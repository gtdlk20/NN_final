When I was outside, I knew that it was cold, but I couldnt really feel it. Everything was covered in ice. That frost isnt really there, right? I asked. D merely told me that it was, indeed, quite cold. I squatted on the front porch and pissed, hard, over the stairs. The relief was overwhelming. I felt mildly ridiculous but at the same time part of me knew why I needed to do that. It felt very meaningful.
