We turn left at the bottom of the hill. The road here is straight and follows a gentle, up-and-down sloping pattern for about a mile. I notice the colors of the sidewalk and grass, and wonder why they dont always look this varied and pronounced. I also notice the many insects flying in the air and leaping in the grass, they seem foreign and somewhat hostile. Suddenly, I see small, winged creatures zooming frantically over the grasswhich is now a Martian redon the side of the road. My brain cannot decide what they are, so it settles for a cross between a moth, hornet, butterfly, and miniature bird. On second thought, I am not sure these zipping, winged bugs are real or just figments of my imagination. Only when one plows into my bare chest do I realize these things do exist. I shout an expletive and dash into the road to escape these airborne menaces.
