We sparked up another bowl and Sven told Ole I get it now. Ole and I were trying to figure out what he gets but we never really did. He would not respond to the question what do you get?  He said it again I get it now. We asked again what do you get? He looked at Ole with a very angry look and said in a stern voice why are you doing this to me! We asked Sven what Ole was doing and he wouldnt say. I tried to calm him down and I offered him a cigarette. He replied to my offer no I am turning my life back to Christ. I knew Sven was a Christian so I encouraged it and maybe thought it would calm him down or at least bring some kind of light in his head. Sven then said dude I am never doing acid again. When he said this I had it my mind that it was almost a mission or something of Ole and I to calm him down and turn his trip around. At this point also I stopped paying attention to the time but it had to be at least 6 am and we all were still tripping pretty hard. Sven then proceeded to speak in tongues and call out for Jesus to save him. This to say the least freaked the fuck out of Ole and I. I then said dude we have been in this tent for way to long, lets go for a walk.
