Once I eat it, it usually takes about an hour or so for me to start to come up. I attribute the come up with a rising feeling in my chest (kind of like when your heart jumps the moment you see someone who you've been nervously waiting for (I think you know what I mean)). I realize that I'm tripping when I feel around the inside of my mouth with my tongue and start to become very conscious about the position of inside of my mouth or my face. Basically, I think this marks the beginning of the debasement of standards in the brain. By that, I mean that I stop making subconscious assumptions regarding how the world(and myself) works. Once this debasement of standards occurs, the trip starts for me. Now I am basically a child looking at my world and life. I judge things from the perspective of an outsider I am basically a child looking at my world and life. I judge things from the perspective of an outsider (that is why I think many people report learning so much from acid). At this point in my trip, there is usually a pattern that starts to show up on everything and continue throughout that trip (the pattern is different every trip). I think that this pattern is a physical manifestation of the patterns of life that I notice while I am tripping. That is to say that every trip (for me at least) has recurring inexplicable themes that only I can understand (If you've tripped a few times, you might know what I mean, but then again it could be me). After usually about five to six hours, the change in perspective starts to subside and my consciousness begins to regain structure. The patterns are still all over everything and my brain feels somewhat drained. This 'aftertrip' for me is a period of reflection where I recall all of the recurring patterns (visual as well as pertaining to life).
