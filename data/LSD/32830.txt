After a few songs, we figured it would be a good idea to go see one of the crazy side-shows going on at one of the tents. By the time we got there we were starting to trip pretty hard. We sat down in the tent and waited for the show to start. We had a really interesting conversation with someone near us about how crazy the whole festival experience is. I felt like I was speaking really profoundly and me and my friend were both cracking up. There were decorative chandeliers hanging from the tent that seemed to sway back and forth. The show began and it was immediately very visually appealing. The opening act had 3 women dancing in golden clothing and they were waving around golden cloth that seemed to shimmer. The colors, lights, and music were all very vivid and spectacular.
