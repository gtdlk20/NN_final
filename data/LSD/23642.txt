Summer turned to me, Len?, she called. I had considered taking my phone with me to blast some trip tunes as we walked along, but it felt unauthentic. So far, acid had warped the reality around me in a way that I had never experienced before, and I wanted to see what it could do with the natural sounds and rhythms of the city street-life. Reality needed to bend itself, in order for me to be legitimately surprised by it, and if I was listening to music, I would have altered the process drastically. So, in answer to Summer, Nah, no phone on me.
