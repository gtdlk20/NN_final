We got back to Carters apartment just before 2:00 AM. We took refuge in the same room we had started the trip in, but things were much different than when wed first popped our tabs. Though it was unbelievably dirty and unkempt, Carters room provided the three of us the protection we now desperately needed in order to stop thinking about the outside world. Here we had air conditioning, tons of trippy posters to look at, and bean bags on which we could finally let our brutalized bodies rest. At this point I assumed that wed passed the peak, but it certainly didnt look like that was the case.
