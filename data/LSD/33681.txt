After receiving our merchandise we successfully drove home and went to J's place to sleep.  Arriving at about 1 in the morning we immediately tried going to sleep.  Me and C still had acid in our systems and stayed up playing Super Smash bros. Meelee  until 2 am when he passed out.  I didn't fall asleep until 4 am. The next day my legs felt like they had been run over.
