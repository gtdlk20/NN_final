The coolest and most memorable part of the trip was while listening to Pink Floyd's 'Atom Heart Mother.'  Me and Nick were convinced that we were tribal leaders, took our shirts off, and wrapped them around our heads like turbans.  We ran all over the room, and made faces at each other in the bathroom.  Nick's face looked like a Picasso painting.  We made up an elaborate dance that included banging pillows on the bed as hard as possible.  When my other two friends returned they were greeted to two shirtless men with turbans on shooting them with guitars.
