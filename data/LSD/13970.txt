It was getting hot. There were many people in his apartment now. My friend and I didnt know what to do. We both glanced into his bedroom and saw the window. The window. Our haven. That saved us that night. I will never forget the window and the wonderful memories and closeness it brought. We opened up the window and literally hung out of it, the bottom half of our bodies standing on the bed, while the top half dangling. We stared at the stars and I shot to the moon. I danced around in space for a while, laughing at all the other meaningless people in the other room. Didnt they know they could fly in space in this room? They were missing out. I was having the time of my life. My friend and I discussed how beautiful bricks were and how there was a Mexican mountain just right above the rooftop. What in the world had I done to myself?
