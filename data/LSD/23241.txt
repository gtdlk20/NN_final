We went to his house and on the way we got a lot of snacks. When we arrived at his house, my friend told his parents that IÂ’d me staying round that night. All was going well until his parents said 'ABSOLUTELY NOT! YOU HAVE TO BE UP EARLY TOMORROW MORNING AND AT YOUR AUNTIES HOUSE'. As I heard this it felt as though for a split second the whole world collapsed on me. We agreed that I should look after the tabs before deciding when to do it. I went home, very excited to have LSD for the first time, very excited to have my first ever drug.
