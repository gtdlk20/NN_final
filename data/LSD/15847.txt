I felt tired and uncomfortable for the rest of the day, unable to sleep, but unwilling to get up and try and do anything. I've had worse comedowns off of ecstacy where I'm in physical pain, but I did feel terrible, bodily and mentally. Luckily, the girl I was seeing came round to visit and pampered her 'poor little acidhead' all day.
