It wasn't until 3 hours after we took the hit when we started to feel the effects... At this point I was biking my girlfriend to her class, which I said I would attend... It's a lecture room with about 200 other students. The class was for sociology.. Anyways, by the time I'm in her class and sitting down I'm starting to trip out.
