All in all, I got exactly what I wanted from my trip. I got to experience intense visuals and also dealt with some of the issues that were ruining my life. Being on acid reminded me that I really enjoy being outside and looking at trees and other plants and made me realise that I donÂ’t need drugs to enjoy these things. I have now started going outside regularly to meditate to replace smoking a joint or a bong.
