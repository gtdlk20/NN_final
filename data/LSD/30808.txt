We felt ready around the beginning of October, back when I met this kid called Dylan West - whom we all just called West. Id describe him as a fuckboy junkie extraordinaire; hes the kind of guy whos currently trying to grow pot in his dorm room, dabs indoors with the smoke detectors all over the place, trips almost on a bi-weekly basis, and has a penchant for smoking up with steamy showers in the bathrooms indoors. As soon as I decided Seth was a no-go, I had ended up Wests world. I slept over at his place for the entire weekend, two weeks before tripping, and we eventually hooked up at one point. I knew he was the right person to ask for a hookup.
