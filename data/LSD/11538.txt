At one point, I found myself in the bathroom.  Im sure W took me in there.  I dont know if I asked or he suggested.  I was not wearing my glasses during any of this, which left me unable to distinguish much visually.  In addition, visual reality was again undulating and distorting.  I tried to remember the mechanics of peeing standing up, but this was mostly muscle memory. I wasnt sure whether the urine was going in the toilet, on the floor, or in my pants.  This was really upsetting and made me feel guilty for maybe making a mess.  I crawled around on my hands and knees with toilet paper determined to clean up anything that needed cleaning up.  Fortunately, I found no mess and my clothes were dryI think.
