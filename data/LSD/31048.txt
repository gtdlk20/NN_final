I was editing the footage for the, um, the movie... then, then I decided to smoke up a bit before coming over. So I got the munchies, and I raided my suites fridge for something to eat... I found these cookies, and they were so good... I had like three of those, man. But they were edibles... so Im about to pass out... his speech wasnt upbeat as usual, but lethargically entranced into the dimension of sleep.
