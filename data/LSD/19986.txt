Much to my surprise, my dad decided to stop off on the way for dinner at a local restaurant. Unexpected. This meant I was going to be sitting at a table right across from my unsuspecting father right as this awful drug was kicking in. We rode to the restaurant in complete silence, my dad driving and myself in the passenger seat. About half way there I began feeling cold and my leg started to shake. This overwhelming feeling of 'I know something you don't know' came over me. I dared not turn around and look at Kevin in the back seat. Just try and stay focused. Finally we arrived at the restaurant. We got out of the car. I looked at Kevin and he looked at me, at which point the silence was broken when Kevin said with a straight face 'pretty fuckin' funny, huh?' We both broke out into hysterical laughter.
