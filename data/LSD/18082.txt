I went on giggling for minutes on end. Every joke in the video struck me. As I was trying to gather myself from the latest laughing attack the screen suddenly vibrated. All the lines became squiggly just like I'd expect. It looked very real. The more I looked at it the more it begun to wave around. I stood up and walked around my apartment for a bit - everything was getting very swirly and I couldn't look at anything for too long or else it swirled beyond recognition. But it was fine, I was happy about it, intrigued to see how everything around me started to morph.
