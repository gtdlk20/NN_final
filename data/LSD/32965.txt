Things stayed pleasant and amazing for a while until we returned home. My friend's house is filled wit ornaments, toys and crazy wallpaper which all wriggled and changed colours. Being inside at this point was very overwhelming and I had to leave again. We all went outside and things started to get weird. I slowly began forgetting who I was, where I lived, what I do in life, what me and my friends were doing and I was obsessed with knowing where we going even when we had chosen to sit and relax.
