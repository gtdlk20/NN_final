The effects came on much stonger than ever before, the effects were more potent than any other trip in about one hour. I became really anxious and started to fidget with the dried up pine needles on the ground. My one friend asked me if I was feeling alright, I told him I was thirsty. We walked up to the check-in/store, it was really crowded in there. My face began to tingle, and my hands became cold and sweaty. The number of people in there made me nervous, so I was relived to walk out of there with my soda.
