T+60mins: sitting in the VIP room on the couch, staring at the ceiling. A hole appears in the 20 ft. High ceiling about 3 feet in diameter, and huge spider legs start coming through it. I dont like this at all. I get up to find a weapon to hit it with incase it gets through, and Legos appears out of nowhere and I see his lips moving, but his words were mute for a few seconds until I thought about listening to him and then I could hear him, and he was asking if I wanted some more sweet tarts. (here begins the series of events leading to the bad trip) I say sure. He hands me 4 more and leaves. I eat them. I then seek out my friend and we stand in the middle of the dance floor surveying the crowd around us. We watch as Legos circulates through the crowd of 200 kids and I see him dosing everyone. Even cops. He's walking up to police officers in the parking lot and offers them candy, and they accept! Back inside, the dj starts spinning some crazy track with sirens, cop sirens. Constant cop sirens.
