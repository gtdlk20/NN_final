By the afternoon most of the symptoms had passed.  Although the latter portion of the trip wasn't extremely pleasant, and it fucked up the next day, I would still try acid again simply for the bliss I felt during the beginning (although next time I may only drop one hit).  I have gotten some advice on ways to lessen the comedown, most of which involve knocking yourself out so you can sleep through it all.  Overall, I would grade this an expanding experience, if not thoroughly positive.
