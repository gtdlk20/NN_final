I've had a pretty deep fear of tripping for well over a year, up until this point. My other trip report outlines what I've gone through on my first psilocybin experience, but it definitely left its mark on me to keep it short. At the time, I was fundamentally lost, depressed, hopeless and generally on a very negative path in life.
