My inhibitions rapidly dropped away, but I remained in complete control of myself mentally and physically (maybe it was weak acid or I was still somewhat tolerant from the 2C-T-7).  Before long I found myself hitting (well, more accurately, politely asking for sexual favors) on a sober friend of mine (but not before calling my gf and asking if it was okay).  Luckily, my friend is cool with that stuff and didn't read anything more into it than a compliment on attractiveness.
