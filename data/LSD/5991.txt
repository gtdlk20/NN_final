The problem of substitution is unfortunately very real. What tipped me off was the bitter taste, the long come-up time (3 hours or more to fully come up), lots of body load (nausea, phlegm and muscle tension), and having a duration much longer than expected for LSD. Also getting flaccid-penis-syndrome was a dead giveaway that Id taken a phenethylamine and not a tryptamine.
