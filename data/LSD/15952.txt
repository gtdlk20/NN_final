We reached the playground and utilised the swings. Even in the darkness I could see the amazingly bright colours that covered the playground's equipment. This was when I realised that the drug was beginning to engulf me. I could feel the psychedelic colours swarm around my head as though everything had become effected by my hallucinations. Normally when tripping I find that I only see things differently when I look directly at them, even then they appear to remain reasonably normal. Now even my peripheral vision was effected by the hallucinations. Everyone and everything was covered by a blanket of multi-coloured shifting patterns and shapes. This was fantastic as for the first time ever I felt truly at one with a drug. I was able to lose sense of what reality is really like in a safe environment.
