J came and sat next to me and asked how I was doing. Good I am starting to feel it now the room is feeling different. By this time my other mate was back to randomly dropping the words Naahhrrnn Bread again and everyone went back to doing their own thing again.  I was starting to see things differently and starting to comment on things and began being a little bit obnoxious, starting to get louder. I felt like I wasnt part of the group and they were annoyed with me being here especially the guys I didnt really know. They were on the way down and I was heading up. I looked over to the guy sitting on the edge of couch. He had long ginger hair and a bushy ginger beard. All I saw was Dr Zaius from planet of the apes. He morphed into Dr Zaius right in front of me. I nudge J next to me and said man I think its kicking in bro. Hey Is that Dr Zaius on the couch bro. J laughed as I sang the song Dr Zaius, Dr Zaius. I was now seeing things in the room begin to change and morph. I started asking J about things I was seeing as if to confirm I was tripping. Things started moving and changing colours. J asked how I was going? looking concerned I could tell he was keeping an eye on me. I told him I was ok and I was starting to trip. The others wanted to turn off the lights turn up the LSD trip music with the TV playing geometric shapes and colours. I was just starting to see stuff in the room melt and change and wanted to keep the light on so I could see it more and interact with them. But they were ready to relax and watch the colours as they came down. The lights soon turned off music a little louder.
