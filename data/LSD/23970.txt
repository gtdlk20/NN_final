After jamming for about an hour, the effects of the LSD really started to diminish. It didnt happen much more worth writing. During the trip, there were times I felt safe and comfortable, and other times I felt really fragile and scared. But at the end I really felt like I had accomplished something, that I hadnt let the fear win. So all in all a good experience, which we repeated a few times, and eventually got kicked out of the school, but thats another story! Hope you enjoyed the read, and stay safe!
