3:00- I stayed outside running around in the grass for over 2 hours. I went back inside and was still tripping BALLS. Crosses, peace signs, smiley faces, flowers, and shapes where showering out of the walls. The walls themselves where distorted and morphing like they were melting or made out of water. Time was so fucked up at this point that I didnÂ’t know if a minute passed or a whole day. I just sat on the couch and tried to play Modern Warfare 2 with little success.
