We came to a large patch of grass with tall trees all around and decided we should lie down there. This is when I began to come up. My body started to feel electrically numb. The fireworks and stars were breathtakingly fantastic. We noticed a large group of alpha-male types having a vicious circle fight right near us so we got up and moved on.
