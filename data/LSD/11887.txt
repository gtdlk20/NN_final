	I continued thinking about minds and thoughts, and I started thinking about free will. I came to the conclusion that free will is not anything at all, and that there is not even the possibility for such a thing. If we had free will, this would mean that our actions and decisions are not controlled by reason and cause. As a result, there would be an effect (whatever action I did using free will) without a cause, meaning that cause and effect would no longer be related. Our brains prevent this free will, thankfully, so that we dont go around doing random things for no reason. Brains are computers, composed of even smaller computers (neurons), which are then composed of even smaller computers (atoms), and so on. Because of this, there is always cause and effect, and there can be no effect without a cause, and therefore we cannot just do things randomly and without a reason. Looking back on this thought, it seems fairly rational, because my view of humans is that we are very complex computers, as opposed to being the magical free-willed beings that many people think we are.
