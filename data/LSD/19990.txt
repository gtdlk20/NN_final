We decided to stop and get some ice cream cones. The ice cream at the arena is soft serve, so we decided to get 2 large cones, chocolate and vanilla swirl. The cones were always fairly large, but on this particular day, who knows, maybe it was the drugs, but they seemed to be about 2 feet tall. We walked down the concourse with our ridiculously large ice cream cones, when suddenly we hear a voice from above - 'STOP!'
