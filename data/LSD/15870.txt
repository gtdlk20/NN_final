I firmly believe that I ended up in some kind of drug induced psychosis during the night.  What triggered it?  Who knows.  I have taken higher doses before without the same effects.  This was the first time that I had had my ass handed to me on a plate by drugs.  I was left with a sense of falibility - no one can ever claim to have total control over a drug experience and this wasn't an insight I'd had until now.  I had a newfound respect for hallucinogens and what they could do to a man.  This trip was the best I've ever had and the worst.  The concert experience was nothing short of magnificent - the after show was very close to hell on earth.  World War Three inside my head!
