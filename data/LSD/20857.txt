i saw chad in the mirror, and his eyes just stayed om place as his face and felsh and muscile all melted away all at once. And he just becaused a skeliton right there. He was standing in the mirror with his eyes, looking right at me, and he was just dead. His eyes scared the hell out of me. Then i saw dave, as chad wasw aalready there, and dave did the same. It sounded like an atom bomb in my head. and i came over to lay down. And i closed my wtyes and then i just saw the whole world, everyone, every face and person eradicated. I was then standing alone on a red star shaped platform, with blacknesss and nothingness everywhere. And then, eyes, everywhere, looked at me. Some jokingly, some laugingly, some to accuse... I was immortal, there, DAMMED FOREVER TO SEE THE EYES THAT MOCK ME.
