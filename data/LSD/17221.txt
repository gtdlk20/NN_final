Having only been in the house maybe 10 minutes and walking another 5 I was already starting to feel the body high.  Although I wasnÂ’t yet seeing or really hearing anything yet.  I just felt good at the moment.  We kept walking through the woods for another 15 minutes or so until we got to a stopping point and decided to settle out in the middle of this large grassy field.  As we sat there I realized that I was beginning to hallucinate and apparently everyone else was beginning to as well.  C put on her stereo and we began listening to music and talking about life, the field we were in, how cool the sky looked, and all the rainbows we kept on seeing all around us.
