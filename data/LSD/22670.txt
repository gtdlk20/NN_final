Finally, or what I recall as being the last part of this trip, there was nothing but blackness and my mind and two other minds. I had to remember something but every time I did the other two minds already knew what I had remembered so I had to remember something else, something new. I finally came back to my senses repeating the word 'forward' over and over until I realised where I was.
