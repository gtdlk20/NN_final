The first two lines have to do with my realization that it doesnt matter what I do, it will turn out good either way. I get lost in the...well everything really. I didnt even know what to put because there were a million things going through my head. Music had never sounded so clear to me, and I kept picturing the sun bursting above the dark horizon...daylight breaking too soon. At the bottom of the page I wrote, I WISH I HAD SOME COLORS! I wished I had some colors that night even more than I wish I could upload my drawing along with this story. I am truly more proud of this drawing than any other piece of art I have ever done.
