The sense of weirdness slowly pervaded everything around me, and it evolved into an inability of my brain to properly process, and make sense of, my surroundings. It wasnt like I didnt understand anything anymore, but more like my immediate reality just didnt compute. Why was I there out of all places? Why was Frey, whom I went to school with, there? Why were he and Louise involved now? That was all so random. I couldnt justify any of it, and was very bothered by the fact.
