It was an ordinary February day, I had a sugar cube hit IÂ’d obtained from my buddy A. I had done acid once prior, and still experienced flashbacks from it, distortions of my visual field, borders and definitions would disappear. I had all but given up on mushrooms, I had done them 5 times and had 5 bad trips, The last 2 times both ending in paranoid breakdowns. I felt I had done something horribly wrong, everyone hated me or was reporting me to the police, I saw girls from past relationships in the mirror looking back at me, but nonetheless I decided to trip one last time.
