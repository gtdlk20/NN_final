Shortly after this one of the strangest and most unique things that has ever happened to me occurred. It started with me smoking a few bong loads I think and then while they were talking about something I sort drifted off into my own world. I entered a trancelike state that was like nothing else I have ever experienced on any kind of drug. It wasn't like an exotic or enchanted hypnosis/mindfuck like with mushrooms it was instead just..a trance. A classic trance and I don't know how long it lasted because I lost complete concept of EVERYTHING.
