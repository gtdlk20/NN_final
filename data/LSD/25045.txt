Terror struck deep within me. What other-worldly entity could be stalking my friend and I? Had we accidentally opened a portal with our insanely huge dose of LSD? My initial response to this terror was to turn back on the lights. I needed to be able to see what was going on outside. WHAT WAS THERE?!
