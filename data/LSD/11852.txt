Another thing that happened at some point is that Arthur and I took a walk.  I think after we had come back inside for a while we grew restless again and embarked on another soothing sojourn into the natural world.  At first, this walk was extremely stressful.  I remember I was very agitated by the traffic going by as we went down the sidewalk.  The cars exuded an air of great menace and danger to me.  At one point we went across a crosswalk and it was a hellish nightmare of a three-second experience.  There was an indescribable amount of body tension and there was this big SUV type car inching through the intersection as we crossed which put me on the highest alert.  I was intoxicated by drugs, so I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to cross or not and I was deathly afraid of breaking the rules and thus getting hit.  Eventually, we reached this kind of enclosed neighborhood near my building and I calmed down.  It was peaceful there and very wooded, with no cars.  I don't think anything of note happened on this walk Â– we went a little ways until we were purged of our anxiety and then we started back.
