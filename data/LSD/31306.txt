I was definitely down by that point, but I still struggled in processing everyday furniture. I dont know why objects were so tough on me, but they just looked complex. As we prepared to head to the cafeteria, we passed by the courtyard which had circular tables and benches all connected to each other, and those still seemed weird to me: why; what does this mean? What does it represent? It doesnt make sense, I concluded.
