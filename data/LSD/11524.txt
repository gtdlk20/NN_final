Setting: I took the medicine at WÂ’s house.  W is an MD who has been trained as a facilitator/guide for people doing psychedelics as part of scientific protocols.  He shared his beautiful house two blocks from the ocean.  He offered to provide dinner and breakfast the next day.  We agreed that I drop at 2PM and I would stay the night.  He had a wonderful sound system and a playlist of music that he curated himself specifically for people who are tripping.  Spacious, comfortable, relaxed, and safe.
