Again I went back to the deep loop in which my thought cycles through God, free will, time.... although this time I had some idea what I was after. I was testing the limits of my model of reality. This is where it hurts. This is where my model of reality is really strained. It has some gaps in it, and the gaps are connected with God, free will, , and time. I write in there, because there is something nameless in that list of four things that keeps recurring in my thoughts as a sub-linguistic concept. Because I haven't named it, I can't really even consciously understand what I am representing by it. It may have something to do with 'soul' or 'psyche'. I learned a quite a bit this time (I can talk about it in another message)... I discovered that a lot of what I associate with the word 'God' is part of me (a 'higher self' or the id, or something). I'll write up some of my other insights in another message.
