It took a while to come down from our highs, but the come down was still visually rich and I continued seeing patterns and shape shifting until about 9 hours after ingestion. LSD stimulates frontal lobe activity very much so I found sleep difficult until about 4:00 in the morning, when I finally realized that I hadnÂ’t eaten or drank all day and was probably still awake because my body was searching for food and water.
