I then told my friend that I wanted to try some. He said we could no doubt score some at a psytrance party so I went along. It was a Saturday night so it was crowded. We were in this place with loud music, wasn't my kind of scene but I bared with it knowing that I was about to score some LSD. My friend tried a few people who looked like they may be selling but was unsuccessful. We were about to give up and try another party when I saw this teen walk in. He looked like a modern day hippy so I immediately told my friend to ask him. He went, a few minutes passed so I knew we had something. I went up to them talking and started listening. My friend turned to me and told me he had LSD but it wasn't at the price he expected it to be. My friend had only done LSD once before so he wasn't sure about the price himself.
