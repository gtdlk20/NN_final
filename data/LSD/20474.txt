There is a lesson in this for everyone who has not learned it already. LSD IS NOT A TOY! I have only taken LSD five times in my life, each months or years apart, and this dream has shaken me to my core. It doesn't take much, it's entirely unpredictable. LSD dreams can be used to remove clouds from your eyes, and they can be used to reinforce ways of thought, and they can be used to build huge new clouds in front of your eyes. If you use it in a setting that causes you to think in a certain way, you will create thought habits that keep you thinking that way. You can not escape being changed by an LSD dream unless you know exactly what you're doing, so make sure that you change for the better.
