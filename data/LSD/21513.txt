C said he had a cd that was really trippy, and he put it in the big, multi-tray stereo J had in his room. Lights out, lava lamp on, music beginningbut this was strange music. It was dark, sinister even, and we immediately felt a cold menace begin to creep into our reality. For the curious, the cd was Delerium Cordia by Fantomas. Shapes began moving and flitting about the dark room. We still had the giddy feeling of coming up, but it was rapidly becoming shadowed over by thisapocalyptic music invading our minds. Deep chants, strange screams and breathing sounds, weird moans and giggles and clangsWe felt like we were in some devils kitchen. The stereo became some kind of boiler, an oven that radiated evil. W began staring at the corners of the room, mumbling from time to time about things coming out of them. By now, wed lost all association with time and the outside world. Our reality was the 9th level of hell. I recall C nonchalantly stepping into the closet on one side of the room and, just because I was feeling ducky, I shut the door behind him.
