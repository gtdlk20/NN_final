So my experience begins on a cold New England night.  The sky is clear and the stars are shining brightly.  It's about 8:30pm when I decide that I should take the remaining acid from a 10 strip I bought a while back.  I was alone in my home, parents had gone away and my brother had wondered off to who knows where.  I felt that being alone for a trip could be a growing experience for me, since almost all my previous psychedelic experiences involved fairly large numbers of people being around.  My intension for this trip was to explore myself, my mind.
