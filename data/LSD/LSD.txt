My Minidose Manifesto

I would like to preface this report with a note on the terminology of ingesting sub-perceptual doses of LSD. Technically speaking, a psychedelic microdose is a sub-threshold dose of the substance. This would lead one to believe that the effects of said amount would be unperceivable. There seems to be a contradiction here that I wish to resolve. Call me a drug nerd or a word nerd, but if a microdose is defined as sub-perceptual, then perceiving anything from a dose you took disqualifies it as a true microdose. Since my experiences with small amounts of LSD have somehow fallen between the sub-perceptual and threshold realms, I propose the term minidose. Its lower than a museum dose, (One where effects are apparent beyond threshold levels to the user, but still appropriate for a public experience) but higher than a true microdose. Heres a more appropriate word for those of us that felt something that wasnt nothing, but nothing about it was really something, ya dig? Okay, report time!


This report is a hallmark example of an LSD minidose gone right. I have ingested LSD and numerous other substances in quantities that yielded experiences ranging from mild amusement to intense visual & mental effects. However, it has been only in the past 12 months that I have begun to experiment with the practice of LSD minidosing. Each month, I pick a couple days to ingest a minidose. These experiences were chosen arbitrarily, but were always at least a week away from experiences with any other psychedelic so as to avoid tolerance influences. Since each batch of blotter I have obtained tends to contain a different dosage, it takes a little dialing in to determine the sweet spot size to slice. If Im being completely honest here, I did not use a ruler. I eyeballed it. Theres definitely a way to be more scientific about measuring your minidose, but I like to live a bit on the wild side when the stakes are this low. Furthermore, I prefer to cut each according to what my effects were from the previous minidose session. This way, I can make a larger/smaller cut adjustment as opposed to having pre-cut pieces that werent quite the size I preferred. The blotter I cut it from is a square centimeter, and the sliver my blade yielded is just shy of a milligram. For a reference of dose, I am forced to speculate. These tabs are about 125 micrograms each, so my portion was about 10.42 micrograms. It is cut from the same piece of blotter paper, and I attempt to achieve a 1/12th cut for each. It should be noted here that everyone reacts differently to drugs. I have personally found that about a 1/12th slice of these particular blotters provides the desired effects for me as a minidose.

Most of my minidose days were work days (I work from home), but there were a couple weekend days in there as well. I found that the effects didnt tend to vary significantly between these settings. For the purposes of narrative consistency and readability, I have selected a day where I felt my notes best represented the most common effects felt across the span of my minidosing experiences. Heres the scoop:

7 August 2018
10:00 AM  I pop the estimated sliver of LSD into my mouth (1/12th of a blotter). Besides a glass of water, this has been my only intake of the day thus far. 

Another comment I feel is worth mentioning: I invariably feel a bit anxious prior to taking any psychedelic substance. I do not experience fear; its more of an apprehensive hesitation that is present despite my knowledge of the safety and the success of my past experience. Yet, I do not view this as a negative thing. Rather, I prefer to view it as a symptom of my healthy level of respect for the power of the substance.

10:55 AM (T 0:55) I enjoy a breakfast smoothie of fruit & veggies, a cup of darjeeling tea, and bacon. This is a standard breakfast for me. Aha! I notice effects setting in. There appears a very mild confusion from change of mental state: slight difficulty tracking tasks, I am more easily distracted, and my attention tilts inward towards my thoughts and physical senses during this period of transition. I am more easily distracted, and my attention tilts inward towards my thoughts and physical senses during this period of transition. This passes within 10 minutes, and I break through to The Flow. 

The Flow is an ease of passing from one task to the other without the presence of the ordinary hesitations/stuckness I must overcome to start the next task. For example, Ive set a goal to do a set of 10 pushups every 2 hours during work. Yesterday I didnt even try. I thought about it, but other things seemed more important to me and I got distracted. Even though I knew it would take maybe 3 minutes of my time, the mental activation energy required to initiate such a task was not reached. Today the pushups are not only achieved but also done so with enjoyment and almost excitement to have completed the task. Being in The Flow means increased decisiveness, stamina, and focus, though it is not forceful. It is like floating a river in a kayak instead of a raft.

11:13 AM (T 1:13) I notice the classic electricity feeling of the substance in the crown region of my skull. This is a familiar sensation I get from LSD that feels like a mildly metallic energy. Its not a shock per se, but similar to the sensation you get when a very weak 9-Volt battery touches your tongue. Its not distracting or intrusive; more like a tickle.

11:38 AM (T 1:38) I have fluid conversations with my boss and clients without perceivable drawbacks. My assessment of my bodys energy level is equivalent to a full cup of dark coffee, but without the side effects of jitters and sweaty armpits. This kind of energy is different than any stimulant Ive tried. To me, stimulants feel like Im pushing a go button in my brain & body and force my heart rate up. They rev my internal engine. In contrast, minidosing is more of a carrot than a stick. I look forward to the experiences and inherent rewards that task completion brings with fresh perspective and confidence in my natural stamina.

12:13 PM (T 2:13) I find that Im able to make more conscious decisions as to how I react to stressful work scenarios. In moments where I would usually get worked up, Im noticing a more moderated, slightly detached approach to finding solutions. Upon reflection, my detachment seemed to be of my critical thinking part of my consciousness from my more limbic, emotional side. This recognition of the influence my visceral urges have on my thoughts and actions empowers me to maintain an elevated, more consistent level of overall mindfulness.

1:10 PM (T 3:10) I notice an increased propensity towards making my actions more efficient and swift. This is seemingly driven by sheer novelty, as opposed to a speedy or caffeinated urgency. Repetitive tasks typically bore me and cause pop-out moments where I lose focus or make stupid mistakes due to a lack of engagement. When minidosing, I find the little things that I normally overlook to be objects of manipulation. For example, rather than going about my normal keystrokes and clicks, I treat the task like a race or production line and attempt to modify my process to increase efficiency. Cool stuff!

1:40 PM (T 3:40) I make time to eat lunch. Its a busy day, but I dont feel overwhelmed. I eat a fried rice bowl and turkey sandwich. Food tastes good, as is normal. I do not experience a reduction in appetite as I often do on higher doses of LSD.

2:39 PM (T 4:39) I just noticed something that has been going on for a few hours now: a mild increase in my visions color saturation. This is nothing super hallucinatory by any means, but was enough for me to take that second appreciative glance at the way my lamp illuminated the sundries on my desk. Their hues seemed to have an extra degree of purity. In the past, on larger doses, I have had the pleasure of perceiving a much larger spectrum of colors than I ordinarily do while sober (Im red/green colorblind). Its difficult to discern whether this was due to a legitimate change in my perceptual abilities or a shift in my psychological appreciation for colors in general. If I had to venture a guess, I would say the latter is more likely. During this minidose, the value of colors was not influenced in any remarkable way, which makes sense physiologically because my pupils did not dilate. I did not have closed eye visuals at any point during this experience.

4:30 PM (T 6:30) Its safe to say Ive plateaued in effects. 4:30 PM (T 6:30) Its safe to say Ive plateaued in effects. Things have been about the same since my last notes.

5:43 PM (T 7:43) The days tasks are completed without the typical post-lunch lull in productivity. I find myself working past the optional quitting time out of the desire to make tomorrow less strenuous. This is atypical of me. I still feel a solid energy boost, namely in my head and hands. The nature of this energy is curious it feels visceral but does not seem to be originating from the places Im feeling it. The point of origin is my mind, not my body. I feel a nonspecific inspiration, and it is then manifested as a sort of mild electric buzzing in my cranium and fingers (direction of energy from the mind to the body). In contrast, stimulants feel to me like my body parts themselves are requesting tasks from my mind so they can occupy themselves with actions, such as dancing (direction of energy from the body to the mind).

6:45 PM (T 8:45) I begin a workout consisting of weight training with brief cardio warmup/cooldown.

7:50 PM (T 9:50) Todays workout is completed with an ordinary level of endurance and strength. By this time, noticeable energetic effects of the substance have dwindled and I feel closer to baseline.

8:45 PM (T 10:45) Conversation with a new friend is fruitful and engaging. I have a calm and mindful demeanor during this interaction, and favor listening and brevity over my more discursive tendencies. I would call this change the chief symptom of the minidoses afterglow effects.

11:55 PM (T 13:55) Time has passed quickly, as it tends to in good company. My partner Lace has returned home, and we retire. Sleep comes easily, and is sound.

Reflections: I awoke the next morning feeling well-rested, back to baseline sobriety, and ready to take on the day. I did not detect any aftereffects (positive or negative) of my experience from the day before. The weekend after this experience (4 days later), I indulged in a larger dose of LSD with recreational intentions and did not recognize any semblance of tolerance.

Its worth noting that in the process of dialing in my sliver size there were days when The Flow was less prevalent and days when I inadvertently pushed the envelope past minidose and into mild psychedelia. Comes with the territory, I suppose.

Overall, I have found this application of LSD to yield consistently positive results. The increased agency of my critical thinking (empowered, I think, by its slight separation from/recognition of my more visceral urges) proved to be helpful in many areas such as my perceptions of mood, energy, creativity, motivation, and overall mindfulness.

I became interested in psychedelic drugs in the winter of 2005, and having had multiple experiences with mushrooms and LSD at lower doses, I decided during mid March of 2006 that I was ready for a step up.  I spent a few hours on Saturday morning cleaning up, I ate a light meal (I believe it was cold pizza) and at 2:40 in the afternoon I ate my last 6 hits of blotter acid. 

I considered myself a fairly seasoned psychonaut at the time, and I recognized the initial onset of the condition roughly fifteen minutes later.  Colors became sharper, and sounds took on a strange ethereal quality.  I walked into the den, encouraged.  It was a large room, with a hardwood floor and a fireplace.  I felt certain that this was the right room in which to begin my journey, and so I reclined on the couch and fell into a relaxed, mellow state.  That was when I began to hear singing.  It started as a sweet humming sound, like a barbershop quartet tuning up, only at very low volume.  The sound began to rise, and the tone began to change.   The windows were slightly open, and a cool breeze began blowing the curtains from the window,   It seemed to me at the time that there was a whole invisible choir in the room, and each change of the light wrought its own change upon the tune.  It grew and grew, and soon instruments were thrown into this beautiful choral mix.  I began to search in vain for the source of the sound, but as I moved the music grew around me.  Soon I recognized that the sound was coming from me, and from all the life around me.  The music was the embodiment of life, and spirit, and joy.  Everything I saw added to this beautiful melody.  I went into another room, a hallway this time, and a few soaring violin notes accompanied me.  The mellow feeling gave way to a kind of curious energy, as if I was using awe itself as fuel.  

For the next thirteen hours, I was enthralled by the beauty of life as I had not been in over a decade.  Color seemed to thrive in this new, alien world! The entirety of the rainbow glared at me from every corner.  I saw colors I couldn't name, colors that I've never seen replicated.  It was as if I had never seen color.  I  looked out the window towards the bay, and grasped the size of the universe in a new way.  A vast map formed inside my head, earth, and the planets, and the sun and stars and space beyond.  It grew ever larger, and an arrow appeared over the grain of sand the earth had become, an arrow with the words 'You are Here' hovering almost comically above.  I snapped back to reality, or what my reality had become, and took a few moments to clear my head.  While I was recovering from the sheer size of the void, a white swing caught my eye.   A red cardinal had perched on the right hand arm-rest and the colors were so sharp and clean that they almost hurt to look at. I thought it seemed very realistic, then laughed to myself.  After all, it was real life!   My mental processes seemed remarkably clear, and I began to 'toy' with ideas in my head.  I was fascinated by my new found ability to take a blueprint, and picture it as an actual object.  I am not nor will I ever be a mechanically-    inclined person, but today it seemed not to matter.  I built entire houses out of thought,  being able to cross-section and dissect them with ease.   Even such complex instruments as jet engines could be effortlessly mentally re-constructed.  After playing in the sandbox that my brain had become for some time, I opened the back door and headed out onto the patio.

Trees and grass were moving in a way I had never seen before, above the surface of the ocean.  Branches and leaves seemed to burn with motion, each becoming a hazy, insubstantial blur as they moved.  'Like kelp, but not' I said out loud.  It occurred to me that I was talking to myself, and had been for quite some time, and a fresh gale of laughter overtook me.  Each old and familiar sight was altered, changed somehow as to make it appear completely new and wonderful.  I looked up at the sky, curious, and was greeted by the sight of a vast cerulean ocean.  It was a very clear day, and both the moon and the sun were visible, and they both screamed and competed for my attention.  A jet soared overhead, and it left a great plume of rainbow exhaust all the way across the sky.  As I watched, the jet passed cleanly through the moon and out the other side, creating momentary chaos.  The sky changed entirely, becoming first darker and then lighter.  Colors sprang from nowhere, and disappeared just as quickly.  I knew how easy it would be to forget everything and watch the sky patiently until the end of time, but I had other things planned for the day.  I looked at an oak, and saw that each leaf was in fact a diffuse, green light.  The green gave way to blue, which in turn gave way to yellow.  These changes continued at a fairly predictable rate, and I realized that I had control over them!  

Suddenly it seemed that the outside world was on my side, and I was safe and in control.  I felt completely at peace.  It was a warm day, but even if it had been freezing I doubt if I would have felt it.  Eventually I decided to return to the house before I forgot how to move.  It sounds silly to me looking back now, but at the time it seemed to be very possible.  Given the sensory over stimulation of the situation, I'm not entirely surprised.     

I ventured back inside and turned the t.v on, browsing at large.  It started to become complicated as the buttons began to change, sometimes as part of a pattern, sometimes at random.  A short time later, they began to drift from the face of the remote itself!  Laughing like a loon, I tossed the oddity of a remote back onto the table, where the clean grain of the cherry wood swam over it and devoured it.  I smirked at this odd sight, completely at ease, and refocused my attention on the movie.   It was an old favorite of mine, but I found vision being routinely drawn away to a large, white wall on my right.  I eventually gave up watching the t.v to focus my full attention on the wall.  Complicated fractal and runic patterns would arise spontaneously on its surface, only to be seconds later subducted into the ether.  Chaos would destroy order, which would instantly arise in another form.  I saw planets rise and fall, stars form, reason melt and the very fabric of the universe be torn open, to spontaneously be pulled back into the plasma of the wall, and then spit back out in another form.  At times I could only interpret the colors as noise, the sounds as color.  I could visibly see the music from the clock radio on the counter traveling from point to destination, but I could not for the life of me make out the digital readout of the clock.  I became very preoccupied with time, and dimension.  Such intangible concepts to me were like solid objects, visible things that could be touched and seen.  

If it were possible to break an acid trip down into words, the sheer volume of words would be staggering.  Hundreds of ideas cross the brain in seconds, weaving a complicated spider's web that seem to fit perfectly together, although they share few common characteristics.  Color and light seem as different sides of the same coin, striving in some cases for balance, and in other cases for contrast.  I decided to listen to some music without the radio, and in seconds was conducting full symphonies in my head, adding and changing instruments on the fly to produce intricate and pleasing melodies.  All the electronic gadgets in the world seemed inferior to that wonderful internal toolkit I was only now receiving full access to.  Soon the audible mental orchestra gave way to a visible one, and I imagined myself to be in a concert hall, watching a group of celestial beings play instruments unlike any I had ever seen before.  It was purely a mental picture, but something in its aspect reminded me so strongly of real life that I began to wonder if I had been granted a true vision of some other dimension.  Realizing the answer to this question would always escape me, I endeavored to think it over anyway, with disappointing results  After some time of this, I realized it was quickly approaching sunset, a sight I did not intend to miss.    

I ventured outside again and felt my breath leave my throat.  I was enraptured.  The sky that had been so perfectly, absolutely blue only a few hours ago was now a violet so gorgeous and benign that the strength left my knees and I sat loudly on the ground with a loud 'oomph!' sound.  This violet color was reflected on the surface of the water as an intense, fiery orange.  The sun itself had turned a red so deep it seemed a burning ball of blood in the sky.   All around, waves of colored smoke-light (it had the characteristics of both) began to caper and dance.  They distinctly seemed to be sentient, and benevolent.  I reached my hand into one of them and at that point I had an epiphany.  I realized that nothing is unimportant, and everything matters.  For some people this might seem obvious, but the idea struck me at the time as being crucial, and central to my own personal beliefs.  The sun finished its performance, and the stars made their way onto the stage.  The sky became a vast, black painted sheet of canvas, and the stars gleamed like cold jewels in the night sky.  They rippled and undulated, as if they were pleased with their own beauty. 

I sat there, totally unable to move for an indeterminate amount of time, watching the night silently explode with color and life.  Beauty enveloped me, rolled over me like a wave.  The clouds began to race across the shining orange surface of the moon, surrounding it in a halo of the purest gold.  This gold light bounced off the surface of the water, lending an silver gleam to every moist blade of grass.  The night itself seemed to beckon me, it was totally engrossing.  I watched and I walked, but I didn't speak, not wanting the spoken word to mar the beauty of the night world.  I wandered for a while, oblivious to both the growing coolness in the air and the emptiness of my stomach.  I didn't seem to need food, the night provided more than enough to sustain me.  I wandered for hours, thinking of many things, and basking in the beauty of the night.  

Eventually, the maniac energy which had possessed me throughout the day gave way to an exalted, happy weariness, much like the one that accompanies a a day of hard but ultimately successful labor.  I retired to my bedroom, and began to stare at the ceiling.  Chunks of drywall began to bulge and drip from the walls and ceiling, only to dissipate into a thin smoke.  The smoke would drift a few feet from its point of origin, and then lazily make its way back into the gap.  Soon enough,  I began to ponder the nature of the universe in a general way, which led me specifically to thoughts of black holes.  Not a moment after I had begun this train of thought, a small black vortex opened up in the center of the ceiling with an audible stretching noise.  It grew larger and larger, and upon reaching the size of a basketball began to exude ribbons of the colored smoke-light that I had seen earlier.  They were very bright, primary colors, the exact shades on a kindergarten color chart.  They began to revolve around the room, picking up speed as they went.  Eventually the colors began to band together, and soon the room was a circus of colors all racing through each other and intertwining.  All at once, the mystery of the tie-dyed t shirt was no mystery to me.  The night ended with me laughing myself to sleep.  

I awoke the next morning with a sense of exultation, I felt like I'd lived eons and seen things that no one else would ever see.  The relief of stress was enormous, and for a few months the minor problems we all have every day failed to dampen my new found spirits.  It has affected me in more ways that I can put into words, but overall I'm a much more tolerant person, and I like to think of myself as being more understanding.  I feel as if the mystery has returned to my life, and with it my will to continue moving forward.  After all, there's no telling what might be around the next bend, and whether or not it'll be able to top that day as the most thrilling and awe-inspiring of my life.

LSD





BODY WEIGHT:
160 lb





Overview details written approximately 2 months after the experience; majority of report written the day following. 

30 year old male; 2009. I am familiar with several psychedelics and experienced to the point that I am comfortable taking them alone in moderate doses. I have taken LSD three times. Light breakfast. No herbal supplements, unusual foods, prescription drugs, etc. I spend the weeks before thinking a bit about what I want to get out of the experience, in what is becoming an annual ritual. 

The purity of LSD is rarely a consideration and I consider this material well assayed by friends. Dosage is supposed to be 1 dose (100µg) per drop but I of course lack tools to verify this. I've taken one dose of what was indicated to be 100µg from this source before, and this time took two as that experience was pleasant but never left ++ territory. 

The physical effects of LSD are relatively familiar and in any case not interesting to me in this case so I encourage reading other LSD descriptions for that.

--- Begin

It's a sunny day in the middle of a window of rainy ones - my good fortune (and good planning). We sit outside, getting a late start around 10am. 200µg (approx) in tapwater-brewed 'Splashdown' tea in the back yard with L. Sunny morning. I am excited but apprehensive, though I'm not sure why. I have a vague worry that I'm not in the proper mindset for this, as dissatisfied as I am with some life fundamentals - work, money, and the like. Fascinating that after 15 minutes the LSD is completely metabolized in the body and nothing has 'happened' yet. Neural explosions are beginning, cascading upward to consciousness. 

I've edited this document after the fact; such additions (almost solely additions) are [bracketed]. 

I have two 'goals' in mind, if that's the right word. I don't press, only offer up a subject and see if it is taken up. I am interested in understanding more my relationship with my body; specifically, my asymmetry and the pain I feel in my hands and back and head. I have realized that frequently my frustration and bad mood are the product of pain I am so inured to that I am consciously unaware of it. I'd also like to understand why I don't feel hungry often enough, and in general repair my connection to my body, damaged by illnesses and attendant emotional struggle. 

I'd also like to understand how I can proceed with my study of science; it seems a pointless exercise, arbitrary and capricious. I love science, and I am amazed to discover that not only do most people involved in it not revel in it, but that they are absolutely rigid with anxiety and fear, and caught up in their social/political academic game. I don't know if I care to succeed at it at the cost of participating in their model, whether it is worth the stress of the degree program, and how I can justify researching tiny details of such a huge world to little real avail. 

--

My alert is as always a slight lightness at the brow and a tickle in my shoulders and a desire to take full, deep breaths rather than what seem like habitual shallow ones. 

The onset consists of waves of the sensation - my attention begins to detach, wander, and small details of the landscape jump out. The lines of a leaf are more vibrant, the regularity of the lattice behind the plants becomes especially salient and clear. I feel euphoric, and my shoulders drop and I relax. I am tempted to laugh out loud. 

Sound is a clear indicator; the air becomes crystalline, and my field of perception becomes spherical and much larger. I am not hearing with my [attention-limited] ears any longer, but with my whole perception. I can hear a dog barking echoing from the wall over my right shoulder from the window to my left, a truck downshifting on XX street a block and a half away, hear the dampening effect of the warmer, moister air next to the grass of the lawn as a tangible presence. 

Some visuals begin; straight lines become chrome-edged, curves heavily shadowed in black. In general I don't pursue visuals, favoring instead Large Thoughts. This marks the last point I find 'normal' attention forced upon me for the remainder of the experience and I decide to move inside and lie down. 

We go inside and I lie on a large pillow L kindly sets up, in the sweet spot of the stereo. First I am in the front room; trucks going by outside are loud and obnoxious. I make small talk about the trucks and can tell I am beginning to have difficulty communicating; everything feels socially awkward, as though the timing were all off [and such chit-chat is inappropriate]. This is the incorrect way to talk, now, and I am a a bit ashamed and as always startled by how much time we spend saying such things. I am chilly, or at least trembling slightly. I sit on the pillow and L puts the goat over me. My teeth chatter; mild nystagmus, some large-muscle tension. This phase lasts half an hour. I am happy but a bit distracted. L helps me move to the living room to better enjoy the silence.

The temporal progression is not clear from here out until I start to come down. I'll speak of the major experiences instead. 

The Mirror Game

[Later voice: This is a fascinating example of dehabituation and using the insight provided by the experience as a biofeedback to examine my own body. I have a fair amount of experience with biofeedback in physical therapy.] 

I go into the bathroom, which has got to be every trip sitter's least favorite part, I am thinking to myself. What is he doing in there? Should I interrupt? The very thought that I am thinking these things [, worrying from someone else's perspective] is an indication of how strongly the tendency to imagine things from others' points of view asserts itself. One time while I am in there I am gazing into the mirror. The visual aspects of this I'll described below; here I'm concentrating on my body. 

I notice suddenly that I am standing with my weight mostly on my right leg, and that my right toes are curled slightly against the ball of my foot. It feels entirely natural or habitual but suddenly stands out. This makes my balance entirely wrong; I can feel it. I have noticed this before, but now it is clear that this throws my right shoulder up, clenches the muscles of my back and neck. My entire right side is clenched. I remember the first time I took LSD, the nerve on the bottom of my right foot being so painful. Today it is again, as is the spot between my index and middle finger. (A nerve? Have to check.) I habitually curl my foot to protect this pain. 

[Later voice: Later, I suddenly remembered a summer in childhood when I acquired a sliver of glass in this location; I cut it out myself. This strikes me as bizarre and silly but the thought leapt to mind and fits and is provided without editing.]

I shift my weight to make it evenly balanced between my left and my right foot. My smiling face in the mirror begins to repaint itself as sinister. The stubble on my cheek grows coarser, my eyes droop, and my face in the mirror becomes a symmetric version of just the left side of my face, angry and ugly. I shift to my habitual, mechanically bad pose, and my smile returns; the stubble diminishes; I look happy and my face is right-side symmetric. 

This is not going to be easy. My body and my mind have a commitment to this unhealthy posture. 

I hesitate briefly - I feel a pressure to not do anything 'too weird'. I can't imagine why. This comes up other times as well. [The internal monitor is so strong.] I take off my shirt; I can feel warring selves who feel this is 'too weird' make my movements clumsy. I identify with the ones who are doing the shirt-removing, discard the nay-sayers. [More on the perspective of 'fractured' selves as an analogy for conscious attention later.]

I watch my shoulders; I flex, stretch, rock my back. I grip both sides of the sink and gaze into my own eyes, and begin. I move from one foot to the other, mixing in a bit of left foot gradually, watching my visage distort and become angry. I balance and remain patient, let the torment subside, until it settles into a blend of familiar and sinister, happy and angry. The anger and sadness tug at me; like any potential focus, I can feel the pull to identify wholly, to fall into [associating with] the negative identity. To do so would mean being overwhelmed by fear or anger or tears [giving up to ridiculing myself for this exercise, or to let the awareness of the pain submerge, and lose my ability to work with it]; I can feel them welling up within me. Neither, though, is it safe or right to ignore the sadness and deny its existence. Instead I must integrate them, observe both. I can see that I am smiling. I continue this process for as long as I can. I want to reach a point of balance, then identify with it, make it my new physical condition. Again I think of the biofeedback training I've done: I need to use this state of heightened perception to identify the healthy posture so that I will recognize it later, so I can strive toward it. My perception is too clouded by pain and habit most of the time. 

There is more about this right/left symmetry in the morning, below.

Eventually I decide I have made as much progress as I can without incurring too much cost to be useful. I am grateful to myself for this opportunity. 

Food

L makes me some eggs. They are perfect, just soft enough and just runny enough, with delicate traces of mint leaf and salty blue cheese, and two pieces of perfectly toasted bread, one with piquant meyer lemon preserves and the other just with sweet butter. I weep. I want to tell her they are fantastic, but every time I try it sounds so habitual, so trite. They are Good Eggs. I don't want to sound like I'm ready to converse; I just want to tell her how much I appreciate such exquisitely crafted food. I make some noise to this effect and drop it. A few moments later she appears with a glass of water, well timed. Her concern for me is enormous and perfectly phrased; not intrusive, not demanding, always only present and ready to withdraw. 

I don't want to stay on the bed where I ate; she is reading there and the presence of another person makes me itch to communicate verbally, and I am incapable of it [and don't desire it]. The failure is distracting [; it is the wrong thing to try to do]. I return to my pillow in the living room, I think; perhaps this is when I go outside. She asks if I want company and I don't, but it is hard to tell her no. I worry I will make her unhappy, by rejecting her company, by leaving when she has designed such exquisite music for me, music which has guided much of the rest of my experience. There is a lesson here, I note, in my worrying too much about my responsibility for others' feelings. 

Sex

I'd like to make love, though it's not a strong desire. I don't suggest it for a few reasons. One, I'm not sure how I'm interacting with L. I don't know if I would come across as a drooling barbarian. The subtle parts of sex may not work, and I don't want to just paw at her. I know this is a dangerous thought, even as I am thinking it, but decide to save it for another time. 

I also worry that it won't go well - in that it may not be the great extra-verbal bridge between us that I feel it should be. That thought scares me, and I don't want to make the risk right now. Another (or the same) lesson, another thing to discuss later with her. 

Finally, I have no idea what my attention span is. Sex may take a million years, and I may have to stop and wander off on another pressing mission. Again, I don't want to intrude. 

I do wonder, though, what an orgasm might feel like in this state. I think of what she did to me a few nights ago, and cannot fathom being on the receiving end of such pleasure again. Considering the plate of eggs made me cry, I imagine the singularity experience of orgasm - not so different in some ways from this loss of self - may gild my mind with diamonds and silver. However, it took me several minutes to thank L for the eggs, and I think my verbal abilities amount to single words right now. I can't imagine myself croaking, 'sex?' and then waiting - or worse, wandering away. I know this will be funny later, but my tolerance for conflict [especially navigating social interaction] is very low right now so I don't pursue it further. 

God

I saw god.  Oh, should I have saved that one for last?  I saw god.  Oh, should I have saved that one for last?  

It begins as an understanding of how I perceive and the nature of the self. I am shedding selves moment to moment, sheaves of them falling away in a spiral around 'me'. Each one is the mechanism of an individual perception, of thinking a thought. [I would say now that each one is a verb, an experience, an 'action' but more accurately an 'interaction'.] I don't associate my subjectivity with any one of them; rather my subjectivity is informed by them as a plant is by its leaves. I would say I 'dispatch' them for each purpose, but there is no separation of me from Me; rather each is created in the act of perceiving, thinking, and they are me the way my finger is me. Each little-m-me occurs at the interface, the product, of Me and Everything Else, is created by that interaction. It was like being in a shower of tumbling leaves, each a complete moment exactly the size of a perception, where perceptions can be near-instantaneous apprehension of qualia (essential blue-ness; a single figure/ground realization; flutter of an eyelid; contraction of a muscle) or more complex thoughts like an appreciation of the relationship between myself and L. 

This was very clear in the mirror game. V1 neurons in the striate cortex are each calibrated to different time series and pattern detection - they are spatiotemporal filters of different temporal 'sizes', with different perceptual responsibilities. I can see each one functioning. The result in the mirror is a series of successive 'images'. I watched my iris and perceived each component of perception separately - blue; grey; diagonal lines; black-edge-darker/lighter border detection, each present and entire, and in each direction its neighbor another slice of qualia separated either in time or in my 'choice' of perception. This same effect was visible outside the 40-to-100 millisecond domain of V1; especially V4 stuff like spatial frequency (patterning), figure/ground detection, and up into global visual perception and even into greater cognition, and I'm reminded now of recent research that shows that not only are V2-V4 susceptible to attentional focus (citation?), but that they can influence and tune V1 but even frontal cognition can (XXXX, 2008). I'd say they're on to something. 

Subjectivity, such as my identity, is 'choosing' a branch, a spiral arm, of these shedding selves; identifying with a slice of them. This isn't a random set; it's a set that is defined by the same nature as the fractal set generation mechanism that 'creates' them in the first place. As each element of a fractal contains the same infinite complexity within as without, so does any selected subjectivity. It may feel discontinuous in time but that's from the local perspective; the relationship from above is clear, as the colored regions of a Mandelbrot fractal are related. Whichever are selected are seamlessly joined into the 'user illusion' of consciousness. 

I am a shedded self, a local function of the fractal; every branch is a pocket subjectivity the universe uses to see itself [through local interactions]. Uphill, the universe is a single entity; it is the essential subjectivity; that is to say, 'god'. It is a fractal spiral, radiating from a single pole. Capital-M-me is that singularity; as far up as I want to go, I am the entire universe. I feel love for myself, all the facets of myself. There is no perception of myself in the past, though; nothing about my childhood or really anything other than how I identify myself now, and of the rest of the world on an equal footing with my 'self'. [Future was present, though; my sense is that 'past' was present, but my only perception of the past would have been from a smaller yet self, and 'upward' was more interesting.] 

There is never a sense of another larger than me; that is, if there is nothing, there is nothing; if there is a thing, it is a subjectivity of some size, defining the axis of a spiral. Further subjectivities may exist [alternate branches of this larger whole - some are 'mine', some I will, I know, habitually conceive of as 'other people', later; the selection function between 'me' and 'other person' though is so clearly analogous to that between the various perceptions that make up 'me'], and we are equal and part of the all, but there is no part of the all that is unknown to Me at this moment; none is an island, entire of itself, etc. This is probably why communication is so difficult; I am identifying with things outside the single-ego-verbal-entity, and cannot coordinate it to talk at that level any more than I can usually choose to grow the right side of my thumbnail faster than the left. [God is the name for the process that defines this 'spiral' and temporarily partitions it so it can interact with itself; ] there is no god outside our relations to each other. 

The sensation fades and I can tell I am becoming more little-m me. This is effected by 'selecting' an arm of the fractal and indwelling there; there is some sadness (?) to the selection of a branch and I am reluctant to restrict myself, as much fun as it is to play at being a person. I so rarely get to be here, with everything all in one place and available to me. I feel comfortable and joyous to be so large. I'm certainly not bored. I am home. 

As I come down I find myself 'sticking' to L, desiring to speak to her. The desire to interact with another subjectivity requires constraining myself to the portions that can operate at a shared time scale. To be more specific, engaging verbally is a lower-resolution interaction. Verbal-style interaction, that is non-externalized but cognitively categorized interaction, affords a slightly higher resolution, and it is more tolerable - these are body language, scent, balance. This greater band of communication with the world remains longer, too, when the effects dwindle; later, when we are on the beach, I can feel the flow of traffic, can feel to a greater degree even than usual the individual drivers and their collective behavior. I tell L that if one of the drivers were to consider turning left to enter the parking lot as they drove by, I would be able to feel it, and I believe this; it's the same way you can tell when a driver is going to turn even though they failed to signal, a thousand tiny cues from the slight turn to the right, the flick of the eyes to the mirrors, but I can perceive it at leisure; can read the body language of the couple arguing far across the beach [and I'm right; we walk closer later, and they are arguing], etc. 

But that is later. As I said, I 'stick' to L, but I am incapable of tuning in to the faster/smaller frequency and can't make myself think at that level. I suspect that this is the point at which I am harder to deal with; this is where I start making the right kind of eye contact but can't engage. L later says that she couldn't tell; she thought my eye contact was fine [all along]. From my perspective, my subjectivity had 'left' that shard and was on to the next, and I felt I was not eye-contacting well. I am reminded (note the passive voice so often!) of the handful of individual cases in which I have seen a person known well to me 'go mad'; that is, fail to be able to sync up with the consensus world and communicate about it. The 'sane' perspective (I in those cases) feels flickers of the identity of the other, fleeting, like the way a thicket of trees becomes a periodic orchard from a moving car, but the trapped mind is incapable of communicating. I wonder if I should go visit [redacted; who is currently in a mental institution]; wonder whether it would be easier or harder to talk to him now. [Probably, I thought even then, harder; there is no special likelihood toward a greater ability to relate there.]

I'm reminded of my biofeedback training and the sensation of being able to 'consciously' smooth a tense muscle or direct my breathing. The sensation is similar; finding the controls, getting the heft of a ball to throw it, bouncing in a new pair of shoes to see how they'll fit. I'm heading toward myself. [Was it John Lilly who referred to needing to get the user's manual out of the glove compartment at this point?]

[If you get into these spaces [non-ordinary states of consciousness] at all, you must forget about them when you come back. You must forget you're omnipotent and omniscient and take the game seriously so you'll engage in sex, have children, and participate in the whole human scenario. When you come back from a deep tank session -- or a coma or psychosis -- there's always this extraterrestrial feeling. You have to read the directions in the glove compartment so you can run the human vehicle once more.]

[Another one of Lilly's I hadn't read at that point:

At the highest level of satori from which people return, the point of consciousness becomes a surface or a solid which extends throughout the whole known universe. This used to be called fusion with the Universal Mind or God. In more modern terms you have done a mathematical transformation in which your centre of consciousness has ceased to be a traveling point and has become a surface or solid of consciousness... It was in this state that I experienced 'myself' as melded and intertwined with hundreds of billions of other beings in a thin sheet of consciousness that was distributed around the galaxy. A 'membrane'.

I like that the 'point' of consciousness moves up in dimensional complexity and becomes a surface, or a solid.]


The Copular BE

I'm barely verbal. My ideas are nearly incoherent but I want to talk as much as possible, having learned from trying to remember my dreams how important it is to verbalize them quickly. I share how English-prime, the 'variant' of English derived from Korzybski's general semantics, seems like a wise idea. The copular BE is a lame copout, a shortcut not worth its cost, from my perspective. Everything is defined by interactions; there is no epistemic or attributive identity. 

We talk about how every tool is not value-free but rather compose entirely of values. I tell her that right now I feel like a 'tool' in this sense; that I am a locally constructed artifact composed to interact and by interaction with the rest of 'my' 'environment'. Everything is like this in its own way: my V2-V4 neurons are like this; they do a job (or several jobs, actually) and any more cohesive appraisal of that job is necessarily from the perspective of that of which they are a portion. I am a delightful machine, capable of edge detection and qualia sorting and composing sonnets and metabolizing food and oxygen and thoughts [I wrote this, 'metabolizing thoughts', intentionally - thoughts are food for one of the creatures I am], and inventing parking laws and paying parking tickets - depending on what 'I' is under examination. I am a message in a bottle, floated back to this corner of time-space-experience. My only definition is the message I bear/am; my existence is that message. 

I ponder destroying all dogmatic verbal systems and see that everything is a 'verbal' system; destroying a verbal system would be nothing but destroying the portion of Self capable of interacting at that 'resolution'. This is impossible, of course; the self exists only through interaction, waiting for interaction with the verbal system to create it. Oxidation is a verbal system of oxygen and sonnets are a verbal system of typical ego-resolution subjectivities and love is a verbal system of larger subjectivities. For that matter, dams are verbal systems of beavers and commerce is a verbal system of corporations, which are themselves a verbal system of egos. So, Mr. Burroughs, I understand your frustration and agree that your path to liberation requires tuning out particular verbal systems, as we have already done. Rarely do the portions of self associated with micturition or sneezing dominate our consciousness, rarer still those whose sole interaction with the world is digestion or toenail-growing. It takes a lot of work to put this Self in the position of chatting about the weather; be proud of it, or at least pat it on the head and thank it from time to time. Better verbal systems await our need for them. Every human relationship is such a local verbal system, developed between two spiral arms of the universe. [Upward!]

Love for L

L is a wise soul. L cares for me, and cares for me well. Every realization I make in my life, she is prepared to meet me at. I am humbled by my good fortune and joyous that we love each other. She is an excellent partner and I am happy that I feel I am relating to her properly, as two individuals with a strong bond; we are good for each other. Later when she is talking while she drives I am rapt at listening to her; I love her mind, so quick and so sincere. Sincerity, above all, is the word I associate with her, and with what it means for us to have a relationship. It is possible for me to be utterly sincere with her. 

This love is so good and I want to compare it to my past love, the one that was so strong but so wrong and so sad. I decide to think for a while of Jennifer, and my love for her, to understand the difference. I see that what characterized it as so intense was its ludicrous focus - I was able to think of nothing but her; I identified as solely the shards of self concerned with her. It was a good experience and a good place to experience, but inherently curtailed, a dead-end arm of the spiral. Specific memories I had shadows of but had thought lost show me this. I remember a curl of hair, the shadow of a curtain; just like with H, occasional phantom concordances lined up but we were never consistently in sync. I let the image fall away. 

L, 'totally subjective'

I'm just becoming verbal again and L and I are talking. She uses the phrase 'to be totally subjective' and my naive mind is still taking words at strong value to my internal correlation for them. 'Total' and 'subjective' are words that have a lot of import to me at the moment, but I'm starting to understand the mediating function of words between subjectivities and the contrast between what leaps to mind when she says 'totally subjective' and my understanding of what she really intends me to think is so huge it makes me choke and laugh. I've got your total subjectivity, right here. [I still laugh, thinking about this. I didn't mean to be unkind, it was just overwhelming and unrelated to what she was saying. For a moment I thought she really was able to be totally subjective simply by saying so.]

[There is] no difference between right-on-red law and oxidation of iron in rusting. Both are just local customs. 

I pick up my glasses to put them on and the asymmetry of my head is enormous. I feel my teeth grind against each other, feel how much my body spirals, and I'm sad. I pick up my sunglasses a moment later, and they are in the same category as the glasses, but different - not being custom-fitted, they move differently, and the three-dimensional difference is tangible, a chiral variant. I wonder if I would be much, much better at complex geometry. Math is pretty again. 

The universe is clockwise. I remember that from yesterday. But when I woke up this morning, it was counter-clockwise. This relates to my left/right balance issue; I am misperceiving the direction, perhaps? I close one eye, my left (RVF), and breathe deeply. The universe Necker-cubes back to clockwise, and I dwell for a time in the 'weakness' of my right eye, remembering, strengthening my connection to that perception from this side of my brain. I know that my worsening right rhomboid/ infraspinatus/ trapezius/ latissimus pain is the result of ignoring my left side; distrusting my weakness, denying the memory of years of pain, still. I am happy; I have a path to recovery. I am aware that this is an insight. It was not granted to me from on high; it is not a message from elsewhere (see earlier, there is no external authority). It is a fact just like 'blue eyes' or 'bad haircut' or 'hexagonal hydrogen-to-hydrogen bonds become stronger than local entropy in water at 0 degrees celsius around here' that I was able to perceive. 

We walk on the beach, and L assiduously avoids being upwind of me while she smokes. I want to tell her that seeing a cigarette surrounds me with every sensation associated with them and that the oddness introduced into her walking behavior is much more distracting than the smoke could be, but I am completely incapable and it doesn't really matter anyway. She is being kind and I love her. 

The tide is very far out and I enjoy the sensation of the ocean being at arm's length, and see where it's going to come back. I feel dizzily lost and enjoy the feel of the small rip currents formed by the curl of the dunes. I see how I could be trapped by the water and shiver; Tyger Tyger, I could be drowned while I enjoy the sound of the percussion of the waves. A small voice sets a timer on how long I will stay here. [And I take some pride in the fact that I have a mind that is good at taking care of me, that will set that timer and not interrupt me with worry until it goes off, so I can safely devote my attention to other things.]

Science - If everything is simply everything's way of noticing itself, pointing out patterns seems absurd. But being a scientist, ie, noticing things, is a joy and the whole point. It's the tiny details that seems ludicrous. [The notion that any one detail is better, or above all that a model has anything to do with reality.] 

Religion

We talk about a definition for religion. More to add, but essentially that I find it hard to identify something that isn't religion. [Everything is religion.] Peak experiences are going to be a moving target [that is, while math is the study of models, the study of peak experiences has an open lambda closure (sorry, lambda calculus is just the best way to explain it) in that what is 'peak' is a function specific to a particular subjectivity, and will have to be amended as we grow. Any religion we build, that is, any spiritual technology/religious function I might create to as James defines 'associate man with the transcendent' has to have dynamism built into it. This is the cleverness of Mr. J. H. Christ and Mr. G. Buddha. They did an excellent job of making definitions relative, before their followers started eating the menu instead of the meal and Christianity in particular ossified into the petty, cruel mess it now favors.]

Food

We eat at the Tibetan place we love because they genuinely prepare North Indian food with all its layers and complexity intact - I've never been anywhere like it in the States. The food is sublime. The wine is a clumsy failure; I can feel the minerals in the soil reach out and be blunted by the naive sweetness, clubbed to death like a defenseless baby seal. I think again that aesthetes of wine know what they're doing, and their attempts to describe wine are also attempts to harness a dogmatic verbal system. Us religion folks may benefit from talking with them. 

Body

Today, I love my body. I am tall and strong and happy. My posture is good and nothing hurts. I dance a lot. I am astonished by how great my body is. I laugh every time I walk by the mirror, which I conspire to do frequently. 

Lessons for the future

Fewer things. The closest thing to this and the route to broadening consciousness, that is, 'identification with formerly non-self' is unalloyed attention. Multitasking is silly, or rather any multitasking that requires conscious attention. [Here I was thinking of the kind of multitasking that is built in to our bodies - digesting food, up to perhaps balance while reading, etc.] Cultivate attention; 'never whistle while you're pissing' moves one notch further toward being my next tattoo. 

Fewer things in every sense. Possessions are so easy to have, but each carries with it [or, more, demands you carry] a tiny fragment of your values [devote a small amount of your attention to carrying it]. One is the constantly progressing product of interactions with the universe. Own nothing; keep near you the things you value. ['Omnea mea mecum porto'.] This is the Buddhist doctrine of clinging as explained by Alan Watts and others. Leap lightly and love each step. Any step not loved is a stumble. [I cry, just a little bit, reading this only two months later.] 

Identification of self with more is something I bring back as a goal. The broader Self I can experience, the better. Individuals should be large in extent in time and space [and subject]. 

[Miscellaneous notes I can't delete:]

A child boy on the street can't take his eyes off me. I smile; I talk with him. He's about five years old, playing on my steps as his mother takes him on a walk around the block. [Old people and children notice me a lot more, or I notice them, or we notice each other, for a few weeks after.] 

PULL PIN SIX! 

Ha ha ha. Zelazny made great hay of the LSD experience. Walking to shadows, the relationship between selves. Pull pin six! 

right eye/left eye
I underuse my right eye. 

[Finally - all this added:]

One of my favorite meditations has become easier for me, or one has been suggested to me by the experience. I call it the moment-to-moment or the continuity meditation, when I have to call it. I 'attentionate', devote my attention to, the act of perceiving time. How big is a thought? Is this moment of thought the same as the last one, or is it a new one? What makes the border? How long can a thought be? None of these are individually considered, of course; rather I am trying to examine the state-of-thinking. 'Examine' is really not the correct word. I am devoting myself to being the state-of-being-thought/perspective, I suppose. Making of myself only the act of making myself. I find this meditation nearer at hand now, when I close my eyes and think of it.

And I find my mood still (+2 months) very even. Kind, thoughtful, happy, I dare say. I've been called 'wise' four or five times in the last few months; hardly all new, but still it stands out. I feel less desirous, more excited about doing than having. I've felt this before, of course, to one degree or another, but this seems different, to be with less effort; a higher baseline of such a state. And my attention is less fractured; I discard multi-tasking. 

I could be sad when I read this and see that it has in some ways become more distant. But I'm not; I'm doing Well. I will know what I need to know when I need to know it.

I had always been curious about psychedelic drugs. When I was younger I never thought I would actually try anything like LSD, but there was always a curiosity, brought about by images in the media portraying the crazy visual hallucinations people can have when under the influence of certain substances. I have been an avid pot-smoker for about four years, and about six months ago, I tried mushrooms for the first time (a half-eighth). I will never forget this first experience I had, as I walked through this magical forest where everything was beautiful, and where I felt completely one with everything around me. Since then, I have done mushrooms two more times: once at Bonnaroo (unremarkable compared to my first trip, but still a good experience) and again at an STS9 concert at Red Rocks Amphitheater. Here, I experienced my first true hallucinations. The rocks were making faces at me, laughing down at me, and the sky had turned into an incredible kaleidoscopic pattern. This was the only time I have ever really experienced ego death. Although somewhat frightening at times, I could feel the music through my whole body, and it was one of the most intense experiences of my life...but amazing! 

Anyway, onto the real story (I could write pages about my shroom trips but they were insignificant compared to my trip on LSD). Just a warning, this might get kind of long, but hopefully its helpful. I know I read dozens of these experiences before I tried acid, and I feel like they prepared me well. About a month ago, my friend B and I were planning on going to a dubstep concert, and we were trying to score some mushrooms for it. We searched and searched, but nobody could hook us up. However, one of our friends said she could get us some acid. After my most recent mushroom experience, I felt as though I could handle just about anything, and I had been curious about acid for a really long time, so we decided to go for it. B had tried it before but didnt trip that hard because it was weak acid, but our friend assured us that this was good shit. 

As the night of the show approached, I was very excited, but admittedly, a bit nervous. I mean who wouldnt be? Even though I had butterflies in my stomach, I felt like I was physically and mentally ready for whatever the acid trip would throw at me. I had the mindset that if I could look at any aspect of the trip positively, there was no way I would have a bad trip. Besides, my most recent shroom trip had been so intense, and so incredible, that I couldnt imagine encountering any visions or feelings on acid that I couldnt look at positively. Most people would have freaked the fuck out if two giant cliffs were making faces at them and laughing down on them, but I had taken it in stride, and even found it hilarious. 

The day of the show: I sat through class all day not hearing a word my professors muttered, anxiously awaiting the Ginza show, and my first LSD experience. After class, my friend B called me up and informed me that he had a family emergency, and had to go home for the weekend, so he couldnt go to the show. I was really bummed, I had been looking forward to tripping with him, and I wasnt sure if I still wanted to do it. Its a good thing my friend, N, said she would drive us to the show, otherwise I would have had nobody to go with. I asked her if she wanted a hit of acid, but she declined, saying she wouldnt be able to drive us home if she was tripping. Good point. I really wanted to do the acid because I had been looking forward to it all week, but I was apprehensive about tripping alone. I was nervous, but I was more than confident that I would have a good trip. I had done a lot of research about acid, and I knew that it would agree with me, but everything I read cautioned me about tripping alone. We drove down, smoked a few bowls, and then decided to go to the show. I had the acid in my pocket, and I decided to chill for a little. I would get to the concert, and feel it out: if I was digging the vibes of the show, I would drop the acid. 

The moment I walked in the door, I immediately decided I wanted to trip there. The main room was uncrowded, and had a lounge area with comfy couches. There were black lights, and a crazy lightshow going on, and interesting paintings and stuff to look at on the walls. There was also another room next to the main one with all kinds of statues and paintings, and just cool shit to look at. Not only that, but there was another stage outside with a different band playing. Oh yeah, did I mention there was also a game room with pinball and air hockey, and all kinds of other fun stuff? After exploring the place for a bit, I decided it was a great place to trip out, and it was time to drop the acid. 

10:00pm. I was a bit nervous, so I decided to only take one of the two hits I had, and take the other if I wasnt tripping that hard in like an hour. My heart was racing as I put the little piece of paper in my mouth, but once I did, it all subsided. It didnt taste like anything, but it felt strange, almost tingly and cold on my tongue. The journey begins here. I sat talking with my friend for a little while, looking around at everything in the room, I remember thinking, in about two hours, this place is going to look very different. I had no idea how right I was. After about 45 minutes had passed, I was feeling really good. I had a nice body high, and the music sounded great. I couldnt tell if it was the acid, or if the lightshow was just really trippy, but I didnt care, I was having a good time. At this point I was still having normal conversations with my friend, N, and other people in the bar, but I couldnt help but notice that everyones faces looked very three-dimensional, and almost plastic-like. We went outside to check out the other band, and they were awesome too. It was really hot inside, so we chilled outside listening to the other band for a while. I was really high at this point, but I wasnt having any hallucinations, and I was still concretely in this world, so I decided to take the other hit. 

11:30pm. I casually popped the other piece of blotter in my mouth. N and I decided to go inside and play some air hockey. I sucked at it because I was captivated by the vivid trails left behind by the neon colored puck. I lost but I didnt give a shit, I was too enamored with all the cool paintings on the wall. All the paintings now seemed more lifelike and three-dimensional. I could see the smallest details in everything: things that I would never usually notice. Looking at an empty spot of wall, I could now see the patterns made by the cinderblocks under the paint in more dimension than you could imagine. It was like I had HD vision. I realized I had left to go to the bathroom a really long time ago, and I had just gotten distracted by all the cool stuff, so I went back outside and joined N. The band outside was a huge contrast to the dubstep inside. They were playing old-style hippy jam band type of music, and had all kinds of horns and saxophones: this is the best sounding music I have ever heard in my entire life. I had a perpetual smile and couldnt stop dancing to the music. I was in total and utter amazement at how good the music sounded. It was almost as if my brain were having a constant orgasm for the entire concert. My smile felt bigger than my face, and I could feel the music through my entire body...even more so than when I was on shrooms at red rocks. 

I looked at the ground and it was covered with an incredible pattern. It was not kaleidoscopic, but stationary, almost like a pattern on a fancy wallpaper. I looked up at the tree above me, and the leaves were dangling above my head, almost like they were trying to reach out and tickle me. I found this hilarious, and I kept pointing these things out to N, only to realize she couldnt see them. She was experiencing an entirely different show than me. I wished so badly that I had someone to share this experience with, because any time I would try to tell N something, she would just laugh at me like I was crazy. It was difficult to have conversation now. I kept thinking of a million things at once, and when I started to say it, I would just forget where I was going: my brain had already moved on to a different subject. My arms felt really weird, almost like tight and stiff, but I didnt really care because I was having such an amazing time. 

We went back inside, and the lightshow was more intense than ever. The whole room was purple, and I felt like I was in space or something. The dubstep music was literally fucking my mind: It sounded like alien music and it was just so odd but so moving, I just could not get over how amazing it sounded. No, not sounded. I wasnt hearing music anymore, I was feeling it: absorbing it with my whole body. It was a three-hour mind orgasm, theres no better way to describe it. I remember at one point, N asked me what time I wanted to leave. I replied, Time? I dont care about time. Time isnt real, its an entity made up by man, and all it does is cause problems. I then realized she was probably bored by now. I was having the time of my life, and she was probably tired of it and ready to leave. I wanted so badly for her to be in the same state of mind as me, and I realized I would never be able to explain to her how I felt at that moment. I am trying my best to explain it now, but words truly do not do justice to the LSD experience. I guess the best word to sum up the whole experience is, whoooooooaaaaaaaaaahh. 

Anyway, the concert came to an end and it was time to go home. We exited the building and everything seemed so bright, even though it was 2 in the morning. It looked entirely different than on the way in, and I had no idea where we had parked. I felt really bad that Id just had such an incredible experience, and N had just been like sitting there bored. I kept apologizing and asking her if she had a good time. She said yes, but I couldnt help but think she was just trying to make me feel better. She reassured me that she had fun too, and she put on some music. Again, I start head bobbing with a huge grin: music is my favorite thing in the world at this moment. It was hot in the car so I rolled down the window on the highway, and stuck my head out of it. It was the single most refreshing moment of my life. The cold wind blew all of the troubles out of my mind and I was left content. 

She dropped me off at my apartment building and I went inside. The stone tile floor looked so trippy, the rock grains flowing around. As I went up the stairs the echoes of my footsteps sounded like I was underwater. I walked into my cluttered apartment and thought, fuck...what am I supposed to do now? I was still tripping hard and both my roommates were asleep, and I was just all alone in my frustratingly messy apartment. Everything looked warped, like in a fun house mirror. First things first, I decided to put on some music, and I went outside on my porch, where I liked the atmosphere a lot better (it faces the woods). 

I grabbed my bong and packed up the bowl. It was the last of my weed. I had about a half bowl and that was it. I looked at my empty weed bag: devastated. I kept thinking I saw another piece in there but whenever I reached in to get it, it would disappear. I was really sad that I was out of weed, but whatever, Ill just smoke it. I took a bong hit, and as I held it in, all the leaves on the trees next to my porch just curled up into a crazy pattern, a lot like the leaves dangling above me at the concert. With each bong hit the visuals got crazier and crazier, and I found it hilarious! 

I had the idea to go get my acoustic bass, and I started playing. Improvisation never came to me so easily, and the strings felt like butter on my fingers: I was incredibly entertained. There is a Bob Marley poster and a Jimi Hendrix poster on my wall, and their facial expressions seemed to keep changing. Could it be? Here are two of my idols, the two greatest musicians in history, right here on my wall, grinning in approval of my music. 

I wasnt hungry, but I decided I wanted to have a flavor in my mouth. I squirted a drop of honey in my mouth, and it was the sweetest, most delicious thing I had ever tasted. 

It was then that I remembered that when I was on shrooms at Bonnaroo, my friend and I spent like 2 hours drawing with magic markers, and it felt so cool! I didnt have markers, but I grabbed a pen and some paper and started going to town. I like doing art anyway, but the satisfaction of drawing while on acid was just incredible. I had no idea what I was going to draw, and I thought it would turn out to be total crap, but I didnt care. I would make a mark and watch the ink bleed onto the paper and take shape. I would expand the mark and it would turn into something else, then something else, just growing and growing. It was like the drawing was unfolding before me, revealing itself to me bit by bit. I didnt have to think about it, and I was not creating the drawing, it was more like I was just unveiling the art from the blank page. My hand was moving but I wasnt controlling it: it was just revealing the drawing to me little by little, but I wished more than anything in the world that I had some colors. My mind was racing. So many different feelings and emotions poured out onto the page. It was like five minutes worth of thought process packed into five seconds...end on end for ten hours, and it could all be summed up by, wooooaaahhhhh. 

I kept having these incredible realizations after realizations about the world and the universe, and myself. It was like every great realization lead to another one, but at the end of every realization loop was the incredible realization that nothing I had just thought of made sense, and I was just on acid.  About halfway through my drawing I realized that it was going to turn out really cool. I was creating art without even being conscious of what I was doing.  That was when my mind revealed to me the most incredible realization of them all: It doesnt matter what I do, and it doesnt matter how I get there, but in the end everything works out.  I had just been aimlessly scribbling on a piece of paper for what seemed like hours and it was turning into an incredible piece of art. I realized I could put whatever the fuck I wanted on the page and it would be art, no matter what it was. Anything at all, I could do it and it would be awesome. In the midst of all this, I wrote on the back of the page: 
It can be whatever I want it to be, 
Whatever I want it to be can be art. 
I get lost in the_____________???????? 
Music never sounds so clear as if 
Daylight broke too soon. 
There are question marks and scribbles all over the back of the page and then: 
and thats how to describe ACID 

The first two lines have to do with my realization that it doesnt matter what I do, it will turn out good either way. I get lost in the...well everything really. I didnt even know what to put because there were a million things going through my head. Music had never sounded so clear to me, and I kept picturing the sun bursting above the dark horizon...daylight breaking too soon. At the bottom of the page I wrote, I WISH I HAD SOME COLORS! I wished I had some colors that night even more than I wish I could upload my drawing along with this story. I am truly more proud of this drawing than any other piece of art I have ever done. 

Everything was so significant that night: like every little detail of everything! I even wrote at the bottom of the back of my drawing, Everything is so significent. Magnificent? Significent. And yes it was spelled wrong. I looked at it after I wrote it and thought that it didnt look right. Is that really a word? Sig-ni-fi-sent. Like magnificent? Well everythings magnificent right now too, but what the hell is that word? I couldnt think of the correct pronunciation of the word. Oh well, maybe its not a word, maybe I just made it up in my head. Language is obsolete, and words are just useless, they dont mean as much as they are intended to mean. I was seriously convinced that significant was not a real word, and that my mind had fabricated it just like my distorted visions and crazy thoughts, and the abstract piece of art that had revealed itself to me. 

I was finished drawing, I was bored with playing bass, and it was cold as fuck outside. I was still tripping hard but I had no idea what to do. I had done all I could do with this trip and now I just want to be done, but there was no way I could fall asleep yet. I looked at my watch. 4:20am, and I dont have any more fucking weed. Well shit, what do I do now? I was officially bored with tripping and I just wanted it to be over so I could go to sleep. I remembered how awesome honey tasted, so I squirted some more in my mouth. It was waayyyyyyyy too sweet, it almost hurt my mouth it was such an overpowering taste. I decided to take a shower: that will kill some time. 

I walked into my bathroom and when I looked in the mirror, it was not me in the reflection. I mean obviously it was me but it didnt look like me. I looked like a fucking lunatic: like an insane psychopath. How is this decision going to affect my life? What is happening to the world? I felt like my entire idea of reality was just falling apart. I put on some music and hopped in the shower. The warm water comforted me, and I started to feel better. I realized, what the hell, Im still tripping so I might as well enjoy it. I was smiling, moving to the music again, thinking positive thoughts. I became amazed by the patterns made by the wet and dry parts of my shower curtain, and water droplets looked distorted and split up into a symmetrical arrangement. I sat in the bottom of my shower for what seemed like hours, just thinking about the crazy night I just had. My whole idea of reality was just shattered; I realized there was so much more to the world than what I had previously thought. Was I going insane? No, no, Im just on acid. 

I got out of the shower and dried off, and put on some comfortable clothes. I made myself a cup of tea and sat out on my porch, as I watched the sun start to come up. I felt great! So comfortable and refreshed after my shower, and soothed by my hot tea. For the first time in my life, I was completely and totally at peace. I had made it through my acid trip and had an incredible time: it was a night I would never forget.  I gained so much insight from this experience, and I felt like I had grown as a person. I went to sleep around 6:30am, exhausted, but incredibly happy and peaceful. 

I woke up at 8:00am and I had an incredible amount of energy, considering I had been up all night tripping balls. I walked out of my room and looked around my messy, cluttered apartment. I felt really good: I wasnt tripping anymore, but I was definitely off baseline. I couldnt hang out in my messy apartment; I had to go somewhere else. I put in some headphones and just started walking. Nowhere in particular, I was just walking; thinking. Everything looked so vibrant and beautiful! I walked around the woods for about two hours just thinking about all the insight I had gained from my trip, and how I could relate it to everyday life, and just admiring the beauty this world has to offer. I realized everything in the world has this inner psychedelic beauty that has always been there, but I just didnt notice it until after I tripped on acid. Even now, about a month later, I still sometimes look at something and realize how trippy and beautiful it is. I wouldnt call it a flashback, but some things like this just remind me of my acid trip. 

I feel like after this experience I am more open to abstract thinking, and I have realized that sometimes you cant plan things out, you just have to go with the flow, and whatever you do it will probably turn out for the best. I would not recommend LSD to just anybody, because I can definitely see how some people may think they are going crazy or have a bad trip, but if you can look at just about anything in a positive way, and you dont let things bother you, you should definitely try it. With the right mindset and setting I really learned a lot about myself and the world from LSD. It is not something I would want to do all the time, but I really want to trip again in a few months. From my experience the most important thing to remember is that the point of LSD, or mushrooms for that matter, is not just to get fucked up. These drugs are not like alcohol or MDMA, where I just get fucked up and party, and have a good time. Psychedelics really expanded my mind and made me look at the world in a whole new light. I had an incredibly awesome time tripping on acid, but I also learned a lot, and I feel like I am a more mature and insightful person after this great experience.

BODY WEIGHT:
140 lb





It was Friday night, I had just managed to obtain ten hits of blotter and this was the first time I would be trying LSD. I was very excited at the time, and couldn't wait to try it. I had done extensive research beforehand, and on this particular Friday night, I really thought I was ready to escape reality. Little did I know what was in store for me later that night. So the night progressed and I invited a few friends over to my house. For the purpose of this story, we're going to call these people Jack, Kate, Tim, and Ben. Kate had also done a bit of research and was ready to try it as well. It was just going to be her and I tripping, while everyone else was just going to hang out and trip sit, and make sure we stayed under control.

So the time came when we were ready to try it. I handed her a hit of blotter, and took one for myself, and we both popped them in our mouths. We then decided to go watch tv, while we waited for it to kick in. It seemed to take an eternity. After about two hours I called a friend of mine and asked him what the deal was. He insisted that I just keep waiting, so I did. About ten minutes later, Kate claimed she could feel it. I however, could not. About fifteen minutes later I began to feel it as well. It came on slowly. My thoughts seemed to wander wherever I would let them go. Every thing I touched had a very interesting feeling to it. Some things felt really uncomfortable to touch. I picked up Ben's key chain and stared at it in amazement at all of the colors for about five minutes. Then it started feeling really odd, and like it was cutting into my hand. I instantly threw it down on the table. While Kate was already tripping hard, and had went into another room, I wasn't quite all the way there yet. I went to see what she was up to, and she kept going on about snakes for the next half hour, and how the room was 'filled with snakes' and  the 'snake gods'. At this point I was enjoying myself, and having a really good time just laughing about everything. The smallest things seemed hilarious. For the next few minutes I was just fucking around with Kate while she was going on and on about snakes and kept unplugging her laptop cord which for some reason was hilarious at the time. I was really enjoying myself. I just felt like fucking around with everyone. I was there on the ground, screaming and yelling 'BEN! BENNNNNNNNN!' Then he would come into the room and I would go completely silent. Then he'd walk back into the living room, where the other trip sitters were, and I'd scream and yell his name again. This went on about three more times until he finally just got sick of my shit and started ignoring me.

I had some really crazy visuals, the most noticeable being when I looked at people's faces. While watching someone talking their face would kind of morph, and get larger and smaller. Their expression would also constantly change. This was quite amusing.  At this point both of us were tripping quite hard, and nearing 'peak'. We were laying on the ground, and just having a good time. At this point, one of my trip-sitters decided that he 'had to try it' after watching how much fun we were having. I kept telling him no, but he didn't listen. He went to the kitchen and grabbed a hit, then threw the money at me a bit later. A bit later I found out that EVERY person in my house had done the same thing! They all wanted to try it, so they took a hit without my approval. At this point I started panicking. They were treating this drug that they had never researched before like it was something small like weed or alcohol. Tim even claimed it was 'no big deal, and it's just a drug you chill out with your friends with'. Oh how wrong he was. I was starting to freak out. Thoughts were racing through my head, I kept thinking 'I'm losing control here' and kept thinking how terrible it was that we had no trip sitter to keep anyone under control. Then I started freaking out about the fact that it was my house, and that if anything got broken, my parents would kill me. From this point on, I could not enjoy the trip. I was panicking, and beginning to sweat. Everyone was tripping, and there wasn't a single sober person at my house. People were all over my house, doing god knows what, and I was really not enjoying myself. I became very hot, so I decided to go outside to cool off. We went up on the pool deck outside my house. Everyone else came with me. I kept asking them who hadn't taken it, but I kept being assured by everyone that each person there had taken it. This just made me freak out more. Tim tried to calm me down, which worked for a little bit. We laid there for a little bit reminiscing about the classic scene in 'The Pirates of Silicon Valley' where Steve Jobs takes LSD. We discussed it for awhile, and talked about how amazing it was that 'they made all those computers'. This doesn't make any sense to me as I'm typing it, but at the time, we all thought it made perfect sense. The pool deck had an amazing unique feel to it, as did anything else I touched, and my vision was filled with colors.

I was finally starting to enjoy myself again for a little while, but it was short lived. Kate and Ben had run off, and everyone was just being very loud outside. I started worrying again. A bit later I felt too cold outside, so we all eventually made our way back inside. It wasn't but a minute later the doorbell rang. Tim went and answered the door. It was the cops. They wanted to talk to me, since I lived at the house. I was panicking again. I could hardly even talk. I went outside to speak with the officer, who said they had gotten a 'welfare check' call. I kept trying to convince the officer that everything was fine, and that no one had done anything. I also kept saying that I did not want them searching my house under any circumstances. I couldn't think very straight at the time, as I was at the peak of my trip now. I just kept repeating that I didn't want them searching my house. This officer kind of 'gave up' on me for awhile, while another officer came out to talk to me. This officer tried to talk to me on a much more personal level. He said how he knew we were on something, and that his guess was acid. I didn't say a 'yes' or a no' but my facial expression did change when I realized he knew what was up. He continued talking to me on a personal level, and started going on about he used to 'sell dope at my age'. Then he started talking about how he turned his life around, and that I needed to, too. 

At this point the other officer came back outside and started questioning me again too. I felt so intimidated and scared at the time. I was tripping hard, and I could not handle the situation at all. I felt like I was two inches tall, and the officers were giants. I felt like I was an a small bug about a second away from being stomped on. They also questioned my friends, in a different area away from me. My friends had told them that I sold it to them. I tried to weasel my way out of everything, but I was tripping so hard that I just couldn't handle it. I don't remember a whole lot of what happened next, but the officers had entered my house, and they found the remaining five hits of blotter, which I had left in a DVD case on the kitchen counter.

I felt destroyed. I knew in my mind that this was the end. At this point they had also called an ambulance to my house, as well as backup police officers. My entire culdesac was filled with law enforcement. Since I was freaking out even more now, the police officer led me over to the ambulance so that the medical examiner could check me out. He said I would be fine, and that I just had a really high pulse. Some of the police officers were enjoying themselves, and fucking around with me at the time. I remember one officer telling me to go to another officer, then when I got there he would say 'What are you doing here? I told you to go over there!' One of the officers who was talking to my friends inside of my house, was talking about all the crazy things all my friends were saying, and how they were definitely 'gone'. Eventually, one of the officers led me back to my front porch, to help me get my shoes. I put them on, then I was put in the back of a police car. I felt two inches tall again. I began to feel very claustrophobic, and started freaking out again.I kept looking out the window, and eventually they let me out again for awhile. 

They asked me a few more questions, then I asked if I could call my parents. At this point the reality had really struck me. I knew how FUCKED I was. I knew I was being arrested, and I knew there was nothing I could do to get out of this. I called my father, crying to him on the phone, and telling him how sorry I was for disappointing him. I went on about how I should have listened to him. After awhile the police officer told me to wrap it up, so I said my goodbyes, and he then took my phone as evidence. I was put back into the police car, and an officer got in and started the car. We started driving to the police station. I had calmed down slightly, and I remember saying 'Damn!' as the officer floored it once we got out onto the main road. Eventually we got to the police station, and I was led inside. I was still tripping and had trouble remembering what he was telling me to do. He led me down a hallway, and had me sign some papers. Then he led me into a small holding cell.

Once I was in the cell I realized the severity of the situation again. The cell was a small room with bright lights, a mirror, a toilet, and a sink. I sat on the bench and the cell and just thought about everything. Wondered how I got myself into this. I started crying, and asking myself out loud 'How could I do this?' 'How could this happen?' This talking to myself went on for probably an hour. Then I proceeded to stare at floor of the cell, which caused me to see some very interesting visual hallucinations. I couldn't enjoy myself though. My mind was not in the right place. At this point I just wanted to end the trip. I took a drink of water, then took a look at myself in the mirror. I looked terrible. I definitely looked like someone fucked up some sort of drug. I kept having weird thoughts like 'Is this me?' 'Is this who I am?' Over the next couple hours, I kept drinking water, to help end my trip faster, and also went to the restroom a few times.

Finally, the officer opened the cell, and I was led out. I was told that I would be going to the local juvenile detention facility. My heart sunk, and again I realized just how much shit I had gotten myself into. I was put into handcuffs and shackles. Then I was led outside by two more officers into a white van. At this point it was around 5am, and I had not slept yet. I couldn't sleep though, as I was still tripping. I was put into the back of this van, while the officers got in and began to drive. The juvenile detention facility was around two hours away, so they told me to try and get some sleep. I tried, but I couldn't. It was very uncomfortable sitting with handcuffs and shackles on. During the two hour drive, I had some very weird thoughts. I thought a lot about life, and how these officers were just 'normal people' who happened to have a job in law enforcement, and how they all had their own families, and their own problems. This was just their job. My mind wandered the entire ride there.

Eventually we got there. I was taken out of the vehicle, and led to the door outside the facility. A very buff man, was standing outside it. The officers wished me luck, and left me with this man, who then proceeded to yell at me like a drill sergeant. He made my repeat everything he said, and started going over some of the ground rules of the facility. There was a yellow line taped down on the floor and I had to acknowledge all of the officers and request permission to cross it. This was very hard to do at the time, as I was still kind of fucked up, and I hadn't slept in ages. Eventually one of the guards led me into a room and had me shower, then gave me prison clothes to change into. I couldn't believe I was actually in jail. After I finished my shower, he let me call my parents. I told them to get me a lawyer and they agreed. That was the last I would hear from them. Eventually I was led to a room with bunks with the other inmates. The next three days that I would remain in this facility would be the worst days of my life. The first day was the worst. I was still coming down from the LSD, and I was not allowed to sleep at all until 10pm rolled around. Needless to say I could hardly function during the day, and was completely exhausted by the time night came around. The facility operated like a standard jail. Asshole guards, terrible food, no rights, and nothing to do besides read the 'rules sheet' you were given. If you had good behavior, you could later be upgraded and be able to read the Bible, then if you continued to have good behavior, you could check out a book. The three days I remained in this facility were the longest days of my life. What was even worse was that all of the other kids in there were in there for real crimes like fighting and stealing. I was in there for a drug charge. A victimless 'crime'. Every night before I went to sleep I would think about how I was going to possibly get of there, and how long I would be in there. On the third day I was taken to court in another white van, along with a dozen other inmates that were scheduled for court that day.

We got to the court house, and my case happened to be the very first one. My parents, my lawyer, and I both went to the stand. My lawyer did most of the talking, and eventually it was agreed upon that I should get out of the juvenile detention facility, but have house arrest for a month, then eight more months of probation. I was unhandcuffed, and released to my parents. That's where my story ends. All of this happened over one hit of LSD. My trip was a train wreck. A complete disaster. I later found out that all my friends had gotten off scott free. Not even charged or anything. I was slapped with over $1,000 of fees, and now had to serve probation. 

So that's where my story ends. I wasn't able to properly evaluate the drug 'erowid style' due to everything that happened. Would I ever eventually try LSD again? I'm not sure at this point. If I did try it, it definitely wouldn't be at my house again.

(liquid)

Well I didnt think it was possible with the quality of most LSD I see these days, but it seems I finally achieved my lifelong goal of overdosing and completely flipping out. 

It was a Friday night and my trusty acid dealer arrived with the small squeeze-bottle vial. Usually she laughs hysterically at the number of hits I want to take, telling me I scare her. This time however, she just looked concerned and said this is supposed to be really good stuff. Are you SURE you want to take 10? At this I replied that I was so sure and she proceeded to squeeze the drops onto my tongue. 1,2,3,4,5,6- ok swish around, then 7,8,9,10. With the usual hug and have a good trip!, she left me to my usual coming up on large amounts of LSD- antics. My especially active roommate was gone for the weekend, and so I locked myself in my room and watched the end of this really strange Japanese zombie movie called versus. The time was 1:50pm

The LSD came on stronger and faster than I had ever experienced. Usually I wait about two hours, wondering if I got ripped off. This time I ate very little in preparation, and by the 25 minute mark things were seriously near the overwhelming point. The white walls became trillions of colors with a repeating pattern that looked like the symbol for a cold front over and over again. I have only gotten sick on acid once before, but the intensity of the come up left me curled up on my bed with my face in the comforter, rolling around to try to stave off the nausea. Im sure some out there know what I am talking about- its no normal nausea, its inconsistent and comes in rapid waves. What was initially an ecstatic mood at getting what seemed to be excellent acid turned into fear- this was coming on way too strong, way too fast. I remember lying on my bed looking at the different sized whirlpools swirling in the drywall and thinking Just hold on, motherfucker! For some reason I kept conceptualizing the amount of time I had been waiting for this trip, and it seemed to be a very tangible amount of days bathed in this dreary sunset light and it made me feel unbearably depressed so I tried to banish it from my mind. 

By this point it was about an hour in and things were getting really intense. I looked at the underside of my hand and wrist and saw the veins scintillating and moving quickly like highways of loading bars on the computer with the diagonal lines moving. The visuals were making me sick so I closed my eyes and saw this universe pattern with millions of different sized dots and stars made of different day-glo colors. It was all intensely beautiful but I felt too sick to appreciate it. I stood up to make my way to the bathroom to try to speed up the inevitable and found my balance was insanely off. I stumbled and almost fell over, then crawling over to my toilet and sitting cross-legged in front of it, cursing it for being so tall and not being usable with me in that sitting position because it was the only position I could think of at the moment. The visuals at this point were not as noticeable because I was looking around too fast to settle on something, and frankly was concerned with my survival more than the trip. I knew in the back of my head that no one has ever died from LSD itself, and so as long as I maintained some small measure of control and didnt fling myself out a window or something I would be fine. It certainly didnt feel that way though, I felt violently ill and my mind kept going back to how the current trip must compare to ergot poisoning. I kept trying to put on music to calm myself but it seemed loud and like it would alert my roommates that something was wrong with me so I kept turning it up then down, the mouse making ridiculously long trails on my computer screen. None of my usually fully memorized favorite songs and album titles made any sense, and I kept going in circles on iTunes trying to find something, all the while becoming more and more disoriented and frightened. I kept picturing paramedics bursting in my room and shoving tubes down my nose, and my parents crying and standing over my hospital bedside. A part of me said no, Im not going to let that happen. Ironically my unstable window shades took this opportunity to come crashing off the wall and knock everything off my desk, making me trip over them in the process. Landing on my bed with low music playing, I laid there, trying to calm down and think what to do next to help myself. These strange sequences of action kept entering my head, like ok turn down the music. Now lay on the ground. Ok now pull out phone. Now try to find headphones. These very mundane actions helped me feel centered and not so totally freaked out. I fully expected either my roommates, the police, or EMTs to bust in my room any second. I kept thinking I was going to die, even knowing about the toxicity of LSD, and my mind kept flashing to what the last thing was I wanted to say to God to rationalize my short life. I stumbled to a notepad and started to write mom-I love you then crossed it out as it suddenly seemed completely random and trite. Was this really the last message I wanted to leave the world?  Instead I opted for printing in huge letters HOLY SHIT for some reason crossing the T at the bottom and making it look like an I. I was totally fucked up, the carpet was undulating and each object on my floor took on massive significance in what I thought to be the light of my last moments of life. Eventually I passed out on my bed for several hours when my crisis came to a pitch- I shut my eyes and tried to narrow my experience to the smallest amount of stimuli possible, focusing on my breathing. I guess this made me fall asleep because the next thing I remember was waking up around 6:00 pm, knowing the worst was over and thanking God and the spirits of the universe that I was alive and O.K. The trip was far from over, however, and the visuals were still going full force. My whitewashed walls were plastered with thousands of little amoeba shaped blobs each with numerous different bright colors contained within. I remember being stunned at the rainbows that seemed to form a halo around every object. By this time the sun had set, and turning on the lamps in my room sent cascades of crystalline light in all directions. With my totally ridiculous fear of dying past me, I was able to turn on my favorite music (A Japanese producer named Yasutaka Nakata) and enjoy the totally beautiful, ecstatic visuals that slowly died down, coming back briefly in waves until about 11 oclock.

In retrospect, I never thought I would have an acid trip I wouldnt be able to handle. I pride myself on my experience with psychedelics and voraciously read books, websites, anything I can about them and the experience we humans have with these substances. I was unprepared for the completely rapid and alien change my world went through in less than half an hour. I am mad at myself for freaking out, I contemplated calling 911 during the worst parts, and just imagining what could have happened had I done this sends shivers down my spine. A hospital is NOT where you want to ride out an acid trip. Reading this back to myself, I think Why couldnt I have just calmed down and enjoyed it?? At the time, this was impossible. My trip was like a freight train that gathered and gathered speed until I did the only thing I could-became unconscious. 

I hope no one gets scared or chooses not to partake of LSD because of this trip report. I love lysergic acid diethylamide, it is an unbelievably wonderful sacrament that has been bestowed upon the human race, and I truly believe that a direct experience of reality, beyond labels or concepts, could push the human race off the destructive path it is currently on. But I am beginning to preach

Background: I am male, at the time of this experience 24 years old and weighing around 128 pounds. I take no prescription or OTC medications, but generally use marijuana and yerba mate on a daily basis. I have also been using kratom frequently, about two to four days most weeks. I have extensive experience with psychedelics, everything from mushrooms, LSD, DMT and 5-MeO-DMT, syrian rue and caapi alone or in combination with the aforementioned tryptamines, hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, MDMA, 2C-I, 2C-E, 2C-B, Trichocereus cacti, sketchy blotters suspected to be DO-x compounds, Salvia divinorum, nitrous oxide, ketamine and DXM.

A friend had given me four hits of a new type of blank blotter acid to test out, reputedly from a different chemist than before. We have been doing a certain type of acid once a week or so, for several months. Thus I had become very used to the effects of legitimate LSD, at various doses. One hit to catalyze my mental processes. Two hits to feel the characteristic effects of LSD. Three hits to go deeper. Four hits for a trip to the moon. Five hits to be seriously, seriously confused and disoriented. Eight to twelve hits, to transcend the confusion and reach a much higher plateau of fractalizing goo. In other words, I knew acid, inside and out.

Mindset going into the trip: So I decided to take all four hits (5 X 6 millimeters each) of this blank blotter on a Sunday morning. The friend who gave it to me had not sampled himself (he almost never takes psychedelics these days), but he said that everyone he had given it to reported it was stronger than the batch I was used to. I did not consciously state an intention for this trip, but was just feeling kind of bored and thought four hits of acid would be a good way to liven up my day. I was confident taking it all would be no big deal, as I had taken five hits a couple days before and been a-okay. When I put the blotter in my mouth, it tasted faintly bitter and did not have the electric-tingly tongue feeling I get from legitimate acid. However, I did not think anything of it at the time.

The Experience: Right after dosing I walked down the hill with a couple people from my house, it was beautiful and sunny outside. After so much cold winter weather this unseasonal warmth was welcome. On the way down I began feeling somewhat detached. I concentrated on just being centred and grounded within myself, and not reacting to anything around me too strongly. I chose not to speak at all, unless specifically asked a question and even then my reply was terse. We went to a flea market which has some cool stalls. The community centre it was in had poor ventilation, and I was alerting and starting to come up. I felt very uncomfortable, people milling all around, and very aware of the funny smells in the building. Bad vibes. I quickly excused myself, saying I would hang out outside.

Once outside I felt a very nervous energy. There was a little joint in my pocket, but I didnt feel comfortable just hanging out calmly and smoking. I needed to walk! There was a strong stimulated feeling, a kind of nervous energy soothed best by physical activity. Without telling anyone, I just started walking around the neighbourhood. Taking residential streets, soaking up the sunshine. I felt a little guilty about having just wandered off without telling anyone where I had gone, but at the same time I felt I had to keep walking to ease the comeup energy.

The trees were beautiful, bare branches showing their growth habits against the blue sky. The elm trees in particular fascinated me, the fissures in the bark looking like eyes or faces. And the snow was melting and dripping all around, sparkling brilliant rainbow colours. I passed a house with colourful childrens toys, a little sled and toy shovel. Everything seemed more vibrant than before. The next house I passed had a decapitated seagull lying at the edge of the sidewalk. The head was nowhere to be seen, but the yellow feet caught my attention, pointing up at the sky. Pink and red tissue and a hole in the neck. Feathers were scattered across the sidewalk. I felt no revulsion or anything towards this macabre sight. Instead, I calmly noted that there was a dead seagull, thought that a cat probably got it, and continued my walk.

At this time I was beginning to notice some muscle tension. All my deep muscle tissues seemed clenched, tightened up. My shoulders ached, and my hips and legs felt a little stiff. My hands were getting numb and tingly. This happens to me sometimes on LSD, especially if I do not stretch properly first, or if it is cold outside. However, on LSD I usually only feel the muscle tension in the later stages of the trip. Usually the tingling hand effect is not this strong, nor does it come on this fast. I was a little perplexed, but put it down on being outside (not cold but a little chilly) and possibly taking a higher dose than normal.

I walked past a local coffee shop, in which a couple of my friends were hanging out and chatting. I stopped briefly when Dante came outside and hailed me, but again did not feel like going inside. Inside was too stuffy, too many people. Outside was kind of gross, dirty melted snow and peoples spit and cigarette butts all over the ground and flower planters. I was feeling a bit antisocial, saying I didnt want to hang out here, and was going to keep walking instead. Again, the vibes felt bad to me. I continued my walk, and a friend text messaged me from inside the coffee shop: Come back! I ignored the message.

I made my way to the nearby park, seeking a pleasant natural place to maybe smoke that joint. There was a lot of mucous building up in the back of my throat, and I started to cough frequently, spitting out the phlegm. Thats kind of weird, I thought to myself. I have hacked my lungs out before on high doses of 2C-I, 2C-E or 2C-B. Even on mushrooms. But usually I dont get this kind of body load on acid. Unless I am specifically tripping out about my body for some reason, acid usually has little to no body load.

Next came more coughing, and eventually I purged. What the fuck? I havent purged on acid since since that sketchy fractal acid blotter I took years and years ago (which I suspected to not be LSD but probably a DO-x compound). I still didnt make the connection that what I had taken today wasnt acid. I thought it was really strange, but figured my anxiousness, my desire to get away from busy roads and pollution was what had made me purge. Everything is possible, as acid is so much a catalyst of my mental processes.

After purging I tried sitting on a patch of clear grass, a little sunny spot on the hillside. Having quite the déjà vu, sitting here, just having purged just like that time I took 23 milligrams of 2C-E. The anxious need to walk around, the nausea, the way everything glowed vividly in the sunshine The coughing was still bothering me so I decided not to smoke the joint, and to continue homewards instead. Sitting calmly was hard, I still had that anxious, stimulated feeling driving me to walk.

Upon returning home, I put on a pot of tea and before the water had even boiled everyone else came home as well. They were a little upset that I had just disappeared and avoided them all, but the only one I told the real reason, was my girlfriend. I went through some intense emotions, feeling ashamed of wandering off and letting my friends worry about me. Feeling ashamed of taking acid in a way more recreational and abusive, than enlightening. Feeling ashamed of not being honest with my girlfriend and others about my actions, from the beginning. Recalling bitterly that, if I do not state my intent consciously and clearly, it means that my subconscious will run things for me. My subconscious chooses its own agenda, and I was enmeshed in my fears, anxieties questioning my self-worth.

I felt there was a barrier between my girlfriend and I, because I had not told her right away about taking the blotter. I felt very emotional about this and first had to clear my conscience with her. Once the barrier had been torn down, we attempted to make love. However my penis was flaccid, with too little blood flow to maintain an erection. This has never been a problem on LSD. Quite the contrary, LSD usually keeps me at a constant level of sexual arousal. Love making becomes cosmic, oceanic, and ecstatically transcendent. On LSD, we tend to make love many times until reaching the point of exhaustion. I have experienced flacid-penis-syndrome before with phenethylamines, particularly higher doses of MDMA or 2C-E. One more aspect of this blank blotter acid, making it feel different than the acid I was used to. Instead of having sex we just cuddled for awhile.

I was dragged out of the house by my two brothers (not blood, but I consider them to be my brothers). They were walking to the mall to find a new blender for the house, and wanted my company. I wasnt too enthused, but decided a change of scene would be good for me. That stimulated nervous feeling was still nagging me, and although I was already tired from walking so much before, more walking seemed a good idea. The muscle tension in my body was still pretty bad.

We walked along the highway to get to the mall, and everything was dirty, mucky and smelled of exhaust fumes. My nose was running, mucous production again. Damn pollution. We think its okay because it gets diluted in the atmosphere, and yet most of us live in the dirtiest and most polluted areas; in the cities, in other words. Meanwhile looking up, I saw jets were spraying chemtrails, in a nice cross-hatch manner to the planes that had sprayed earlier in the morning. The sunny sky was slowly being covered with a thin silver mist.

So kind of a depressing walk, but in retrospect the walk was pretty nice compared to being in the mall. Malls are fucking scary! All my senses had been heightened, and I was very aware of the little details. The subtropical heat, making everyone feel a little stupefied. The toxins making the whole building malodorous. The gaunt and vacant stares of the shoppers, anxiously searching for bargains. It was scratch and save days and a lady walked past asking her kids how much they had saved on their purchases. I saved 10%! said one daughter proudly. The other moaned, I only saved a penny. All three had the same chubby, fast-food figure.

I could hear the electricity buzzing around me. I could see the fluorescent lights flickering. Nowhere was there any relief to be found, no green plants or artwork to soften the consumerism. Desperately I tried not to let my glance fall on any of the products all around me. I didnt want to give them my attention. Stuff I dont want, stuff I dont need. My eyes found something that wasnt a box with a sticker: A sign on the wall said Area monitored by closed circuit television.

Star dragged us around the electronics department for awhile, then we got our blender and fucked off. Unfortunately not outside, Star was adamant on doing a tour of the mall. More gaunt faces, more vacant stares. A woman with four rambuncous children and a fifth in the stroller. All boys? Maybe the fifth was a girl I wondered what compelled her to have so many. Old people in wheelchairs, slowly rolling along. Everybody seemed drained of energy and depressed. What a fucked up place the mall is. We reached the gaming shop, near enough to the food court to smell that peculiar and unpleasant odour. What passes as food for those already drained of life force it will fill you up, without truly nourishing and replenishing. My sense of smell was through the roof, I could smell everything so vividly.

The walk home was nice, I was glad to be out of the mall and we took side streets rather than the main road.

Around 13 hours after dosing, I started to question the blotter. Why was I still having vivid hallucinations after thirteen hours? Why did I still feel just as high as after five hours? Acid would normally start to wear off after eight hours, and be nearly clear by twelve. Instead, I was seeing geometric patternings and such across every surface. The visuals were more reminiscent of cactus or 2C-compounds than LSD. Slowly all the little clues clicked, and I realized I had taken something other than LSD. I had taken some kind of phenethylamine. The nagging, dragging stimulation and lingering psychedelia had finally tipped me off.

PIHKAL came off the shelf and I browsed. I was pretty sure I had taken a DO-x compound and not LSD, since the DO-x are potent enough to fit on a blotter and are longer lasting than LSD. To me, this trip had a lot in common with 2C-I, 2C-B and 2C-E. It was longer lasting than even 2C-E, and perhaps with more of a stimulant edge. Otherwise I felt the effects were closest to 2C-B, particularly the coughing & mucous production, and the way I felt pushed to walk around so much, to ease the nervousness. Also, on 2C-B I got a lot of muscle tension like with this blotter. I had taken another type of sketchy blotter in the past, which was a much more mellow experience seeming more like 2C-I to me. That other sketchy blotter was nice material, but this stuff had a little too much body load for comfort. And so, I tentatively identified the substance I had taken today as DOB. I believe the other sketchy blotter I had taken was probably DOI.

About 15 hours after dosing, and with the aid of a couple doobies, I was able to go to sleep, however my sleep was broken and disturbed all night. I do not remember any dreams that night, whereas with LSD my dreams are usually more vivid and more easily recalled. The next day I still felt slightly altered upon waking but the feeling had faded by the time I went to bed the next night. The muscle tension stayed with me for most of the next day. I got a nice massage from my girlfriend, which loosened me up a lot but the deepest muscles were still clenched. I was worn out and slept soundly that night.

Conclusion: In PIHKAL it lists DOB as having a dose of 1.0-3.0 milligrams, lasting 18-30 hours. There is mention of muscle cramps and the strong stimulating effect. Everything I experienced seems to closely match descriptions of DOB. I would say that I prefer LSD to this substance. The body load was too high for me to be really comfortable. Taking all four blotters at once was probably not the best idea. If I had just taken one or two, I might have had a much more rewarding and enjoyable experience. The duration of the substance was a bit annoying, and I made poor choices regarding my set and setting. It wasnt a bad trip (I dont believe in bad trips, there are just experiences often learning experiences).

If I tried this compound again, I would do so at a lower dosage. I would take it early in the morning knowing that I would be tripping all day. I would put more conscious intent into the experience, perhaps planning to be outdoors hiking in nature to receive the full value of this substance. I would do it on a warm day, and make sure I was warm and comfortable while coming up, to help with the muscle cramps. But honestly I felt the overall tone of the experience was cold and harshly analytical, and I have no desire to seek this substance out. The body load was too high, and the mental effects did not make up for the body load.

There was a lot of these sheets of blank blotter floating around for awhile, and I went back to the guy who had gifted me my tabs and told him what I suspected it was, and urged him to be open and honest about what he was selling. Dont call it acid unless its LSD, thats just being dishonest. There will definitely be people interested in trying DOB. Im all about knowing exactly what you are taking.

My partner tried this substance out at a dosage of three hits, a week or two after my experience with it. She experienced the same annoying muscle tension as I did, and also the extremely long duration and residual stimulation of the compound kept her up and awake all night the day she took it. She agreed with me, that compared to LSD the body load was much higher and the mental effects were not as enjoyable. She has no desire to repeat the experience.

We had one other friend who took four hits of this same blotter and had a very rough trip. The effects lasted so long that she didnt feel as if she ever really came down, and again the cold, harshly analytical nature of this compound got to her. She struggled with the integration process for months, and needed lots of support from friends as well as some conventional psychotherapy.

The problem of substitution is unfortunately very real. What tipped me off was the bitter taste, the long come-up time (3 hours or more to fully come up), lots of body load (nausea, phlegm and muscle tension), and having a duration much longer than expected for LSD. Also getting flaccid-penis-syndrome was a dead giveaway that Id taken a phenethylamine and not a tryptamine.

BODY WEIGHT:

I had tripped twice before, taking 2 hits both times, and had experienced an overall pleasant and beautiful trip both times. They were only very mildly hallucinogenic (wavy walls etc). Because of this I was very enthusiastic about acid and felt cavalier about its use, thinking to myself that I wanted to try four or five hits the next time, and explore what I considered the peaceful world of LSD further. My third trip was the most insane, arduous experience of my life up to this point. I tripped for a total of seventeen hours. 

A close high school friend and I decided we should trip together during Christmas break in my hometown of 3 years, a Chicago suburb. I had brought five hits with me, and was eager to take them all, but my friend was having trouble procuring any for himself. Then I heard from a friend I had bought my acid with. He had split his five hits with a friend, and he described his experience as not in reality. He also advised me: Dont do five hits, you will die. This was enough to convince me to split my LSD with my friend T, and so around 8 at night we took the hits, put on a massive amount of clothes and began walking to Thatcher Woods, our designated tripping spot. 

It was a cold night and there were 3-4 inches of snow on the ground, but it wasnt an issue. As we were walking I began feeling the warmth of energy rising up and through me, causing me to laugh and feel intensely content, as had happened in my previous trips, and we were both very excited. Eventually we reached a suitable clearing in the woods, and sat down. The woods were beautiful and completely secluded. The energy flowing through my body felt more rapid, and then it was building and building and began whirling through my senses, which I perceived as a sort of bizarre dizziness. Then T pointed at the treetops above us, and I looked up. 

The trees were swaying animatedly, and the longer I looked the stranger they became. They began transforming into billions of detailed rainbow fragments put together masterfully, but then would revert back to some sense of normalcy in color again. The sky turned purple and began coming down towards me, overwhelming me. It melded with the trees in a glowing display, shrouding the trees which began resembling massive beautiful peacock feathers protruding from the ground. 

This already was more than I had imagined was possible to perceive, and definitely more than I was prepared to handle. I could feel shifting and a sickening peeling in my brain and I began panicking, muttering frantically and told T that I was very, very scared, and was having a panic attack. I suggested that he call for help, either parents or 911, but fortunately he had tripped harder than I ever had and told me to just sit and breathe for a second, which I did reluctantly (he added later that me telling him I was having a panic attack almost caused him to have one as well). I calmed down slightly, and the horrible sensation in my brain that had caused me to panic had ceased. Sitting there I could feel my mind blasting and firing away at a pace it had never even approached before. 

We began striking up an animated and basically nonsensical conversation about anything and everything. The entire world began existing in a rhythm which I could sense internally. I began speaking constantly and only in rhymes and rhythms, certain lines appealing to me in particular (e.g., majestic just got hit by the magic stick, moving through the groovy gravy, sipping on the world syrup). We began riffing off each other completely naturally, finishing each others sentences and thoughts, and (at least I) felt unified with him and the surroundings through this rhythm, this groovy gravy that the world was now immersed in. While in the forest certain things, sounds or movements, at times caused my entire body to spasm uncontrollably, as if my brain had been zapped. Though I felt liberated and overjoyed at the rhythm I could sense, incredibly unpleasant sensations such as the spasms and indescribable feelings in my head would come and go and it became very important to stave off these horrible feelings. 

For some reason I pulled out my phone from my pocket. Forgetting why Id taken it out, I was suddenly overcome by euphoria and threw my phone as far as possible. I saw its light illuminate as it landed. As I walked over to get it I could hear ice groaning and cracking beneath me (we had been debating for some time whether we were in fact sitting on top of a frozen river or not, although it had been much funnier before.) Frightened, I asked T to retrieve it for me. He did so, and gave it to me. I saw that it was completely mangled. When I tried to open it (it was a flip phone), it came apart. Id had that phone for three years. It had three years worth of friends, acquaintances, loves, ideas I had written down with text, even some rough recordings of musical ideas. Losing all this hit me extremely hard, and I was stunned. I felt intense despair and self-disgust at my recklessness, my pointless gesture of throwing the phone, pointlessly breaking what Id had for years. In my mind it was synonymous with the very basic action of disregarding and hurting people that you loved just to test them. I realized that my phone was named Oliver and told this all to T. While consoling me, he advised that I just let go. 

At that moment the concept of letting go took on not just letting go of my phone, but of anything transient. I suddenly knew that my entire life was just like my phone and that I was a speck, a zero dimensional point floating in an abyss. I began letting go. Bizarre alterations in my mind continued rapidly. When I voiced certain thoughts to myself, I found I could trace them back to some subconscious memory or lesson that I had, and I was able to analyze the cause of that thought, that fear, whatever it was, and if I chose let it drift away. For example, I was cynical about many things at heart and was able to trace that cynicism to an event that occurred when I was 15. I innately knew the reasons for aspects of my character and could trace them back to concrete memories, but was scared to let them float away and forever alter my psychic makeup. For what seemed like a small eternity I went off alone and sorted through fragments of my subconscious, which seemed to be floating through my conscious mind like flotsams in an ocean. 

Afterwards I reconvened with T and attempted to explain what had been going on in my head, but soon realized it was pointless to try. T understood the incomprehensibility of the situation perfectly however, using a John Lennon quote: A profound whatever. At that moment I felt a spasm in my head which seemed to be describable only as a profound whatever. Suddenly I knew that my life, all existence, was just a profound whatever, although over the course of the night more and more ways to describe that feeling popped into my head. I felt like all of literature and music and dance, etc was seeking to capture that profound whatever. I suddenly had this bizarre cognitive breakthrough that everything is everything else. Although it sounds ridiculous, I just knew it to be true during my state. All of existence was not just unified, it was all just one very detailed particle. 

We stayed in the forest for what seemed like forever, basically shooting the shit and engaging in hilarious yet rhythmically primal banter. I found that this banter was the best part of the trip, feeling intensely adept with language and amusing ideas which T was able to reciprocate and be a part of. This gave my swirling mind an outlet and comforted me that I was with another human being who I trusted. Eventually we left the forest with the vague plan of heading back to my house. 

During this walk we continued our cosmic banter the entire way. While walking there was a strange sensation that it wasnt T and I who were moving, but rather the entire universe was sliding by while we watched. Still, it was very important to keep our legs moving, as if on a treadmill, or the universe would just stop. It was euphoric and during the walk at certain intervals we would suddenly know that we had lost that round, but win bang go, we would win the next. Our conversation and actions would reach intense inspiring climaxes but could be lost in a second, and when it was lost I knew that I was starting existence over again, that little unique fireball of neurons was lost forever. It was like lighting fireworks and watching them flare, some of them beautiful and overwhelming. 

We finally got to my house, but I wasnt ready to go in. Instead we stood at my street corner (although I literally was incapable of standing still), where we continued rhyming and grooving. I began crafting characters and bizarre storylines which me and T became, such as Cheesy Steve, Friar Bobkins, Fruity Susan. I felt euphorically free to be and say anything at all. My hat became the symbol of all things good and pure in the world, and I would throw it on the ground, mock it, then be almost brought to tears and beg T to pick it up, that the world depended on it. I could detect language nebulas revolving around certain groups of words, knowing which words were in the same nebula by letting my brain feel them out. Italy and Sicily were the center of one nebula. Quiche and teeth were at the center of a particularly nasty nebula. 

I began flitting from different moments in my life and reliving the emotions and sensations of the times, going back years and years and even feeling a strong emotional connection to a period of my life in Hong Kong from 1st-2nd grade, when every Saturday morning my dad would drive me and my brother along the underwater highway connecting Hong Kong to Kowloon to play ice hockey, and I would sleep with a stuffed dragon in the backseat. Somehow I remembered vividly riding on the back of my magical dragon as it raced through the ocean, guiding me safely through the waters while I slept, and it was the most beautiful feeling to relive, regardless of whether it had happened or not. 

Eventually T grew tired of the cold and decided to go home. He had been hinting at it continually but I had just kept firing rhythm at him, and eventually he left. I was still boiling with thoughts and little segments of rhythm, but I forced myself not to talk to myself  I feared it would caused me to go spiraling into the madness at full speed. So I somehow managed to find my house key beneath all my layers of clothes, and went inside. It was 2 o'clock at night, which was incomprehensible to me it felt like eons had passed since I first began tripping. 

By myself in my dark house the trip became much more dark and frightening. I flitted about for a little, marveling at the purity of water among other things. Finally the craziness in my head became too much. I needed a human outlet, but I couldnt wake any of my family. I decided to use my laptop to find someone to talk to. I went into my room and booted up my computer  the screen made my eyes recoil at first, it was a writhing mass of colors and 3 dimensional activity, but I was slowly able to focus and use it despite the intense visuals. I went on Facebook and began talking to anyone who would respond. The typical pattern would be that I would spout complete randomness, they would have some confused response and then I would get bored and move on. In one online conversation a friend asked me how I was and I instantly without any premeditation replied that I feel like Im dying a million times while I laugh about how much I hate jews. I was scared to be alone and was trying to stave off that truth at all costs. 

I sent a few garbled emails* and then put on Bjork  it was amazing. The music was so pure, and especially the song Frosti, which hearing caused me to visualize a delicate, beautiful ice contraption. Songs were like human lives, they were so detailed and wide ranging, they were a journey, sometimes heartfelt, sometimes beautiful and serene, sometimes very clichéd and unimaginative. Everything was everything else, and songs were a lifetime in 3 minutes. The song Hidden Place (also by Bjork) made me love my room as I looked around and I began dancing but eventually settled into just watching my hands swirl through the air. I also scrutinized things I had hanging on the wall and was disgusted by certain things which I could so clearly see were just extensions of my ego, and tore them off. 

My room was where I settled down for the long haul, and tripped for another 9 tormented eternal hours. There was absolutely no possibility of sleep. I began going through the same wheel of emotions and feelings over and over and over again, until it was all like clockwork. Love, carelessness, anger, awe, euphoria, intense psychotic pain, it all came and went in a pattern that I knew was always there but hadnt been aware of. By the end I had experienced every emotion so fully that I was just weary from them and worn out by endlessly going through their wheel. I laid in bed clutching my stuffed dragon and listened to Bjork, and John Lennon (whos music I found was all completely in understanding of life on acid). I was still hallucinating. In particular my ceiling fan in the dark was constantly morphing, at one point becoming a powerful rainbow pharaoh glaring down at me. Closing my eyes was even worse though, as I could feel all my senses exploding and saw red fireballs and felt as if I was staring into my own mind. 

I spent a long time in the bathroom, just looking at myself. My ego was so destroyed at this time that I didnt even know who I was looking at. I tried to detect myself in my eyes but it was all futile and hopeless. I felt like a cog in a machine who had suddenly sprouted a consciousness and was now staring at itself, helpless to be anything but that cog. I tried to think about love and all of the good things but there were painful moments in the trip where it was simply impossible. Several times during the night I cried as the psychotic turmoil became too much and I pleaded to regain my sanity. 

There was still beauty, though. As the first rays of sunlight were coming in through my window they illuminated all the countless dust particles in the air, fluttering about, moved by unseen forces. These small particles also were lives, propelled every which way and completely without control. Nevertheless I was struck by their beauty as they whirled to and fro, in wonderful patterns. By this time there had been brief moments when the trip had lapsed slightly, and given me hope. But at 11:00 AM my brain was still blazing and there were still some visuals, and I knew that I needed to tell my mom. By this time I was genuinely worried that I would never in my life be able to sleep again, that I would have to be taken away, that I would never be normal again. I had seen too much and couldnt function any more. However, I somehow grasped that a mothers love was a saving grace of the world, an astoundingly beautiful thing that could help me calm down my mind. I hadnt told her I loved her in years and tripping rhythm had made me realize that I had to tell her, or I would never be at peace. 

I went downstairs, where my mom was reading. At first I acted normally and tried to eat some cereal, but could only manage a few bites. Eventually I made clear that something was wrong, that I was on acid and that I needed help. She sat with me and I poured out all my fears, that I had no reason to live, I had just lived longer than I ever wanted to in one night, that there was no point to anything. That we were all basically automatons griping about nothing and placing meaning into completely meaningless lives. She just talked with me and shared the same sentiments and told me not to think like that, and gave me a huge hug, and it felt so comforting and lovely to be back in her embrace after years of nothing more than basically formal contact. 

My younger brother came downstairs and the three of us began what I perceived as an immensely rhythmic conversation, much like the one during the height of my trip, and it filled me with a good feeling and a sense of being home in life. Finally my mom got some Nyquil for me as I had told her about my fear of not sleeping (although was a bit freaked out at the prospect of taking more drugs). For some reason it was very difficult to tell her I loved her. But once I managed it I felt a huge wave of relief wash over my mind and a new sense of wellbeing. My brain was still flying but it was winding down. I then lay in bed while my mom read to me, and finally at some point around 2 oclock, listening to Ben Harpers Welcome to the Cruel World, I managed to drift into a few hours of sleep. 

The trip was everything that exists in its extreme. It helped me recover my relationship with my mother, gave me a unique, enigmatic bond with my friend T and gave me a glimpse of the internal mechanics of the universe (at least, it felt that way). The cost though was the most alien, surreal and heart-wrenching night of my life. I dont think Ill ever forget it. 


*sent to a friend while tripping, to give a sense of where my mind was at: 

'Go'

On January 12, 2008, I had an LSD experience that would change my view on the world for good. More than just feelings of pleasure and pain, it had the sheer force of intensity to it, and my complete surrendering to whatever came along. My only desire being to see things for what they truly were.

Now this was around my twentieth trip on acid, and I had been taking it regularly, once or twice a month for about a year, thinking I had seen most of what the drug had to offer. It had taken me about five trips to realize that I was best when taking LSD alone in my apartment, apart from the raves, parties and night clubs which most of my friends would choose as a setting. Over the course of all this acid experimentation in 2007, I acquired a clear sense of direction and purpose in life, readjusting myself dramatically to the things I thought were in fact worth fighting for.

I quit a four year addiction to Klonopin, lost complete interest in alcohol, marijuana and tobacco; found my soul dwelling in the arts as I rediscovered painting and classical music. Actually, I quit my language course in the university to try a major in piano, realizing that I had spent my teenage years too fearfully to affirm my artistic identity, and that the track I had been leading would surely lead me to undeniable frustration. My hermitage also grew considerably and social interaction became an ever greater task, as I substantially found myself on another plain of thought and interest, I could no longer go out with my friends to just hang out, neither submit myself to any passiveness towards daily life. I felt like there was a bubbling, active volcano, erupting inside of me, pleading for artistic productivity and disciplined dedication to musical studies, and that there was no time to lose, no time to be spent fooling around.

I must also point out that three months after my first hit, I developed intense tracers, light and noise sensibility, a wavery vision in which nothing stands still for too long and some phases of stomach clenching anxiety. Symptoms I later related to what is called to be HPPD. There was something else I can only call enhanced thinking, as my imagination and creative powers sparkled to an unprecedented level of output causing me to put a lot of faith in the my artistic development as a whole. Interesting enough, as these HPPD symptoms sky-rocketed, my interest in LSD only grew stronger.

In January 2008, I acquired 8 hits of a blotter I had not yet tried. At about 10:30, on a sunshine Saturday morning, alone in my fourteenth floor apartment about 50 meters from the Brazilian coastline, I took one of these hits. And within 50 minutes I realized that something very different was at play, as reality began a slow and unstoppable path towards disintegration. The trip came 4 to 5 times stronger than I had ever tripped before, and the well known apartment which I had been living for the past three years morphed into uncharted, unexplored territory.

Now something inexplicable happens to me when I take acid that my piano and painting techniques burst ridiculously with expression, something I could never really match while being sober, and for that reason tend to have a frustrating outcome. But I never give up trying, having the drug showed me what Im capable of. On this particular trip, there was very little playing, no panting at all. I could barely move is most of what I can say. With six to seven thoughts in my head all at once, there was very little room for action or decision making.

As lunch time arrived, I grew increasingly hungry and headed for the kitchen where I spent the next two pain-tasking hours trying to prepare myself a meal. By that time I was being repeatedly struck with very different, contrasting emotions of great bliss and great sorrow. It was as if I was an actor being shoved with every possible role-play, and feeling beneath the skin all the possible emotions that human beings are capable of feeling. 

As the effects continued gaining in strength, I realized I would glimpse both heaven and hell, and the kitchen I was in was no longer a kitchen, but a swamp, with broad leaf petals and a misty, fog type atmosphere. As I looked at the garbage can, I envisioned multiple insect, worm-like creatures feasting on rotting food. And then suddenly, I could see my body, a pale-grayish body lying on dirt, dead, rotting as well, being feasted on by worms and flies. I felt my fleshy body intensely and took into account that my hands, skin, eyes, and all the fleshy meat that made me be would one day be eaten by these slow chewing worms, and that the lives of these worms depended on my fleshy meat, just as I depended on the ingestion of other living creatures to live as well. 

And then it hit me, like a bomb, like a surprising explosion of truth That if all life were to be made one, it must continuously feed upon itself to sustain its existence. Figuratively speaking, one must chew ones own arm to give ones leg the possibility of growth. I cannot blame mosquitoes for thirsting for my blood, no matter what conditions life gives us, its only natural that life wants to live, and itll move out of its way to do so, no matter the costs. 

With such ideas in mind, the meat and beans that I finally managed to serve on my plate had a different tone to them. Needless to say I rejected the meat, chewing on it felt like chewing on my own. I ate the beans or else hunger would have certainly sent me on a downwards spiral. 

There was a point in the trip in which the magnitude of the experience looked down at me from up above. I no longer had control of its directions and my ego was washed away. I didnt know who I was, and this feeling of a lost identity was frightening at first, but then everything all around was so abundant with endless streams of possibility, I didnt care who I was. The marvel of not being in character was just fine with me. And in that ego-lost state, I realized how the fabric of life was indeed the fabric of a dream, and ones life could be a good dream or a bad dream, but still a dream, made true by the endless life eats life cycle. 

At about 4 hours after ingestion, I felt utterly alive, with streams of vibrations flowing through my body, I could not really locate where my body was. There was a definite body-mind split which made me exist thoroughly in thought. And I felt like a kid about 4 years old, with a big honest smile on his face, longing for a playground, a place to play his life away. And playing gave life meaning, the joy of spilling energy for a cause that found purpose in itself, not needing any justification other than the sheer desire to play. I understood how important it was to be in peace with ones self in order to have a better life quality. The song they sing to us when were kids: Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merely, merely, merely, merely, life is but a dream., proved to take in tremendous amounts of wisdom.       

All along the experience, faces and gestures of people would flash in front of me. Id wonder who they were. Id have an infinite amount of empathy for the faces I saw, wanting to hug them, and pour myself into them in a great gesture of love. I would then see myself as a very old man, watching my grandchildren (or just kids in general) playing in a park or something, having fun. And I would feel like god, wanting to create a world better than our own, a place where more smiles and less suffering would be seen. 

About nine hours into the experience, I gradually started to come down and resumed creative activities, playing each note on the piano with great delicacy and love, music being made an essential aspect of my life. I felt as if I had survived something great, and had gotten a peak of something even greater. Most of all there was a prevailing feeling in me that there is more suffering in life than is made plausible, and that a lot of this suffering shows to no utility at all. I also longed for the impossible: the ability to not depend on other living beings to myself be and began to wonder if Id ever find a realm in which such was made possible. 

That night I did not sleep, I was not sleepy at all. The stillness of the late night hours gave a feeling that everything was in its right place, like a calm sea after a heavy storm, a feeling of harmony and understanding, that I knew my place in the universe and that there was nothing to fear. Somehow I believed that if the person I am role-playing while journeying on planet earth ever reached his fullest potential, this role-playing me would die a complete death, and the characterless, egoless me that embodied myself would gladly move on to a state of unbeing, or being on a realm not as harsh as than the one found on planet earth. 

Maybe life on earth is an acid trip in itself, with good trips and bad trips, pleasure and pain, and a lot to teach us about who we are and what were after. A real test of endurance not meant for the weak-hearted, but what all this striving is meant for... one must answer oneself. The meaning of life is most likely the meaning we give to it.

I began my trials with LSD in January of 2008. The first time was on a Saturday. I was home alone, and I was in a good state of mind. The only problem was that I had a few doubts about the source I had acquired the tabs from. They were younger distributors, and somewhat new to the business. I had no reason to doubt that their tabs were LSD, but some previous customers had complained they were slightly on the weak side. 

I slipped a quarter-inch blotter under my tongue. The paper was thick, almost like cardboard, and adorned with fractal patterns. It had no taste whatsoever. About forty minutes later my skin started to flush, and within an hour there was a nice full-body high, but only the slightest of visuals. A second tab was taken, and between two and three hours in, a hallucinogenic state flowered into being. There was some wavy movement of objects with my eyes open, and a profoundly increased level of detail in my surroundings, with intensified light, color and shadow.

After about four hours, the mental effects became more prominent. There were looping and wandering thoughts, somewhat reminiscent of the confusion produced during the onset of a mushroom trip. But there were also moments of lucidity, reflection, and clear articulation. Throughout the day, my pulse rate increased and decreased unpredictably in fluctuating cycles. One of the most distinctive and constant visual effects was a tendency of letters to 'wiggle'. In fact, words seemed to swim upon their pages, or whatever they were printed onto. It was beautiful to watch, but could be distracting if I wanted to read a book. The effect was constant, and long lasting: Even shortly before I went to bed, I caught the large blue print on the packing crate in the corner of my study rippling and echoing around the edges.

The effects seemed to be gone the next day, but for several days there was a vague sense that something remained altered under the surface. On one occasion I smoked some pot several days after the trip had ended, and acid-like visual and emotional states once again became noticeable. It was obvious that I was dealing with a powerful drug. The visuals were perhaps not as strong as I had expected, but they were very clear and crisp, with a unique beauty of their own. The mental state gave way to profoundly emotional twists and turns and a sort of mystical confusion. But I couldn't help but think I had missed something, that a greater treasure still remained to be unlocked. 

There were a couple more small doses that failed to deliver that missing element, and even a skirmish with bad prints containing a DOx chemical. Then I happened upon some new blotters that I had reason to believe were of the highest possible quality. It was time to finally get to the bottom of LSD's mystery, and I chose to do so with the company of a friend. 

In early March, I met up with 'C': A University student with similar interests who I met a few months back. C had previous experience, including having had the opportunity to thoroughly explore 4-AcO-DMT. He had expressed an interest in LSD to me, but before this day he had never taken a long-lasting drug. C is a 150 pound male in his mid twenties.

It was Sunday. C and I planned on meeting up early, but he got a bit lost and showed up shortly before noon. I brought him in, and introduced him to my girlfriend. She diverted her attention away from her cooking show and greeted him. I then showed him around the various rooms of my apartment, which I had recently decorated with a number of paintings and prints. 

We settled in the Study: A second bedroom that I converted into a place to manage my computer, my DVDs, my music, and my chemicals. He commented on the Perkinson print on my wall, a very colorful layout with a bird spirit beside a kachina doll. Then he surprised me with a very kind gift: Samples of some 4-substituted tryptamines from his own collection, suspended in a liquid-filled eyedropper bottle. I added the sample jar to my refrigerator. We talked for a few minutes: I asked him how he felt, and if there were any preparations he wanted to tend to, or any plans he had for the day. C decided to take a small supplement of L-Theanine as an anti-anxiety treatment to combat his trepidation. After that, he was ready. He had come prepared with bottled water and plenty of his own musical selections. We were content to spend the time indoors relaxing and simply see where things went. 

I took notes on a notepad once we got started. Before I share what happened, I would like to describe the acid tabs we were working with. These were bicycle prints, from Europe: Commemorating Albert Hoffman's bicycle ride and his first trip on LSD. They were highly-priced, yet nobody who buys them ever seems to complain. I could not get my source to divulge exactly what the dose per tab is. But in my estimation at the time, 250mcg per tab seems like it could be about accurate. Later, I asked my distributor to determine the exact dosage for me. He eventually talked to laboratory contacts who were involved in preparing the tabs, got back to me, and told me that the dosage per tab was 200 micrograms.

[Erowid Note: 
Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be done casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements were derived, it is reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.] 

This was our bicycle day: A day to discover the true power of LSD.

11:55 AM: C & I take 1 tab each and hold them under our tongues. There is a bit of a chemical taste.  It is not like the sickly-bitter taste of a DOx blotter, it is the metallic taste of a significant dose of lysergic acid. It washes away with a sip of water.

12:05 PM: I put on an album of relaxing music. C shows me a necklace he recently got: A silver serotonin molecule! Something I've seen many times before in pictures but never yet laid eyes on in person. It's beautiful.

12:30: We are very talkative. I show him a diagram of the LSD molecule online and discuss the differences between lysergides and tryptamines. Then the conversation drifts and we talk about the Dreamachines invented by Brian Gysin. I'd like to build one as a decoration for my home. C talks about how primitive stroboscopic light experiments like Gysins influenced more sophisticated light-flicker therapies that came later on.

12:40: We're still only feeling the faintest of effects. There's a little bit of chest tension, and we're feeling anxious, as though something big might happen soon. There is also a noticeable body high. But definitely no visuals.

12:50: We had agreed that if we weren't overwhelmed by around the one hour point, we would consider a second dose. Perhaps I didn't give as much thought as I should have to the unusual potency of these blotters, and the possibility they might take more than an hour to sink it. I go to my sheet and cut two more squares off with a pair of scissors. Soon we are tasting the chemical again while music plays behind us.

1:00: C is seeing rippling patterns with his eyes closed. I feel tenseness under my skin and a connection between my state of being and C's. I feel that the same energy is rippling through us both, what is behind his eyes and under my skin is the same force. Nobody else can understand my state except for him.

1:05: C puts his iPod on to listen to his own music. I turn mine off, finding that I prefer the silence. 

1:15: C is getting sucked into his own world now. He finds its easier not to talk. I cannot find a neutral state and I cannot ignore the fact that something enormous is starting to happen. Silence is very powerful.

1:20: C is completely swept away. So am I. It is difficult to speak.

1:30: There are still more closed than open-eye visuals. But the raw sensation of the drug is becoming intense. Our faces are flushed, and there are feelings of pressure against our skin. I see a flash of emotion appear in Cs face. I ask him, What are you feeling? He says, Euphoria. I wasnt expecting it, but its really strong. His face twists into a strange smile. So does mine.

1:35: I am stricken by a wave of anxiety mixed with mild nausea. The euphoria is deepening the substance seems to sink into every atom of my flesh. It is getting difficult to manage.

1:40: I wander into the bathroom and throw up. I feel better afterwards. I brush my teeth and wander back out to the study.

1:45: I play a song. In the chorus, the artist sings, 'And I puuuuuuuuuush your body out into space...' I close my eyes, and there I am: Floating in a great black void. The singer's words propel me as he continues: 'Let it go, watch it drift awaaaaaaaaaay...' and away I drift. Living the song, floating in space.

1:50: The song ends. I open my eyes and look at C. He looks very peaceful.

1:55: The substance is rising in intensity. It's not peaceful anymore. I am dumbfounded. C looks panicked. We are both starting to get dizzy.

2:00: I look into C's wide-open eyes. He is becoming overwhelmed. He looks at me. 'Oh Fuck...' he says. It is beginning to dawn on him just how powerful this thing is that he will be inundated with for the next ten hours. 

I respond to his outburst: 'Yes, I know. The world's not the same as it was yesterday, is it?' 

In a hushed whisper, C replies ...no, it's not.

The only thing that bothers me is that I cant define it. I cant explain whats changed about the world. But everything's changed. Its just too much to put into words!

When we close our eyes, we are met with kaleidoscopic swirls, abstract patterns, and bizarre flowing textures. C saw something that looked like fishnet stockings with eyeballs emerging from them.

2:15: C looks like he might fall over. He tells me he needs to lay down. He asks me to get him a blanket, so I run into the other room and grab my familiar black, red and blue quilt. C covers himself, saying 'I think I just need to go with this.' He closes his eyes, pulls the blanket over his head, turns on his music player and slips away into his own universe...

2:30: The substance peaks, and we are both awestruck. A great and terrifying realization is dawning on us. It feels like we are waking up to a greater truth. A truth that is extremely difficult to accept.

.....there are no timelines after this. There was no measurable time to make them out of. Only an eternity of awe. Awe, in a word, was the predominant effect of this drug. Why was a mature, intelligent graduate student grimly curled into a ball on the couch as hours slipped by? Awe. Why did I stare away for those same hours, never daring to say a word? I was in awe! There was a problem with communication from this point on. I wanted to define the event that was unfolding, as if to assign limits to its limitlessness. But most of my attempts at articulation got muddled.  It seemed like I was caught in an infinite riddle that threatened to destroy my thoughts as soon as they formed. 

Sometime after four, we broke our silence. Talking seemed a little awkward, almost forced. Each of us understood what the other was going through, but neither of us could really express it. C told me he understands how a substance like this is not addictive... because it is euphoric, but also very difficult. We talked about the pleasure, how it had gone so far overboard that it was difficult to endure. The chemical-induced joy was unlike anything we had ever felt before. We vacillated between wanting to embrace it, and hoping it would just end. C had on-and-off discomfort in his lower digestive track and frequently needed to urinate. He never got nauseous, though. He lost himself for hours at a time just listening to music in the darkness. Later he told me he felt extreme empathy and connection for all kinds of music. With every song he played, it felt like he was right on stage, hearing the band live. With every word and sentence that the singers spoke, he felt like he could understand *exactly* what they meant, on a deeper level than ever before.

We listened to a lot of music. Sometimes together, other times each on our own. It was always a delicate matter. The impact of the songs chosen was enormous, so there was no room for anything agitating. At one point I pulled C out from under his blanket and asked him what kind of music he was listening to. He explained that it wasnt really music, but a lifeline to keep him connected to reality. I agreed. I went back to my own playlist, and picked my lifelines very carefully.

At about Five my girlfriend got back home. She will soon be quitting this awful job that's got her working on the weekends, but they had called her in to do something from noon to five. I left the study to say hello to her. C was still in the other room, laying under his blanket in a state of rapture. She knew that C and I would be taking acid today but she had no idea what kind of an experience we were emerged in. Your pupils are dilated, she said innocently. Its an intense day, I explained. I took her by the arm and walked over to the couch to sit down. I had her tell me how her day had been for a few minutes, not wanting to comment on mine at such a critical time. There was a separation between us. C and I were locked into something that she could not begin to understand. It was difficult to connect with someone who was not drenched in the same energies as me, surviving the same situation. 

Before I walked back out into the study, I stopped to look at the painting on our living room wall not a print, but an actual painting from a little-known artist. It is a portrait of a French woman on a bicycle, with her arms in the air. The bicycle is perched upon the moon, and a dark blue sky is cast behind them. The blue crept with depth and emotion, the woman's face looking uncannily real. I could empathize with the character, feeling for all her rippling details. Maybe the lady who jumps with joy while lost in outer space could understand a situation like mine.

For the first half of our LSD experience, the mere concept of eating was unthinkable. Food became just a series of interestingly textured objects: strange things to be stared at but not consumed. We stayed well-hydrated all day, me drinking an endless stream of sodas while C stuck to bottled water. It was well past six when we finally managed to drag ourselves into the kitchen and swallow something solid. I had a couple of toaster pastries and a pork dish, and C baked a barbecued chicken pizza. He ate two slices of it while I went through half a bowl of pork both of us talking about how good the food tasted and how glad we were to be able to eat again. Then C put the remainder of a pizza slice down, proclaiming Jesus, now Im not hungry anymore! A mutual wave of physical intensity had pushed to the surface in both of us. I started to feel uncomfortable about the meat I had just eaten and could not finish my meal.

The concept of time became tougher to comprehend as the substance droned on in never-ending waves. How many times did we lose ourselves in a dream for an hour or three, sitting in music or silence, waiting for the energy to pass? Was it at Nine when we first started thinking the symptoms might be fading away, only to feel the energy rise back to the surface again at Nine-Thirty? It died down the same way it came on: In a complex series of layers that unfolded gradually. It seemed to be gone many times only to rise back to the surface, but each time it was resurrected one shade weaker than before. Was it the sixth time that it left when it finally stayed away? The ninth time? The fourteenth? Who could say. I was still affected by it even at midnight. C said he still had effects fourteen hours after dosing.

So how did this end? C went home a little past 11:00. His girlfriend drove by and picked him up. He left looking almost as shocked as he had looked at 2:30, and he told me it would take several days to completely process this. Afterwards, I recouped with my girlfriend. At first I couldn't talk directly about what had just transpired. I just wanted her to hold me close. Eventually I broke in by asking her, 'What do you think a spiritual experience is? What do those two words, 'spiritual experience', mean to you... how would you describe it? How do you define it?'

I had her tell me specific examples of times in her life when she felt that she had undergone spiritual growth, or felt a closeness with God. I asked her what the spirit meant to her. And finally, I explained that I had just had a spiritual experience of my own. I compared it to the times in my life when something had happened that forced me to change and grow. The times when something great or terrible occurred that shocked me so utterly, that I could not even function for days afterwards. It's after a shock that we discover who we really are. I cried. I told my girlfriend how gracious I was to be alive. How thankful I was for yesterday, today, and tomorrow. 

The awed silence that C and I experienced, coupled with that penultimate sensation of throbbing bone-deep euphoria to the point of bitter frustration, this was comparable not only to a shocking experience that induces spiritual growth. It was also comparable to being in the direct presence of a higher power. Imagine the feeling of waiting your entire life to ask God a few important questions. Then one day he appears before you, and he is so strange, so powerful and so beautiful, that you can't even dare to open your mouth. You can only stare in awe, knowing that the answers do not matter. That is a lot like the feeling I got from the energy of lysergic acid coursing through my flesh and blood into my soul. I was in the presence of something so much bigger than myself that I could only bow down in quiet appreciation, hoping not to disgrace the holiness of the moment. 

LSD is more than just a psychedelic. It carries the powers of many different classes of drugs in the space of a tiny droplet.  I could feel it in my soul, and I will never again doubt that the spirit is real. Lady Delysid... you are boundless!

This was only my second experience with psychedelics. The first was a mild trip on one hit of acid. My friend K (I will refer to people by initials), who has tripped several times on mushrooms but was as new to LSD as I was, warned me that we hadnt really been tripping. You can sense when youve crossed that threshold. It feels somehow sharp. You know youre in it for the long haul. This really didnt bother me much. My last experience had been so universally positive that it was hard for me to imagine what a difficult trip would be like. Ignorance is bliss, eh?

I couldnt have asked for a better day to trip. It was well into autumn and the leaves were all shades of brilliant colors, some on the ground, some still clinging to the trees. The day before had been quite cold, which had me worried Id have to trip indoors, but on the day I was to trip, it was unusually warm, almost like summer, but with a crisp fall breeze. The sun lit the landscape so intensely that it reminded me of my last trip. My friend T attributes days like this one to the Stoner God, a benevolent deity who blesses hippies and heads with nice days to trip on.

After eating breakfast with the four friends I tripping with, smoking a bowl, and preparing our trip kits, we set off toward the park. About half way there, probably around 11:30, we stopped at a bench to take our hits. I never cease to be amazed that so powerful a drug comes in such an unassuming package, and I mused to myself about this as I held the tiny peace of blotter paper under my tongue. My friend P knew several people who had tripped off of this same sheet and the word was it was excellent acid. P described the feeling you get waiting for acid to kick in as being like preparing to go on stage, and I recalled the nervous excitement and mental preparation from when I did theatre in high school. Everyone was in such high spirits from the weather, though, that I hardly thought about the acid, still in my mouth.

As we entered the park and headed up the trail to Lookout Point, our first destination, I started to notice the colors more deeply. I saw my friends slowing down and looking more intently at the trees and assumed that the sensation had hit them at almost the same time. P smiled and said, Do things like really bright to you? I nodded with a grin and he added, I think I might be tripping.

As we sat down on the giant rocks of Lookout Point, I suddenly felt a tightness in the back of my neck and a buzzing sensation in my head. I closed my eyes and leaned against the rock trying to calm myself, but my mind was chattering with odd disjointed thoughts and the tension had increased so that I kept trying to yawn. I realized that I felt cold, and I stumbled to my sweatshirt and jacket which I had discarded a few feet away. When I pulled them onto my body, I felt a tingle down my spine, and the fabric was pleasantly warm but oddly harsh on my skin. By the time I made it back to the rocks, my hallucinations had begun set it. With my eyes closed, I saw a magnificent spiraling fractal pattern radiating red and yellow shapes and symbols from a point that I sensed could only be the depths of my subconscious. (Incidentally, at a later date, I told a friend that my spirals always went counterclockwise, and he said his are always clockwise. We speculated that this may have something to do with left and right brain). When I opened my eyes, I saw the textures on the leaves and rocks seemingly smolder  they would ripple and darken, then peel away and send what looked like tracers into the air. Seeing me struggle, P asked, How are you doing, man? the last thing I remember saying for some time was, Everything is melting up.

At this point, I experienced what I would later learn to call ego-death, but the feeling was alien and unpleasant as I desperately tried to cling to my sense of self while the drug acted to deconstruct it. My mind felt fractured, as if I was existing is several places and times simultaneously. Cause and effect had lost all meaning, so I began to have disjointed memories with no sequential relationship to one another. This led me to believe momentarily that time itself was an illusion, and that each moment in my life was occurring at the same time. Questions like, Who am I? and What is fundamental? led to radical deconstructions of existence, because everything I thought could be abstracted one step further. I found myself flailing to find a sort of cognitive ground  some fundamental thought upon which I could base my experience. Time, space, personality, and causation had all failed in this, and lacking any reference point, my consciousness was a whirlwind of thoughts without context.

At some point, K looked at me and asked, How are you? I looked at him slowly and nodded my head. Words could not express how I was, so it seemed sufficient to give him the affirmative  yes, I exist. How I am is a non-issue, I just am. I also recall an odd moment of clarity in which I stressed to myself, This is only a drug. Even if its difficult, youll still come down eventually. In retrospect, Im almost proud of myself for having the strength of will to think such a thing in the midst of such a shit storm. After we had been sitting at Lookout Point for some time in various mental conditions, A, who was very familiar with LSD and more adept than the rest of us insisted that we continue hiking and make our way to the lake. P and K agreed, but I looked at T to find that he seemed to be struggling as much as I was, if not more. I tried to protest, but had difficulty speaking clearly. A insisted that moving would help me calm down and the group began moving.

She could not have been more correct, because I soon as I had a goal  something to draw my attention away from the madness in my own head, I began to realize that my surroundings were absolutely gorgeous. The ground was covered in a carpet of golden leaves that made the atmosphere seem to glow with an aura of the same color. The tree branches turned into spiraling tendrils of light that would curl themselves into circles before spinning off into the air, as if propelled by their own inner energy. The bark was bulging and rippling with dark craggy patterns. All of the trees looked like the ancient, massive treed you see in pictures of the primeval forests in Europe, except that the bark was crawling about and rearranging itself.

We stopped again to rest and immediately, I was back in the confusion of my own mind  stronger, but not yet in control. P said, We need some music, why dont you play your harmonica. I remembered that I had my harmonica in my pocket and I put it to my lips, hoping I would remember how to play it. I found myself unable to play coherent melodies, but I discovered that it was intensely pleasing and calming to me to simply inhale and exhale through it, producing the two fundamental chords.

On a harmonica, inhaling produces the V chord, and exhaling produces the I chord. V to I is the most basic cadence in all of music, tension and resolution. Some musicologists have theorized that moving from I to V represents leaving home, while the V to I resolution represents the return home. I was not actively conscious of this theory at the time, but I simply knew that this was the case. Exhale/inhale, V/I, tension/release, away/home. The duality implicit in the harmonica was like a revelation. Suddenly I knew the cognitive ground that I could use to understand my shattered reality. Everything exists in two states  dissolution and resolution, away and home.

In all things, there are two states
Dissolution and Resolution
Away and Home

This simple phrase became a mantra for me. At once, the madness of my experience collected itself into archetypal manifestations of this fundamental truth. I began to babble to P about my discoveries  the duality of all things, the cyclical progression from dissolution to resolution and back again, the psychological meaning of home. I was obsessed with the notion of home. I insisted that all of life is just finding home in the present moment, discovering the resolution of all tensions, psychologically returning to the first state of oneness, before moving back into chaos and repeating the process. At some point during this time, I had the bizarre sensation that P and I were shooting thoughts back and forth between our minds non-verbally, but these thoughts consisted only of sounds. I really cant explain this, but thats what it felt like.

After walking for a long time, we arrived at the lake. The size and brilliance of it completely overwhelmed me. As we wound around the shore line, I admired the plants around me, which had taken on a painterly quality  instead of continuous lines, they looked like bold strokes of color moving independent of one another. Finally, we found a shady spot near the waters edge and sat to eat. At that moment, I felt completely at one with the universe and my companions. I reached the conclusion that all life is really a manifestation of the same universal life-form. Realizing that this life would continue forever without me, I had no fear of death, though I felt fortunate to have been given a portion of this life to do with as I please. As I sat in perfect bliss, marveling at the implications of my insights, I realized that I was home.

After reading many of the LSD trip reports, I thought I'd add mine, which I feel illustrates pretty clearly the effects of a VERY large, unintentionally severe dose of acid. Take it as a warning, or an enticement, or just entertainment if you choose.

Summer of 1999, Highgate, Vermont...It was one of the last Grateful Dead shows before Jerry ate that fatal pint of Heroin Garcia. Two friends and I made the journey in my bedraggled hatchback. Now, we were not fans of the Dead, nor did we have tickets...what we DID have was a few paycheck's worth of cash and a powerful hunger for some good old-fashioned visceral experience after a summer of hard work. We hadn't been there ten minutes, having parked the beater back in a field which was rapidly filling up with freaks of all shapes and sizes, when we encountered a pale little hippie who asked if we'd been 'hooked up' with acid yet. Is it good? we naively asked. (Like he was gonna say no.) We gave him some money and he ripped us off a huge chunk of plain white, unperforated blotter- maybe half a sheet. In minutes the first couple were in our mouths as we wandered down the highway, watching this tiny town rapidly becoming the biggest city in the state. 

Half an hour or so later, J was expressing skepticism about our purchase...It was too cheap, it didn't taste like anything, we didn't feel any tingle in our mouths or stomachs yet...'I think it's fake,' he said, 'or really weak. We should just eat it all.' What the hell, I thought, he knows more about this stuff than me. We offered some more to B, but he was more interested in finding some mushrooms. So, down the hatch it went; ragged chunks the size of postage stamps or matchbooks. 

It was probably only fifteen minutes or so later that I noticed a fly buzzing around J's head. A fly which grew to the size of a ping-pong ball, turned red, then, blue, then multiplied into a cloud of giant flashing flies which sounded like a chainsaw. 'I don't think it was fake...' I said to him, and he turned to me with pupils already swelling towards dinner-plate proportions, and grinned like a dog eatin' bumblebees.

Well, what followed was a full THIRTY-SIX HOURS of madness. There are two things I am eternally grateful for; the acid was not only strong as hell, it was clean as a whistle and I never experienced more than a twinge or two of physical discomfort. Second, we were in possibly the one environment where, screwed up as we were, we were practically blending into the wallpaper amid 150,000 or so other bits of human flotsam and jetsam. There's no way I could describe all the outlandish, incomprehensible things I felt, saw, heard and experienced there, but a few deserve mention.

At one point, probably six hours into the trip, I decided that I just needed to leave for a while. Just go away, into the woods, AWAY from this seething mass of lunacy swirling around me. I walked into the edge of the forest, into a little sunlit glade filled with white flowers here and there. Ohh the relief I felt! here was a perfect spot to lie down and grab ahold of the fraying edges of my sanity and...wait...that's not a flower!! I had stumbled into a shithole. The white flowers were wads of toilet paper that had recently wiped some dirty hippie's ass. THERE WAS NO ESCAPE. The crushing blow struck me between the lobes and i was paralyzed, stark still for several minutes. Then I pulled myself together and plunged back into the howling, gibbering carnival of humanoid creatures which now spread out for miles and miles. I knew I had no choice but to surrender myself to it.

Later, I reconnected with J and B (who had indeed found a gigantic bag of mushrooms) and we locked ourselves in my car for a while. We turned on Nine Inch Nails and rolled up the windows in a desperate bid to block out our surroundings for a bit. J and I had a full on conversation about our situation without opening our mouths; this is not a myth, folks, it IS possible. I later saw him hackysack in complete darkness for thirty minutes without dropping the ball. B was throwing handfuls of caps and stems around the car and drooling. He was not able to participate in the conversation. The trees outside, tossed by the wind, were a wriggling electric frieze which screamed and vibrated at an impossible pitch.

It was about this time that I realized, as I looked in the rearview mirror, that I did not know my name or anything at all about myself. I literally had no idea who was staring back at me. Ego death, i believe they call it...It should have been terrifying. Instead it felt wonderfully liberating. It gave me the freedom to concentrate on other, more important things. Things like the sentence I was hearing over and over in my head, drowning out even the buzzing screams of the trees, a sentence not in English or any other earthly tongue but in some older, more primal language. I could never attempt to transcribe it but to this day, if I concentrate, I can hear a faint memory of it. This sentence goes around and around in a vast wheel, a carousel or Ferris Wheel of light, sound and knowledge. This sentence contains every bit of information that has ever been and will ever be known to man and to God. I realized that if I could just figure out where to put the PERIOD, where to make it stop, I could read it out clearly and thus would become the most knowledgeable, powerful being in the universe.

I have no idea for how long I rode this wheel, listening to the sentence repeat and blend and swirl around me, desperately focusing on finding its beginning and end. At some point I realized that if I did not stop, I might never be able to get off of the wheel. Some blessed part of me recognized a potential future life at the Shady Acres Home for the Incurably Psychotic, and forced me to jump off. When I landed it was dark and J and B were gone. There were huge fires raging out in the human wilderness and electric snakes shooting through the sky. I set out again into the chaos, with my name and identity now recovered, and had a blast.

Two days later when we finally woke up from a few hours of cracked and broken sleep, at four a.m., we fled the vast metropolis of Highgate, where two hundred thousand residents had loved, fought, fucked, died, and created a complex society complete with its own economy. The car was strewn with camping gear, spilled beer and coffee, and littered with mushrooms which we did our best to collect before getting on the highway. When I got home that day and emptied my pockets, I had about eight packs of cigarettes, a big ball of opium, a chunk of hash, some microdot pills I couldn't identify, some mysterious feathers, and a scrap of paper with a scribbled circle on it. The 'wheel' didn't look quite so amazing anymore...I laughed and we went swimming naked on the microdots in the glorious August sun.

I've taken acid a couple times since then, but never has it done much for me...I just kinda get a 'been there, done that' feeling; like it has nothing left to offer. I'm certainly not suggesting that anyone go out and gobble twenty or more hits of Fluff. I'm actually very thankful that I emerged from this as an intact, sane entity. So, I guess the lesson is that even if your smart-ass friend tells you to eat it all...give it a few more minutes, O.K.?

LSD (2) : Multi-Day Experience (13), General (1), Festival / Lg. Crowd (24)

LSD





One day my father told me it was time, and some months later when we both were ready I took him off to a small cabin in the mountains, to escort him on his first acid trip. For years I had thought about introducing him to LSD later, in preparation for his dying. But Harold came to it sooner in his own growth, without my urging, which made me doubly glad to share the occasion.

I was more his escort and witness than an active guide. During his trip, I mostly managed the music and gave him the reassurance of my presence by infrequent responses, staying out of the way. A few times I was more directive, pointing him toward a deeper level when he got stuck in pre-pubescent memories on the way up, and suggesting strongly that he had choice about how to reintegrate what he had learned, while coming down. But basically, it was his trip: he had set its contours up and prepared himself, and I just watched it happen. The most active useful thing I did was take notes, which helped him later to connect with his experience.

The day before he tripped we had a lazy lunch together, and then relaxed for hours as I drove him up to the Sierra to find a place of peace. Night was falling as we got to the cabin; I made a fire, and helped him to prepare his space. Over dinner, we reminisced about the many years he had watched his children at their psychedelic rituals, and how he had come to his own. I teased him a bit about having had to attend a seminar with Stanislav Grof, the noted researcher, to finally give himself permission. He said the seminar had clarified things for him, as it had; and we turned in early.

In the morning I fed him a good breakfast, laced with extra C and E vitamins to buffer his body against its coming stress; and watched him check out the eyeshade he had chosen, the headphones, and the music he had programmed. To find good acid, in those days of scant supply and shoddy synthesis, had taken me months, for I wanted the best for him. I talked of the search and of the lore of its use again as he held the small blue tab in his palm, and probed him again for uncertainty and fear. But he was clear, and we said the ancient toast together: 'L'chaim!'

After he swallowed it, I got the axe, and took him out for a walk to gather wood -- to give his body motion to rest on, and to complete his ritual of preparation. We carted the manzanita faggots back, stacked them inside, and said goodbye to the morning. By then the first tremors of strangeness were rising in his blood, and we laid him down with his eyeshade on, wired him up to sound, and got on with it.

Though I had brought him to a place of good vibes where he himself had spent a night of magic once before, I almost blew it at the start: for between our walk in the cold and the mattress we lugged inside, dense still with winter night, his body took a chill that blankets and the roaring fire beyond did not dispel. It took me an hour to recognize how truly cold he was, insulate him on sleeping-bags, and turn him on his side open to the fire to thaw, kicking myself for my negligence.

Fighting the clenching of his muscles against the cold kept him down, and for much of this first hour his awareness was mainly in his body. As he lay there blind inside his eyeshade, hearing only Bach through his headphones, the outer world withdrew and he began the inward journey, feeling out the marvelous discreteness of the individual muscles, exploring his nervous system. As he warmed up, he stopped confusing the neuronic twitchings and explosions with cold-reflex, accepted my counsel to stop fighting them, and let them take his body -- which jerked and throbbed for hours, sometimes in violent rhythmic motion.

As his body let go, he was carried deeper into the experience. The sitar's notes in his earphones, 'random and colorful', took him to the five-and-dime stores of his childhood to stand before their shelves of a myriad gaudies, and took him into the quality of experience newly minted in exquisite detail, discovered through the eyes of the child still live within him. He wandered out eating chocolate kisses and through other scenes of his youth, feeling his hairline change as he grew from three to thirteen in half an hour.

'How little is really your own,' he said, 'the color and texture of a particular little fragment of bone.' And with this, he began to experience the qualities of substance. At first it was simply the substance of this material world. He spent a long time being eleven in Chicago, a young boy out on the prowl, discovering -- in the slag heaps and coal mounds, rusty iron and broken glass, all the detritus of urban earth -- the stuff from which his world was made. Worn rags and boards, a sense of materials wearied by wear, become thin, greasy, dull; and a sense of wonder at how impoverished his life among these had been, and how uncelebrated.

I took off his pants to leave him naked under the covers, stoked up the fire, urged him to go deeper. Explosions in the cortex, the brain-stem. He began to be aware of the flesh of the universe, and saw these qualities of matter as its qualities, perhaps from an underlying sense of the wear of his own matter, his sixty-one year old frame. He spoke of 'the worn, grimy, re-used material out of which reality is constructed.' Yet what caught him was not the small pity of it all, but his realization that this thin worn fabric 'has no reason to be, except someone once put it together ... and so much had to happen to the raw material of all this, before it could take these forms!'

But what was there in the first place? 'There must have been something, some clarity of purpose .... ' As he wondered, he began actually to feel it as 'a crystallographic intelligence.' I said softly, 'Is you speaking of her grace the Shaper?' without lifting his earphones to let him hear me, and did a little dance of glee unseen -- at his making contact, and at all the ironies. My daddy the lifelong atheist, my daddy the Marxist materialist, now plunging headlong through Hegel's echo into the true dialectic. My father, who strove for forty years to write simply and clearly of the workingman's bread-and-butter struggle in his union newspapers, here a journalist still, opening the mouth of his distant body every now and then to report precisely on transcendence, on 'states of being and of awareness, and their interplay' in disjointed sentences, lucid and poetic, and elegant with metaphor, so much so that later he cried out, 'I'm not entitled to such extravagance of concept!'

As the full effects of the acid took him, his rush went on, carrying him inward towards the Light. He began to know the qualities which underlie the qualities of substance. He saw the universe as glass, crystalline and discrete, gloriously multifoliate yet unrelenting in its angular quality. This perception was shadowed by personality, for also he was reading out his sense of his own self, a constant expression of sharp edges in argument, whose monotony made him sad as he realized 'how much of the space of a lifetime has been used on the angularity, the hardness and verifiability of things.' He was still in touch with all the shattered metals of his childhood in Chicago -- indeed, his awareness was working on all these levels simultaneously, so that their metaphors reflected and penetrated each other, making something whole of all the planes of reality, as it is.

Then he became aware of something new to him -- a dynamic within the crystalline, a soft and flowing quality -- and discovered that he was this too. 'There's all this space between molecules!' 'Right!' I yelled. 'And something in it!' 'Right!!' 'Something strung like embroidery, gathered in accumulations of meaning ...' He savored the polar qualities, invented his own names for them, repeated the names in incantation: 'the angularity of crystal, the sinuousness of vapor;' and then realized, 'There's a sense in which all this is manufacturing itself, all in a harmony, a quality of tension between them.' And with this phrasing of the Tao-poles he went beyond, into the state from which all reappears. He was all, knew that he knew directly the total history of each least tendril of the energy that makes what is. Or so I surmised from my own experience, as he was silent for half an hour, leaving only the buoy of his last assertion to mark the depths he was exploring.

'How hard it is to make this energy take shape,' said the god in him, rounding the bend to return. His nearer levels speculated amazed: these forms of self and world we know are almost arbitrary, what would happen if we let go of the belief or act of will that keeps them as they are, what shapes would it all assume beyond 'the first purity that inhabits it all?' As reintegration proceeded, he felt himself becoming the Ten Thousand Things of the Taoist universe; and then as it went further felt the skeins of Harold's personality recondensing in their complex tangles. So much was coming back to be the drab worn angular stuff it had been! He wept.

It was time to intervene. Lifting his earphone, I told him that it was all his, and that he could choose to remake a different balance in the skeins. He worked at this, and after a time recognized more of the sinuous in what was recondensing, felt its play in what was still largely angular, still not fully warm, but somehow less dull and impoverished than it had been during all the wasteland years.

And he was happy with it. 'If I have to have substance, this is the form I want it to take, this boundary between the crystalline and the flowing.' He felt like something stuffed into a sausage or sock, full and bulging oddly. His bladder too was bulging by then, five hours after dropping. I tried to get him to pee, he couldn't; but soon his reinhabitation of his body had progressed enough that I judged it time to reintroduce him to the world. I announced it cheerily, checked with him that he was ready, lit a candle, doused the light, and took off his headphones and eye-shade.

Going up, he had seen himself as an old scrap of bone. As he blinked around the room, I handed him an old scrap of bone to focus on -- a fragment of deer antler, cracked to reveal the core of osseous fibers, delicately and intricately structured for use and from use. The commonplace, the trivial tawdry, revealing itself to him as beautiful-of-the-world, weighted and numinous in the qualities he had come to know. Grasping it clumsily, like a newborn bird he fixated on it for nurture. 'He' was only partly there yet; toward the center, he was still subdividing the animate and inanimate, and down here at the end of the tendril of energy he saw the fragment both as branch and bone, and as his flesh.

When he was well-bonded with his talisman, I put pants on his ass, a coat on his back, and levered his stumbling carcass out the door to the porch. Pushed to the distance, the clouds banked a narrow sunset, aglow in dark pastels. The wind was icy after heavy rain. We unzipped. I rested mine on the rail, he of the 26-inch inseam held his underneath it, and we peed off the porch together -- as we did at the toilet thirty years before, but now with the order reversed, his tinkle coming as mine was well along. Even so, I was two again, feeling that primordial pleasure, feeling what he was feeling anew, in yet another vivid flash of contact high.

After this blessing of the earth, the flesh, our kinship, we watched the sunset for a while, at one with its mundane perfection, ever-changing; and exchanged platitudes about it, savoring the freshness of their meaning. Then I tried to take him out for a walk, to ground him more fully in the world, in his experience as an animal on this planet. But he was still just re-establishing control over his mechanism, and simply wasn't enough back in his body yet to make it walk unaided on the ground. Night comes early in the winter mountains, so I lost the chance. But between bone and sun I figured he was well-oriented, and I steered him back up the stairs.

For six hours more, till midnight, he came down from the peak experience, digesting it -- mostly in silence, self-absorbed. When I removed his mask I stopped being his memory, and soon withdrew from the rest of tending him, after I blessed him with a ripe persimmon and spread the rest of the simple table for him to glory in, discovering earth's luscious fruits. Now simply his companion, I ate too, talked a little, but mostly left him to his own inner processes, going out to walk the dog for my excuse. I was a bit spacey and drained myself from the hours of attention, and when I came back I spent my time in the music and my body, beginning to integrate my own experience, as he was integrating his.

His was not a detached, retrospective integration. As his body slowly metabolized the drug, he was still in tenuous contact with the primal melt within; and all the levels of its substantiation continued to work within his consciousness as it ever so slowly cooled down to what we call normal. For most of the evening he watched the fire, which I continued to stoke with the hot-burning manzanita chopped that morning. One limb in particular he saw as human, a child's; felt as his own. Holding the antler talisman, in organic sympathy of wood and flesh he lay and watched the limb being consumed by the fire, lived its changes to ember, knew himself in this, felt his substance used by the process of life, the child becoming an old man. 'It is,' he said, 'and I'm surprised, I don't regret it,' with perhaps a changed perspective on the worn, though death had never scared him.

Infinite in gradations of grey, he saw the small fireplace's angled walls as a temple, watched luminous colors dance within, absorbed its warmth, and at last began to cry. 'For the first time I think I understand why Betty wanted a fireplace,' he said, and recalled all the years he had reacted to it as inessential and expensive, alien to his understandings and desires. This brought him to consciousness of the might-have-been-but-was-unable that grew to break their marriage; and then to the body of love for her that still is live within him. He struggled awhile with this, accepting its weights, not yet clear to a sorrow without regrets, and then moved on, integrating this too.

The candles died, the last log flared on the high-banked embers, I drifted off snuggled beside him under the sleeping-bag, woke at three to find him soundly out, put on some more wood to cut the dawn chill, and fell asleep again. At sun-up I found him gone, out for a hike in a world crystalline with frost. When he returned, we tidied the cabin and packed, and got the car stuck in the old cattle-grate, had to tear home in record time to get me to a meeting. Once we hit the highway, I gave him my notebook, and for eighty miles we went over the experience page by page. Most of what I'd recorded, and all the deepest stuff, he had already forgotten or repressed.

As he read it came back, not fully but enough to accept as his own. 'A pretty metaphysical drug, huh?' I said, and helped him sort out the progression and relation of the different levels of his consciousness as the notes revealed these, confirming from my own experiences the reality, or at least the relative universality, of his. As is usual the day after tripping, he was somewhat punched out in his body, with a coupled depression of spirit. I offered him a frame to understand and deal with this; and we talked again about what it meant to his old rigidity, to recognize emotional states that couldn't be commanded. By the time we hit Berkeley, I had told him what little I know about how to integrate all this in everyday consciousness, about what choices there are. I was only half an hour late to my meeting, and he went home to rest.

Commentary  (1972,  revised) 

Dad had the kind of trip I'd hoped for him. Much contributed: good acid, good environment, good company and fair tending. But the deepest contribution was his own. Ever since I did morning-glory seeds in 1964, he'd been close to people going through psychedelic ritual. All along he had been going through slow and painful changes, to his depths, influenced by his children but in his own way. Venturing nothing rashly or quickly, he came to acid in his own time, prepared by some slowly-growing sense of inner certainty. I had no fear for him; he searched himself for fear, felt almost apologetic at not finding it, and I believed him, he was ready. What he will do with the experience, where he'll go from it, I have no idea. While we were driving home he said, 'I think I won't want to take acid again.' I asked why. 'I took it to learn something. I think I've learned it.'

And what of me? Harold had deep feelings about my being the one escorting him in this initiation. He bespoke them now and then, I signaled that I understood, and we let it go at that. Not out of shyness, which isn't our custom. Rather, the whole trip was like that, almost accepted as mundane, special but sandwiched in between our other schedules of special and busy things, nothing to make a fuss over. Still I have my feelings about it, however casual we were in making the arrangements. What a high honor, to help my father come to share experience and perspective so precious to me! We do not push each other but attend over time; and here many years of slow sharing came to a fruit. I was glad for him, and for myself in having him as fellow-traveler: all the way home it moved me to delighted laughter.

The deeper things I can't say compactly. How it is to be his son and then in turn his father in leading him through things I have grown through; and then again his son, as he models for me in his late and painful growing what it is to be his age and still alive -- all this at once, endlessly and joyfully reflexed into itself, who I am who he is. How fortunate I feel that it has worked out so, with our lives and beings thus intertwined, a closeness that has fed and not imprisoned, ongoing and so rare.

So, well, I guess I'll start from the begining and tell this whole tale in a linear sort of way, complete with numbers on a clock, distances, and so on. This is how I remember it all, and it's surprisingly fresh in my memory too. Be forewarned, however, that it probably won't make much sense to the outside observer - you had to be there. But back then in the heart of the immense maelstrom it made perfect sense, the bizarre logic was pure and simple and undeniable. It was, as I would say near the end of the ordeal when I began to regain my grip on reality (or rather normalcy), as if someone had stretched reality - space and time - to the size of the entire Universe while at the same time crushed it into something the size of a marble, and then, in the end, obliterated it all completely. But it was more than that. It was a journey into my inner-universal depths where I was taught, firsthand, lessons of a lifetime. It was as if someone froze one millionth of a milli-millisecond of time in my brain and one millionth of milli-millimeter of space in my brain and crushed it into a miniscule bubble where I could explore freely, all while they stretched it out across the entire cosmos. And it was all in my mind all along. This whole affair didn't really teach me anything new, it just let me experience the knowledge of my brain first hand.

It was decided, T and I would take the acid on Saturday afternoon. We'd talked about it for a while and concluded that it was worth a try. So we made our intentions for the journey clear and awaited whatever it was that would greet us on the other side of the drug we slipped into our tea. I must say that is was both nothing what I expected and exactly what I expected at the same time. My intentions, though, are what made it what it was.

~part1~	
we drank our tea spiked with three sugarcubes of LSD and waited. At first I wondered if it would work at all. Maybe the sugar had broken down the chemical already, making it useless. Maybe the sugarcubes didn't really contain any LSD at all, although I was pretty convinced against that idea recalling the strange undefinable  taste the tainted sugarcubes left in my tea. Time passed anxiously with no signs of what was to come. I took off my watch, not wanting to be bothered with the analytical thoughts which usually fill my mind. Time still crept slowly on. I began to see reflections in T's glasses more clearly; was I beginning to trip or was this me being hypercritical of my thoughts, overly aware due to the anticipation of real visions to come? The candle on the table flashed out of the corner of my eye and when I looked at it directly it seemed somewhat brighter, more luminous. I got up from my seat on the floor feeling strange sensations in my body, mostly my legs and an upset stomach, and decided that a chair with some back support would be desirable. I sat across from T and we talked. She seemed miles away, though there was probably only five feet or so between us. She had an upset stomach as well, so she put her hand upon the disturbance, claiming that her hand felt incredibly warm. I decided I had to go sit with T on the couch. 

Moving my legs to walk over felt somehow foreign, but I bridged the gigantic gulf between us with relative ease quite quickly. We sat together and hugged. T put her hand on my stomach and it felt incredibly warm and comforting, 'like a heating pad' I mentioned. Nikido, T's cat, wandered in looking for some affection. It rubbed up against us and wanted to stand on my knee, but I soon became anxious with the cats presence on my body, in my energy field, and had to shoo it away. It stood for a while at the end of the couch and eyed us curiously, obviously knowing something was up. We told Nikido it was okay, we were just experimenting. She seemed okay with that. I began to see T and Nikido and I as living beings. Yes, I could instantly tell the living beings in the room apart from the inanimate objects; there was a strange aura around us three, a faint grey shroud covering our bodies. I watched the ceiling for a minute, the patterns from the paint moving slightly, a queer optical illusion. We sat together for a while but I began to feel antsy, my body was bursting full of restless energy. I stood up and walked around the living room. 'My legs alternatingly feel weightless and then all of a sudden leaden like they're made of sand,' I told T. 

I began noticing ever so slight changes in perception. I remember wondering if this was it, thinking I had expected something far different, something more, and I began to desire a deeper experience - I wanted it to be more profound, not just some silly optical illusions. That's something I grapple with in my real life too, the desire for more more more, instead of simply relaxing into the present experience and enjoying it for all its beauty and magnificence. T and I got thirsty and headed to the kitchen for some water. We both held our water glasses tightly, and I over the sink. 'I feel like I'm gonna drop this glass,' I told T. She laughed and held her glass tight. We talked more about this and that as the visuals became stranger. T said she saw some sort of mask in the window across from hers. I couldn't see the mask but I could see the bricks in the adjacent building moving in and out of the wall. I suddenly had to pee. I left the kitchen and headed down the hall. I was only gone for a minute but it felt much longer and I was very anxious to get back to T. Washing up I saw my face in the mirror and it appeared much more round than usual, a great sphere. I saw every pimple on my face magnified and some began to erupt like volcanoes. The same self-consciousness (though even more intense) from my everyday life hit me, but, thankfully, it vanished after I looked away and headed back to the kitchen. 

I suddenly felt extremely cold and had to put on my sweater. T began explaining something to me which I cannot now remember and, in fact, I don't think I was listening very well. It was becoming increasingly difficult to consciously focus my attention on any one thing, though when my attention was focused it was my full attention and I could observe things more thoroughly in ways I never could before. A half opened cupboard door looked like it was swinging towards me from out my peripheral vision. I turned sharply and it stood still. I closed it tightly. 'It's getting kind of hard to speak straight,' I told T. 'It's getting tough to turn thoughts into words, the ideas all get jumbled up in the process.' Then, 'it's quite a process turning abstract thoughts into concrete words. Thoughts and words are so totally different but they need each other for the sake of communication,' (though probably not quite so wordy). T had to go to the bathroom (I think) and I decided I liked the living room a bit better than the kitchen so I sauntered on in there. The happy birthday balloon I had picked up earlier became a great toy, bouncing it off my hand, observing its weightlessness. Every time I hit this up in the air its a new feeling,' I thought. 

Someone walked outside for a smoke and I saw them through the window. I watched her go about her business, this strange human ghost of reality, and felt as if I had to hide, she could see me through the window. I ducked into the corner and marveled at her wordly confidence mask as she acted out her life. After she went back inside I watched another person brush the snow off their car while they pretended to be confident, self-assured. T came back into the room and we bounced our blue balloon back and forth. I explained the incident with her neighbour to her. 'That's kind of like me in my life.' she told me. 'Both literally and figuratively.' 'It's funny how we all hide within ourselves sometimes and are scared to let others see what's inside,' said I. We discussed this fear, this self-doubt, for a minute and it felt like we were really resolving these issues within ourselves; dissolving our fear. We soon decided we should go outside; we were starting to get quite high and quite restless, and besides it was getting dark out. We went to get our jackets and shoes on. I began to see Nikido out of the corner of my eye wherever I went. Really it was just shoes and socks and backpacks and various other inanimate objects scattered about the floor but in my peripheral vision it looked like T's cat. Then I'd turn and . . . socks, just socks. 

I wanted to find the real Nikido though and went on a mission to do that, finding her on the corner of T's bed, just where I thought she'd be; almost like I already knew. We conversed nose to nose for a moment then it was back to the mission - get on warm winter clothes. The sun was beginning to set and we wanted to get outside quickly before it was dark, but that was not such an easy task. My perception of time was beginning to become skewered but it must have taken quite a while to get dressed and ready to go. I had made a great friend of our blue balloon, which seemed to grow and shrink as I held it in my hand, and I realized that I had become quite emotionally attached to it. It was something that gave me comfort and, much like in real life, I had great difficulty giving it up. T giggled at me trying to put my socks on with the balloon in my one hand and then in my lap, sitting. Eventually I decided the balloon must go and with a substantial amount of difficuly I set it on the floor, forgetting about it almost immediately. I grabbed some granola bars and oranges for our journey into the outside world (unneeded where we were going) and got dressed with surprising ease. Even my shoelaces were a snap. T packed a backpack full of stuff (water and who knows what) and took a considerable amount of time longer than I did. 

I began to get somewhat frustrated with waiting for her, another cross-over from regular life. I need to be more patient with her sometimes I think. Even though I don't often show signs of my impatience and frustration on the outside I tend to internalize it and that's probably even worse, building up resentment and more and more frustration. But at the time it really didn't bother me too much for I had plenty to keep me occupied. She finally got ready and I felt like we were going on a long journey, which I related to T. 'We are,' she told me rather matter-of-fact-ly. And we two brave inner-universal timespace explorers set off. T worried that Nikido had somehow gotten out of the apartment but I knew just where to find her - on her throne at the end of T's bed, 'her center, her place of power' (T's words) - right where I had left her. 

~part 2~
outside we went. T was shocked at the temperature change when we first stepped outdoors, but I didn't even notice it. It seemed where my attention lay was from where my experience would manifest itself. My attention was on our space (and  time) explorers theme and as we walked down the alley I felt as if we were walking down a launch tunnel of sorts. 3. 2. 1. Blast off! and out into space we dived. A one way roadsign pointed us in our direction, though we soon passed another which pointed the opposite way. I began thinking of these white arrows as guide signs between two realities. T and I started talking about how much power we have to create our own lives, our own realities. I became a touch spooked as we passed by a busy parking lot. T mentioned some metaphor about vehicles and our lives which slips my mind. Soon we were crossing the bridge by the museum. Cars buzzed by to our left, headlights blurring. 'We're on Broadway,' I told T. I felt like an old fashioned gangster, no better yet, mobster, like in Dick Tracy, and I began to swagger. 'Just stick with me doll,' said I. Then 'I feel like I should be smoking a big cigar here. I should be wearing a tuxedo and you should have a long evening dress.' 'And a string of porls,' T added in her best New Yawk accent. Me: 'We're on broadway doll. . . .' 

Across the bridge and we wanted to cross the street now; better go to the crosswalk, our judgement quickly becoming severly disabled. 'Now I feel like we're in a comic strip. An Andy Capp comic,' said I, still walking with my same swagger, now more pronounced. As we crossed the street I bowed comically to the cars stopping for us. I suddenly felt T's embarrassment as if through telepathy. She might have said 'B, don't' embarrassed but maybe I just heard it in through our sudden ESP connection. 'Who cares?' I wondered aloud, 'who cares what these people are thinking for one milli-millisecond of their passing lives?' 'Yeah . . .' T seemed to agree. 'You're right . . .' telepathically. We walked around by the museum, marvelling at the Christmas lights and trees. 'Look at the trees,' T said as we stood beneath two massive firs. 'They're so beautiful and huge and old. Just like those other ones over there,' pointing at some smaller trees across the road. 'They're just alike.' 'Cause they're all exactly the same,' said the Buddhist in me, referring to the interconnectedness of everything. We stood beneath some flagpoles and I listened to the sound of the flags flapping in the eastwind which made me kind of disoriented. We stopped for a moment and talked about who knows what, I don't remember. 

But I soon felt very antsy again and wanted to keep keeping on our inner-universal timespace journey. T stood while I explored the environs. Sliding on a patch of ice I felt like I slid forever but looking back at my tracks it was only a few feet. I slid around on the ice for a minute dancing a wonderful moonlight ballet and wrote 'Love' in the fresh snow. Then I rushed back to T shouting 'mission complete space commander T, let's go!' and off we went, although I knew somehow that T wanted to stay still for a little longer. There's that impatience again. But I just felt the need to go go go, I burned like a candle. I began dancing slightly as I walked now, prancing maybe is the word, hyper, giddy, completely mad. I leapt up onto the edge of what in the summer is a water pond and almost cracked my head open slipping on the slip-slidey surface but managed to land upright. Okay, then, my motor skills are still functioning well enough. We passed some old-fashioned streetlights and they riveted my attention, but, like anything else I lent my attention to, only for a second. 'I feel like Jack Skellington from The Nightmare Before Christmas,' I told T looking at the old rickety fences and old-fashioned streetlamps at our side. 'First it was a mobster, then a comic strip character, now The Nightmare Before Christmas.' 

We stopped in a mostly empty parking lot and I heard a loud, screeching, catlike sound. 'That's the electricity,' T informed me. 'You heard that too? I thought it was some crazy cat woman over there.' I said. T laughed. 'Nope. Sometimes I hear the electricity when I'm sober.' I doubt it's so loud though. My ears had definitely perked up. Which direction now we weren't so sure with no signs to guide our way. 'Sometimes I feel stuck, like I'm waiting for something,' T communicated. I thought about our relationship and how sometimes I'm scared to take the lead for whatever reason. 'Waiting for what?' I asked. 'I don't know, like life. For the fear to go away,' and we continued on this train of thought until suddenly I had a grand realization, I had to reach out and grab life; I had to take the lead, both in this situation and life, forget fear. And I did. 'Let's go.' I decided and off we went, probably when T again needed more time. But again, I had to go go go . . . I had somehow become the default leader of our litle expedition. We walked down a little gradual hill. 'This feels like a movie, or a book. I feel like were in a book. Or a movie, the movie of our lives,' I said. I was Willy Wonka and the whole world was my chocolate factory and here I was guiding the little golden ticket winner on through this psychedelic madhouse. 

At the bottom of the little hill we met the top of a massive hill, snowy and slippery looking and quite a daunting slope in our inebriated state. Neither of us wanted to go down, or rather we were afraid of the big hill which in our normal state we had tramped up and down numerous times. In this dream it was scarier though. But with my recent realization that I had to grab life by the balls without fear I said fuck it and threw myself on the mercy of the hill.  T followed. This kind of became the starting point of our true journey. Down the hill, down the rabbit hole. We weren't getting high, we were going low, or rather deep; deep into our dreaming awake minds. Out into the great non-timespace of our internal universe. 

~part3~
down the hill I flew. I noticed to my left a long narrow patch of snow reaching all the way to the bottom of the hill and I decided that I could simply jump upon this and rocket my way sliding to the hill's base in an instant. I jumped on prepared for a wild ride but was unfortunately surprised by the stickiness of my chute. It was dirt underneath the snow. The long grass beside me, on the other hand, was quite slippery as T found out. We stopped about halfway down and T said 'I thought I could just slide down the whole hill like a ski jump.' So did I. 'You can,' I told her, just realizing myself that, yes, you could. And so T took off running, flailing, quite comical. I laughed, I thought it was beautiful. For a second I wanted to help her, thinking that she might fall and hurt herself, but some voice inside of me told me not to worry, T can handle herself. I ran down the hill after her and transformed into a gazelle as I ran. I actually had four legs and kind of trotted-ran, moving faster, I'm sure, than I ever had before in my life, lightspeed. I bumped into T trying to slow down as I reached flat ground. 'Whoops, sorry.' 'No don't worry.' I looked up at the big, once scary hill and laughed. 'I feel like I could just run right back up that hill right now and not even be out of breath,' I said. 'We are mighty gods T.' 

Then, not wanting to make the mighty gods angry, 'but really we're just tiny little lost human beings.' True. We walked. We headed for the trees; the talking, swaying, breathing life trees. I kept thinking there was a car behind us, shining its headlights on us, and I kept turning to check; nope, nothing. But the ground at our feet looked bright like a light shone on it from above or behind. I heard helicopters and it felt like they were beaming their searchlights down on us two inner-universal timespace fugitives. We walked in the snow looking down and it seemed as if we were walking on cracking eggshells which covered the neverending void; naught but blackness below. We two courageous explorers found our way down near the river and followed a path as the helicopters followed. Soon another timespace explorer approached, although for the longest time, indeed until he was almost right upon us, I thought he was a trailmarking signpost. 'No, it is a person,' T said. 'You're right,' said I, 'and he's crossing some sort of a bridge.' Funny though, I never remembered a bridge being anywhere around here. It was short and had guardrails on one side. I couldn't tell how far away our visitor was; distance was now impossible to gauge. 

He approached and I realized that it wasn't a bridge with guardrails at all but rather two dogs (huskies maybe?), whom our visitor was walking. I tried to be calm, pass by nice and slow, nice and easy, but all that failed and I said 'good evening fine sir,' in a strange tone and laughed. The one thing that got me though was how real this queer eskimo timespace astronaut seemed. 'How did that real person get into our dreaming dreamworld dreams?' I asked T. And T: 'Yeah, he did seem so real, hey?' Our eskimo friend seemed the first real thing I had seen in hours, years, millennia, who knows, for time had stopped having meaning, as had space, and the numerals we give to those two abstract concepts. 'Thank you O indian, O real life eskimo in our dreamy dream world,' I called out to our eskimo timespace friendly fugitive after he had passed. T laughed. 'This is great,' she said. 'Yeah, this is great . . .' And suddenly reality returned. No, maybe I just calmed myself down for a minute, because the sky was still brilliant purple-orange, the hills and trees still had ancient carved faces, the helicopters still followed . . . but I thought to myself 'this is it, the trip's over.' and I walked calmly now beside an ever calm T. 

We walked in silence and I gazed around serenely. The hills seemed to speak to me in their ancient way, through their stillness. I was lost in the barrens, far, far from the world, but not scared at all. T and I talked about how we felt we were on a different journey, but together. We were like anchors for each other, keeping ourselves from going off the deep end, but still helping each other to explore on this great psychonautical inner-universal journey into non- timespace. I didn't want the trip to end, there was still something I was looking for; I still wanted more more more. An airplane flew overhead and I ducked, it was sooooclose to the ground, the noise was intense. Moving my head made the noise alter too. Maybe I still was tripping. 'We are still so high B,' T calmly reminded me. Oh, yeah . . . We found a patch of ice on the trail which we ejoyed slip-sliding on. T slip-slided away but I became a bit confused with what was going on, where we were going, where I was going, both in life and on this journey. 

I wandered in circles, a lost little human figure in the confusing wilderness of life - whatever that was. Time didn't exist. If you would have asked me right then how long we had been out there, or in here, I would have probably said about six years, or seven maybe . . . minutes ; ; ; who knows . . . now, with my logical mind back intact, I could estimate from the amount of ground we covered, et cetera, et cetera. but right then time really didn't exist. And it wasn't that I couldn't keep track of it, no, it really didn't exist, and I knew this in my heart, from this universal perspective I then had. And neither did space. Just an optical illusion. We create our reality within our mind. Our poisoned mind of the time created this bizarre, illogical, reality, but it was every bit as real as our normal reality, because we were really experiencing it. We, therefore, have the power within ourselves to create whatever we want out of our reality, our lives, our existence . . . existence . . . 'existence . . .' I murmured circling around T as we discussed this. Just get out there, quit waiting or hesitating, quit walking up this backwards escalator of your life, grab life and make it your own, whatever you want it to be. And I wish I had taken a typewriter into this dream with me to write all this down, later it will probably be forgotten, or just somewhat illogical.'  

But these things still do make sense, as they did before the trip ever began. See, I knew all this already, or at least I thought I knew; the drugs didn't teach me any new knowledge. But knowledge and wisdom are two different things. Then (during the trip), I really knew all this deep in my heart, now (back in normal life), I just know it, but don't feel it. I've lost the universal perspective I had during my mystical journey. LSD expanded my mind so I could see my own internal universe, there's no doubt about that, but unfortunately it was a temporary glance; I'll have to do with waning memories of this experience, for now. But me and T were truly enlightened beings just then, two inner-universal timespace fugitives exploring this pyrotenknik outer world from our self-created universal center. Just then the helicopters spotted us. I grabbed T and hugged her tight, knowing this was the end. 'I feel like we're Bonnie and Clyde right now ol' T,' I said as the helicopters aimed their guns, ready to take us out. But then I remembered that, oh yeah, we create our own reality and I bade the helicopters goodbye, good riddance, piss off! and away they went, simply vanished . . . All of these realizations had come to me periodically and repeatedly, as reoccuring themes, throughout the evening, as they had to T as well. 

We had somehow reached the same conclusions while on two seperate trips (though the same trip); perhaps through our psychic connection. And perhaps that is just what we unconsciously (or not so unconsciously) intended; the power of our intentions was supremely strong. All of this wisdom was just read, contemplated knowledge kicking around in our heads that we didn't know how to apply to our reality, but this crazy drug solidified these beliefs by actually letting us experience it first hand. This was experiential wisdom, experiential spirituality, rather than just vicarious knowledge. But while tripping I fully created my reality and I realized just how easy it can be, I just have to control my mindful mind in each decision-making moment. Even now that I'm back to normal reality and I can't see so easily, so shockingly clearly, this first-hand wisdom, I still know it's there. I can still create my reality, my life, however I choose. There's nothing to fear, nothing to doubt, I just have to quit waiting, hesitating, walking up that backwards escalator of life, and reach out and grab life! 

So, with helicopters gone and the trip is definitely not over, T and I continued on. We walked along the path which became increasingly icy and I became increasingly lost. I looked at my feet and at the asphalt and snow speeding past. Bicycle tracks in ths snow became tank treads, footprints the boots of marching soldiers, I was in a war zone. As I focused my attention solely on the ground I found that I lost complete knowledge of where I was, I could have been in Russia for all I knew or really cared. But looking up I discovered that I was just in Edmonton, in the river valley, with T, going for a delightful evening stroll. Lightning began flashing in the sky for a few minutes. We stopped again, slip-sliding on the ice, and noticed someone behind us carrying a light of some sort. A bicyclist. 'Don't tread this way, tis too icy for one on a bicycle,' I warned our new friend. They stopped, surveyed for a less perilous trail, and continued on foot along a trial just up a small hill from us. 'What is someone doing way out here in the middle of nowhere at this time?' I wondered aloud. The cyclist walked past as we whispered. 'I wonder if they can hear us,' I whispered almost inaudibly, although I'd bet that the cyclist heard everything we said loud and clear; my perception of distance and volume were lousy. 

We got cold - ah, yes, we must be coming down (or going back up, as it were) if we're starting to complain about the weather. But my mind wouldn't buy that. My hands would though as I suddenly noticed how painfully cold they were, my face too. How could I have ignored that for this whole trip? We turned back, straight into the wind (of course), heading for T's apartment, warmth. I was mostly lost but knew to head for the bright city lights - oh how they radiated their seductive glow. The wind whipped at us and instantaneously the trees began to bend in towards me, try and grab me. For the first time in the trip I was truly frightened. Fortunately, it only lasted a second as I took control and snapped myself back into safety, into my own secure, stable psychedelic reality. We walked into the wind and talked increasingly about seemingly trivial things - I'm cold, I'm hungry, I've got to pee. Hmm, are we coming down? Yep . . . no way . . . maybe . . . Then T mentioned something about 'work', that hideous, awful word, and I knew that we were on our way slowly back to earth, out of our deep inner-timespace universe that was always there to begin with. 

~part4~
we stood, still quite high, at the bottom of the hill we had come racing down earlier as gazelles in the snowy ski jumping alps, and got ready to walk backwards up that escalator. It took us quite some time to get up that hill, and I know this because time was beginning to seep back into my consciousness as neat little numbered units again. I was okay now with the thought of coming down and almost looked forward to greeting the normal world again, however bizarre and backwards it seemed after having been away for so long. We slowly weaved our way back into reality as we climbed that hill, discussing our trip, sharing insight. 'This has changed my life forever' I remember thinking. Halfway up the hill and normalcy took charge more and more. Three quarters up and if I focused hard I wouldn't feel high at all. I was somewhere between two worlds and I could make complete sense of the things I had learned in my dreamscape and apply it to normal life situations; that was a great feeling, though passing. We reached the top and kept walking, freezing cold, tired, hungry. 

I felt almost entirely sober by the time we crossed over that Broadway bridge again. The weave into normalcy continued 'like one of those old-fashioned phone operators. All our normal plugs were disconnected and reconnected somewhere else, now they're all getting switched back again, back to how they normally are.' We finally reached T's house and after a hell of a time turning the key in the lock with our frozen hands we found warmth again. I had to pee, I had to eat. My left hand thumb wouldn't work and I wasn't sure whether it was because of the cold (our hands were bright red and white knuckled) or because of the drugs still at work in my mind. We sat in T's kitchen and talked, ate some veggie lasagna (which I could vaguely smell! for the first time in my life!(I have no sense of smell)), and drew pictures of The Pyrotenknik Lightning Bubble!  I noticed that as time passed we talked more and more superficially, or maybe just more confined, less universal. I found myself at times getting annoyed at the turns in the conversation. Both of us had troubles with keeping a train of thought together and we'd dart from one topic to another, I think often not really picking up what the other person was saying with their words (though we still did have that psychic connection somewhat). 

My back hurt, I grew confused at what had just happened as many of the millions of thoughts I had had began to escape me in the mish-mosh of words words words. Patience B . . . T and I took a bath together and eventually went to bed at about two in the morning, approximately twelve hours after our inner-universal timespace journey had begun, though it seemed longer. I slept well, though T complained about her thoughts keeping her awake most of the night. We parted ways in the morning and I felt kind of crappy, confused about what I had learned, what it all meant, how it applied to this reality that I must occupy in order to live. So when I got home I sat down and started writing. This scrawl has been therapy for me, it's helped me work through this whole crazy experience. I get it now, I think . . . I am in control of my reality. I can do whatever I choose with my life, my reality. I just need to stop walking up that backwards escalator of life, quit waiting, hesitating, and get out there and grab what I want. And I suppose I already knew that before LSD, but that crazy trip has really solidified these beliefs in my mind, really given me the motivation to create my reality. Now, how to actually manifest this creation is another matter altogether and I do feel somewhat confused as to how all this wisdom can be applied to my everyday life. 

Being mindful, making wise choices, taking risks and overpowering fear, and so on, I suppose . . . The bottom line is that when I look deep inside of myself I do know what I have to do, I always have really, and after yesterday's brilliant inner-universal timespace voyage I feel as if I'm finally ready.

I've enjoyed taking a look through some of these accounts of 'Trips' the good, bad and ugly. I wonder if anyone else who's had a bad trip and read some of the other stories here has felt a loosening of the sphincter reading other peoples nightmare episodes?! :)  The following account is an example of one very bad trip in around 30 good ones, but i'ts so far out there I thought I'd cover the bad stuff before the good. I think it's important for any would be tripper to be prepared for the fact that an experience doesn't guarantee that you'll have a good time. Its also fair to say that steps can be taken in order to have a wonderful time, the FAQ section of Erowid has a very well written 'Trip' do's and don'ts  list which I think would ensure better chances of a positive psychedelic outcome. Here's my story anyway, it's about the one that went bad.   

About ten years ago I bought my third trip from a guy in my home town Norwich (UK) It was a 'Strawberry' and I was told it had been double dipped. The guy had a reputation for selling good acid so I happily gave him my cash. My being in Norwich was just a social visit over a couple of days and catching up with friends. On the last day there I decided to drop the tab and use my friends house as 'Trip HQ' He knew what I was up to, he had gone to work and left me his keys to make myself at home. I took the single LSD tab in the late morning in a positive state of mind with no worries or anxieties. I began to come up on the acid towards the lunch time. It was to be the first and last time I'd ever trip alone. Outside it was a glorious sunny day but I was happy enough in my temporary sanctuary to even think about going outside. The LSD rush started blazing up my spine and racing through my guts, I felt a little uneasy with it but had enough mind to allow myself to just go with it and wait until the rush plateaued.

It did just that a little later, I'd decided to sit in the upstairs of the house and listen to music on the radio in a sunlit bedroom. I was having a wonderful time, watching floral Escher type patterns breathing over my skin, I enjoyed looking in the mirror looking at my grinning face with very distinct map contour patterns gently washing over my flesh. Its seemed like a great start eh?  Well, I vaguely recall deciding to go downstairs again for some reason then the next thing I recall was awakening on the floor of the dining room alone. The first thing I noticed was that there were blowflies buzzing around a bowl of catfood on the kitchen floor (Which was in view) I remember feeling perplexed as to why both flies had two bright neon after images in red and blue. I sat up and tried to figure out why I was on the floor in the first place. Now its worth pointing out before I take you down my helter skelter that somehow because of my black out, I'd completely forgotten that I'd taken anything at all. Prior to tripping I'd also written myself a note of reassurance in case things got too weird. So, sitting up on the floor still, I found my note and tried to read it. Alas because I was acid addled the words made no sense to me. Instead they morphed like alien glyphs and danced around on the piece of paper. 

It was then that my last little link to sanity crumbled and I heard my voice utter the terrifying words 'I've gone mad!' I had a feeling that I had to be somewhere else which then got heightened by the digital watch I was wearing suddenly bleeping a time alarm at me. but I had no idea why or what it meant.  So I left my sanctuary, I later found out that I left the back door wide open thus making the house entirely a burglars free for all. (Fortunately without that as a repercussion) I remember walking almost on auto pilot down a busy street heading towards town, I saw one of my old school teachers who also saw me, but the only thing I did was force a grin and keep on walking. I did indeed walk, not so much as a conscious effort or with any sense of intent, I felt utterly out of control, I collided with someone carrying their shopping -- vaguely heard them cuss at me as I continued in my stride, I turned down a passageway between two houses and strolled though the backdoor of a house I'd once lived in, past the new inhabitant and out the front door. I walked into the city center from there -- I still don't know how I survived crossing roads but I did. 

I strolled into a city cafe where my friend's son was working, he saw me and said hello, but in my acid addled state of autopilot I just walked past him into the main cafe and sat down, then I stood up and walked out of the cafe without uttering a word.  Other than being completely out to lunch on LSD at that time in the trip, I don't recall hallucinating, moreover I was more a puppet on a string guided by some subconscious walking mechanism which had its own design on where I should be, there was certainly no cognitive thinking to my actions. After the brief cafe episode of the trip, the situation just went from bad to worse.  Somehow I'd navigated myself through Norwich during the busy lunchtime shoppers and begun to head in the direction of the city's central park 'Chapelfield gardens' As a child I'd always felt a sense of friendliness and comfort there. Now in my fried state the familiar comfort of this park had shifted to its polar opposite, I was now hallucinating on top of everything else. The people in the park were all walking around but my perception had begun to distort their heads and faces beyond any form of human recognition. 

If you could imagine for a moment being surrounded by people in a busy place where their heads had been removed and replaced by Squids and Octopus you might begin to accurately picture the scene confronting me in the park. Everyone had tentacles smothering their faces and dangling down their necks like fleshy snake beards, even the women and children were not exempt from this disfiguration. The octopoid heads were white in appearance and each person seemed to have baleful staring eyes where their ears should have been. Even in my state of auto pilot I felt nothing but sheer terror at the alien swarm of people walking around me.  My feet had obviously decided to make evasive maneuvers because I then found myself out of the park having crossed yet another treacherous main road and was now heading towards a multi storey apartment block. I recall that I got inside the building somehow and wandered in circles on one of the floors of the apartment block, I seemed stuck in a loop of wanting to get out, walking around a circle of short corridors and arriving at a janitors cupboard, I would open the door expecting to find an exit and be confronted by a dead end with cleaning products and brooms. I would repeat this several times like a fly that desperately flies in circles around a kitchen only to collide with the same window again and again. 

I don't remember how I finally broke the loop but I did. The next thing that happened was the memory of walking around some side streets, into someones back garden via an alley way, I recall a middle aged woman looking a little afraid of me being in her yard and rushing into her house closing the door behind her. I left the yard and I think I walked between two garages, the gap between them was tight, perhaps I tried to go through it anyway, In my mind I was a being trapped inside an ever tightening spiral that I relentlessly marched along. As the spiral tightened my body would begin to crush, if I were to continue down the spiral I would surely be crushed to my final atom. . .  I must have snapped out of that little loop of fractal thought mental torture, I was now adjacent to a main road in Norwich called 'Unthank road'. I was in a front garden of another house, the inside of my mouth felt like plant matter, when I tried to scream, my tongue shot out as a mix of flesh and thorny rose stem. The situation was utterly hopeless, and getting ever worse with each lysergic eternal minute. Over the other side of Unthank road from where I stood was a dental repair workshop, a discreet looking workplace that looked just as much part of the houses above it. 

I recall that I walked into this workshop to the surprise of the men who were working there, I think they said 'Hey, where do you think you're going ' etc, but I was too far gone and on my way out again still under the guidance of this momentum and hidden agenda of the auto pilot within me.  The adjacent side street began the final demise of my terrifying trip, you'll have to indulge me in this part and go with the flow of reality and abstract woven together. First off, like a lemming I walked across this side road, onto the pavement then promptly plummeted a good seven ft into someones basement flat, there had probably been a flight of steps leading down to this concrete pit but I didn't see them and wouldn't have known what to do with them if I had. I guess I clambered up to street level again and limped my way up this street which was a bit of a cul de sac. Part of my subconscious memory must have recalled that an ex girlfriend had lived at the end of the street. I found myself walking up to her old front door which was one of those aluminium framed, double glazed types. 

I recall my reflection looking somewhat like a Francis Bacon painting, a mixture of anguished flesh and black oils ripping like blood down my body.  I was falling in eternal darkness, like a fleshy sack of bricks. As I fell forever I would crash through intermittent panes of glass which would shatter and tear me in my never ending descent. With the sound of breaking glass was the wavering crescendo of the word 'Mad' repeating in waves. . . mad, Mad, MAD, MAAAD,MAAAAAD,MAD,Mad,mad over and over as I plummeted, ripped and torn in darkness with splinters of glass falling beside me.  Back on the street a voice was saying'There is a way out of this, there is a word, and if it all ever gets too much you just say '_____________' and a door will open to allow you away from here'  Back on the street I had staggered a few more paces then fallen. I was now a seven year old child lying on the pavement, my best friends parents stood over me feeling concerned 'What happened', 'He's hit his head', 'Call an ambulance'. A disk-shaped hole appeared above me with someones arm reaching down to me to try and pull me up into safety, I tried to reach the grasping hand but couldnt, then the hole disappeared. 

I was staggering along the street again at the bottom of the cul-de-sac. My gaze lifted to the sky and the sky's gaze fell upon me, each cloud was now a giant type of amoeba type organism, covered in dots which pulsed in colour like the skin of a cuttlefish, each giant amoeba had a giant blue human looking eye observing me. I could hear voices taunting me, telling me I was stupid, telling me how thick I was for looking for the answers, telling me I had spastic consciousness. The amoebas seemed to be singing a never ending song which was something like this. . .  'I'm an umpsquamadic peel and if I ever know what I feel, then I know that I felt like this before and I always knew what I was timely for. . . ' (Repeat into infinity with a chorus of about 1000 people!)  I briefly saw existence as a giant clock face of a billion dots between each second, the dots were ticking forward in a relentless advance like the movement of a second hand. Each dot was the equivalent of someones lifetime. The internal monologue described that living and dying was part of this eternal chain, It showed me that there was a gap of nothing at the point which marked 12 on the clock face and that was a one second break from the never ending cycle of existence that any soul would have. 

Then the monologue started laughing at my dismay.  In reality I briefly became conscious enough to recognize that I was stumbling through a small children's play area at the base of the cul-de-sac. Its worth describing to you a little about the geography of where I was. Adjacent to the cul-de-sac is a small path which leads to about four flights of stone steps leading to a street below. This street is called 'Park lane'. If you go through the gap in the fence at the back of the childrens play area there is a steep foliage ridden embankment that leads down to a flint gravel parking area at the rear of a Park lane hotel. Guess which route I took!  In reality I passed through the gap in the fence, failed to notice the dangerous drop below me then tumbled down the embankment onto the flint parking area. I was crawling on my hands and knees by this point. A piece of flint had torn the palm of my hand making it look like a stigmata wound which was pretty appropriate to the following delusion. . .  I was in a place that looked like 'The sea of holes' from the Beatles 'Yellow submarine' movie. 

This was a white void with an infinity of swarming black dots, I could hear air raid sirens and the sound of buzzing, In the sea of holes was a giant cross which had a festering bloody pile of guts and organs spread across it staining the wood crimson. The guts were smothered in wasps stinging the ruined flesh causing venomous pustules. It was an image of impossible pain then the monologue returned booming over the sirens and drone of the wasps 'This is Christ, he's still suffering for your sins, still paying the price. . . ' More laughter, then a fleeting moment of reality. I had crawled across Park lane and collapsed in the gutter on the other side of the road, my jacket was gone, there were cuts and grazes over my bare arms. A wasp had landed by my elbow and was making a snack for itself on one of my cuts, I remember trying to brush it away and it stinging me as I did. Over the other side of the street I saw a woman pushing a pram and looking at me with concern but now I had returned to acid Hell again. 

My body was a giant mass of green flesh punctured all over by cactus-like thorns that had grown from within and broken my skin on the way out. I had no arms or legs, I was more like a mass of tendrils with an apple shaped mass at the top. My form was that of pain, nothing more and nothing less.  A brief flash of a police car pulling up beside me, someone getting out. . .  I was pain, floating in the sea of holes, there were a billion holes, each one a passage leading to another identical ocean of swarming black dots. The monologue told me there was only one hole which lead away from here. . .  I was in a hospital, lying on a padded vinyl mattress with medics standing around me, I was human-shape again. The doors of the room I was in swung open to reveal an idyllic country side scene of green hilly pastures, bathed in glorious sunlight and a friendly looking old Oak tree in the foreground view, if only I could crawl through those doors I would be safe, my soul saved. But I couldn't move, the doors swung shut then opened again, now I could see a hospital corridor instead of the fields, someone was being pushed past on a stretcher trolley.  

Back in the sea of holes it seemed that my gaze in any direction would erase the back dots in their masses, for the first time in this nightmare trip I felt a sense of conscious hope. I began to wipe swathes of dots by sweeping glances into the void around me. . .  'What have you taken?'  I was gaining hope by the minute, stripping the black dots away, removing these taunting false exits. . .  'What have you taken? Was it acid?'  Surrounded by a self-created white void of comfort I gazed at the final bunch of black dots and knew my release from Hell was merely held by these remaining few. . .  'He's out of it still'  I had gazed all but two of the black dots away, these two now had a bridge akin to a line seen in a dot to dot puzzle, in my mind my voice returned as I stared at each dot, I heard my own internal voice yelling 'One Two, One, Two, One one, Two. . . ' Then The two dots looked like my own hands with cuffs around them. The black line bridge had become a visible chain, the white void had faded to become a hospital room. I was in fact on my back on a hospital bed with my arms trapped beneath me, I was looking through my legs at my wrists grazed with the rubbing pressure of police hand cuffs around them, then I yelled 'Get these fucking hand cuffs off me!'  

In the room with me were a male and female police officer from the Norfolk constabulary, they had obviously been the people who had lifted me from the Park lane gutter and taken me to hospital. The male officer obliged my demand and removed the cuffs. The woman police officer asked me stuff like my name, If I knew where I was but the best I could muster was a brief groan. They both looked a bit frustrated and left me in the room on the hospital bed alone. I was rapidly regaining my sense of self and conscious of reality. I recalled that I had indeed dropped acid sometime earlier, my Hospital surroundings and the amount of cuts and bruises I had were confirmation to me that whatever I'd done, it had seriously backfired big time!  I sat on the edge of the hospital bed, noted a number of missing items I had recalled having on my person prior to all of this. I found my pumps in the bedside cabinet and put them on. Then I took my first deliberate steps across the room I was in. The bizarre nature of this entire episode had one final twist installed for me. 

I recall walking to the door of my single bed room and opening it, a few feet away from me were the two police officers facing each other having an intense conversation about what to do about me. They were so engrossed in their discussion that neither noticed as I came out of the room and begun walking down the hospital corridor. There was a window that stood from floor to ceiling, the type that pivots in the central vertical axis, so judging that I could fit through the gap, I squeezed through it!  There is little left to tell of this story, except to say my walk from the hospital to the train station was quite distressing, I was in a lot of pain. Had stitches in my chin, my elbow and hand. My right forearm had swollen up purple making it look like Popeye's right hook. I was still semi hallucinating but very aware of how I'd nearly died and how I had a lot of explaining to do when I got home to my girlfriend. There were no legal repercussions for giving the police the slip, I had caught a train back home to a village in Suffolk which was not in the jurisdiction of the Norfolk constabulary, however they had contacted my father who was in Norfolk, so I had quite a bit of explaining to do for him too!  

In retrospect, it was the worst day of my entire life, It was the closest I can imagine to having full blown psychosis. I think it was nothing short of a miracle that I didn't end up over someones car bonnet or worse. Do I believe the monologues and symbols of that day? I'm not entirely sure I do, I now understand that intense adrenalin bursts whilst hallucinating are responsible for dragging the mind into the abyss of fear and worst possible scenarios. I kind of feel that I would have a very bleak outlook for life and reality if I believed for a moment that anything I saw in that trip was true. I've had some other trips which were glorious and the polar opposite of that day. 

So I tend to agree with Aldous Huxley that Heaven and Hell are both valid states of consciousness, It all depends on where the person is at and how we navigate through the psychedelic state which determines which destination we arrive at. If anything puzzles me at all about that day, it would have to be the black-out I experienced early in the trip, I suspect that had I not lost consciousness I would probably have not forgotten that I took the drug and therefore wouldn't have panicked myself into an internal Hell fractal.

I have experienced with LSD approximately 15-20 times.  This was not necessarily a bad trip, just an uncomfortable one.....

We started out at 4pm, ate the tabs and called for a cab to take us to the hills where we wouldn't be bothered by reality. Earlier that day we wrote down our address on a piece of paper and took it with us, in the event that we wanted to go home before we sober up, we could hand the paper to the cab driver, and he would handle the rest.  

The hills are about a 10 minute drive from the house.  As soon as we arrived, I was already feeling funny.  There was a porta potty nearby, so I went in.  My friends were talking outside and the sounds were noticebly strange.  We hiked for about 10 minutes, and I was feeling really tingly, and could not stop smiling!  Now it had been about a total of thirty minutes since we dropped.  I was amazed at the speed of the effects coming on.  Walking down the trail a little more now, things are buzzing, butterflies are cicling with magnificant trails following, like a million rays of light, all red and yellow.  There were two ladies walking their dogs that stopped to chat about 30 feet away from us.  This made me really uncomfortable.  I was beginning to feel the paranoia that I always do, but a little stronger this time.  At first I could make out what the two ladies were saying, but within a couple of minutes, it was all a bunch of mush.....just like Charlie Brown's mom.  

We moved to a different spot, as hard as it was for me to walk at this point.  My legs felt like rubber, and I could not stop laughing.  At this point the hallucinations were starting.  I thought there were 10 or so people walking around, all with dogs.  I asked my boyfriend if it was real, and he said no.  Laying on the grass for about another hour or so I think......15 seconds seems like an hour sometimes.  My boyfriend was running up and down the hill like he was a mad man, just full of energy saying 'Yahoo, isn't this fun??'  I could not move.  I wanted something, but I wasn't quite sure what it was.  I could just not get comfortable, so we moved again.  This time into a crater-like bowl shape on the side of a hill.  Getting really dark now, there were so many things to see in this 'crater'.  Trees moving, faces forming within the rocks and making faces at me, the grass breathing.  I suddenly felt like the crater was closing in on me.  I could no longer see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I got scared and wanted to go home.  Uneasy, and not wanting to spoil everyone else's time, I went with the flow.  

Next we moved up to the top of the hill where we get an incredible view of the freeway and all of the lights.  It was cold, and scary out there.  I was at a place where I just wanted to stare at the lights with all of the energy shooting off in the sky.  The clouds forming animals and people dancing.  I could not focus my eyes on one single thing, they were jumping all over the place.  I think one of the reasons I didn't have a better time is because it was dark, and I could not tell if there was someone (from reality world) standing right in front of me or not.  I had to remind myself that I was not going to stay like this.  'It's just a drug'  I kept telling myself.  My wonderful man sitting there trying to comfort me but it just wouldn't work.  Suddenly a BRIGHT light goes on in the residential area below us.  My boyfriend yells 'Everybody Down!'  We lay there in complete silence.  I could hear all of our hearts beating LOUD.  I thought it was a cop and we weren't supposed to be there.  The most horrible things were going through my head.  I was afraid I would be forced to talk to him or something.  Then the light goes off.  

I was still afraid to look.  Finally my man says 'It's ok, it was only somebody's motion sensor light in their yard.'  Holy smokes.  My pupils were so huge, that a mere porch ligh from 200 feet away seemed like a cop spotlight.    At this time I convinced everyone to go home.  I wanted a comfortable place that I was farmiliar with.  We ventured on down the hill throught these massive sticks sticking out of the ground as tall as we were all around us.  We obviously lost track of the trail, and could not find it.  I was practically running down the hill, frightened almost like someone was chasing me.  My boyfriend kept trying to hold me back and slow me down.  This only made me feel worse.  I was still peaking really good.  I could see the end of the trail that meets the main road.  It would look like it was 10 feet in front of my face.  I would take 30 more steps, and look up, and I was still as far away from the end as I was the last time I looked.  This went on for another 10 - 15 minutes, or so I thought before we were level.  

We were now walking through a swamp that was about 1 foot deep.  I felt like I was sinking in quick sand.  When we got out of the swampy area I reached down to feel my pants, only to find that they were completely dry!  Not even any mud.  :) Hehe.  Phew, almost home free, then CRAP!  We have reached a freakin' dead end.  A wire fence all the way areound us.  But this was never here before???  AAAAAHHHHH.....I think everyone was a little freaked out about this.  It was a very trapped feeling, almost clausterphobic.  I remember hearing screams from a child near by and parents yelling.  I started running.  We found the end of the fence, and called a cab.  How did my boyfriend call a cab???  How could he possibly even speak?  This made me think he was coming down, and I didn't like the feeling of having to finish my peak alone.  Waiting for the cab on the curb for what seemed like a whole night, listening to my boyfriend talk about normal real things like the economy, and buying a house someday.  I just could not comprehend this.  Here comes five pairs of headlights!  

Yeah, the cab is here.  We walked towards the van, waving it down.  When it stops, we realize it wasn't a cab, it was a mom with a carload of kids inside.  Boy, she must have thought we were loopy.  I am discouraged once again.  The next car that came was in fact the cab.  We got in and looked at the strange looking man about to take our lives into his hands.  He never said a word to us.  It was like he sensed our energy or something.  Going up and down hills felt like a roller coaster ride, hearing all of the creaks and cracks inside the car, with the radio on so low, but yet it was like we were at a concert.  Stop lights stayed red for an eternity, watching 500,000 cars in cross traffic going by.  It was hard to make out where we were even though I've lived here for 12 years.  

Still peaking in the cab, as soon as we got home and walked inside it was like the world came back all within 10 seconds.  I was no longer peaking, but still feeling effects.  We put on the Doors, and it rocked us to sleep.

Next time, I am going to do it all during the day time.  I can't fight it.  I really just have to go with it.  I am humble, and bow down to the acid gods.  Pretty powerful stuff.

I am a very experienced LSD user, and an avid reader of Erowid's reports.  I am frequently surprised by the lack of clear and reliable information that my fellow psychonauts have had going into their first LSD experience, or in cases where ignorance has led to disaster.  So, with this in mind, I wish to relate to you my own experience with an unknown source and potency of the drug, and why it is so very very very important not to leave these things to chance (unless, of course, you are keen to go mad).

The day in question started fairly normally -- it was a saturday in mid-summer, beautiful weather, I was in a good mood, and had most of the day at my disposal . . . so I decided to go down to the waterfront (the place in my town where it is most easy to pick up drugs on the street) to buy a vial of acid.  This was mistake #1.

When I got down there, I almost immediately made contact with an older woman, perhaps 40 or 50, who claimed to have amber liquid in great quantities.  Indeed, this was true -- she had a small makeup jar that was filled with probably 300 or more hits of the brown liquid (maybe a 1/4 cup of the stuff).  She took my vial, a small binaca dropper, dipped it in, and sucked up probably 30 or 40 hits.  She charged me only $20 for this, so I began to wonder if it was really acid at all . . . usually I paid more like two or three bucks a hit, and this worked out to about 50 cents each . . . but I bought it anyway and took off.

It was probably somewhere around 2 or 3 in the afternoon, at this point.  I walked several blocks to the mall in downtown, and retreated in a public restroom to drop a few hits.  I dropped 2, noted they tasted slightly of liquor, then left to walk the mall.  This was mistake #2.  People have told me before (and now I tell others) that you should ALWAYS drop only one, or even less, when you have bought a batch of unknown potency.

No more than perhaps ten or fifteen minutes later, I was in a software store, looking at video games, we a sudden, quickly-rising sense of panic and apprehension came over me.  I began to think, 'Perhaps it was poison, or they mixed it improperly!  I might be about to die!'  I left the store immediately and sat down on a bench in the mall's atrium, trying to get my head straight.  I remembered in the past that music had calmed me when I felt anxious on LSD, so I got out my CD player and tried to listen to acoustic guitar music, but even that was way too much.  And I was freaking out because I was like 20 minutes into the trip -- not even close to the peak -- and I was already overwhelmed.  Fortunately, even at this point, I was a fairly experienced solo tripper, so even with my mind out in space, my body was functioning on a basic survival sort of level.

I left the mall in a great hurry and walked to the nearest bus stop to catch a bus home.  Had I known the story of Albert Hofmann's second (and intentional) trip, I might've described my feelings at this point as he did at the onset of his trip: 'extreme personal crisis'.  Though I waited about 5 minutes, it seemed like an eternity.  There were hundreds of people out on the streets, and every one of them seemed to be mutated or twisted in a unclear sort of way.  The bricks that made up the sidewalk sent up half-visible smokily twisting versions of themselves, and stretched and bent about people's feet as they walked by.

Being on the bus was even more frightening.  Though I knew all of this was in my head, it didn't take away the hallucinations of mad chattering that I was hearing, nor did it curb the panic that had risen and was still rising in me.

When I got off the bus, still some 10 blocks from my house, I was alarmed to find that in addition to the wild visual and auditory hallucinations, I was beginning to have difficulties in the physical realm as well.  As I crossed the road (which too was frightening -- I had no trust in any of the drivers not to run me over, despite the fact that the stoplight was quite clearly red) the pavement began to feel as if it were slowly rolling and jumping up and down under my feet.  Trees moved and waved in rapid, almost violent profusions of color and pattern, and I began to worry that I might be left completely mad from this trip, that my mind might never come back.

Once I got home, I lay down on my bed and attempted to center myself and meditate, get some kind of grip on reality, but my thoughts felt like energetic fluid, far too volatile to be controlled.  I saw huge, swift blue slashes of lightning arcing and chasing across my ceiling.  I went outside to smoke a cigarette, and found that the side of my house was flowing up and down simultaneously, much more rapidly than I was accustomed to on acid.  Unreal, half-visible geometric boxes encased the smoke that rose from my cigarette, and I thought to myself, this is the true nature of LSD, a drug that must command great respect, not only for the wisdom it can uncover, but also for its power to drive the unprepared completely mad.  It is a drug meant for those with great mental strength, and little fear of its ego-slaying properties.

I realized somewhere in my random mental wanderings out on that deck that half the reason I was freaking out was that I was alone.  So, once again operating in survival mode, I called my friend A, and explained that I had take 2 hits of LSD, but that the effect I'd gotten was far more potent than I'd expected, and that I was in need of some companionship.
     'Damn,' she said, 'You sound SO loaded.'

I agreed that this was in fact the case.  She told me that she had to go to work, but would send my friend B over in a minute to watch over me.  After I hung up with her, I felt better, knowing at least if I was going to go mad, I wouldn't be alone.

It seemed to take forever for B to arrive, but once he did, we put in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and sat down to watch.  Oddly enough, though I was still grilling incredibly hard, once B was there, talking with a fellow LSD user (though he was completely straight at the time) and the comedic atmosphere of the movie combined to make me feel much better.  At this point I would say I was having a good time again.  B and I hung out for several hours that night, but when he went home at about 11 pm, I was still completely fried.  I stayed up most of the night reading Greek myth and listening to Pink Floyd.  I think I finally came down somewhere around noon the next day, but felt odd and slightly tweaky for a good week or so afterwards.  Also, previous to this experience, I'd never really had any lasting after-effects from doing hallucinogens, but to this day I still see tracers and what I refer to as 'rainbow trash', a sort of static-like colorful profusion of afterimages that lightly sprinkle my vision.  I understand that these are symptoms of HPPD, though they have never really caused me any particular problems, and they have subsided somewhat with time.

So, I say in conclusion, if you are going to do LSD, do it with a known source (hopefully a friend), do it in moderation (for the least after-effects and paranoia/fear), don't do it too often (can you imagine LSD getting boring? sounds unlikely but I've experienced it), and for God's sake don't do it anyplace you can't easily and quickly leave if things do start to go south.  If you respect these things, LSD will respect you, and a wide world of knowledge, creativity, and self-discovery await.

Its the last day of our honeymoon. Wed scrambled to find a camping spot for our acid trip, and the place we found is perfect and serene. Its part of a larger, established campground, which were not used to since we usually stay off of logging roads. But its a Tuesday night, its fairly secluded, and we dont have to worry about bears or wild animals while were tripping. 

Our campsite is right on the edge of a lake, and Ryan has set our tent and hammock up off to the side, nestled in the fir and aspen trees. Theres a mountain on the other side of the water. Its a large enough lake that there are waves lapping up against our shore. 

We each take one tab at 5:30pm, as soon as I get back from paying for the campsite. Its our first time tripping with just us alone, and the third altogether. Weve had a short honeymoon, just a road trip down to the Redwoods and Crater Lake. Its been a long summer with the preparations for our wedding. Small as it was, only forty-five people, it was quite an ordeal. Over the last few days, Ive loved our time to relax together, and now Im totally ready to explore acid with just us. 

After we eat our tabs, we eat a small dinner, salad and chicken hot dogs. We lay in our hammock for a little bit, but one of the trees is too flimsy and were basically on the ground. Aspen leaves are sprinkling down on us as we adjust and try to get comfortable.

I start to feel the effects of the acid in the hammock: my body feels light and airy, and the colors are becoming more vibrant. Ryans feeling it, too, and we decide to sit and watch the sun set over the water. There are various logs up against the shore, so we sit on one as the water laps up against rocks. Over the next hour or two, we watch the sun go down behind the mountain. As the light fades, everything takes on a purple hue. We see lights across the water twinkling at us. Bats come out and catch bugs on the water, swooping back and forth in front of us. Stars appear in the dark sky. Ryan and I talk about how beautiful the earth is and how much we can hear and see. Once it gets dark enough, I lay on one of the logs and stare up at the stars. 

It starts to get cold though, and we retreat to our tent about 8:30pm. We try to get comfortable, knowing well be here for a while. Finding our beanies, our extra layers, all the blankets we brought. On acid, Im constantly reminded of how much stuff I have. It seems any time Im on acid, I get caught up looking for something. On acid, Im constantly reminded of how much stuff I have. It seems any time Im on acid, I get caught up looking for something. I have no memory of where I put it last, and I have to sort through all the unnecessary clothes and food and shoes Ive accumulated. 

All bundled up, we sit around, feeling the effects of the acid and talking about it. We talk about our honeymoon so far. I feel connected to everything around us. The critters we hear outside, Ryan, the trees, the wind. We consider taking a walk, but we refrain, too cold and afraid of running into people.

Its maybe 10:00pm. Its very dark in the tent, but the visuals from the acid are making everything rainbow. I dont know what triggers it, but I leave my body and enter some kind of void. I feel like Im in the space between light and dark. I can finally breathe, and I understand that Im not Emily anymore, Ive become something else. This void feels like space because everything is so dark, but Im surrounded by twinkling lights. It all makes sense, and its very familiar. 

What do you call it? I ask, wondering how to describe what Im feeling. 

Ryan says language cant describe it. Im struggling with what Im experiencing and I want to talk about it, but my words are a jumble and Ryan is a jumble, too. Everything he says, I question. I question his memories (I have none at this point), I question how we got here, I question what any of this is. When he uses my name, I bristle. I call him Ryan, but at one point ask, Am I Ryan?

He feels like he made it weird by mentioning his dad, but I have no idea who that even is. He reaches for me, but I move away. A few minutes later when I reach for him, he moves away. I feel like were in a struggle where were never going to come together. Like the sun and the moon, always chasing each other. We bounce from one corner of the tent to the next. 

I think well always be in this tent, trying to meet in the middle. We arent Ryan and Emily anymore; were also my sisters and my brother and all the other people weve tripped with before, and also some kind of gods. I feel like weve been here before. I keep telling him that: Weve been here before. Havent we been here before?

Ryan says something about Diamond Lake and camping, but I dont understand that, either. 

I somehow end up sitting on top of him. I do something that makes him say, Ow! and I come back to my body, just a little bit. I fall to the side and Ryan holds me. He is talking about God and love and warmth and light. I listen and try to talk. I feel like some of the wildness has left me, but Im still not sure what this body is or who Emily is. We talk about the spirit and the soul and I try to describe the feeling of being outside of the physical world, but then I get thirsty or cold or have to pee. I keep saying, But I have this body, I have to keep coming back to this body. I am full of disdain for it, the thing that is keeping me from the void from before, where I felt like I belonged. 

Ryan, though, is grounding me with words that actually make sense. You just have to keep yourself warm and eat and we have to remember God and love and family. And were going to go home and start a new life and make a new family together. 

I ease back into reality, slowly. I let him talk about us and the mythological meaning of marriage. I feel like our souls have known each other before, and our wedding was a link in our eternal story together. I start to understand that Im an eternal being, just like Ryan. I have always been, I am, and I will always be, and in this life, I get to experience time and death. This night is a bridge between the two worlds, where I am fully aware of both sides of my coin.

I think of my brother and how he described God on our last acid trip, with a group of a dozen people, most of them strangers to me. He said the Hebrew word for God -- Yahweh -- could be a play on how to say I was, I am, and I will be all at once, a way to describe something timeless and eternal. I feel outside of time, like the past, present, and future are stretched out before me. I dont see the past or the future or understand them, I simply feel it. Its as though I have one foot in the river of time and one anchored on the solid ground. 

I can hear everything around us, and theres a soft hum from the world. We hum the Om sound and it feels like our spirits emanate from us with the sound. We recite Hare Krishna and talk about how God is for us, with us, and ahead of us. 

My entire body is humming with energy. We keep using the word dance to describe it. I have an autoimmune disease that leaves me sore and stiff, but on acid, I am light and free and painless. I have an autoimmune disease that leaves me sore and stiff, but on acid, I am light and free and painless. When I move, colors wave through my body. When Ryan speaks, rainbows ripple through my mind. Ive tapped into some kind of synesthesia so that everything is connected and one thing always emphasizes something else.

Throughout the night, we listen to the waves of the lake, we stare at the moons reflection on the water, we watch the stars, we visit the horrific bathroom trying to poop (we dont), and we are constantly trying to get warm under our insufficient blankets and sleeping bags. Ryan smokes a cigarette, and he says it will be his last one. He started again a few weeks ago, amidst the wedding stress, but now hes facing the facts about what they really do to his body.

We smoke some weed, talking about the goddess Kali and how smoking cannabis has been a spiritual rite for many cultures. I havent smoked weed on acid before since I was already enjoying myself so much, but since Ryan is smoking, I want to, so we can be on the same level.

Ryan tells me I scared him earlier, that he was worried I wasnt going to come back to him. We talk  about wild feminine energy and about yin and yang. Throughout the night, he keeps talking about darkness and the devil and good and evil, but I have trouble feeling the same urgency and doom when thinking of evil. I know there is light and good and love and there is also dark and hate and anger, but I dont know if theyre adversaries. I dont even know if you must avoid one and only seek out the other. How can there be a sun without a shadow? They are both necessary to life. 

But I recognize that I grew up in the light, loved by my family and blessed to be able to feel safe and travel, and now I can flirt with darkness because my foundation is in love. Some people have struggled with darkness since childhood, when it was cast on them unwillingly, and they fight to find the light when they dont have role models who have shown them how to live in it. 

Im talking about human mythology and how the world is made up of two planes, the visible and the invisible. And for thousands of years, people have been talking about the invisible world through myths and spirituality and religion. I tell him I understand that were eternal beings and we will die but our souls will live on, somehow. In another life, in another dimension, Im not sure.

I realize Ryan has fallen asleep on me. Its 6:30am but I feel so awake and like Im still tripping. I sleep for an hour or two, but my body is uncomfortable and still buzzing with energy so I journal, trying to capture some of my emotions. I unzip the tents door and watch everything outside. The fog rolls out as the sun rises, and the birds are waking up, searching for food. I feel like this is my first glimpse of the world, and everything is so beautiful. I take off a sweatshirt and realize I stink, so I decide to walk to the showers to clean myself off. I can hear every bird flying away as I walk by and see every bright leaf fluttering in the wind. The place feels like a magical wonderland. Im sore from the long night, but my body also feels fresh and new. 

The whole day, as we ease back into ourselves, is surreal. I wake Ryan up around noon, and even though I enjoyed the alone time, Im so glad hes awake again. We talk about our experience, and at times, it seems like were talking about what it means to be mortal and trapped in bodies. 

I just want to be home, but as Ryan says, Theres still work to do. We have a three hour drive ahead of us and we have to eat breakfast (we forgot olive oil for the eggs we brought) and we have to pack up our things. When I was younger, I would play a game in my mind. I pretended I was Emilys identical twin and I had to act just like her or people would find out I wasnt really Emily. I would take in everything about her life as though it were brand new and I would go through all the motions, just as Emily would. I feel like that now as we fold up the tent, search the car for my phone, and give Ryan directions. This entire life is odd and new, but familiar and comfortable at the same time. I know Im Emily, but I also know that everything Ive created for myself is temporary and so much of what I focus on pulls me from the real magic of the universe. I get caught up in stress and plans for the future and idealizing who I am when I could be watching the sunset or enjoying music or laughing with Ryan. 

On the drive home, we talk about God and we listen to mewithoutYou. The scenery is beautiful, the colors still so vibrant. I doze off here and there, but the energy is still humming in my body. When we get home, I read William Blakes The Marriage of Heaven and Hell out loud as Ryan cleans up some pocket knives he bought from an antique store. Im struck by some of the images, so close to how I felt on the trip. One stuck with me, a proverb from hell: Eternity is in love with the productions of time.

DOSE: T+ 0:00
1 tablet
oral
LSD


  T+ 12:00
0.5 mg
oral
Pharms - Lorazepam





BODY WEIGHT:
200 lb




Dose: 1 barrel-shaped tablet; actual dose of the medicine is unknown.  It was given to me by an experienced psychonaut who vouched for its purity and potency.

Set: My intention was to let LSD take me wherever it wanted to take me.  I was particularly interested to experience ego dissolution and to discover what remained after the mind was obliterated.  

I am a self-professed agnostic and do not have any spiritual side to my understanding of the universe.  I was open to having a spiritual/mystical experience and was eager to experience the oft-cited underlying noetic sense of unity/all-is-one.  

I was committed to trusting the molecule and my own inner healing intelligence. I was hoping for some beautiful closed and open-eyed visuals.  I hoped to see what might be behind the free-floating anxiety I occasionally suffer from.  

My intention was also to have fun with the man who agreed to sit with me.  Well call him W.

Setting: I took the medicine at Ws house.  W is an MD who has been trained as a facilitator/guide for people doing psychedelics as part of scientific protocols.  He shared his beautiful house two blocks from the ocean.  He offered to provide dinner and breakfast the next day.  We agreed that I drop at 2PM and I would stay the night.  He had a wonderful sound system and a playlist of music that he curated himself specifically for people who are tripping.  Spacious, comfortable, relaxed, and safe.

T: 0:00 I swallowed the pill with a sip of water and did 15 minutes of my usual meditation practice.

T: 0:30 My body was beginning to tingle, and I experienced subtle vibrations at the periphery of my visual field.  I began to feel gentle waves of energy the way it feels halfway through the first cup of coffee in the morningonly much more wavelike.  W was tinkering with his laptop. Impulsively, I sat down on the armrest of his chair and rested my head on his shoulder, asking if he minded if we cuddled a little bit. (Hes straight and Im a gay man.) He was fine with that.  

Very soon after I felt like it was time to go in.  I put on a soft sleep mask and a set of killer noise-reducing headphones and laid down on the couch.

(Note: times are VERY approximate and are reconstructed from a review the next day with W.)  

T: 1:00 The music took on a depth and richness that was breathtaking.  I felt the music in layers that I could slip in between.  My mind seemed to be turned off, so I wasnt really thinking about anything.   I just kind of merged with the music.  We started with music I brought on my iPod, all trippy electronic stuff from the 70s plus a few more current pieces. 

T: 1:30 Halfway through a Sigur Ros song, I had to lift the eye shades and take off the headphones.  I remember saying that this was way too much music to absorb.  The room felt like it was undulating and I was a little nauseous.  I told W that I didnt want to be responsible for the music and asked him to take over.  What I really was saying was, I dont think I am in control anymore, and wanted him to take over.  I laid down on the couch.  

I had this sense that things were building in a way that I couldnt explain. I had this sense that things were building in a way that I couldnt explain. My visual field was distorted as if it were a wet painting that someone was running their fingers throughlike finger painting.  I started to get a little anxious, so I asked W if he would hold my hand.  He did. Almost immediately I began cryingdeep racking sobs.  W came to me on the couch and held me against his chest while I cried more-or-less continuously for the next two hours.  

Very little of me was there any more.  I dont really remember anything very specific from this time.  My mind was in pieces.  Language was unavailable.  To the extent that there was any self there, I knew I was the source of an unimaginable volume of radiating love and gratitude for Rs presence.   I knew I was safe, and I was ready for what might come.

T: 3:30 I started shaking. I have peripheral neuropathy in my feet that makes them feel intensely restless and like there are minor jolts of electricity shooting through them.  Only now it was happening to my entire body.  All my muscles began to spasm in involuntarily contractions from my core out to my fingers and toes.  Bolts of electricity coursed through my body and gave off brilliant white crackling sparks.  

Everything was completely black around me.  I was absolutely disincorporated.  I directly felt what was going on in my body, but I was diffusely separated from what was happening.  I remembered my intention and decided not to try to resist the spasmodic electrical discharges, but to trust my inner healer.  I was certain that this was what was supposed to happen and was happening for a good reason.  

During brief periods of consciousness, I felt like I was adrift in infinite blackness.  I knew the blackness was in no way malevolent, but what simply was.  The elements of my personality/self floated in the blackness in fluid puddles like oil packets in water.  Occasionally, it occurred to me to wonder what the blackness was or what might be on the other side of itif there was another side.  I pretty much decided that the blackness was everything/nothing, but I didnt feel like I had the energy to be too curious.  I was content just to float in between the spasms.  This continued for about two hours.  

Occasionally W would say things to me.  One thing I remember was that he thought there was something inside that needed to be let out and he asked me if I could let it out.  I think I just shrugged.  At some point W changed my shirt because I was drenched in sweat.  I dont remember this.

T: 5:30 The shaking stopped and I began to recover a sense of my surroundings.  My cognitive processes were still totally scrambled, but I was regaining a sense of self.  W kept asking me things like what I wanted to do or if I were too cold.  I kept answering him with, I really dont have any capacity for measurement or comparison.  This seemed amusing.  I just wanted him tell me what to do.  

At one point, I found myself in the bathroom.  Im sure W took me in there.  I dont know if I asked or he suggested.  I was not wearing my glasses during any of this, which left me unable to distinguish much visually.  In addition, visual reality was again undulating and distorting.  I tried to remember the mechanics of peeing standing up, but this was mostly muscle memory. I wasnt sure whether the urine was going in the toilet, on the floor, or in my pants.  This was really upsetting and made me feel guilty for maybe making a mess.  I crawled around on my hands and knees with toilet paper determined to clean up anything that needed cleaning up.  Fortunately, I found no mess and my clothes were dryI think. 

Somewhere over the next two hours, W cooked dinner while I lolled in and out of consciousness on the couch.  The smell of cooking meat was vile and the cilantro was so pungent it was painful.  

T: 7:30 W told me the next day that around this time I was starting to reincorporate and kept making suggestions of what I might like to do.  I had no ideas.  I was still profoundly incapacitated, so he had to walk me everywhere.  He had this amazing patio with outdoor flame heaters.  I found myself unable to tolerate more than the dimmest lighting without actual pain in my eyes and a flooded sensorium.  

As W escorted me around, it occurred to me that this is what it would be like to be old and in a nursing home.  I flashed on a friend of mine who had recently died of cancer and I thought this is probably what he felt like in the last days of being in the hospital.  Oddly, this was not a depressing thought, but a neutral, affect-free observation of what the future might hold.   

W kept trying to engage me in conversation, but I couldnt make words work.  Another flash: like how it must feel to have a stroke.  I was feeling tremendously grateful for Ws diligent caretaking and at the same time guilty for making him have to do what felt like to me such a lot of work.  I kept trying to ask how I could pay him back or what I could do to pay it forward.  He was SO gracious and kept saying he was enjoying himself and felt privileged to be with me during my journey.

T: 9:30 Still unable to make words work very well, control over all my other functions was gradually returning.  I kept asking W to tell me stories.  I was definitely responding to him as a father figure and found great comfort in being treated like a sonwhich is weird because Im probably 20 years older than he is.  

As it was nearing midnight, I could tell W was getting really tired, so I finally convinced him that I was safe to be on my own (as long as he put out all the candles).  He told me I could do what I wanted as long as I promised not to go outside.  At this point I was getting a lot of trails and colorful vibrations at the edges of objects, especially things with bold designs. I really liked this.

My cognitive faculties and motor coordination were still pretty scrambled, so after W went to bed, I wandered around the house remembering how to do things and practicing basic motor skills.  

By about 1AM I felt like food was a thing that could be reintroduced into my reality.  The flavor of pesto on a cracker was sharp, explosive, and rapturous to my entire body.  I practiced locating all the things I had brought with me (phone, iPod, tablet, wallet, glasses, etc.) and was very relieved to discover I was beginning to be able to function again.  I texted some friends to practice word-using, and opined that I had just been through something immense and that I would need some assistance fitting the pieces back together again.

T: 12:00 I was still seeing colors on the edges of things.  My mind was very awake and racing, but not in a speedy kind of way. T: 12:00 I was still seeing colors on the edges of things.  My mind was very awake and racing, but not in a speedy kind of way.  My body was definitely tired.  I decided I was ready to be done with tripping and took 0.5 mg of lorazepam.  This put me to sleep for about 2 hours.  

T: 16:00 I woke up as the sun was rising.  I got dressed and walked down to this AMAZING little beach where families were out with their kids and guys were fishing.  I felt rested, but very inward like I was still not ready to interact with other humans verbally, but being nearby was pleasantly reassuring.   I felt battered, but alert. After a while, W came by on his hoverboard thing.  We went back to his place and had a really nice breakfast, while he filled me in on what happened that I couldnt remember.

Integration: Three days later as I write this, I am still unclear what happened and what it all meant.  I was surprised that after my mind was removed what I found was a deep, endless blackness.  Im wondering if this is what death is like; returning to a black everything/nothingness.  

I puzzled with an impending old age (Im 65yo) and I wonder if I was projecting myself into that possibility.  I am realizing that I have a lot of anxiety, not about dying but about being incapacitated and in pain.  Perhaps I don't have anything to fear? I had a lot of energy in me that needed release.  Why it came out in tears and shaking/spasming electricity I have no idea.  

There are a lot of unresolved feelings relating to my dad and a strong desire to be forgiven by him that were definitely needing to be experienced.  Pervasive was a yearning to be taken care of by a man.

This is a report of my most profound psychedelic experience. I recorded as much of it as I could in my journal the day after it happened so that I wouldnt forget any of the finer details. 

As most people reading this already know, words dont really capture the real significance of a powerful psychedelic trip, but writing it out really helped me process what I saw and felt and the post-trip confusion thats made it so hard for me to leave this experience in the past. 

Set:
After an exhausting first year at college, I was more than ready to unwind for the summer. It had been a great year, but towards the end of it I felt like I desperately needed to escape the chaos of campus life. Unfortunately, things were just as chaotic back home. My friends were getting into legal trouble and my folks were going through some kind of mid-life crisis, so I bought a train ticket with what little money I had and went to live with one of my closest friends. 

About a month before school, I moved back to campus to live in my fraternity house with a couple of brothers that had stayed for the summer. It was a very empowering place; seven of us had the whole two-building compound to ourselves until fall. I was having a great time when I first arrived, but in the back of my mind I knew that the fun wouldnt last forever. I was spending way too much money on weed, my relationship with my family was terrible, and the shitty campus job I had was barely supporting me. All of that on top of the fact that I wasnt at all prepared for the school year? I was digging my own grave. But things just didnt seem... serious. That was definitely about to change.

July 5th: Night of the Trip (Setting)
Independence Day was brutally fun. When the next day rolled around only a few guests, some beer cans, and a beautifully pungent American pride remained in our courtyard. I woke up just before sunset to the sound of fireworks launching into the sky like the bombs that inspired the Star Spangled Banner. While I smoked away my hangover on the roof and thought about what to do with the long night that lay ahead, a strange and yet all too familiar feeling took hold of me, and maybe instinctively, I knew it was time to trip again. 

This is where shit gets weird. One of my more interesting frat brothers (Ill call him Carter) approached me not an hour later with an offer to trip if I could pay for three tabs of acid. This was really strange given that we werent very close and I hadnt hit anybody up yet. Meant to be, or mere coincidence? Im not so sure, but needless to say I accepted his offer. By now the stars were coming out and the frat was mostly empty. It was a clear, calm night. 

Wed be giving the third tab to a brother Ill call Mikey. It would be his first time tripping. Together, Carter and Mikey formed a duo that was both feared and loved throughout our small Greek community for the crazy shit they would pull at parties. They were filth at its finest; it would undoubtedly be a trip to remember. 

Trip Report
We dropped the tabs in Carters apartment directly across the street from the frat around 9:30 PM. I was somewhat skeptical of the whole situation. I actually snuck my tab off my tongue after about ten seconds, hid it in my sock, and eventually ended up committing and swallowing the whole thing. Small white blotter. No taste. We did not test it, so I can only assume that it was LSD. There were no other drugs in my system other than THC and alcohol. 

At 10:30, I could literally feel the come up in my bones. Colors were a little more saturated, my perception was remarkably clear, and I had a gut feeling similar to the one I get when Im locked in and slowly ascending the first hill of a roller coaster. Things were moving smooth and predictably except for a slightly delayed onset, so the three of us giggled our way back over to the frat in a quest for some joint cones.

By the time we arrived at the back door, my depth perception was all kinds of fucked up. We tried to play some basketball but the hoops were suddenly twenty feet tall and swaying like palm trees in the wind. My peripherals were very wide; I could extend both arms all the way out on either side, look forward, and still see my hands. There was also some faint color pulsating. 

Out of nowhere, a powerful rush started to wash over my body and the stereotypical I took too much moment was suddenly upon me. Without saying a word to my tripmates, I decided to go inside and lie down. In hindsight, I should have just said something and stayed with my dudes, because this is where things took a sharp turn for the worse. 

I entered the nearest room to find my fraternal big brother (mentor) and his friend smoking and drinking beers on the couch. The room is dark except for a few candles and the harsh light of the TV. The various bongs, bottles, and fast food on the coffee table had multiplied into a sprawling city (not a metaphor, literally a city) of glass and paper that seemed to emphasize how much I smoke weed and eat junk food. I laid on the bed in the corner of the room and stared at the television in horror as Joe Dirts mullet became a cascading waterfall of smaller and smaller Joe Dirt faces. It was my first time watching the movie, and needless to say, it made absolutely no fucking sense. At this point I had become an alien in a humans body, so I tried to fit in with the other people in the room by laughing when they laughed too, but it only made them more suspicious of my true identity. 

As my body began to tense up and sweat, a few dudes from down the block came in and bought some weed. I hallucinated a caravan of maybe twenty strangers that had come with them to make fun of me for being so fucked up; they all stood around my bed and laughed at my discomfort.

My mind started to spiral into psychedelic insanity as I realized too late that the fraternity might not have been the most stable place to do this shit. Its typically a comfortable environment for me but the lack of privacy and slightly occult atmosphere were quickly becoming overbearing. I closed my eyes in an attempt to calm down and was greeted by swirling geometrics and pulsing white lights so bright they should have blinded me. 

I opened my eyes to find that the walls of the room had completely disappeared into an inky black, endless darkness. The ceiling, now freed of the constraints of walls, stretched high above my head at odd angles where it typically lay flat. It looked and felt like I was in a completely new place. Left and right nauseatingly merged into a single, impossible direction, but I could still somewhat distinguish between up and down. 

I eventually forced myself out of bed and went to my own room. After changing out of my sweat soaked clothes, I checked my phone. It was only 11:45. My body was doing okay but my mind wanted this chemical gone. I went outside and projectile vomited what appeared to be toxic green slime. With my tripmates nowhere in sight, I was forced to surrender to the house once more and decided to lay down in an empty room. I must have been delusional at this point, because my goal was to just... go to sleep. I turned off the lights and laid flat on my back, alone.

I dont really know what happened next. I think I passed out and had a kind of fever dream of a tall red figure asking me if I was ready to die. Some of my friends think this was Satan, but I dont think so; the figure didnt come across as menacing. When I chose to return to Earth, I almost immediately woke up. I checked the time again. 12:00 AM.

The trip definitely switched gears after that. I knew there were a few bad vibes to overcome, but I was suddenly much more comfortable in my intoxication given that Id literally just defeated death. How much worse could it get?

I crept back to my bigs room and found him alone and passed out drunk. Rick and Morty provided the only light in the room. I sat on the couch and became transfixed by the implications of modern entertainment, the shows trippy themes and tense dialogue quickly plunging me back into madness. At this point I figured the bad trip would never end and that Id been banished to some form of chemical Hell. Just as I accepted my fate, around 12:15 or so, Carter and Mikey burst into the room.

Carter saw what was happening and pulled me off the couch, the two of them surprisingly calm and collected. I didnt get the impression that they were tripping as hard as me, but they also hadnt thrown themselves head first into introspective darkness. Instead, they had gone to a nearby river to shoot firework mortars into the sky and had even managed to smoke a few more joints. When I initially chose to go inside and abandon my fellow trippers in favor of solitude, I destined myself for that dark journey. Once we reunited and their playful, energetic presences put me back at ease, I was finally able to succumb to the more positive power of the drug as we wandered the streets like the sweaty, tweaked out acid heads we were. 

By 1:30 or so, the three of us had walked a mile or two around town and ended up on top of a parking garage. It was a god damn miracle that I was keeping up with them while we walked, let alone that I was able to navigate and hold a conversation amidst constant warps in what seemed like space and time itself, but my motor skills were totally intact. It was a warm summer night, and I found great solace in the breeze as we looked down on the streets below us. 

Mikey was taking it like a champ. He was showing the signs of a typical first timer, occasionally laughing about how crazy we probably seemed to the rest of the world. When I looked in Carters eyes, I saw something else entirely. Whatever visited me that night seems to have visited him as well, but it was apparently not his first encounter. This made me wonder; how much control over the trip do we really have? All I was looking for was a light show, yet there I was, unbelievably more fucked up than I had ever been in my entire life. Mikey provided some sobering insight as we hiked back to safety:

Dude. I get it. I never understood how you could just end up homeless as fuck, wandering around all the time like a lunatic. It makes perfect sense now. Fuck weed, fuck crack fuck all that shit bro. This is insane. If you got a hold of this stuff and you werent ready, what the fuck would it do to you?

What would it do to you? I have always had good plugs, good friends, and a stable environment to trip in, but all of my experiences with psychedelics paled in comparison to this and it was one of my less risky endeavors. I have always had good plugs, good friends, and a stable environment to trip in, but all of my experiences with psychedelics paled in comparison to this and it was one of my less risky endeavors. You could secretly slip someone a pot brownie for the first time and scare the hell out of them, but what happens when you give someone drugs like this when theyre not ready? Most of the people I know going around looking for acid are average partiers just looking for some cool colors, euphoria, and whatever else might be bundled in a lower intensity trip. These people (myself included) are usually looking for more of an MDMA / Molly high, but they dont know how to describe it effectively, especially if theyve never taken any kind of psych. It got me thinking about how my brothers and I typically make fun of the old homeless men that wander aimlessly around the city covered in dark and mysterious tattoos, but now the three of us had joined them on their endless march. The only difference was that when we finally couldnt drag our bodies any further, we had a place to rest until normal life resumed.

We got back to Carters apartment just before 2:00 AM. We took refuge in the same room we had started the trip in, but things were much different than when wed first popped our tabs. Though it was unbelievably dirty and unkempt, Carters room provided the three of us the protection we now desperately needed in order to stop thinking about the outside world. Here we had air conditioning, tons of trippy posters to look at, and bean bags on which we could finally let our brutalized bodies rest. At this point I assumed that wed passed the peak, but it certainly didnt look like that was the case. 

As we all finally relaxed and let the acid do its work, something began to change. Instead of geometric chaos or the usual breathing, I saw objects for what they were, yet they were imbued with some indescribable psychedelic power. The room we sat in could have been no bigger than 10x10 feet, but it felt as spacious as an empty ballroom, like I was looking up at a ceiling hundreds of feet above me. The disco lights that spun around us seemed to really be enjoying themselves, and occasionally, they would emit a playful laughter similar to the sound of wind chimes. The posters on the walls did not morph or spasm. Instead, they were buzzing with electric color and pure, radiant beauty, but it was a calm and controlled beauty, almost as if the acid had applied a trippy filter to my everyday vision. When I looked out of the windows, all I saw was an infinite field of stars in every direction. It seemed that the three of us had literally lifted off into space.

The ornamental hookah that towered in the middle of the room shimmered with what I can only refer to as electric rainbows. It was blowing a ridiculous amount of smoke. The clouds we puffed would cascade between our bean bags and pool up on the floor like fog rolling through mountainous valleys thousands of feet below us. My pupils were so wide that it almost hurt, but apparently we had ascended past pain into a place where only orgasmic pleasure existed; it literally felt like I was having a full body orgasm. 

The whole thing was very Promethean, like I was experiencing something that humans are usually not allowed to be a part of. It was also very ritualistic. It was as if the Universe had selected me for some kind of honorable cosmic initiation, but this may just be my egos way of viewing it. It definitely made me feel like a badass when it struck me that I was probably the first in my familys bloodline to ever experience this kind of ecstasy, but the term badass falls short of what I felt to be the absolute epitome of cool. I had tapped into the galactic heart of eternal youth and it filled me with a power that I still have absolutely no words for. Lightning literally shot forth from the heavens and struck me with envy, for I had somehow stumbled upon Gods power without believing in God or even knowing that such a thing was possible. (Im trembling as I wright this.) The energy around us was so palpable that I honestly thought a sober person might walk in and scream in horror at the crazy shit that was going down, when in reality they would have seen no more than three stoners on some bean bags. Crazy shit, man. 

At one point I felt like our brains were merging into a single unit through some kind of sexual mind-mechanism. A beam of pure energy shot through my skull like a beacon in the night that I could have sworn was visible for miles! Had we left the house to find crowds of cheering people congratulating us on winning life, I would not have been surprised. 

I did my best to just let it all happen. The three of us didnt say much for an hour or so but the emotion in the room was palpable and plain in our bewildered facial expressions. Carter handed me a Mountain Dew, and as my hand touched the can and connected the two of us for but a brief moment, the entire room became submerged in a bubbly green liquid. Other than some accents of pink here and there, literally everything in the room turned a brilliant green. Carters long, wavy hair began to float as if we were really underwater. This was by far one of the most incredible things Ive ever witnessed. It was more than just a lucid hallucination... His hair was really floating, his tattoos impossibly meaningful hieroglyphics. He radiated cosmic power.

I was fucking awestruck. Behind Carter, through a veil of soda bubbles, I could see that we were still in space. I wanted to get up and stick my head out of the window to see how far wed gone, but I was far too overwhelmed to move. Lightning struck again, this time bringing with it a shower of candy, the kind youd see in a childrens cartoon. The little candies danced around me, twirling the fog of the hookah in their wake, each cloud now glowing neon blue. Youth seemed to be an important motif behind this part of the trip, and in an ironic way, it felt like what was left of my innocence was being utterly obliterated by witnessing such fantastic magic. 

Ever since the moment wed returned from our excursion to the parking garage, two gigantic speakers had been pumping out an intense mix of hyper-charged EDM that seemed to propel us higher and higher with every beat. It was an impossibly energetic music that seemed to pair perfectly with the carnival of colors that swirled around me, hypnotizing me. I thought about how electronic music might be the perfect psychedelic soundtrack for the modern tripper with its never-ending, constantly evolving sound. At least, it was perfect for the three of us.

Time melted away and for what seemed to be an eternity, we sat in that room, the rest of the city fast asleep as we soared to unimaginable heights. By the time the sun was rising, around probably 6:00 AM, Mikey had gone home. With one of our sacred acid bonds severed for good, me and Carter fell awkwardly back to Earth as we smoked one last joint and talked about the trip. At the time, I was so blown away that I didnt really say much. I sort of expected the credits for my life to roll and someone to shout, Thats a wrap!  Instead, Carter left me with this: Now you know what its like to be as high as humanly possible. He said it so causally that it gave me the chills.

By 8:00 AM, only an afterglow remained aside from the generally weird feeling I had after seeing such crazy shit. I bid Carter farewell and went back across the street to my room in the frat. After taking an hour long, steaming hot shower, I laid down for a while in shock. My phone fell behind the bed that Id watched Joe Dirt on, and it would take me a week to find it, but thats probably a good thing. The enormity of what Id witnessed made me want to call my mom, call my dad, call 911, fucking ANYBODY. Did no one see my skull beacon?!

The next few days were unreal. Smoking weed made me pretty uncomfortable and I was even more reserved than usual. After deciding to go back home and work on myself before tackling school, I did a fair amount of research on psychedelics. Without the internet and its treasure trove of resources, I would have gone insane. 

This trip changed my life. I gambled and won big time, but I also got a preview of how bad it hurts to lose, and even though I say I won, theres still a price to pay. I cannot share the true nature of what I saw; there are literally no words for it. Ive never seen it captured in paintings or photos. Ive heard it in some songs, but still... Its not the same. Dont underestimate these drugs.

So, there yah go. Im counting the days till I can blast off again, but I figure its best to save such bold adventures for a future me, so Ive decided to wait until Im at least 25. Thanks for reading, and peace!!!

The Cheshire cat lounged upon my tongue as I waited. A thousand teeth lit up the cavern of my mouth, anticipation speeding through my veins like a rocket. For the fifth time that minute I inspected my stereo. 11:44 AM, it replied, and I imagined its disapproval. 

Kids these days, it would mutter, stealing a patronizing glance in my direction before leaving my imagination and becoming lifeless once more. 

The Cheshire cat yawned. Had it pumped its secrets into my body yet? The stigma against psychedelics intrigued me, and eventually led to this day. I idly traced random shapes upon my living room coffee table, waiting for the trip to take me away. Hallucinogens dont just happen- I let the tab sit on my tongue, and then I wait. And wait. And wait. 

Impatience ripped at my throat, a strange viper that showed no mercy. Defensively, I rose from the couch and paced around the room, fumbling at my cell phone, glancing at the piano, now the bookshelf, now the TV, attempting to trigger whatever this experience would turn out to be. How much longer? My mind and body were upset with me. They wanted a release.

My eyes trailed to the Oriental rug. Burgundy, honey colored rings and wavy lines danced across its length. Isnt it insane how our brain gives us the ability to distinguish these patterns? And what exactly are patterns anyways? My mind was lost in thought while my eyes danced along the fabric. This is just a photograph of life itself, I mused, like how I get fucked over, again and again and again. The brown and reddish lines were swimming in the larger pools of the cream colored background. For a second, I had the weirdest urge to jump into the carpet and surf along the shores of the fractals I saw. After weeks of what was the bastard child of agony and numbness, I felt connected. And god damn did it feel GOOD. I let out a sigh of relief which echoed electrically through the currents of my body. Energy. I had to move. I broke my trance with the rug and rose from the living room floor- I hadnt even realized I sat myself down. I traversed to the kitchen, and there, in all its glory, lay my iPod. 

Why werent you listening to music before? My mind ventured, irritated. 

Milliseconds later, my headphones were on, and Radiohead was blasting through my skull in a dazzle of alien time signatures and chords that have yet to be named. Normally, I wouldnt listen to Radiohead- I couldnt understand their music and thought it was overly obscure. And there I was, staring into space listening to the ambience penetrating my eardrums. It smashed into me like a brick wall. The jigsaw fell into place out of absolutely nowhere. While I normally had no sense of rhythm, beats were beginning to reveal themselves to me and the strangeness became oddly clear; music was redefining itself. 

Wow, I whispered, and it was in this stretched out moment that the world opened her dreamy eyes and let me in. Having remembered the ever-sleepy Cheshire cat, I opened my mouth-cavern and pried the feline off my tongue. I couldnt help but stare at the now faded contour that made up its face. Just like in Alice in Wonderland, its body was nearing invisibility, while its infinite grin tore through my field of vision. 'Couldnt you have given me five more minutes?' The teeth didnt move, but the cat seemed aggravated- the disappearing curves and lines were writhing around like wet noodles. It disturbed me, so I tossed the tab into the garbage, cat and all. Well, that takes care of that. Its extremely unnerving to have inanimate objects be unhappy with you, so I left the kitchen, returning to the living room in search of adventures. 

The rug was literally throwing a dance party- I could see every thread and seam moving in unison with each other, swaying to my music. 

'How can you hear my music from all the way down there?' I was mystified. 

Its because you are one in the same with the rest of existence, and you never bothered to realize that, Life responded nonchalantly. Its because you are one in the same with the rest of existence, and you never bothered to realize that, Life responded nonchalantly. If reality was truly based on perspective and perspective only, life had a point- everything around me was changing its shape based solely on what I was hearing. The wooden panels of my floor resembled nighttime on the fourth of July- the warped oak was expanding, contracting and wiggling around, and within the crazed orgy of movement I could discern faces that had no distinct features other than the emotions they conveyed- that one was happy, this one afraid, that one surprised- there were millions of them. And though they all were so different, they were the same. I had once again managed to sink to the floor, a fluid motion that felt like an elongated second. Once down, the floor became a cloud and the faces floated around me. I couldnt feel myself sitting, which was odd, because I knew I was. 

This isso weird. 

Did I just say that, or did I simply think it? I couldnt tell, because Radiohead was set on grabbing my attention. My hands rose, and I began to conduct. Every swish and hand movement felt like a tectonic plate moving across millions of miles. The wooden faces danced to my conducting, changing their emotions and expressions every beat. I was a maestro. The synthesized music was reaching a climax and my head was rushing like a coaster in mid-drop. My hands became blurs, leaving salmon pink trails behind them every time I moved. Like comets. A benign pit in my stomach lifted me upwards, begging me to move. I couldnt resist. Why would I refuse? and walked straight to my front door. My hand reached for the doorknob, its cold metal touch seeped through my skin, shooting through my body like an icicle. I was a snowman, but I could move. The door opened, my feet moved forward (though I couldnt feel them) and the world was reborn. 

A bright, white light shredded my retinas, but I wasnt blinded- I was seeing life for the first time. When the white smoke cleared, the colors that emerged sent me spiraling into a thousand thoughts that had no beginning, end or middle. Although late December was generally dreary in the Northeast, todaytoday was breath-taking. The strip of forest across the street was glowing, the bark much more purple than the brown it was supposed to be. Rather than seeing every tree as an individual, I saw them as a unified entity- they were melting to the ground while simultaneously shooting upwards. Mesmerized, I hadnt even remembered to put my coat on and descended the stairs, zombie-like, towards the trees. The magenta branches were waving at me, holding hands, dancing underneath a sky that was burning sapphire. They were beckoning, calling my name, and it rustled through the wind which blew through my face. 

Come to us, they called, in a voice that was not verbal- it was too ancient to be auditory, for the trees were so very old and did not have the ability to speak. It wastelepathic.

'How long have these trees been here for?' My mind asked me. 

Who knows? I responded, walking across the asphalt street which looked more like a stormy sea of blackness. You think these trees are old? You do realize that there are redwoods that were born centuries ago? You cant even begin to perceive a grain of time. 

The trees were now in front of me, tall and looming. I walked beside them, without any particular destination in mind. I was too involved in my surroundingsbut why? What did this mean? Why was I so transfixed on these trees? This asphalt? I still couldnt feel my feet, but I sensed the movement. My mind was trailing into millions of directions at once, and at some random moment it hit me. 

I am being watched.

This thought invaded every fiber of my being instantaneously, without any warning. It reminded me of those times when I was a child, when Id face one direction in my sleep, petrified that a monster was about to rip my head off from behind me. But I didnt have eyes in the back of my skull, so it could happen at any minute. And I knew it would- I felt its eyes searing through my spine, eyeing my body like fresh meat.

This is ridiculous, I muttered. Was my voice shaking? Why? Why? My mind was chattering and I longed for it to shut up.

IMBEINGFOLLOWEDRUNAWAYIMBEINGFOLLOWED. 

The feeling hit me once more like a thousand knives. ITS GOING TO EAT ME AND GOBBLE ME UP. I jumped, whirled around, and came face to face with no one. I could have SWORN someone was behind me. Whats going on? Why is this happening? I didnt like these feelings. I jumped, whirled around, and came face to face with no one. I could have SWORN someone was behind me. Whats going on? Why is this happening? I didnt like these feelings. Uneasiness was now joining this new found paranoia and as I turned to seek comfort in the branches of the forest, uneasiness turned into pure fear. The branches that were purple just seconds before had become dark brown bramble and thorns dripping a black substance that oozed out of the pores of the bark. The thorns rose from the forest floor and were reaching out, reaching AT me, trying to grab me- each thorn was a spike that splintered off into a thousand other little thorns. They didnt have mouths, and yet their mouths were foaming. They were after me. I heard myself losing control and screamed. Had I been rational, I would have realized just how loud I was. And the trees spoke to me.

Poor little girl, got yourself lost in Oz, have you? it was the most malicious voice. It enjoyed my pain, it enjoyed my suffering. It wanted me to be afraid, and it wanted to get me. It fooled me into thinking it was behind me but GOD no it was NEXT TO ME. Oh my GOD. I felt fear physically for the first time- boiling lead poured down my mouth, my throat and spread into my esophagus tingling every nerve it could find. It controlled me and I tried to run, the world around me losing color by the second, becoming more and more alien. I ran, crossing streets, and roads, how fucked up I must have seemed, how so very crazy and manic. The trees were behind me, laughing, screaming and pointing their oozing, broken fingers at me.

COWARD! COWARD! COWARD! their words hit me like bullets and panic was holding me down. I wanted to fall into the pavement (which now seemed translucent and blue) and hide. But I kept going. Before I knew it, my phone was in my hand, and I was struggling to remember numbers. 

What are numbers? WHAT ARE THEY? Mind shrieked, and the touch-screen was swirling with pixels that I couldnt understand. After mindlessly punching in random digits and tearing my headphones off, I somehow managed to dial my friend, Karen. The phone was ringing, but to me it sounded like a blaring horn, blazing at a million decibels. I was still walking, though my legs now felt like pieces of steel. I was molasses, and I could barely move. As the horn ravaged my ear, I was nearing the a local Pond. 

Itsthe best placethe safe place. Itll be better. Right? Right? I couldnt answer my minds whimpering, because I didnt know. I didnt know ANYTHING. I was a fool, and I was weak. I was a single human being, a human being plagued by madness and panic. 

Hello? Karens voice drifted from the metal pressed against my face into my head.

Help me. Im having a bad trip on acid. Help. I babbled pathetically. My voice sounded robotic- it wasnt my voice. I was losing my sense of identitythat wasnt my voice. 

THATS NOT MY VOICE my mind was nearly wetting itself. But it wasnt my mind anymore.

Youre what?! Try and calm down. Its just a drug. 

HOW CAN YOU SAY ITS JUST A DRUG? I shrieked, and a couple birds flew out of a tree nearby. Their beaks dripping blood, and their faces were skeletal, burning through me with gazes that sent the urge to vomit straight through my system.

Calm down. Youre overreacting. Where are you? 

I couldnt even respond. My throat was closed, closed by adrenaline, sewn shut by the fractals that were dancing through my peripheral vision. I didnt want to answer her because:

Shes in on it. This is a scheme. Mind said to me, and each word it spoke sent another jab of panic down my spine. Theyre all in on it. They want me to go crazy. Every single one of them. Im fucked up. Im dead. GAME OVER 

My phone slammed to the ground and I followed. I saw a girl lying on the pavement by the pond. Contracted into the fetal position, rocking back and forth like a boat in a storm. Muttering gibberish. Was this me? Suddenly, I lost sense of existence. I was staring out into the world, but I couldnt comprehend what that was. I just saw colors, lines and shapes. I didnt know I was lying on the street, and I didnt know what I was. I didnt know I. I blinked, blinked and blink, and then every negative emotion and every positive emotion ever created rushed deep inside my brain and exploded there. If I was able to comprehend physicality, I would have screamed, but I just lay there, mental shrieks bouncing off my brain and into the nothingess of my minds oblivion. It was the loudest mute sound I had ever heard and it was tearing my insides apart. My organs melted and oozed out of my body. I took the damage. I was no longer seeing the physical world. I was seeing photographs of my past, but not visual picturesit was more like a bats echolocation. Quick, sharp, blinking visions of rainbows and spectrums that was epileptic by nature. They spoke to me. 

'Who are you?'

II dont know, I replied. All I could think about was how pathetic I was, and how broken and crazed. 

'Why dont you know?' The rainbows pulsated whenever they spoke, the colors shifting and changing with no actual order. They understood that patterns were simply figments of a humans need to comprehend the world around them.

Because nothing actually makes sense. Thats why. Im crazy. And hated. 

The rainbows grumbled. They didnt care for human emotions, for they had transcended that. 

'You shouldnt be here.'

Those words stung like the black ooze that poisoned the evil trees from hours ago. No. I shouldnt be here. Then the bile came like a flood, and I vomited. Again, I had no vision, but I could feel the panic and absolute fear pouring out of my body with the fluids torrentially. It was never ending, and the rainbows simply observed. 

What did it matter if I was dying? I asked of them. Does it really matter? Im one fucked up human being, and Ill be dead in minutesthe world is so unified, so BIG, and I know that you will go on and the world will be alrightisnt that all that matters?

The rainbows continued to exist, not answering me. Shadows without origin or fire leapt to and fro, adding dimensions to the colors. I remembered the trees again, and my self-loathing contradicted my feelings of unity with the world. I was a self-loathing martyr. My ego would die, and so would my bodybut the world would go on, with one less screw-upone less me. 

The rainbows faded, and I gained my sense of my physical surroundings. Panic still controlled me, regardless of the serenity the rainbows emanated- their tranquility was NOT for me, and my madness was growing like a tumor.

Go home. NOW. Intoxicated by emotion, I grabbed my phone, unaware of the fourteen missed calls from Karen and began to walk from the way I came. The road beneath me stretched like a rubberband and it didnt end. It kept goingonand onmy legs started running but the road wouldnt end. This was a nightmare. My mind was shrieking again, shrieking at this abomination, why the HELL were the laws of physics breaking down? This was a nightmare. My mind was shrieking again, shrieking at this abomination, why the HELL were the laws of physics breaking down? The road was sucking me under and I struggled to keep my head above the current. The asphalt was reaching out, calling my name like those god damn trees. It wasnt going to end. This road is infinite. My heart was beating faster than 500 beats a second and I was losing my mind. I am a fool. I am pathetic. This road was my punishment.

Millennia later, my house (resembling an amalgamation of shapes) came into view. 

Its going to feel betteronce I go inside. The doctor inside to me lied. I braved the stairs, glancing back into the strip of trees that destroyed me at the beginning of this nightmare and entered my house. It all seemed so different from this morning, but I couldnt comprehend my surroundings very well. The world was spinning not unlike a carousel and I stumbled to the bathroom to continue my vomit fest. The bathroom tiles were no longer just in the wall- they were moving in and out of their natural places, almost 3D, while others seemed invisible. The square tiles on the floor were becoming circular. I was melting into them. The toilet chuckled and I lost whatever sanity I had left.

Screaming, I ran into my room, bundling myself in my green comforter, only to be greeted by thousands of spiders that crawled on me, in me, and into my skin. I was dying. This was fear at its worst and I was losing my mind. Foaming at the mouth. This had to be over soon, right? Right? Then Ill be okayI wont be crazy anymore, right, Doc? Right? Frantically, I looked across the room to my clock on the wall. Everything was buzzing a deep red, angry, infuriated, and evil. It wanted to end me. 

The clock read 12:30 PM. 

45 minutes had gone by, 

and I had eight hours to go.

The LSD had no intentions of stopping.

LSD had always fascinated me since I had first read about it in Ram Dass's book Be Here Now.  I never seemed to be able to find it in my area, and prior to this first experience, I had only tried marijuana and mushrooms.  When the chance came to purchase two hits of liquid LSD on altoids, I immediately took the offer.  I was uncertain of the strength of each hit, so I decided that I would take one, wait for the effects, than either take the second or give it to my friend B depending on the quality.  

I waited until the weekend, and met up with two friends, J and B, around 2 in the afternoon.  I took my first altoid hit around this time, letting it sit under my tongue and dissolve.  My friends and I sat in my room until I started to feel different, at which point I decided it would be best to distance myself from my unknowing family and go for a walk.

J took us on a quick drive to a local park, where we got out and began to walk through the woods.  The first effects of the LSD manifested in how I perceived the clouds- they seemed  very flat, and I could see very defined rays of light shining down between them.  In the forest, the trees seemed to be convulsing in unison, bending in towards me against the wind.  I had experienced similar 'breathing' effects on mushrooms, and I decided that I wanted to surpass that previous experience, so I took the second hit.  At this point it was about 3:00, an hour after my first hit. 

Another friend of ours called and told us he had the house to himself for several hours, so we decided to head over to his place.  On the walk back to the car, the paths in the park seemed to have stretched out since my previous walk through them, and the mud under my shoes had a much stranger feeling.  The clouds had begun to warp, and turn in on each other, almost forming a tunnel.

By the time we got to the car, I was truly starting to trip.  Time seemed incredibly slow, and the music playing through the car stereo took on new dimensions.  The sound seemed deeper, and the directional mixing of each song became much more distinct.  My companions decided that they were going to pick up some weed, as well as some food at the local grocery store.

Upon arriving at the grocery store, my trip took a turn for the worse.  I am not sure whether it was that I was simply overwhelmed by the experience, or if the way I staggered my doses altered things, but I became very confused.  The grocery store was crowded, and in my state, the crowding was further amplified.  I kept losing my train of thought as I was distracted by dozens of signs and fellow shoppers.  My friends chose a few snacks then went to the express aisle.  While standing in line with them, I felt sudden rushes of anxiety and confusion.  Every object that had the potential to carry an image (mirrors, windows, television screens, electronic cash registers) seemed to flash pictures and words at me at blindingly fast rates.  I felt as if I could not properly feel my body, and that at any moment I would soil myself without realizing it, in the middle of a crowded grocery store.  

I told my friend B that was I feeling very lost and that he needed to stay with me.  We moved through the line (which felt like eternity), and quickly left the store.  Out in the parking lot, J and B met up with their dealer and purchased their weed.  We drove to our friend's house and went into his basement at around 4 PM.  

My confusion and fear had reached new heights, and I lay down on his couch and tried to relax as the rest of my companions played video games.  When I closed my eyes I was overwhelmed with visions of writhing patterns and shapes, of many different colors.  Time seemed to slow to an almost unbearable level - I would open my eyes, gradually remember who I was, where I was, and what I had taken, then look at the clock and realize not even a minute had passed, although it had felt like I had my eyes closed for hours.  This process repeated itself seemingly hundreds of times over the next two hours, and I was sure I was going to go insane.  I kept telling my friend B that I was scared, and that maybe I should just go back to my own house, just so I was safe.  I was certain that at any moment, I would forget everything and be forgotten by everyone - that I would cease to exist. The prospect of that ego-death was horrifying to me, and the resulting resistance I had to it led to the greatest sense of fear and confusion I have ever felt in my life.  

During this time spent on the couch, I did experience interesting visual and auditory hallucinations.  My friends were playing the video game 'Rock Band', which can have four players playing instruments at once.  When I focused on the screen long enough, it seemed as if the virtual singer on the screen was standing next to me, and singing specifically to me.  Also, noises made by my friends eating or newly arriving friends entering the house, seemed to sync up with the songs played by the video game, creating new and wild beats.  

Because of the near arrival of parents at this particular house, and given my terrified state, my friends decided it would be best to find a new place to stay at.  At around 6:30 PM, J and B drove me to another friends house, who happened to have a gigantic basement, complete with a ping pong table, air hockey table, huge TV, and tons comfortable furniture.  My girlfriend met up with us at this house, and her presence seemed to comfort me slightly.  However, the real turning point in my trip was when I decided to start playing air hockey.  By applying myself to the world around me, instead of reclining on a couch, I seemed to convince myself that I truly did exist.  The LSD allowed me to play with an unparalleled amount of focus, and I had realizations about myself and the game.  The LSD allowed me to play with an unparalleled amount of focus, and I had realizations about myself and the game.  I saw how air hockey perfectly demonstrated newtons law of motion, that each and every force had an equal and opposite force.  A fast shot on an air hockey table can easily reflect back with the same speed, and the puck is kept in constant motion.  My opponents seemed to try to force their will on the puck, hitting it aggressively, and it only seemed to cause them to score on themselves.  I saw that the way to win was to merely redirect the force and move with the puck, as opposed to forcing my own intention on it.  I think this kind of thinking began to apply to my LSD trip as well, because in the process of playing four air hockey games, I lost my former sense of confusion and fear, and began to simply go along with it.  I went undefeated before the table itself overheated and refused to work.

At this point, my other friends left the room, leaving me alone to try and fix the table in vain.  I gave up, and simply sat on the floor and reflected on the experience.  I wasn't sure what time it was, and I thought maybe my acid had started to wear off, which would explain why I felt so peaceful compared to earlier.  However, as soon as I thought that, the tiles underneath me began to warp.  The darker brown stripes of the tile began to slowly writhe and spread out like liquid.  This dark mass seemed to be made up of many small particles, like a swarm of ants, and it crawled from tile to tile, linking up into a larger mass.  It crawled up the wall, and up my own arm, until the formerly white room was nearly covered in this dark substance.  All at once, it began to swirl in unison, creating a moving pattern on every surface it touched.  Instead of frightening me, I was content and in awe of what I was witnessing.  I left the room to join my friends in the larger part of the basement, and the patterned mass followed me everywhere I looked.  The furry carpet on the floor was breathing peacefully, with each little strand of fabric dancing in the air.  I looked down at my arm and could see the black particles flowing through my veins, and my hairs seemed to grow in and out of my arm. 

These hallucinations were the peak of my experience, and I now felt completely at peace and unafraid.  We left the house around 8:30 and went into a nearby town so my companions could cure their case of the munchies.  The car ride was silent aside from the white noise of the air conditioner, which seemed to form soothing music in my ears.  

When we arrived, I very nearly started down a negative path again.  On a TV next to our table, there was a 'home video' show playing.  These videos showed horrible accidents or acts of violence caught on film, similar to shows like COPS.  I watched a three minute clip of a man nearly burning to death in his car, as well as a bus running over a woman's head.  I was too stunned to speak, and looked around the rest of the restaurant.  The restaurant specializes in buffalo chicken wings, which many of the people sitting nearby seemed to be eating.  The red hot sauce on their faces seemed almost like blood, and they were watching the show intently.  To me they seemed like vicious, bloody animals, enjoying a show of other peoples suffering.  I was disgusted by it, but luckily was saved from further negative feelings by my close friend B's sense of humor.  He was very stoned, and just as surprised as I was that a show like that could even exist.  His commentary on the utter ridiculousness of it entertained me long enough that they could finish eating (I was unable to eat), and we left the restaurant.  

Outside we met up with two LSD-experienced friends of mine, and we all sat down on benches and conversed for the next hour or so.  They shared their experiences and inquired about mine, as well as offering advice.  Both inside the restaurant and outside by the bench, I was seeing patterns on many surfaces.  Inside, the excess hot sauce on the plates seemed to form fractals, and outside the sidewalks swirled with the same dark mass I saw before.  By the time we left town, it was about 10:30 PM, and we decided to head back to my house.

I entered without incident, and spent the next hour and a half just talking with J and B and watching J play computer games.  They both left around 12, and feeling full of energy, I decided I would stay up and listen to music.  I listened to two albums straight through, Lateralus by Tool, and Hail to the Thief by Radiohead.  Both albums sounded amazing - sound was literally orgasmic, and my closed eye visuals were synced with the music. sound was literally orgasmic, and my closed eye visuals were synced with the music.  I listened to some Acid Mothers Temple as well, before deciding it was finally time to get some sleep, because I had work at 10:30 the next morning.  Finding sleep was difficult, but I finally managed to drift off around 4 am.  I woke up the next morning feeling completely refreshed, with no 'burn out' feeling or any residual effects.

Although my trip started out frightening, I felt overall it was a rather enlightening experience.  I had many new and exciting ideas, and realizations about human perception.  In hindsight, I realized that time seemed so slow because of the sheer amount of information I had to process while on LSD.  In normal day to day life, my mind was on autopilot for the most part.  I generally do not think about each bite of food, each single sound, each step, each breath or heart beat.  But on LSD, I was aware of everything, all at once, and my analysis of each sense made me take life second by second, compared to the autopilot I usually am driven by.

To begin this report, I would like to start by mentioning that my journey into the deep word of psychedelic and mind-expanding substances started at the age of 18. First psychedelic I ever used was LSD, at a dosage far greater than I should've had for a beginner. 

In fact, most of my other trips have had a tendency to 'go bad' one way or another, but not inexplicably. It's very apparent to me that all of my bad trips were mostly due to having mixed different substances together, I was in a place I didn't feel safe, I was afraid people would judge me or I would be in an already negative mindset before experiencing the drug(s). Those times really made me figure out things about my psyche and personality that until then were dark, so I really cherish them as a lesson. 

But those times are not what this report is meant for. In between when I first tried acid and now I have had several psychedelic experiences and I would safely say that I have grown accustomed to them. Last time I tried it, was by far my favourite. I loved it so much that I wanted to have it written down while it's still fresh in my head and then go through it as many time as I liked. 

To get all the important pre-trip background info out of the way, we (me and my boyfriend) tripped inside my house, approximately at 15:00 until about 01:00 when we finally slept, but effects really started to wear out noticeably after 8-9 hours of ingestion. Psychologically my mood was in a calm, happy state, I wasn't worrying about much really, I had accomplished some important life goals and was looking forward for this experience, to enter the psychedelic world after a long time. Before ingesting the tab, we had a warm, relaxing bath and had eaten a bowl of cereal approximately 2 hours before. 

When the effects started kick in, my boyfriend was playing video games and I was internet surfing. Gradually I started noticing some changes in the lights, it was as if someone had been messing with the the brightness, turning it higher on. My head felt warm, as if I was sick (I wasn't) and my heart was racing. I also felt very nauseous, but I didn't throw up. Then, I got up from the sofa and started browsing around the house. Body felt heavy and visually I could see light trails, but no distance or size distortion, as in, objects did not seem further, longer etc from what I originally perceived them to be. Colours seemed more vibrant and looking outside the world had an 'electric' feel to it, sometimes my vision would get blurry by all the objects' trails, but in general everything was visually crisper, like my vision jumped to high definition.

 Music played a huge part during the whole experience and really helped set the tone. We listened to all kinds of genres, from psychedelic rock classics, lo-fi to classical, but mainly gravitated towards psytrance, minimal electronic beats and funny or psychedelic music videos. The songs all seemed to coincidentally be about tripping, or we were thinking that all the artist that played them were on drugs. That really cheered as up!

 The first hours of the trip weren't all that great, nothing 'interesting' was happening and the visuals were just mild, also a constant feeling of uneasiness and fear accompanied me. I was having illogical thoughts, mainly that my trip would go bad like all the other times and that my neighbours could hear everything I was doing/saying. But as I was moving closer towards the peak of the experience, I tried to calm myself and abolish such thoughts, by using reasoning, although that last thought of everyone inside a certain km radius could hear us trip sadly accompanied me all throughout the trip. 

The more acute effects hit us simultaneously. Time at moments felt to slow down, music felt pulsing through my body, making me move in a very senseless, deliberate way. I started seeing very distinct hexagonal patterns. At some point, my boyfriend asked me if I felt euphoric, as in if the drug made me feel better and I clearly remember answering that the drug didn't really pushed me into happiness, in a way some stimulants or other psychedelics do. On the contrary, it seemed to enhance what I was already feeling, it expanded on what I was already thinking. It didn't abolish negative thinking, I just had to focus on the bright side or I had to reason my way out of them. I was very in touch with my self, my boyfriend and the world around me, I was more connected to everything than ever. It was easier to see the funny side of many concepts, even death, which I regularly struggle to deal with. It felt so easy to laugh, in fact we were smiling all the way throughout the trip, which is remarkable. I cried so much during this too, out of pure bliss, a state of being that not even the purest MDMA had ever provided. We also teared up because of the extreme pupil dilation. 

That state could better be described by moving and dancing than words. That state could better be described by moving and dancing than words. So through dance we expressed our blissfulness. We danced to psytrance beats, which felt almost ancient and eternal. We were shuffling, I was doing what I could best describe as happy-walking, while playing with my arms and hands making symbols with my fingers. We were screaming and chanting, hugging, our bodies intertwined. Until we had finally reached a point when we wanted to move/dance but were physically exhausted. I remember feeling that at that moment, the wanting to express more, the will to experience more, more and more! The way our bodies smelled, the heat, the sweat, how we were gasping for air. All of that was the psychedelic experience, that couldn't possibly be reduced to simple wording. It was at that moment were I experienced such heavy visuals that I was 'blinded' of my vision of my surroundings for some seconds, I think my eyes went a little to the back of my head. It was blissful, almost mystical. I sat right across to my boyfriend, this time I chose to close my eyes and let the visions wash over me, for a short time. Sometime we lied across the floor, music still playing, looked at the ceiling and felt as if we were in a festival, but really our house was all we needed. Ohm symbols were reportedly witnessed by the both of us. 

What pushed the trip into negative directions at times, was a discomfort I was feeling in my bowels, due to IBS that I was recently diagnosed with. Also the aforementioned fear that my neighbours could hear me trip and the fact that we hadn't eaten anything in several hours. We only drank stupid amounts of water (1.5 litres each). I was fearing food would worsen the cramps I was having at times, also food had never tasted good while on acid before. At around 22:00 my boyfriend could't handle the hunger and made us 2 toasted ham and cheese sandwich. The smell was amazing and toasted cheese tasted otherworldly delicious. That might seem ridiculous, but acid really made me feel 'in the moment', appreciate even the tiniest of sensations, feeling grateful for the simplest of things, in this case eating a ham and cheese sandwich. I could eat so much more but again, I was afraid I'd worsen my condition.

Physical exhaustion finally got the better of us and at around 00:00 we laid in bed, trying to sleep, while still light tripping. My boyfriend didn't have trouble falling asleep, I on the other hand turned to the help of xanax (1 pill) to help me relax. The next morning I realised I should've just been a little more patient with me and not take it, as I felt my head heavier than usual, a sensation not normally felt after a day of acid use, for me.

The following days I experienced an afterglow effect of feeling more connected with the environment and the people I hang out with. The bond I share with my boyfriend also strengthened. For now, I am looking forward to form more psychedelic memories and try to make them as beautiful as this was for me and my significant other, not rushing to the next trip though.

On Friday, the 9th, I turned 27 years old and I had already made up my mind to drop acid for the 15th time in my life. I should mention that this single tab was much stronger than I expected. Maybe more potent than any batch I had had in the past.

Acid was the biggest turning point in my life, converting me from a hardcore atheist to a hardcore theist and then eventually to a tolerant agnostic. Im still agnostic. When I lean toward believing in God I try to practice Sufism: in a nutshell, I seek harmony with everything in my life and see God physically embodied in music. When I lean toward atheism (more often than not,) I practice Buddhism: meditation, yoga, contemplation, seeking mental peace and clarity, alleviating the suffering of others. I frequently incorporate cannabis and stronger entheogens into my spiritual practices. I frequently incorporate cannabis and stronger entheogens into my spiritual practices. Frankly, at this point in my life, I dont really care if God exists. I no longer believe that Gods presence directly affects me via déjà vu and synchronicity, etc. I believe in the inner divinity of the higher self and the teachings of the Buddha. My faith in the spirituality of Buddhism has been totally untouched from the moment I took acid 7 years ago to this day. That includes everything that happened during my trip when practically everything went away from me besides stark, unblinking awareness.

-
Setting: It was a Friday and I took the day off so that I could have the rest of the weekend to recuperate and integrate my experience. I made plans with my friend to go out to the desert of Northern New Mexico with a few possible destinations in mind, but no explicit schedule. He agreed to drive me around for the day, and at 9am he arrived at my house to start the journey.

Mindset: I was optimistic, but a little nervous. Since it had been so long since the last time I took acid I had no feelings of abusing it like I had in the past. I have been working on myself constantly in the intervening years. Spiritually, physically, emotionally, and financially I have tried my best to achieve some stability. I was not really afraid of losing control or going insane. I have had bad acid trips in the past where this was my main preoccupation. On the drive I expressed to my friend that I had a few minor insecurities that may come up, such as the healthiness of my relationship, or my constant feelings of self consciousness. One of my only intentions was to let go of my overly controlling, anal retentive attitude. I managed to eat half a Clif bar before dosing. I wasnt able to eat anything else until after midnight. I drank over a quart of SmartWater throughout the day.

-
Time: 10:30am. We arrived at our first destination, a natural stone amphitheater. The dome is a hundred feet high or more, very wide, and very round. Its like a bowl buried in the ground on its side. After a short and easy walk on the comfortable sidewalk, we arrived at an overlook. After a couple of quick experiments with various musical instruments to hear the echoes they threw, I decided to take one tab of the acid I had acquired last month. I looked straight up at the rim of the amphitheater and the deep blue sky. I was feeling excited. I placed the tab in my mouth.

Coming up: While waiting for the blotter paper to come apart, I hopped over the guard rail and slid down a short hill to a little pit in the middle of the circle at the bottom. He and I carried our various instruments to this pit and laid them out to begin our experiments. I picked up a wooden bongo and played it in time with the echoes bouncing off the walls. We took turns playing my big frame drum that has a long, resonating tone. My didgeridoo didnt reflect much sound because the space was too big and open and the tone too low. I began playing my octave mandolin and was very pleased by the sound. My friend took a short walk back down the sidewalk away from the pit to hear the echoes of my music.

When he came back, we jammed for a little bit and amused the other tourists who came to the overlook to listen. There was a woman playing a flute with us for a while, too. I began to feel slight alterations in my state of mind while playing the mandolin. When I decided to put the instrument down and go for a walk, I noticed that I was definitely already in an altered state. I walked down the sidewalk while my friend continued to drum. The echo became more separated from his playing and more focused the farther I walked. I could still hear him clearly several hundred feet away. I marveled at the gorgeous weather and beautiful colors of rock all around me. The juniper trees were supernaturally green.

I felt even more excited than before and sat down to do a brief meditation on a bench. A couple passed me and we said hi to each other. I was slightly worried they would think we were high if we interacted too much, so I waited a while before walking back. I had a slight trepidation about going back to the pit because of that. Eventually I started walking back, feeling not a whole lot higher than when Id left. We played for a little while more and then packed everything up to go. We were at this first spot for about an hour and a half. It must have been nearly noon.

-
Peak: We started our drive then to a remote monastery in the middle of a long canyon. We turned back onto the highway and took the 13 mile dirt road there all along the Rio Chama. The road was bumpy and the scenery was breathtaking. All the rocks were bright, colorful gradients: greyish yellow, pale to deep red, and dark grey to black. The landscape was littered with bright green juniper trees with indigo shadows. The road was tan dust. The sky was azure with small cloud spotting. There were also some wildflowers in a few bright colors. I remarked to my friend, Rainbows everywhere! Shadows were starting to shift hue and everything was jiggling with the motion of the car. I felt a steady surge of energy moving through my body and I pushed against the floor of the car to use my legs as shock absorbers. The wind was comfortable as it blew through the window and across my face. We were both feeling bold and adventurous.

I had no appetite whatsoever. I knew I wouldnt be able to finish my Clif bar any time soon. I was pretty good about drinking lots of water throughout the day, though. That was a good decision, because I could have easily gotten dehydrated in the desert on this sunny day. Especially when we were exerting ourselves constantly for several hours. The vibrating energy of the car was extremely pleasing for the few hours we were in it. It complemented my state of mind and the energy surging through my body. I felt grounded for the most part whenever we got out to walk around.

We saw various other roads to our left leading down to the river, so we decided to drive down each one to see what was there. First we found a small boat landing. I took off my shoes and dipped my feet in the cool, sage-colored water. At this point I was ecstatic and we were both grinning and laughing constantly. I laid down on the slightly slanted concrete of the boat landing and soaked up the sun for a while, totally at peace. The thin wisps of clouds overhead began to dance and split into fractals. All the visuals I had throughout the day gave me a sense of expansion, patterns gliding cleanly in all directions. I started walking goofily under the inebriation.

As we continued driving, my open and closed eye visuals became much stronger. They formed geometrically perfect fractals, tessellations, spirals, and other patterns. I saw what I thought to be indigenous Mexican motifs, like curving, rectangular eyes or leaves cascading from the bottom left to the top right of my vision. That pattern, hard as it is to accurately describe, pervaded my vision and thoughts for most of the day. It stayed with me throughout the peak and seemed to be opening out at either end to unlimited space within my head.

I invoked the name of Ram Dass and remembered as he described a powerful LSD trip in which he lost all aspects of himself he had come to know so well. As each part of him left, he said to himself, Well at least I still have my body. And at that, even his body disappeared and he was nothing more than a point of awareness. When I thought about that, I too became a point of awareness watching all this happen. I wasnt dissociated (sometimes I start to think that I dont exist at all and begin to completely detach and panic, but not this time) because I knew that nothing had really changed. I still knew that I had a body, but it seemed like I no longer had an ego. I remarked that it seems like acid has the power to erode at everything about you but your core self.

There was a sign that said Whirlpool. He said, Whirlpool?? Do I even need to ask? We took that road without hesitation. The dirt road became a labyrinth of winding paths with dead ends near the river. We never found a definitive whirlpool, but we spent a good amount of time driving around all the criss-crossing roads and ditches. His truck did not struggle at all. During this time, my vision shook loose. Now everything was moving at once. It was like looking through a slinky as the far end undulated in all directions. Every color was pushed to its extreme. More patterns, growing larger every minute, formed on the back of my eyelids. My mood was still happy and euphoric. Starting around this point and continuing for almost the whole day, I had a huge amount of restless energy in my jaw. I had a huge amount of restless energy in my jaw. I couldnt stop opening it wider and wider. The energy kept my jaw chattering in the open position. It reminded me of a previous acid trip where I got severe nervous shivers/tremors and my teeth were chattering uncontrollably. This time it wasnt so scary and I just dealt with it. It even added to my sense of wonder and amazement.

Next we came to a campground. We passed a couple of families and their cars at their sites. We stopped at an empty campsite with a picnic table and walked down to the river again. My friend exclaimed that hed found a rope swing hanging from the tree over the river. I cautiously climbed down, took my shoes off and placed everything that was in my pockets on the ground. I grabbed the rope. It took me a minute or so to find a good place to jump off. I put my foot in one of the loops, held onto the rope, and jumped from the ground out over the river, letting out a whoop. The rope was pretty uncomfortable, and the tree seemed a little flimsy, but it was a huge rush. It was just what I needed to get out of my head for a second. He pulled me in and I carefully got down to give him a chance to go.

After he got down we sat on the river bank for a good while. I stared at a mountain on the opposite side of the river and watched it transform into a painting á la Van Gogh or Georgia OKeeffe. It was constantly moving, the texture of detailed lines or brushstrokes shifting smoothly like the surface of the water. I recalled that I had very recently lost two of my best friends and that this experience was intended to honor them. I was doing my best to enjoy my life to the fullest while I had the time. All this struck me as overwhelmingly poignant and I cried a bit.

We moved on and found a bridge. While walking out over the river, he was talking about the elements: water, fire, earth, wind. The river was rushing below us in grand spirals. Finally we decided to continue on the road and get to the monastery. Although we only saw a couple of cars on our way there, there were a few cars parked and people getting out as we got closer. The architecture was mind-blowing. The walls of the buildings were made from the same rock as the surrounding cliffs. The monastery both blended in and stood out from the landscape. Since I was still peaking, we both decided to just turn around and head back, having seen the monasterys beauty. We had more fun on the drive there anyway.

As we made our way back, we continued to marvel at the beauty of the canyon walls on either side, the mountains in the distance shimmering in the sun, the aspen trees that were bright yellow, the river and its power, and the huge array of colors everywhere. I wondered if it was all real. It seemed too perfect. I took slight consolation in knowing that, sober or tripping, I couldnt be 100% sure that what I was perceiving was real. I do know that the point of awareness that I found out there was as real to me as anything could be, beyond all the subjectivity of perception. After the dirt road ended, we tried to visit a popular retreat center on the other side of the highway, but I decided I wasnt comfortable around so many people. I had hoped to go for a hike there, but since that would involve putting on socks and hiking shoes I figured that would too difficult a task to perform around other people and that could make me panic. We turned around and went to our final destination: Abiquiu Lake.

-
Denouement: We took the truck down to the cliff-jumping spot at one end of the lake. I got out and walked aimlessly around, indecisive. The red sand walls on all sides of the lake appeared to be shimmering and rippling in place. The water was deeper blue than the sky and covered in small waves. To our left was a small, dark cloud. Apart from that, the sun shone brightly through sparse white wisps and puffs of clouds floating just as aimlessly as me. Some of the clouds seemed to be the same shape as the trees and shrubs growing all around. My closed eye visuals were more abstract now. But when I laid out a blanket on the rock and stared up at the clouds again, they formed even more intricate patterns and moved around much more than they had before. I still had impressions of the eye-shaped pattern emerging from and covering everything I could see and then swimming across my field of vision.

My friend decided to jump in the lake from the cliff right in front of us. I was in no real state to do the same. I was afraid that I would become confused as I hit the water, start to panic, and inadvertently drown myself. It was just a thought but I didnt want to find out if there was any truth behind it. He said the water was very cold but he dried off quickly from the sun and the wind. At one point I needed to do some yoga on the rock. I had become too comfortable and needed to engage my body more consciously. Oftentimes things would get serious, or clumsiness or inability to speak my thoughts would present itself and threaten embarrassment. We laughed it off with folksy humor: Aww shit! or Gosh darnit! The good vibes were rolling in full force. They allowed me to flow on and not get stuck in anything negative.

I remembered the sensation that I was all too familiar with: that an acid trip can make me think it will last forever. Not just because it has such a long duration and the power to distort time perception, but because its so subtle and sneaky. Just when I think its over, I see something that makes me think twice. It seemed for several hours that it was coming and going simultaneously. I was hit with constantly contradicting feelings of relief and overwhelming uncertainty. It was extremely disorienting and often a little frightening. Frequently at this point in the trip I lost all sense of time.

We sat on the rock listening to some EDM that melded well with my state of mind. I noticed how lucky we were not to be disturbed by a single person the whole time we were there. It probably would have been difficult for me to handle. Sigur Rós came on a few times, adding even more beauty and awe to the experience. As far as tripping music goes, not much else comes close in my opinion. I was reminded of the poignancy and beauty of life again. I reminisced about one of the first times I came here. I was drunk, high, and tripping on mushrooms. I jumped off the cliff and went for a long swim. We went off-roading in his same truck. It rained beautifully on us. I had a glorious time. He remembered that day too.

The visuals I got while at the lake were incredible. It was like a scene straight out of Natural Born Killers. At one point when I went to pee, I felt like everything was sliding sideways and stretching like taffy. When I was lying down on the blanket and my friend got up to talk about something, it looked like his contrast was turned up, the sky behind him ultra-saturated, his shades reflecting the image of me on the blanket. This whole time I saw tracers made of rainbows following behind everything that moved. His hands gesticulating wildly as he talked, it was like he was putting on a glow stick show for me in the middle of the day. When I looked at my own hands, they seemed fake. Beautiful rainbow trails followed every movement that I made with them. I looked down and saw with amazement that my body kept going, from my arms down to my torso, and then my legs and feet. This is my body, I told myself, only half believing it. I still had a steady connection to my single-pointed awareness, while everything around me was in constant flux. I was heartbroken that our species has allowed the Earth to become so sick. I had an intimation that while Im alive I can envision my core self as being a river of light flowing through all aspects of myself out to everything that I do, and through all the implications those things have for others. When I die, perhaps, I will be nothing but a point in space, fully aware and immaterial.

I guess it was probably around 3pm when we arrived at that spot, and 5pm when we started heading home. The dark cloud to our left slowly grew bigger and more threatening. It didnt concern me much, but my friend wanted to make sure we didnt have to go back up the hill in the rain. For that reason, we decided to leave once the sun went behind it.

I wasnt sure how I felt about leaving. Part of me was ready to go home, but part of me definitely wasnt. I didnt want to re-enter civilization. I wanted to spend the rest of the trip and the rest of my life in the wilderness. I didnt want to re-enter civilization. I wanted to spend the rest of the trip and the rest of my life in the wilderness. I realized the struggle that implied and the hypocrisy of driving in a truck made from materials in a factory while decrying societys faults. The drive back took a little over an hour. I got a definite sense that I was finally starting to come down. I had my first glimpse of my own sane mind in hours. I got a call from a couple of friends on the East Coast wishing me a happy birthday. My friend decided to pull over and pick up a hitchhiker on the highway, who hopped in the bed of the truck for the rest of the drive.

I was seeing everything there was to see. Everything was crystal clear with bright colors, intense contrasts, and all the subtlety of a full-blown acid trip beginning to taper off. It was like I was seeing for the first time. I thought about something Terence McKenna once said, that taking psychedelics reveals the forms and patterns of the mind. Its like dropping ink into some water and seeing how the convection currents are formed. As I let my mind wander and examine multitudes of little things, I saw paradoxes and dualities I was unaware of before. I tried explaining this to my friend. All the little things my mind came to were eventually elucidated by my newfound awareness. Where usually these thoughts are like clouds of confusion, psychedelics will often show me underlying patterns, and make certain things very clear to me. I say, This makes sense now! All this other stuff doesnt. And I start to move in the right direction. Psychedelics have the power to demonstrate how sane thinking is fundamentally different from insane thinking. Its bizarre how close our ordinary waking consciousness is to insane thinking. Society is like a mass psychosis. I realized that I want and need to do three things in life: take care of my body, take care of the planet, and allow my mind to go wherever it desires to go. When we got back to town, we finally stopped at a pharmacy so my friend could buy some beer. The hitchhiker took off. I put my instruments in the back of the cab with a little difficulty and messed around on my phone for a while until he came back out.

My friend has recently moved to a new house. Its bigger and better than his previous apartment, so we both figured it would be a great place to come down from a trip. I spent a long time trying to make up my mind about whether or not to go to a show at 7:30 that my girlfriend and I had tickets to. At around 6:30, I called her and on the phone I decided I shouldnt go. It would be too overwhelming. I was still tripping harder than Ive been in a long time. She didnt sound too disappointed. It was unfortunate that I wouldnt end up seeing her for the rest of the day, but within half an hour I realized that was definitely the right decision.

After I thought I was mostly done with the acute effects of the trip, they came back strong. I sat down and we talked for a while about all the things I had thought about and felt. We listened to some of Modest Mouses new album. I was blown away by how psychedelic and fleshed out it was compared to their earlier albums. I was so grateful to have someone who was not only there for me for emotional and mental support throughout the experience, but who was willing to drive me around all day. I started drawing on some paper, eventually filling it in completely with abstract, fractal patterns. We climbed a ladder and got on his roof to watch the sunset.

-
Next transition: We were about to start a game of chess, so I set up the board and sat down at the table. Suddenly one of his new neighbors knocked on the door. She was drinking a vodka and juice, and soon she skeptically asked about the chess board. I didnt think she would understand. He and I tried our best to hint that maybe she should head home soon while not divulging anything too specific about our day to her just yet. She didnt take our hints and instead stayed for a long time. I became a little uncomfortable because I was feeling very antisocial. I guessed that neither of us was comfortable telling her too much about our day.

The two of them became very friendly and went outside for a cigarette. I sat down on the couch and opened to the first page of Herman Hesses Siddhartha, which he and I had talked about earlier. At the end of the first paragraph, my mind was changed. The last sentence of the first paragraph is,  Already he knew how to recognize Atman within the depth of his being, indestructible, at one with the universe. I knew that this was a direct reference to what I experienced all day, and still had access to: the point of unlimited awareness watching and guiding my body as it interacted with all around me. I put down the book and knew that I could be at peace with literally everything. She was, after all, no different from me, no different from anything in my environment, and finding peace with her was effortless. I put away my ego and decided to just be ready for anything that happened. That was a huge step toward letting go of my anal retentiveness.

I started conversations with the two of them, and eventually she invited us over to her house across the street to meet her dogs. They were both very sweet. She made herself another drink and we headed back to my friends house. I expressed to him that I wanted to go somewhere. Like back out to the desert to look at the night sky, or even just for a walk around the block. He had been drinking already and told me he wasnt good to drive. At one point I started trying to draw some of the tessellations I had seen earlier. She asked me what I was drawing and I gave her the cryptic answer that I had seen these patterns on the back of my eyelids. Its not that I was afraid of what she would think if I told her everything, I was just having fun trying to push it as far as it would go before I did. After a while, the three of us started down the road to a walking path. No sooner had we started walking down the street than my friends brother showed up. He also lives at the house and had just come home from work. We told him we were going for a walk and he said he would try to follow us.

My friend brought his longboard and began riding down the street. We got to the foot path and I welcomed the lower stimulation of darkness. His neighbor was playing the Doors on her phone. Then she switched to Jimi Hendrix. At one point we laid down to look at the stars. The Milky Way was clearly visible. My friend was drunk now and tried to get each of us to ride his longboard. In the dark, it was almost impossible. She ended up tripping and scraping her knee. She brushed it off and kept walking. I was trying to be helpful in any way that I could. I was now on a mission to be of service to everyone I met. I realized my own prejudices and assumptions were preventing me from making connections. She had been nothing but kind to me and I wanted to do the same. I eventually told her I had taken acid that morning. She had no problem with it and we had a short conversation about psychedelics.

When we started walking back, we ran into my friends brother and their other friend. They both asked me if they could have some of my acid. I told them I could give them the number of the guy I got it from but that what I had was for me. I didnt want to deal with other people coming up on what Id just had. I just wanted a nice, clean comedown. They didnt seem to have the respect that I had for it. Not to be self-righteous, I just didnt want anything negative to happen to them on my account. I was ok with taking on their karma and them taking on mine, but their karma while tripping acid was something else entirely for the state I was in.

We got back to the house, more people showed up, and it turned into kind of a small party. I was not feeling it. Everybody was drinking and talking loudly. Even though I still had a strong connection to my single-pointed awareness and the urge to be in harmony with everyone, my senses were overwhelmed. I tried to communicate to my friend how I was feeling, and we had some moments of connection, but by now he was really drunk and having a good time. He climbed up onto the adobe awning over his porch. Since he does a lot of bouldering, he has his own crash pads, so he decided to jump onto them rather than climb down. When he was finally down I said goodbye to everyone and got a ride home from his housemate. On the drive back to my house I described as much of my trip as I could. Later I found out my friend had cut his ankle while climbing onto the awning.

-
Final descent: When I got home, my dogs went crazy. It was around 12:30 in the morning and theyd been alone for a few hours. My girlfriend had decided to spend the night at her friends house. I needed some time alone. I realized I hadnt had any time alone all day. I did a little bit of cleaning and gave the dogs some attention, but they were too excited to cuddle. I was worried about them playing too rough and hurting each other, but I decided to have faith in them and just let them get their energy out so we could sleep later. They were fine. I boiled some water for tea, but I couldnt definitely conclude that I had any decaf in the house, so I just relaxed with some hot water. I made a special Comedown playlist on my computer. It was like hearing music for the first time. While this sensation is very common on acid, I was still taken aback by the clarity of the music, wishing to experience it all the time. At 1am I sat down and recorded a video of myself talking about my day and my experiences for a minute or two. I barely scratched the surface. I made myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and finally realized just how hungry I was. Still, my stomach would only accept so much food at one time.

I found myself thinking about things Id never thought about before and making connections that Id never seen before. This stage lasted a long time, during which I was awed by the power of my experience and enchanted by the subtlety of life. At 3:15am I sat down and recorded another video monologue, this time about half an hour long and covering chakras and my thoughts about them. I also talked about my thoughts on becoming a better person through awareness and effort, and various stray ideas that occurred to me during the day. I consider myself extremely lucky to have had this experience despite my trepidations about taking acid. But I believe it was a combination of luck and divine grace that allowed me to see beyond myself and ultimately have the transformative, life-changing experience I had hoped for. I do see that it can be possible to consciously integrate the divine presence of a higher power into ones life without buying wholesale into a theistic ideology. I felt a huge relief as I finished recording this video, ending it with the line, Everyone is worthy of love, so love them.

I realized despite my insecurities about myself, my relationship, my friendships, and my beliefs about the universe, nothing ended up cropping up to cause me anguish throughout the day. I know that I love my girlfriend, I love our dogs, my friends, and this opportunity to live that Ive been blessed with. I want whats best for everyone, regardless of how many separate realities that might imply. How healthy all of my interactions with others are depends heavily on me, but at a certain point its beyond my control. I found peace with this, my power to help others and my powerlessness to save others.

At 4:00am I got some messages from another friend who is struggling to accept himself. I called him up and offered some insights I had gained that day. I was still feeling at peace with the universe and wanted to relieve suffering in any way I could. I said if he wanted me to, I would mediate things between him and another of my friends. I think he was in a better place when we hung up the phone. I went to bed shortly thereafter. I was still not at 100% sober, baseline consciousness, but I was too exhausted to go on. My dreams were normal, but below the level of awareness where I could remember and describe them afterward.

-
Next day: I woke up the next morning completely sober, back to ordinary reality, with a slight headache I attributed to not eating for almost the whole day. I stuck with my plan to remain absolutely sober for over 24 hours after the event. It gave me a great opportunity to reflect on and integrate the entire experience. I talked with a friend on the East Coast for a long time about a range of things. Again I shared insights with her, sought to relieve her suffering, and in the end, I think she was in a better place after we talked. I achieved a level of effortless grace. I knew exactly what to say to do the most good and the least harm. I was truly humble. I wish I could have stayed there longer. Eventually I was firmly back in my comfortable, familiar ego space, despite the experience I thought would last forever. Eventually I was firmly back in my comfortable, familiar ego space, despite the experience I thought would last forever. I had only brief glimpses afterwards of the egoless space of utter awareness that I was in for such a long time. Things gradually resumed their ordinary patterns, but with a greater lightness and reverence than before.

Ive tried my best to illustrate every aspect of the experience that I can remember. Its now been just over a week and Im grateful for every moment.

Background: My first 14 trips occurred within a timespan of 3 years between 2008 and 2011. I hadnt taken any acid in the 4 years since then, but I have been taking low doses of psilocybin pretty frequently in that time. In 2015 I averaged one psilocybin trip per month and I smoked weed more or less daily.

Ive had a total of about 200 psychedelic trips in my life, mostly with psilocybin. Ive smoked Salvia about 50 times, smoked DMT 8 times, and drunk San Pedro juice once.

When I took this drug, I took it because I wanted to change my life.  When I was a child I was badly abused by my best friend.  When I came to college, I was in many ways a person deeply handicapped.  I was painfully shy and struggled to talk to strangers.  I was extremely apathetic and I rarely did my homework.  I had no experience with intimacy.  These were all of the things I believed about myself at that time.

I had read about people having life-changing experiences using acid, and I increasingly felt it was something I would like to do, and that maybe it would effect a positive change in my life.  By this point I had fairly extensive experience with alcohol and marijuana but I had never done any more powerful psychedelics that commonly come to mind such as shrooms, etc.  I told a friend of mine (Arthur) about my interest in acid and, having experience with it, he volunteered to see if he could find some at school so we could do it together.

I didn't know what I really expected out of taking acid.  Vaguely I had hopes that it may turn me into an extrovert or help me become sexually successful, but really I was just looking for a way to turn around what I perceived to be a very negative life trajectory that I was on.  I felt like I wasn't as happy as everyone else and I wanted to be happy like them.

Eventually, my friend Arthur got his hands on two tabs, and we decided we'd take it together one weekend when he was home for spring break.  It was late March and the weather was relatively warm and clear, although it was windy.  Inevitably I felt a little bit of apprehension, but I was mostly relaxed and I wasn't too troubled by ruminating on the coming trip  I stayed very present minded and just went with it.  My only fear was that I would have a bad trip, and even then it was a fear faintly held and I didn't waste any attention on it.  

At a little before 1:00 PM Arthur and I took our tabs and we decided to walk out to an area of my campus where there's a farm and some trails in the woods that we thought would be a good place to come up.  I immediately noticed a metallic taste when I took my dose; I knew LSD was supposed to be tasteless, so I mentioned it to Arthur and he said it wasn't LSD but it was probably NBOMe or something similar.  He had taken this specific substance before, he told me, and it was definitely acid.  I wasn't concerned.

As we walked out to the farm I began to feel hot and I was being extremely talkative.  Both of these Arthur attributed to my excitement/apprehension, and he was almost certainly right.  When we got to the woods, there was a fallen branch that we had to duck beneath to start on the trail.  As I went under it, I touched it with my hand, and for a fleeting second I felt this weird connection with ancient humans.  I thought about how people for millions of years had walked through the woods, maybe even these same woods, and had maybe even put their hand on this same tree, in this same place.  This was my first indication that something unusual was beginning.  It had been probably 35 minutes.

When we got into the woods, Arthur took out two joints and we sat down on a dry log.  He told me it was a good idea to smoke while we were coming up, especially for me, so that the transition to altered consciousness would be less jarring.  Before I had even finished my joint, I noticed how unusual this high was in comparison to times I had smoked before.  There was a super-real quality to the world around me, and my thinking felt very abnormal and disordered.  It's very difficult to explain; I want to say that it felt like my mind was crowded and cloudy, almost as if lots of little thoughts were passing under the lens of my awareness it felt like my mind was crowded and cloudy, almost as if lots of little thoughts were passing under the lens of my awareness  never in their entirety, but in little fragments  discrete segments of bigger thoughts, confusing and strange because their meaning was lost entirely now without their full context.  Despite how this description may sound, I was having a very good time at this point and I still was really excited.

When we left the woods and started back to campus, it was very apparent now that I was tripping.  My vision was really wavy and fairly heavily impaired.  I remember we stopped briefly to look out over one of the fields, and it looked like the grass was literally rippling as if it were a liquid surface.  I also had the strange sensation that we were inside a giant snow globe type structure, almost like a big biodome.  

When we were back on campus Arthur and I were walking towards my dorm, talking about what we wanted to do.  I suggested we should buy snacks, but when he asked me if I felt I could handle interacting with the employees, I felt an abrupt apprehension.  I began to think I probably couldn't handle it at all, and I imagined it going very wrong.  At this moment, there was a kid in a grey hoodie with a backpack walking towards us on the sidewalk.  His hood was pulled up.  As he passed we made eye-contact, and for a moment I had the sensation that we were in a wintery, Eastern European type city; I could imagine as if there were big concrete buildings on either side of the road, and light flurries of snow falling all around in the air, and a sky blotted out with heavy white clouds.  We passed each other and the vision faded.

This was an extraordinary experience, really beyond my ability to rationalize or make sense of, and I immediately told Arthur I thought we should just go back to my dorm and relax for a while.  When we got back to my dorm, the first thing I noticed was how heavily distorted my vision was.  My hallway looked like a funhouse, as if it were twisted into a spiral.  As best I could, I navigated us to my room and maneuvered inside.  

We both sat down.  I opened up my laptop and Arthur suggested I should play some music.  Immediately, I was deeply disillusioned and even perhaps unsettled by the sound of music.  It sounded depressingly flat, dull, and lifeless  far worse than I typically felt listening to music on weed, worse even than I felt listening to music sober.  I wasn't into the music at all, and I found it hard to even concentrate on.  After only a few songs, I stopped playing it.

Feeling markedly more anxious now after my musical debacle, I went online and, partly for the tongue-in-cheek 'trippy' factor, I decided to read The Waste Land by TS Eliot.  This proved to be a similarly bad decision.  I found myself disturbed, depressed, and generally frightened by reading the poem.  I had an uncontrollable, unpleasantly intense empathy with the words, and I found myself being emotionally deflated by this surreal, devastated, fractured, dark world being spoken of.  I thought about the emptiness of it all, about how these Victorian era people were all fake cardboard cutouts of people, living entirely through rituals they used to keep themselves comfortable while the internal issues they couldn't deal with sucked Europe down into an era of war and a cold cultural vacuum.  Very upset, I closed my laptop.

Arthur and I decided we should watch some TV.  At this point I was beginning to feel a definite claustrophobia.  My dorm is not very large, and my roommate and I were not much enamored of interior decorating, so the walls were essentially just blank plaster with conspicuous pipes poking out of the ceiling in some places.  It felt industrial in a terrible way.  All I wanted now was to relax and laugh a little, so we turned on cartoon network.

On cartoon network they were showing Adventure Time.  I love this show, but it turned out to be a very poor choice while on acid.  The episode we tuned into was one in which this elephant character (can't remember her name) has some apples stolen from her, and the protagonists go looking for them so she can bake an apple pie.  Adventure Time is a trippy show, and this is a notably surreal episode.  What winds up happening is the elephant lady finds the apples hidden in her own cupboard, and incredibly, she calls the police on herself since she evidently stole her own apples.  At the time, this freaked me out, because it was such a strange story and I couldn't tell if it was really happening or if it was some crazy hallucination I was having.  I remember I kept asking my friend, 'is this really happening?' 'is this real?' over and over again, and to make matters worse, he largely wasn't responding to me or he would just say 'I don't know'.  

The episode ended, and another show came on.  This was some kind of live-action show that apparently is a mixture of comedic skits and candid-camera type pranks done by a group of photogenic teens.  I was already unsettled at this point and my mood did not improve watching this show.  It had a kind of 'wacky' vibe, with a lot of fast cuts and kooky effects, that made it stressfully inconsistent and all over the place.  I couldn't settle into whatever was going on screen before it would switch again.  To me in my altered state, each new narrative or skit they would jump to seemed bizarre and meaningless, like self-contained pieces of disturbing art, unrelated to each other and making no collective sense.  I was specifically very frightened by this one prank they featured where I guess they had a bunch of grown-ups gathered together under the auspices of watching a concert, but instead of actual music being performed one of the cast members stood on stage and delivered this kind of weird belching or growling sound.  A sizeable number of audience members had apparently asked the network to conceal their identities (lol) so their faces were blurred out; the collective effect of these things was, at the time, incomprehensibly disturbing.  I began to also hallucinate (I think?) that there were black bars drawn across the eyes of various audience members, as you might see in redacted photos of crime victims or something like that.  Beholding this hallucination was perhaps the most unsettled that I felt during the entire trip.

At some point I eventually went back on to my laptop to try and listen to music, thinking that upbeat songs might improve my mood.  Unfortunately, music remained 'upsetting' (this is the best word but still not a good one) and to make matters much worse, the album art of the song I was listening to featured a mug shot of Frank Sinatra from when he was apparently arrested as a young man.  The association with crime was negative in itself, but I also hallucinated at this time that there was a black bar drawn across his eyes as well, like the people on the TV.  This little experience put me close to a state of outright despair, and I had a terrible body anxiety, kind of like a restlessness.

Around this time I have trouble putting events in exactly the correct order.  I know that at some point, some of my friends who lived on the same floor as me came over to my room to see what we were doing (they knew that I had taken acid earlier in the day).  What I can't remember is whether or not Arthur and I had already gone outside and come back in before they stopped by my room.  Let me tell the events in the order of most emotional coherency.

So after we had watched Cartoon Network for a while, I was miserable and very anxious in every sense, as I have already said.  During the period when we were in my dorm room, Arthur had also frequently mentioned his sense of unease to me as well, so we were both feeling similarly.  At some point he suggested that we should step outside for some fresh air.  I happily agreed and we went downstairs to go sit outside near this cool little gazebo in the middle of my residence area.  Almost instantly after we had left my building, my mood began to improve.  I especially enjoyed the sun, which was out and shining brightly, and it brought my mood up in a way I can't really describe.

We were just sort of sitting there on the bench, not really saying much, straight chilling, and as we did so my mood continued to get better and better.  Pretty soon, I was actually feeling better than baseline  I was feeling really great!  A big stupid smile took over my face as I just sat there on the bench and let the sun shine on me. A big stupid smile took over my face as I just sat there on the bench and let the sun shine on me.  I began to feel a rush inside of me, exhilarating, like a pent up energy.  I don't remember exactly how the thought came into my mind but I remember I started to explain, with great enthusiasm and euphoria alike, to Arthur how the meaning of life is whatever you want it to be.  For some reason, this terse kernel of knowledge excited and uplifted me so much.  It felt so simple and intuitive, and I couldn't believe that there were people who asked themselves what the meaning of life was and wondered about the point.  The point is whatever you want! I thought to myself.  It's completely up to you!  If you think the point of life is to travel the world then the point is to travel the world and if you think the point of life is to eat as much cheese as possible then that's the point of life, to eat as much cheese as possible (I thought exactly this).  It was so beautifully simple.  It was perfect, and I know it's true.

At some point  not exactly sure where in the chronology of things  we were in my dorm room and my friends came in, like I had said.  I'm not sure if this happened only one time or if it happened a few times, I think probably the latter.  The highlight of this part of the experience was when I had gotten an inspirational burst of thought, just like the one I had outside of the bench  which makes me think this might have happened after that experience.  But regardless, I had this sudden and powerful thought ('insight' is probably the better word) about how the world is made.  I conceived of everything as part of a great spectrum, between two extremes, of absolute perfection and absolute imperfection.  Absolute perfection, I realized seamlessly and without manual reflection, is God.  And absolute imperfection represents the no-essence, having no energy, no character, no qualities, no mass, nothing.  And all life, I felt, was engaged in a constant struggle to move toward perfection  everything, all the time, is moving toward a state of perfection.  And perfection is so much a part of our 'quest' as humans that it defines what we are all about, and all the things we paint, and build, and write, are attempts to capture perfection that we discover in the world around us.  Nobody paints an ugly mountain, I think I might have said literally.  They paint beautiful mountains, the ones that speak to us because of their perfect quality.  And it just made so much effortless sense to me.

I explained all this to my friends, our sober visitors.  They did not take me seriously and generally did not engage with my idea.  I remember in all of my interactions with them during the trip I always felt this awkward sense of separation from them.  They didn't get the things I was trying to talk about and they didn't try to.  To them it was a joke.  It frustrated me until I let it go and focused myself internally.  We did not actually spend much time with them.  I remember Arthur specifically did not like having them around very much because they upset his mojo.  He is very zen and he likes his tranquility.

Another thing that happened at some point is that Arthur and I took a walk.  I think after we had come back inside for a while we grew restless again and embarked on another soothing sojourn into the natural world.  At first, this walk was extremely stressful.  I remember I was very agitated by the traffic going by as we went down the sidewalk.  The cars exuded an air of great menace and danger to me.  At one point we went across a crosswalk and it was a hellish nightmare of a three-second experience.  There was an indescribable amount of body tension and there was this big SUV type car inching through the intersection as we crossed which put me on the highest alert.  I was intoxicated by drugs, so I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to cross or not and I was deathly afraid of breaking the rules and thus getting hit.  Eventually, we reached this kind of enclosed neighborhood near my building and I calmed down.  It was peaceful there and very wooded, with no cars.  I don't think anything of note happened on this walk  we went a little ways until we were purged of our anxiety and then we started back.

Eventually, my friend Douglas who had just finished moving back onto campus came over to see how we were doing.  We sat down with him at a picnic table just outside the room to my building.  I remember he told me how large my pupils looked at the time.  It was around dinner time so the three of us headed off to the dining hall which was just across the street from my building.

One of the big takeaways from the dining hall was that food was very bland.  I was reasonably hungry, but every bite that I took of my pizza was just really bad.  Again, the word I want to use here is 'disappointing' or 'upsetting'.  I think the big thing I need to communicate here is that substantially the reason why it was a bad experience was because I felt let down, like it failed my expectations.  I had had pizza before and loved it  I love pizza!  This time the pizza was bland and chewing was a huge chore.  It upset me that the pizza was not tasting and feeling good like I had always known it to do.

Also in the dining hall I experience some not-insignificant paranoia.  There was a person sitting at a table on the other side of the room and a few rows back from where I was, who I thought was watching me.  I was afraid that he was going to beat me up.  There was no reason at all for thinking this, except that he was a little intimidating physically, but I kept thinking that we were making eye-contact and that he was staring at me angrily.  Nothing ever came of this and we left the dining hall after I gave up on finishing my food.

After eating, we went back to Douglas' dorm which was on the other side of the campus.  We spent a little while there playing Mario Kart and listening to music.  Music remained dull, although at this point I was definitely coming down.  After chilling a while Douglas decided to smoke a bowl so the three of us all headed out to the woods, where we had originally gone after dosing, so he could smoke.

On the way there it was growing dark.  In this period I experienced some of my last 'trippy' thoughts, prominently including the sensation that eventually 'everything will happen' because of the infinite nature of time.  Arthur countered that an infinite system doesn't work in this manner.  I argued that because the universe continually contracts, reinvents itself, expands, and then contracts and regenerates again, surely after a certain point enough unique universes will have generated for every conceivable possibility to have manifested itself in reality.  I think my point was dismissed as naïve.

In the woods, Douglas smoked, Arthur was chatting with him, and I sort of went off a little bit (not very far) into the woods to think.  I was really enjoying looking at trees and running my hand along the bark.  Suddenly I had my last great burst of thought.  I had a vivid and exciting vision of the Ancient Mediterranean and hoplites and sun-bleached walls of stone, and for whatever reason I burst out saying that Hannibal (the Carthaginian statesman) did not really lose to the Romans after all, because we still remember him and everything he did to this day.  My point was received with the polite appreciation of true stoners.

It was dark when we got back to Douglas' room.  At this point I was no longer feeling any of the effects of the drug from before.  Instead I began to feel some after-effects, most notably including an excruciating vasoconstriction in my legs which is probably one of the most uncomfortable things I have ever felt in my life.  I was also feeling very 'out of it' and disconnected from everyone else.  When I got back to my dorm, my roommate was there with some of the people from my building.  They talked while I stayed mostly silent.  I felt so different from them, so much not a part of what they were doing and talking about and their activities.  It was profound.  That night, it took me a long time to fall asleep.

When I woke up in the morning I felt a little groggy, not dissimilar to the feeling I get after using marijuana the night before.  During the day I experienced no major side effects.

This experience had a long-term impact on me, specifically with respect to my use of marijuana.  Speaking only of this substance in itself, I found it to be a very clean and cerebral trip.  There were some visuals early on but they were not the prominent part of the experience.  The effects of this drug, for me, basically manifested as flashes of thought or 'insight' that came into my head without effort.

LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Nature / Outdoors (23), First Times (2), General (1)




 




DOSE:
  
oral
LSD
(blotter / tab)





BODY WEIGHT:
110 lb





In the past year, I have experimented with LSD and shrooms (among other drugs) quite often. I am currently 17, but I started using drugs when I was 13. The most recent experimentation I did with LSD was yesterday, while I was visiting my boyfriends college over Yom Kippur break. We had several tabs left over from the last time we did LSD, and we split them so that my boyfriend took approximately twice the amount that I did (because he is considerably larger than I am). Regardless of having taken much less LSD than he did, I think I definitely tripped harder, because I am young, female, and I weigh just under 100 pounds, so drugs affect me very strongly. 
	To be safe, we made sure that we werent using any other drugs or medications at the time. Neither of us were on any medications or pills. We were both in very positive moods, having spent a lot of time together, just relaxing and hanging around the college. We knew that the tabs were definitely LSD because we had previously taken some from the same batch. We have each done LSD 5 times prior to this experience, along with 5 trips on shrooms, and several experiments with DXM and salvia. The only foods we ate during the trip were cupcakes and skittles, which we ate at around 11pm (during the beginning of the comedown). The body-related effects we felt were an increased sensitivity to light, an inability to focus our eyes, slight dizziness, slight difficulty walking, twitching (only for me), and insensitivity to cold temperatures. The cognition-related effects that we felt included improved mood, thought patterns that were very different from normal, short-term memory loss, an increased sense of interest and insight, and increased sexual arousal. 
------
Experience:
	We put the tabs under our tongues at 2:35pm and sat around watching TV as we waited for the effects to begin. The first distinct effect that I noticed was that when I looked up at the textured ceiling, I immediately saw the bumps on the ceiling begin to swirl and darken to form faces and kaleidoscope-like patterns that twisted and turned. I also began to hear the sounds from outside begin to swirl and bubble in a dream-like way. 
The way I experience LSD, all the effects are ones that would normally evoke fear or paranoia. For example, every time I do LSD, I hear this strong, constant background noise that gets louder and softer in dreamlike waves. This constant noise is made up of multiple sirens, car alarms, fire alarms, and other types of alarming noises. These noises dont make me paranoid or scared on LSD, however, because despite these noises, I tend to feel very calm, with an overall sense of curiosity about these sounds, rather than fear of them. Another paranoid effect that LSD seems to have is the constant visuals of anguished, screaming faces. When I look at clouds, ceilings, hair, sheets, or any object with more than just a blank surface, I begin to see millions and millions of faces that are constantly moving around and changing. The faces are never smiling, however. They are in constant pain. The faces are swirling around each other with their mouths open, looking as if they are dead or dying. When I look at clouds, specifically, the faces tend to look more like skulls, corpses, and ghosts that are all attached and piled on top of one another, each screaming silently. This again doesnt bother me or cause me to have a bad trip, but I always find it interesting that LSD seems to be designed to scare the person who takes it.
           Another interesting thing about the faces I see on acid is that a lot of the time they mimic the facial expressions  that I make at them. As I stared at the textured ceiling in my boyfriends dorm room, I made many different facial expressions  from happiness to pain to anger  and saw that the faces tended to copy these expressions by changing their mouths from open to closed or their eyes from small to large. The only expression they didnt mimic was happiness. The faces I see tend to only have an emotional range that goes from neutral to pain. However, when I looked over at my boyfriend, who has long curly hair, I saw that he had multiple faces clinging to his hair. When he smiled at me, it seemed as if all the faces did too, however the smiles werent really visible, and the faces seemed instead to be sending out a positive emotional wave, rather than giving visible smiles. 
	Another characteristic of an LSD trip (that distinguishes it from a psilocybin trip, for me) is that it gives me the urgent feeling that I need to explain the universe and the meaning of life. Though my thoughts rarely reach a conclusion on the reasons for the universe, I feel like I have discovered many things about life that I wouldnt have thought of without the help of LSD. For example, it would never have occurred to me that people are really invisible. Of course this sounds silly, but imagine that you could only see in radio waves, rather than in the range of white (visible) light. In this case, you would not be able to see people, because radio waves (and many other types of waves) pass right through us. Realizing this made me think that there could be many other forms of life that exist right on top of us, and because they might be made of energy, they could pass right through us, and we wouldnt know it. This makes sense to me (especially while Im on LSD), because humans (and all matter) are 99% empty space, leaving a lot of room for energy and small amounts of neutral matter to pass right through us. 
	My boyfriend and I smoked a bowl, and then sat around watching TV and brainstorming for a while. Watching TV on LSD is one of the most amazing and confusing things to do. First of all, on LSD, it is almost impossible to see the actors as real people in a real situation, as you would normally. Instead, you see the actors reading the lines that they memorized from a script, and moving around in ways that they had rehearsed many times. Instead of seeing the emotions that they are trying to portray in relation to the TV show, I see the emotions that they feel while reading the script lines, and how they feel being at work as an actor. Commercials also seem completely ridiculous in the same way, because the manipulation involved in marketing products becomes so noticeably obvious.
	Eventually, my boyfriend and I decided to go outside and take a walk around the lake. It took us almost 2 hours to get outside because we kept forgetting that we wanted to go outside, and it took me forever to put socks and shoes on, as this process took an immense amount of effort and concentration. I could feel the LSD beginning to peak as we tried to go outside. 
        An interesting thing about LSD is that since I have done it many times, I am always prepared for the effects, and as such, I can compensate for them. For example, I have learned how to walk normally while on acid, whereas the first time I did acid, I was unable to walk unless I was following someone else and copying how they walked. When I stood up to walk for the first time on this LSD trip, I found that the walk was quite similar to the robo-walk created by DXM, however it was very much less intense and I still had complete control over my movements. 
	Once we finally did make our way outside (around 6pm), we walked down to the lake and sat on a bench near the edge. Its the beginning of autumn, and the trees were extremely beautiful that day. They were all sorts of different colors and shapes, and the weeping willows that gently touched the surface of the water made the view look like the most perfect painting ever. A pair of ducks swam in the center of the lake, and another pair flew overhead, which added to the perfection of the scenery. I wanted to stay right there forever, watching the stunningly picturesque scenery. The water was perfectly calm and created a flawless reflection of the trees surrounding the lake. At this point I began to think about water, and how it is extremely similar to air. This made me start to feel the heaviness and thickness of air, and I got up from the bench to see how air felt to move around in. I realized that the dust particles in the air are just like the sediments in water, and this connection made the world seem a lot more purposeful. 
	Farther down along the edge of the lake, a woman began banging a pot on the rail of a bridge. Immediately, I began tapping my foot to the beat of the noise she was making. This was completely involuntary, and seemed perfectly natural. During the entire trip, there was this constant noise that was made up of the sounds of other people, cars, animals, and a background noise that my mind had put together from noises I could not distinguish. I could feel this noise, and I could move my hands through the air to control and change the noise. However, at the same time that my hands were controlling the noise, they were also just going with the flow of it, creating a perfect balance between having my hands control the sounds while also letting my mind take control of my hands. (This had also happened to me once before on a shrooms trip, where it had been more intense, and instead of going with the flow of the noise, the noise controlled my hands and moved them with it). 
	We got up from the bench and continued walking around the perimeter of the lake. We passed by several other groups of people who were sitting by the edge of the lake. Typically, when I pass by a group of people, I barely notice them or think about them. However, on LSD, any small encounter or interaction with another unknown person is a very big deal. LSD makes me unable to act normally in even the smallest social situations, because I am suddenly unable to understand what other people are feeling or thinking. On LSD, I never know where to look when I am passing by a person, or if they know Im on LSD, or if theyre thinking about me, or what Ill say to them if they start a conversation with me. When this happens, my heart immediately starts to beat faster and my thoughts become even more jumbled and confused than they were to begin with, and as a result I get scared and paranoid, though I can never reason out a true cause for this paranoia. 
	Once we got back to the dorm room, we both talked about how other people immediately make us intensely nervous. While discussing this, I realized that communications between people (and animals) are very strange, and almost meaningless. This is because one person is never able to truly communicate his or her thoughts and feelings to another person. The best a person can do is to describe these thoughts with the limited amount of words that languages offer. In addition to this, people all respond differently to different situations and stimuli, and one person will never be able to understand exactly how another person reacts or feels. We are alone in our own minds weird. We are also alone inside ourselves, and no matter how physically close you get to a person, you will always still be two separate beings. 
	I continued thinking about minds and thoughts, and I started thinking about free will. I came to the conclusion that free will is not anything at all, and that there is not even the possibility for such a thing. If we had free will, this would mean that our actions and decisions are not controlled by reason and cause. As a result, there would be an effect (whatever action I did using free will) without a cause, meaning that cause and effect would no longer be related. Our brains prevent this free will, thankfully, so that we dont go around doing random things for no reason. Brains are computers, composed of even smaller computers (neurons), which are then composed of even smaller computers (atoms), and so on. Because of this, there is always cause and effect, and there can be no effect without a cause, and therefore we cannot just do things randomly and without a reason. Looking back on this thought, it seems fairly rational, because my view of humans is that we are very complex computers, as opposed to being the magical free-willed beings that many people think we are. 
	We smoked another bowl and turned on the TV again, to MTV, which was playing Paris Hiltons My New BFF. We discussed this show in great depth, and realized that the interactions between the people on this show was so deep and complicated that it was extremely difficult to understand how people can interact with each other so easily. 
	We decided to turn off the TV, and I let my mind wander for a bit. I started thinking about food, and how strange it was that our natural tendency was to put other objects inside of ourselves (eating). This seemed even stranger when I realized that the objects we eat are the objects that we are composed of. So, essentially, we are composed of non-living material, because that is what we eat. This made me realize that we are no different from solid, inanimate objects like beds, chairs and apples, because we are made up of the same elements (carbon, oxygen, etc). What I concluded from all this brainstorming was that since we are made up of non-living material, we are therefore also non-living and that there is no such thing as being alive. Since humans are able to move and think and have free-will, people have this strange idea that we are significantly different (and much more important) than objects in the world around us. Unfortunately for them, we are really just the same as the inanimate beds and chairs, and that eventually we will also become inanimate. 
	For a very brief moment, I got the strangest, scariest feeling that I was trapped inside life, inside my body, inside this universe, and that there was nothing I could do to escape from it. It was the same feeling that people often get when they think too much about death and become afraid of the fact that death is inevitable, and that theres nothing they can do about it (except to accept it). Fortunately, this feeling lasted only for a second or two, and didnt ruin my trip. 
	From my experiences with LSD, and from what I know about it, I can tell that LSD does not create or invent new things. Instead, it just works to intensify the amount of sensory input that I receive from the world. From what I understand, the visuals that I experience on LSD appear to move because my eyes are constantly moving over the surface on which I see these visuals. Since my pupils are dilated and my eyes are unable to come together to focus on any one object, I am unable to keep my eyes still (or my body still), and therefore my eyes continuously wander back and forth across the ceiling, creating these patterns and faces that are constantly shifting and changing. 
	At one point during the trip, I got up from the bed to look at a Jimi Hendrix poster hanging on the wall. This poster was done in a Buddhist-style, featuring Jimi Hendrix in the center, with Buddhist deities next to him and behind him. Their arms also extended out from behind him, and altogether, this image became an intense optical illusion. The arms appeared to move, and the faces all took on a personality of their own. I began to notice details in the poster than I hadnt noticed before. My boyfriend said that he had also only noticed these details while tripping on shrooms. 
	LSD makes sex about a million times better, to the point where it feels like a cocaine rush, but without the crash or the cravings. We had sex several times, often while we were brainstorming and sitting around in the dorm room. I recall one time we had sex, which was probably during the peak of our trips. It felt exactly like the super-pleasure rush that other people describe while doing cocaine. It was almost too intense and too much to handle. I didnt even know that was possible. However, what is really awesome about sex on LSD is that afterwards, you arent left craving more or feeling emotionally low or depressed. 
	Many times during this trip, I also found that I could not keep my body still. There was a period of about 5 to 10 minutes when my facial muscles began twitching excessively, which made my facial expressions change rapidly. Later on, I realized that my legs had been vibrating for a while, while also twitching occasionally. I noticed this constant twitch especially at night (around 3am), when my boyfriend went to sleep. I tried to go to sleep at the same time, but my trip was far from being over, so I tossed and turned and twitched and fussed, and it was impossible to get to sleep. I remember looking at the clock at 5:22am. At this point I was still not physically tired, and my eyes were still wide open and un-blinking. However, my mind was tired of being bombarded with intense pulses of sensory input, so there was this huge conflict between the energy I felt physically, and the fatigue I felt in my mind. I experienced the effects of this mental fatigue for several days afterwards, in the form of minor headaches (however this could also have been the result of not having slept correctly for about 6 days in a row). I think I may have gotten to sleep by around 6:30am. Therefore, my trip lasted from approximately 3pm to 6am: 16 hours. 

Retrospection:
	This was definitely one of the most intense trips Ive ever had, and I definitely discovered a lot more about life than I had on any other trip. What LSD does best for me is that it always makes me a lot more curious and observant about the world and about myself. It makes me think about things that we all overlook because they are so familiar to us: Things like eating, breathing, and existing. These discoveries that I make about my life stay with me, and I continue thinking about them for a long time after the trip. With each new LSD trip, I rediscover things that I forgot about. On the Shulgin Scale, this would definitely get a +++, though at times I could see my trip starting to head towards a ++++ on this scale.
I have also finally figured out how to do an LSD trip the right way. This right way includes being away from people (such as parents) who will want to know where I am at all different times of the day. It also include doing LSD with someone I trust (my boyfriend), and letting other people (his roommates) know that we are doing drugs.

LSD
(blotter / tab)





The experience I am about to write about has changed my life completely. About a year ago I took acid for the first time. A regular smoker of weed, the other drugs I had tried before acid were MDMA, coke, mephedrone and ketamine. My other drug experiences don't come close in terms of intensity and life-changing ability as my acid experience did. 

First of all, I feel like I need to outline the fact that I was with my ex-boyfriend (with whom I'd decided to stay friends- although that has changed now) and his friends (4 of us all together). Sober, I felt completely comfortable with these people. I had a respect for acid before I'd tried it and therefore listened to my friends who had already taken it and I put myself in a setting in which I felt relaxed and myself (as they had directed me to). I took it inside, with purposefully placed wall-hangings and mattresses on the floor with a big set of speakers near by, with the ipod already playing deep house/liquid drum and bass. 

I took my first tab (I do not know how the dosage exactly was as I never asked), and about an hour later we found ourselves outside in the snow. I have never seen anything so beautiful as I did that first hour or so. Snow is detailed naturally, and I have always enjoyed examining snowflakes, but on acid it was infinitely more beautiful, and I mean infinitely in its' purest definition. I felt no negatives at this point, I even stripped off to see if I could feel cold in a bad way and I did not. The only reason I put my top/trousers back on was because I could tell I was freaking out my friends who thought I was going to get hyperthermia or something, and I did not want to scare them. Other than the infinite beauty of the snow, I can remember the trees of the park we were in were waving at me, and my friends faces were slowly becoming more and more warpy.

At this point, I felt amazing- kind of like my best experience on MDMA times a hundred, but I was still concious and aware of the fact that I was not 'tripping' like my friends had described it- my eyesight seemed a much better quality, but it was still MY eyesight. I took another tab, and about half an hour later stuff really started to kick off. I remember no gradual feeling, all I know is at one point I was seeing reality and the next moment I was seeing either reality with visuals, or a completely imagined one (to this day I do not know). I remember at this point going 'blind'. I could feel that my eyes were open, but I was seeing a cartoon; one which had no relation to my normal reality. There was nothing in this cartoon which had any relation to myself or to my normal surroundings. At this point, I panicked and for a few hours, I guess (I say guess because I do not know how much time I spent in this mind-space) my experience was not enjoyable. 

It felt like I was stuck in a loop, and I one hundred percent thought, during this time, that I was not coming back and I can remember thinking 'I could be in a mental hospital right now and I would not know'. I had many bad 'trips' during this time. For instance, at one point (I again do not know how long for, but it felt like forever) I was 'dead', and I could feel my chest being pumped (this feeling was probably stemming from heavy breathing). I could hear my family, my mother and sisters, shouting 'come on, come back to us' and I spent a while trying mentally to do just that. 

This feeling of being dead happened a few times, in a few different ways- my mind was stuck in what felt like a 3 second loop and every now and then this feeling of being stuck in a loop became too much to handle and I think this is why I believed I was dying. In that previous trip, I was told I was dying by my family, but then another thing happened; I accepted my death fully, later on, which in itself is a bit of a death I think! When I did this, and I really don't know how long I had been on acid for at this point, I melted away. I lost control fully but it did not scare me anymore. I was not holding on to the real world and this is when I had a profound experience. The only way I can describe what I felt  is that all at once I was nothing, but also part of everything. I did not know who I was, and had no memory of my life. This therefore meant that suddenly I was part of everything. I felt like I was floating in infinity, for infinity, but I do not know if I could even say there was an 'I', as in me, present during this time. I was seeing nothing but strange, blurred geometric patterns on a white backround, which would then dissolve into pure white and then black and so on and so forth. I do not know when, but at one point I must have fallen asleep.  

I woke up the next day and was not 'blind' anymore- a huge relief. However, I was still mentally tripping and could not grasp time. This feeling of being disconnected from time completely lasted for around a week. I could not remember anything, and I have been told since that during this week my friends and family were scared of the way I was behaving. All I can say is sorry they felt like that. It took me a while to feel 'normal' again- whatever normal is, but I know that I now look at the world differently. Whilst I can remember having long periods of terrible feelings on that acid trip, I am thankful I did it because it honestly has made me who I am today. It was neither a good nor bad experience on the whole, but a learning one. Just like school- and for me at least, the time I spent on acid felt almost as long as my school career! A powerful drug, and one which I am amazed at for it's abilities- it has definitely affected my sober thought which is at once pretty scary, but if you look at it a different way it's pretty brilliant! 

I don't think it's possible to describe it at all but I have done my best!

[Erowid Note: This is an early self-report of the use of LSD from Myron Stolaroff's papers collected and scanned as part of Erowid's Stolaroff Collection. You can view the original as a scanned PDF that includes two type-written drafts, attached together, with some hand-written edits in the second draft.

The report demonstrates some of Myron's self-characterized 'neuroticism', which he later describes in detail in his writings. Although a little long and personal, it is interesting as a historical document of early LSD use intentionally for spiritual and psychological development. In his book Thanatos to Eros, Myron mentions that the dose is 66 micrograms. ]

Evolution of human personality as approached by Sequoia Seminar. Leading study groups involved with this search.

Reason for Session:
Had heard reports of effects of mescaline and LSD when properly administered. Since my principal aim is forming a satisfactory relationship with God and helping others to do so, I felt it vital to evaluate this material, both for my development and as in the work being accomplished by Sequoia Seminar.

Preparation For Session:
On February 1, in Redwood City, California, was tested with CO2 gas. Went up to eight inhalations. Experienced wonderful feeling of prayer, colored imagery. Also took tablets containing approximately 20 mg. of mescaline. [Erowid Note: This should say 'methadrine' here, rather than 'mescaline'. The error in drug name was later corrected in Myron's autobiography, Thanatos to Eros; introducing his subjects to altered states of consciousness by using a mixture of CO2 and oxygen, and by using methadrine (methamphetamine) was the standard approach taken by Al Hubbard. Prior to giving them a stronger psychedelic, Hubbard first wanted to make sure that the subject responded well to these milder drugs.] Produced wonderful feeling of [euphoria], heightened intensity of awareness, much greater creativity, complete absence of feelings of anxiety or insecurity.

On April 15, the day before the session, spent the entire day talking with my two directors, was tested by each of them with CO2 . Although was quite nervous, by last tests was cooperating quite freely [inhaling], and got as high as 20 inhalations. Each test was very pleasant experience with colored imagery, almost invariably involving a playing field with people playing games of one kind or another. No insights of significance.

On April 16, before session, first visited the Catholic Church in Vancouver. Met Father Brown and received his benediction. He promised to honor us at Noon Mass. Met with the other director, while he checked my ability to relax under his instructions.

I took the material at 11:15 A.M., taking approximately 2/3 of a vial of LSD in 1/2 glass of water. I then sat quietly in a chair, listening to spiritual music with my two directors.

The first feeling I experienced was one of calmness and peace. All fear and nervousness left me, and I felt very good. In about 20 minutes to 1/2 hour, things began to become humorous. As I looked at my directors, I couldn't help smiling, then laughing. I had to turn my head away to recover. Then I looked at them and said, 'What a couple of characters!' and we all laughed. It kept getting funnier and funnier. One of the directors said, 'This is his first repression.' I thought of how somber and serious I had always been, and how everything was so important. I saw now that life was simply a game, a joyful, humorous game, and I laughed and laughed at my serious approach to everything. The other director, a very serious looking individual said 'Now Myron, let's be serious'. I laughed so hard that my sides ached.

Now as I closed my eyes, I began to see images, all kinds of colored shapes and forms, continually moving. It is utterly impossible to describe the variety of shapes that passed before me, and they changed rapidly enough so that I could not remember any specific ones. I was listening to the Gregorian Chants, and the music was enrapturing, yet very humorous. I thought of the solemnity of the Church, and laughed and laughed at the manner in which it was attempted to make the church serious, when it was really all so funny. Later when the Requiem Mass was played, I thought that this also was uproariously funny. But behind everything, I had a wonderful feeling of God, and expressed gratitude that I could see this underlying base which was manifested in all that I was experiencing.

In the meantime, the images were becoming less dreamy and more vividly colored. I saw statues of persons, buildings, and similar things, but all moving by very rapidly, continually changing. I had been told to read the postulates I had prepared before the session several times in the first hour or so. I looked at them, but couldn't get the slightest bit interested in them. I began to wonder if I was going to laugh through the whole eight hours of the session. I thought to myself, 'We're going to have to get this guy Myron out here and look him over.' I visualized a kangaroo court, with I and the directors sitting in judgment, while Myron was on trial.

With my eyes closed, I was seeing continuous imagery. When I opened my eyes, the room was still there as it always was, with perhaps more intenseness of color and presence of the various objects, such as I have sometimes experienced in attempts of contemplating my surroundings. From previous reports I had read and heard, I expected that when the drug took effect things in the room would start changing, and I would start experiencing events from the past. Since the room was unchanged, and, if anything, more clear, I felt that the drug had not yet taken effect. I kept looking at my watch, since I had been told that the drug would take effect generally by and hour, and would reach its peak in 1½ to 2 hours. As one hour approached, and nothing happened, I began to get apprehensive. I asked 'Are you sure you gave me enough?' I could feel the drug pulling at me, but with not nearly enough force to overtake customary consciousness. I was assured that I had been given enough. As time passed the one hour mark, I became more and more apprehensive, and kept looking at my watch. I then began to become afraid that the whole thing was not going to work. All my preparatory work, my trip to Canada, my planning on the great spiritual accomplishments I would achieve, would be for naught. This fear continued to mount, and I became more and more in a state of turmoil. My thinking became less clear, my mouth became thick. But even more serious, I was not living up to expectations. One of my directors had made it very clear not only to me but with others that I had passed all preliminary tests in great shape, and that he expected great things from my session. He had described many of the wonders that could be experienced with this material. I began to realize that I was not the person he thought I was, and I began to have feelings of utter failure. Then there was some resentment toward the director for having led me to expect all these wonderful things, which obviously weren't happening! I expressed the fear that I was not living up to the expectations, and the pre-session conversations indicated that they expected too much of me. I was asked, 'Who expected too much from you, Myron?'

This immediately struck home, and I realized with a jolt that it was my expectations that were not being filled. It was I who had come to expect great things, who considered myself a spiritually advanced person, who believed the session would produce an enlightened new being. Then I realized how all my life I had strived and strived to live up to the high standards I continually set for myself. Now it was clear that these standards were all a fabrication, and I had deluded myself in warping my while life to meet these high ideals.

I felt miserable, and sat helplessly, unable to communicate or focus my thoughts. One of the directors handed me a picture of the head of Jesus, done in brilliant color. He asked me to concentrate on it for a while to focus my thoughts. As I sat looking at it, he asked me, 'Who do you see there?' I looked fixedly, as if fascinated, at the picture. After a while it appeared that the eyes were open, then closed, then open and closed in rapid succession. I asked myself, why do the eyes keep opening and closing? Suddenly the picture changed to the head of another man, then another and another in a rapid succession. They changed so rapidly that I could not keep up with them, although I distinctly remember the figure of a pious rabbi with long beard, a caveman with large jaw, and a bald-headed Mongolian with narrow mustache. Finally I said, 'This is every man'.

Next I was asked, 'What is the meaning of the Resurrection?' I knew it was an important question, but could not bring myself to focus on it. Instead I continued to stare stupidly at the picture. After more time had passed, I was asked if I would like to lie down on the couch. I agreed. My mind was very hazy during this period, and I have forgotten many of the details that transpired. However, just before lying down, I remember saying that the material was not working as I had expected, and I was told, 'We have given you the material, Myron. It's up to you to use it'. This made a deep impression on me, as I knew that somehow I was not making proper use of the material. The incident of the picture proved that the material would work if I permitted it.

On the couch, I continued to be in extreme discomfort, with deep sense of failure. It seemed as though the drug were trying to take over, and I kept feeling that I needed more time, more time. I felt as though I was trying to be pulled back into the birth experience. My legs were trying to shrivel up, but they ached and shivered with nothing happening. One of my directors then suggested that I picture myself in the womb, and made some suggestions along these lines. The suggestions were not helpful, although I felt I was trying to go through the birth experience, and it was just taking time to work out. I lay [quietly] and shivered. I placed my hand on my stomach, as I could feel something pressing down there. There was another pressure on my forehead. Observing this, I was asked if I was [an instrument] baby. I somehow felt that I was, and that these were the pressures of instruments. Much time passed on the couch as I struggled to bring myself into the experience. I felt I needed more time, and must have verbalized it. I was asked what it was that I had. I then knew that time was all I had, there was plenty of time. If I didn't do it in this session, there would be another session, and if not then, then a following one. I realized after a while there was no sense postponing it, there was really no way out. The experience had to be gone through, and I might as well face it. If I didn't face it now, there was all the time in the world to face it later, but eventually it must be faced. 

This realization took some time to work out. In the meantime, it was aided by various communications. Some of the more effective questions asked me were[:] 'What does it mean to be born again?' 'What is the meaning of the pearl of great price?' These things I knew, and they helped me face the problem. I was quoted, 'There is a time for _____ and a time for _____, etc. What is this a time for, Myron?' And I knew the answer, that this was a time for being. I was told to let the experience happen, that an air of humility was required. I was reminded that to enter the kingdom of God one must be like little children. All of these things drove home the fact that I must give up control, and let myself go into the experience.

I went through about 1½ to 2 hours of turmoil on the couch. During this period, a strange thing happened to my time scale. Instead of being three hours into the session, I had myself convinced that time had stretched way out, and that I had lay down on the couch after only about ½ hour into the session. The seemingly long time of the drug taking effect was really only about five minutes or so, and I was really going under the way I was supposed to. I felt that if I could get the directors and the room out of consciousness, then I could slip into the experience quite readily. In fact, I even reached the point where the room and some of the conversation I had overheard were not the reality, but some dim illusion, and the reality was that we were only a little over ½ hour into the session, and that I was sneaking away from the illusion so I could go through the birth experience.

At this point, one of the directors sensed what was going on, and had me sit up. He explained that it would do no good to go off on some other time track to go through the experience; this would just be time repeating itself. To have any effect, I must consciously watch the procedure, in contact with my directors. I was very confused, and said that I did not understand. I was told to stop trying to understand, that this was my problem. And I knew that it was. I could see the tremendous effort the rational mind trying to maintain control, to understand and explain everything that was happening. I tried to relinquish this control, but to no avail.

After three hours, with no further developments, I was told to sit up, and asked to think over what had happened in the session thus far and see if there been any value in it. I moved back to the chair, and started meditating. Immediately my mind seemed to clear up, and function extremely well. I saw all that had happened quite clearly, and saw the value of it. I felt that this was the best part of the session thus far, and communicated this thought.

I was told good, then perhaps I could start thinking about the postulates on my paper. What about the first on my list, the need for approval? I started meditating about this, meditating as I would in my regular prayer period. I asked myself whose approval I was seeking. I thought of my father, my mother, and other members of the family, and knew it was not theirs. Then I thought about my birth. I realized thus far that I must have had a difficult birth, that I was an instrument baby, and that somehow I must have been behind schedule. As I thought about this, I suddenly found myself grasped, and squeezed down, and in the womb. The back of my neck and upper vertebrae were crushed in pain. Then I was moving out, and I was taking quick, deep gasps of breath. Suddenly I was out and I felt the wonderful feeling of freedom. Faintly I saw a hospital scene with nurse and doctor, distinctly smelled the ether! Instantly I knew and blurted out, 'I wasn't born on time. They couldn't wait for me to be born!' And from this intense feeling of not living up to expectations, of not coming into the world on time, hinged my insatiable need of approval and my driving compulsion with time. I could see all the patterns of my life tying into this main root - my need for approval, my feeling that there is never enough time and we must never waste time but get things done as fast as possible, always driving, driving for the goal. And with this realization, the patterns and compulsions evaporated! It was quite a relief.

With this experience behind me, I started meditating in earnest. I soon found my mind wandering off in some imagery. Suddenly I realized that for me, phantasy is better then reality. This phrase kept repeating itself over and over, 'Phantasy is better then reality. Phantasy is better then reality.' I asked myself, Why is phantasy better then reality? Immediately the answer came, I can't face reality. Once again I asked myself, why? I then began to get a feeling of dread. I knew that I was about to face some experience of the past that was terribly dreadful, and I did not have any idea what it was. But I somehow knew that it was the most dreadful things I would ever have to face. I communicated my thinking processed to this time. I wanted to ask one of the directors what he thought it might be, but even before doing so realized that it didn't make any difference what he thought, I would have to face it and find out for myself.

It took some time to work up to the next experience. My fear was intense, and it required a great deal of effort to reach the point where I could go through it. I thought how wonderful it would be to be free of whatever was logging me down. I knew there was no avoiding it. In fact, I told my directors that we would have to go through this if it took the rest of the day or even the rest of the week. This I now thoroughly realized, I had all the time I needed, and there was no way out. I told them I would need all of their help, and to pray for me. Instantly I experienced a feeling of lightening of the load, I said, 'Prayer helps.'

Once more I felt myself grasped and pulled into an experience. Again I entered the womb, being crushed down, with the same feeling of my neck and upper vertebrae of my back being under intense, painful pressure. Then I saw a red field before me, with blood vessels running vertically and horizontally. I saw corpuscles of blood running swiftly through the vessels. I realized that I was looking at the wall of the womb. Then I had the feeling of being carried backward in time, going back through a long series of events which passed so quickly it was impossible to see what they were. Suddenly we ( I say 'we' because I feel I was being carried) stopped and I saw a small sphere like a bubble, and it grew and grew until it occupied the while field of vision. As the bubble grew, there was a feeling of freedom, relief of the pressure and pain that still held over from the womb. Suddenly something bright red like a dart pierced the bubble, and I had a definite association of God. I also thought Life. I have not yet comprehended what this experience was, although I had a dim feeling of God granting life, perhaps conception. At any rate, from this point I moved backwards in time again, and the intensity of pain and pressure increased. It was still in the form of my neck and upper back being crushed. Then it felt as though there was a hole in the left rear part of my skull, as though it were deeply depressed. Likewise, my jaw seemed to be pushed way in. I immediately thought of the depressed jaw of the caveman, but I knew the association came from seeing a similar expression in Galliene's report. The intensity of the pressure increased, and built up until I could barely stand it. It felt as though my head were going to burst. All the tissue seemed to be in great tension, and I recognized the feeling as one I had felt in prayer many times, but had avoided allowing building up to this intensity. As I was wondering how much more I could stand, I felt as though the back of my head was being ripped apart. As this happened, I saw an image of a circle which then divided itself in two, as a cell divides. I could feel and hear a ripping sound as this happened. There was a slight feeling of relief as the two halves parted, then the tension gradually subsided, and the experience was over.

I could not comprehend the significance of the experience after the vision of the wall of the womb. Also, there was no feeling of relief or understanding, and I knew that there was more to go through. Once again I had to steel myself for another dreadful experience. I asked myself, 'What more does God want of me?' I thought about it, and thought perhaps I had not experienced enough pain. I must be ready to face more pain, and for a longer period of time. I thought of the parable of the pearl of the great price, and realized the tremendous insight and genius of Jesus. I had always thought that I had understood that parable, but now I saw that there was much, much more to it, and I was filled with wonder. I saw clearly that we could not have the Kingdom until we were willing to pay the full price, and the price was much greater then I ever expected. And I knew that it had to be greater, else we could never realize the value and worth of the Kingdom.

It did not take as long this time to prepare for the next experience. The next time I felt myself pulled under, my head was turned leaning to one side as thought against my will. The same pain in the neck and upper back was there. My face felt real long, as though my head were that of a horse. I was held in this position for a while, and then the experience slowly subsided. I recovered, wondering what it was all about. After a while it started in again, following exactly the same pattern. This time, however, the pressure on the neck and back was much greater. The pressure slowly built up, as though my neck and upper back were being squeezed in vise. I could feel each little bone aching separately. The pain got so intense that I didn't see how it could get any worse, and remained so. I thought to myself, 'Is this as much pain as I can stand?' Perhaps I should have stand even more, so that I would cry out. I felt as though it were impossible to feel any more pain, although I didn't feel like crying out. This peak of pain continued for a while, then gradually subsided.

When the experience was over, I felt as though I still did not have the answer. Something more was still expected of me. I communicated my bewilderment, and asked, 'What more does God want of me? I was willing to stand pain (which for me is about the worst possible thing to face, as I've always been afraid of physical pain) but that wasn't enough. Then I was willing to stand pain for a long time, but that still [wasn't] enough.' I thought to myself, what more can I give? Then the answer came - the only thing I could think of to give that was more than I had already given was life itself. I communicated this thought, and said, 'Perhaps I almost lost my life in the birth experience, and I have to go through that again.' So I started meditating on this thought.

I thought to myself that many times I had meditated on what I would give to God, and had certainly meditated on my willingness to give up my life. Then I suddenly saw that it was not I who was giving up my life. I had always been willing to give my life, providing someone else pulled the trigger. I was willing to be nailed to the cross, but someone else would do the nailing. Then I realized that in my whole pattern of doing God's will, I was simply allowing myself to be maneuvered into situations, and then willingly accepting the circumstances. I was not using my initiative! I realized with deep intensity that initiative was one of the key functions that God gave us. It is a priceless possession, and must be used creatively. It is this God-given initiative that makes us specifically human. And I could see in countless situations in my life, I was not using it, but taking a passive attitude, letting others determine the conditions and then merely following suit.

With this realization, I knew that I must willingly and actively hand over my life to God. This then I was prepared to do. But as soon as I started, a tremendous feeling of relief came over me. I saw that I didn't have to give up my life! I only had to be willing to do so! This realization and the relief that it brought was so intense that I felt that this was the principal point of the whole session. As soon as I saw this, I announced, 'The session is over!'

Eight hours had passed now, and preparations for dinner commenced. I sat, still somewhat agitated and trembling, trying to absorb the enormous impact of all that I had been through. As I became more relaxed and settled down, I soon felt like meditating again. I therefore asked for quiet, and proceeded to think. I couldn't help but marvel at all that I had seen. I was amused by the fact that after all I had been through, in the end I was required to do nothing. However, I had been forced to experience a lot before this was shown to me. I was also amused by my first impression in the session that it was all tremendously funny. If I had only known what I would have to face! I realized that great responsibility we face when we ask others to take up the spiritual path. Never again could I ask anyone to do this. It must be his own free choice.

I realized at this time that I had not experience any of the mystical experiences and wonder of God that I had heard about. These to me seemed highly irrelevant. At my present state of development, the simple truths which I had realized were the [all-important] things, and everything else seemed incidental by comparison. I knew that we would be shown only that which corresponded to our state of development. Yet as I thought about it, it occurred to me that now I had realized some of the essential truths, and particularly saw the price of the Kingdom, perhaps God would show me some of these wonders. I began to meditate on it, and experienced a wonderful feeling of power. Now God and I were partners, and there is nothing he would not show me, from the ends of Time to the outermost reaches of space. Dim vision of these things floated by - not concrete experience as I had preciously been through, but dreamy images. I felt that God and I together could fly anywhere. So I said to myself, 'All aboard. Let's go.' And I thought of what I would like to see first.

Suddenly, I realized, 'Just a minute, brother. Who says where we are going to go?' Then I realized I had placed myself in the drivers seat. It was I who was deciding where we should go. We would get no place on this basis. It was God who would decide where we would go. And it was up to me to be willing to go wherever He led me, regardless of where it may be. I realized that this too had been true throughout my life - I insisted on being the pilot, maintaining always tight, rational control, selfishly wanting to call the shots. I could see the error of this pattern, and my job was to simply be, be just plain old Myron, even though he were not all the fancy things I had previously thought him to be. So now I prepared myself to experience whatever God had in store for me, even though it be painful and fearful.

As I realized the need to be willing to accept what may come, I felt that I still had more to go through in the birth experience. I asked the directors for their help. I was told that too much time had elapsed now, and the material would run out in a couple of minutes. Therefore there was no point in starting anything new. I was disappointed, although I realized there was no rush and would be plenty of time in the future sessions. My disappointment stemmed from my feelings of failure in the session, for having taken so long to get started, and hoping that I could clear up more things before it was over. However, I was talked out of it, and we proceeded with dinner.

I felt very good while eating, but toward the end of dinner began feeling depressed. My mind kept dwelling in the birth experience, and I was afraid of being alone that night, feeling that I would be pulled right back into it. I still felt under the influence of the material, and after dinner I stated this and said that I felt like trying to go through the experience. I was advised against it, it being pointed out that once during the session I had been unwilling to take advice of the directors, trying to get away from them when my time scale was changing. I felt duly contrite, but even while the director was talking, I had to fight back an almost uncontrollable urge to plunge into the birth experience. After a couple of hours of talking and a brisk walk, I was given some pills to put me to sleep. It seemed to take ages for them to work, as my mind kept working most actively. I finally fell asleep, and awoke the next morning with a wonderful feeling of stability.

While I think that the first day after the session I was still somewhat disappointed in myself in finding that I was really at a much lower spiritual level then I thought, within a few days when I more fully comprehended what had transpired, I realized that I had gotten exactly what I wanted! The full impact of insight I had obtained and the wonder of God struck home, changing my entire life in ways that defy description.

I was back from college in my hometown for Christmas. It started off like a normal day. I woke up around 1 or 2 pm, laid on the couch with some food and vegged-out. Around 4 oclock that night a good friend of mine, M, called me and said that he was on his way back into town at the moment and asked if I wanted to hang out with an old high school buddy that went to school downtown and have a few brewskis and a bowl or two. Elated to have something to do in this boring town, I agreed and hurried to meet him ignoring my dad in the den as he yelled at me not to stay out to late. I went by the liquor store with a fake ID and picked up a case of beer, cigarettes, and a bottle of rum. We drove downtown to Cs apartment and began to drink with C, B (a high school friend who was squatting in Cs room) and J, Cs roommate who we knew fairly well. 

About 6 oclock, C and J disappeared and came back an hour later with 22 hits of blotter and two more people I had never met before. At first sight they looked incredibly sketchy (I quickly learned that these were some of the coolest and funniest people I will ever meet) but I decided not to say anything until I met them.

I am a strong believer that an acid trip can go however you want it to, its all in your head. Because of that, I find spontaneity when taking acid improves the overall trip. Rather than someone planning it for a long time, getting really excited and then not having a great trip which is really, really annoying. And since I had had absolutely no intention to take a dose that night, I felt it was a great time to take some.

We stood in a silent circle around the acid, frozen in silent awe at our awesome score. 22 hits for $160. We divided them evenly between the 8 people, except for B who took four (no one wants to be around B on 4 hits of acid).

C and J didnt have an TV in their apartment so to pass the time we turned some music on, cut the lights, plugged in a multi-colored disco ball, and played drinking games and smoked weed to pass the time during that Acid Hour until we came up. After an hour and 15 minutes we started to get pissed that it wasnt working. We certainly felt it, but there were no visuals. Usually, I try to forget about the acid and let it come on by itself. But this unwatched pot was not boiling. I decided to get up and walk around, get the blood flowing. I knew it probably wouldnt do anything but I didnt care.

Standing up, I walked throughout the apartment, stopping randomly to stare at something and try to make it move. Mostly blank stretches of walls or a cool looking pattern on the carpet. I rounded the hall corner and walked into Cs bedroom. I glanced around for something trippy to look at but found nothing. And then I saw it. It wasnt anything special in fact. I had to do a double take because it was so mundane of an object. Stuck to Cs wall was one of the most well-known posters today. It was a black and white portrait of Jim Belushi from Animal House with the signature COLLEGE shirt on. But as I looked at the poster, a very small fuzzy, grayish-blackish dot appeared in the center of his face. I stared at it a little bit longer, wondering what this thing was about to do next.

The spot began to grow so that it covered his entire face. I remained there, 2 feet from the wall, staring at this perfectly normal poster with the most confused look on my face. I stared at if for a few more seconds when M walked in, going to use Cs bathroom. He stopped halfway across the dim room, the only light coming through the hallway door. What the fuck are you doing in here in the dark? Wondering why Jims face is gone and been replaced by a black hole. I replied nonchalantly, still staring the into the darkness over the actors face. M burst out laughing, but not a normal laugh, this one was louder and more prolonged than usual. I concluded that M had started tripping too. You trippin? I'm getting there. I saw some stuff move a minute ago but I was going to look in the mirror. But now I really want to see this black hole. Ha ha, its weird. I know his face is there, but I can't see it at all. Well what is there? Nothing, that is what is so cool. His face is made of nothing, if nothing was a substance. Imagine a static screen on a TV, but frozen still and melting slightly. M looked at me an laughed again, Dude, if I wasnt on three, that would have been the most absurd thing I have ever heard, but I think I know what you are talking about.

We stood up and walked into the incredibly bright bathroom. We stood next to each other, staring into what seemed like a carnival mirror that I could bend with my mind. After making the mirror bend so much I felt like throwing up, and gasping for air between laughter, I dragged my self, now fully tripping, coming up strong and fast, from the bathroom and crawled into the den flat on my stomach, because I though that if I stood up, booby traps hidden in the wall would pop out and attack me.

The rest of the night consisted of a blur of visuals from the disco ball and Christmas ornaments hung by invisible fishing wire from the ceiling with moments of clarity as we ventured outside the apartment into the half indoor/half outdoor hallways that made up the apartment building. We got lost several times in the labyrinthine hallways that seemed to stretch forever in both directions. Every once in a while, one of us would get left behind, sitting in a corner staring at something that no one else could see, only to round a corner with a resounding scream as they walked directly into the rest of the group. Around 1am, J had an idea to go to the top of the parking deck that was attached to the building and look at the sky scrapers of downtown Birmingham and look at the stars and get some fresh air. We rode the elevator to the sixth floor, and as we stepped out, it was like walking into an arena. The ceiling and walls melted away to reveal nothing but black sky above with hundreds of tiny stars. The always lit lights on the citys skyscrapers illuminated patterns on their sides. It didnt take me long to realize that I could control the height of each of the skyscrapers, and make them move up and down in rhythm. From somewhere, Timezones by Widespread Panic floated into my head as the skyscrapers started to dance. They shot up and down going from 2 stories to 150 instantaneously, rising and falling to the beat of the music.

I was told later that I stood on the top of that parking deck in 25 degree weather and bad winds, staring out at the city long after the others had left, from 1:00 til around 2:45 when someone came up to get me. I think when on the trip from the roof back to the room was when I began to stop having intense visuals. Really the only visuals I had for the rest of the night were still there, but not nearly as pronounced. But as the visuals began to stop, a whole different wave washed over me. I regained a sense of my self and started the hardest mental trip I have ever had. 

The wee hours of the morning from when I came back to the room till around 6:30 am consisted of 7 people, 2 of who I had only met 15 minutes before eating their dose, crammed into a tiny bedroom with no chairs and the lights out. We sat and smoked, and talked about acid and smoked and talked about how life was like a movie, just not about us, and smoked...you get the idea.

At about 5:00 we decided to go back to the roof one more time to watch the sunrise. I honestly have never witnessed a more incredibly, breathtaking beautiful sight as the sun coming up over Red Mountain and shining down on the buildings below us and the skyscrapers in the distance. As the sun rose, shooting streaks of orange, red, and dark purple across the sky, it shone through a huge long fluffy cloud, flushing it with color. Everyone of us, all seven, saw a colored dragon head of the exact same description a the same time form in the clouds and cruise across the sky.

Around 6:30am, J had the great idea to get everyone thinking about food. Now, normally, Im not hungry when I am on acid, but he made Micky-Ds biscuits sound so good. So at about 7:15, still tripping incredibly hard, myself, J, and Js friend and his girlfriend tried to prepare our selves mentally for what we were about to do. The biscuits were a 3 block walk, through 10 crosswalks round trip, and an entire downtown industrial section of the city getting up to go to work. We opened the gate and walked out side into the morning sunlight, walked about 8 steps to the first crosswalk, looked at the morning commuters that were whizzing by, starting their day and going through their day to day problems and realized that there was a real world out here and were were tripping way to hard to do this right now. We did it any way. We walked in the freezing cold and with giant pupils the three blocks to the restaurant. Upon arrival, we realized that we couldnt go in and risk someone seeing us do something crazy. So we sat, diagonally across the street from a police department, cops driving by about once ever 45 seconds, in the freezing cold and tried to suppress our psychedelic delusions as we ate steaming butter biscuits.

We made the trip back to the apartment without incident, but that...

WAS WHEN DISASTER STRUCK!

Sitting in Js den at about 8:00, my cell phone rings. At first I dismiss my ringtone to the acid, but it rang again and this time my friends asked my if it was mine. I looked at the caller on the front of the phone. Mom it read. It took about 20 seconds for me to remember what went wrong. I remembered something vague, a voice, telling me something, OH NO my dad telling me not to stay out late, and I had not come home. Maybe not with you, but I have a very strict set of parents, if they had found out what I was doing, I could kiss my next semester at college good bye. I fell into a bad trip instantly. I couldnt figure out how I was going to get out of it and I panicked, the acid just magnified it. The walls began to close, I got short of breath, and a huge well of anger rose up. I stormed out of the apartment and screamed and hurled my phone against the ground, shattering it. My friends dragged my inside and calmed me down. Soon, with a great help from the acid, I accepted my fate and decide to not let it get me down for now. But then I began to think of the situation from an objective point of view to try and search for an answer. Lo and behold, I found one. I pieced together a story that would satisfy my parents questions and any snooping with my friends parents they might do and enjoyed the rest of the trip, my parents took the story, and my only punishment was that I was not allowed to go to sleep that day, and spent it doing errands and yard work for my parents.

But looking back on it, this experience made me respect acid, how fun and fickle it is, but also how it lets me look at things from an entire different perspective.

It was around 12:30am when a very peculiar looking character rolled up on a dark red moped. 'Sorry for making you guys wait so long,' he told me and my friends. He reached inside his little fanny pack that was tied around his belt a pulled out a huge block of bubblelicious bubble gum wrapped in cellophane. 'Well here's your 'cid. I put an extra one in there for having to wait so long.' Me and my crew knew that the fucker was supposed to be there at least 4 hours ago. 'And you know, I have an extra one in my pocket that I'm probably not gonna eat anyway so you can have it too.' He took it out of his pocket and set it on top of the brick.

There were 18 hits in total for a group of four acid veterans who were very sketchy about this whole bubblegum business; it was the first we'd ever heard of such a thing. It was me who had found this dude giving us the stuff, and we were already beginning to think we were getting ripped off. Acid is very hard to come by in the great state of Texas, so we knew there would be hell to pay if this son of a bitch runs off with our cash. I gave the man $160 and he drove away in on his moped. 'What kind of drug dealer drives a fucking moped!?' my friend Cody asked, 'I had better fucking trip or I'm gonna find that guy and kick his ass!' Our patience wore thin as the guy was 4 hours late, but there it was, 16 hits plus 2. Now something you must understand, acid is not a fairly common drug around these parts. Hell, I felt proud of myself that I had even found any, but when you do find some it's usually weak and you have to take so much of it that you get pissed for spending all that money.

Four of the hits were not ours; someone had given me some money and bought some. This will affect my trip later so it's imperative that you know this. The actual bubblegum looked very legit, you could actually see the acid dripping out of the hole that the guy had made to drop it in. We split up the brick four ways so that we each had 3 hits, and split the 2 extra hits in half so we each had a half. We all started chewing at the same time and went back inside to play video games. So the crew which consisted of Zac, Cody, Johnny, and me, were inside waiting for the stuff to hit us playing Halo 1. 'You know I've got a feeling this is actually legit,' Cody said. 'Why?' I asked. 'Because I feel really relaxed, and usually I feel relaxed when I'm about to trip the fuck out.' He was right, the room had been absolutely quiet for the past 15 minutes, not a word uttered, were we already frying to the point to where we were zoning out. It wasn't too much longer before me and Zac noticed that we were doing incredibly bad at the game. 'Alright dude, I can't concentrate,' said Zac. 'Yeah me neither.' So we went out to the garage to smoke cigarettes. Even though I don't smoke, might as well follow the crowd.

It was like we transitioned into a different world when we walked through the garage door. It hit us all at once. I noticed that the car door for the garage was breathing in and out, and a bottle hanging from the ceiling by a wind catcher from a party we'd had earlier in the year was swinging violently back and forth, but it wasn't. I was trying to hold myself together because I didn't know if everyone else was tripping like I was. 'Dude, I'm fucked up!' said Johnny, and a wave of laughter came over all of us, and it kicked in the full effects of this wonderful drug. 'I feel like dancing!' said Cody, and he started doing the weirdest dances known to modern man. He did a move where he makes his body limp and pulls himself back up by his collar. For a moment, I thought he was an actual ragdoll, the thought caused me to laugh hysterically. I looked around at the garage and noticed that everything's shadow was moving, but the object itself was staying still, and the garage closet was moving as though the wind were blowing it in and out.

It was around this time I wanted to go and relax and enjoy my trip. 'I'm gonna go inside and lay down,' I said. As I walked through the door I noticed Zac's picture. It was an oriental dragon flying through the clouds with some sort of kanji next to it. The dragon looked as if it was coming out of the picture and moving and twisting it's long body through the room as the clouds came out with it. 'Wow,' I said. How something so beautiful can be so bad? The dragon turned towards me and opened its mouth and inside I saw the earth, the room was making noise and the clouds seeping out of the poster started making thunder and lightning, it was so overwhelming. I started to notice that my eyes were burning and I blinked, and it was all gone, and the room was quiet again. The dragon was back in his frame just gliding through the background. 'That was cool.' It was all that I could say, the experience had left me in complete awe. How long had I been standing there I wondered, had my thoughts began to rip the very fabrics of time and space? I knew I was in the thick of it; I'd gone down the rabbit hole and walked through the doors of perception. Now all I could do was take the ride.

1:45 AM. I was still standing in the middle of the living room, wondering if what I had just seen was possible. I could feel the beast coursing through my body. My senses were amplified so much to the point where I didn't need my glasses. I heard footsteps coming from the garage and heard the back door knob jiggle, in came the rest of my crew all laughing hysterically, which in turn made me laugh. 'How long have you been standing here?' asked Zac. 'I don't know, not that long I guess.' We then retreated back to Zac's room. While we walked down the hall it seemed to get longer and longer. I thought I heard the song 'For Your Love' by the Yardbirds for a second but even now I don't know whether it was reality or just some fucking strange loop in my mind's inability to perceive what was going on.

We sat down and smoked some grass. The room felt like a capsule in which endless possibilities were drawn on the walls. We all couldn't sit still. It was amazing we were all thinking each other's thoughts. There was no need for communication, simple grunts, laughs, and hand gestures allowed us to understand what we were each seeing or hearing. Zac's room in itself was a trip, different characters from other people's minds were drawn onto the walls, the people's creativity splattered on the surfaces for an everlasting moment, all moving and distorting. I could actually taste their colors and I felt as though everything was a part of me. 'Shit won't stop moving man!' exclaimed Cody, pulling me out of my trance. He had removed his shirt and was sweating profusely; he looked like a wildman, someone who was raised by wild beasts in the jungle and couldn't possibly fit in with the rest of society.

2:30 AM. I didn't feel comfortable sitting down; there was an urge to move so that nothing could grow too attached to my body. If I did sit, I knew I wouldn't move for hours. I got up and went down the spiraling hallway to the living room again. I noticed Zac was in the kitchen drinking a soda on which the graphic was spiraling round and round as the can itself remained still. I too was very thirsty.

I grabbed one and opened it, my senses all amped up to near superhuman perceived the opening can as an explosion and gave me a scare. Zac laughed at my stupidity, so did I. I drank from the kaleidoscopic can. The liquid felt like electricity quenching my thirst but making my body's senses go haywire as if someone threw a wrench into the mechanics, an electric impulse that started at the back of my neck, went down my spine to my feet, then up again to the back of my brain. As I moved my head back to its regular position, I felt the soda swirling all throughout my being, like a cold snake burrowing through my innards to kill my thirst. 'This is the best soda I've ever drank man!' I said while laughing, I felt as if everything in life was meant to be joyful and nothing could make it bad. This is where my mind slipped off the tracks. 

I put the rest of the acid back in the fridge so that it would be fresh for the guy who bought it. I looked just to check and see if it was still there, there were supposed to be four individual pieces of gum, but there were only three. I felt fear and anger creep up my spine like the way magma flows to the mouth of a volcano. 'WHO THE FUCK ATE ANOTHER FUCKING HIT!?' My words seemed to make the very earth itself shake, 'THERE WERE FOUR FUCKING HITS THAT WEREN'T OURS IN THE FRIDGE AND NOW THERE'S ONLY THREE! WHO THE FUCK TOOK IT!?' By this time Cody had run to the kitchen and was freaking out, 'Dude I swear to God I didn't take it.' 'Those weren't my fucking hits man. This isn't cool!' All of a sudden I didn't feel safe, I felt that everyone was my enemy, no one could be trusted. I stormed off to the living room in a rage. All of the walls were starting to close in on me, the floor turned to slime and the ceiling started to melt and hang down like goo. I was scared by the thoughts of what was going to happen if I didn't have all the hits. My world was imploding and it felt as though I was already dead. Then, I heard Zac's words and they snapped me back to reality, 'Oh shit dude, this is gonna make him have a bad trip.' He was right, I had already started decomposing from the inside out. I knew that if I started losing it, everyone else would too. I have to take control, push the thoughts aside, what's done is done there's no way to change it. I forced my mind to forget the nightmares that were to come, stay in the now and forget about the future. 'Ok guys, what's done is done, fuck it, I'm not gonna have you guys have a bad trip because of me. So just forget about it, let's move on.'

3:45 AM. With the situation over with I soon forgot about the missing hit. Objects were dancing back and forth, and pictures with different characters in them were coming to life before my very eyes. Music! I thought, Music would make this a whole lot cooler. I put my hand inside my pocket and pulled out my MP3 player and went back to Zac's room the rest of the crew was out smoking cigarettes. I lay out on the bed and looked up at the ceiling. Zac has a lot of stars drawn onto his ceiling with chalk. I focused on the stars while listening to Planet Caravan by Pantera. The song is very psychedelic. It's about a space caravan and has a very fluid sound.

As it played I closed my eyes and felt as though I was floating through the sky, looking down through the clouds and seeing the entire city's lights from a bird's eye view. Then I soared higher until I broke through the atmosphere and was flying through space. I saw the world in all its purple beauty spiraling through the cosmos. I opened my eyes; I was back in the room looking at the stars. I concentrated on the ceiling, and one by one the stars started to peel off like stickers, then they hovered right underneath the ceiling and started waving like a flag, all in synchronization. Stars then started sprouting out like flowers in a fast stop motion film. I saw a shadow move across the room and a wavy figure standing in the doorway.

4:30 AM. 'Dude what're you doing?' Zac said with a chuckle. 'Just lie down and put this on.' I handed him the MP3 player. I went to go lay on the couch in the living room but I noticed a guitar and an amp in the back of the room. Now, I'm an avid guitar played, no Eddie Van Halen perhaps but I do know my way around a fret board. This guitar was a Dean From Hell. It's a blue guitar with lightning on it and was just sitting next to an amplifier. I touched it, felt the 'energy'. I picked it up plugged it in and began to play. According to what the crew was saying I had never played so good in my life. As I played I looked down at the lightning on the guitar, when I would make a note, the lightning would fluctuate. I felt as though that I could cause the beginning of new life or destroy it with this guitar. I could disorient the very universe with the flick of the whammy bar. And it was good.

5:30 AM. Around this time I went outside and saw the purple sky - the sun was coming up. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I immediately ran inside and got the crew. 'Come outside its beautiful!' We all ran out and examined the spectacle. The clouds seemed to be objects floating and casting their shadows upon the canvas that was the sky. The purple and golden rays seemed to be cleansing the sky of all impurities. We all stood for about an hour.

7:00 AM. Everyone started to get tired; after all it had been about eight hours since we dropped it, plus the endless amount of waiting we had to endure for the stuff to actually get to us. The trip was starting to wear down and everyone had been lying in their sleeping spots for a while, still tripping and shaking. Strangely I didn't feel tired; I was just up and walking around looking at everyone wrapped up in their blankets like caterpillars in cocoons. The thoughts about the stolen hit were still in the back of my mind. Zac was still awake, and I was asking him about whom he thinks might have taken it 'I don't know man, but I have an idea for you if you're that worried about it.' 'Lay it on me.' 'You should go and eat one more hit, and tell the guy that theirs 2 hits on each gum.' It was a brilliant plan, one that would make even the Watergate masterminds say wow. At least it was to me. So I went to the fridge and opened it up and took one more hit. 

7:15 AM. This amounted to my fourth one. It didn't even take five minutes for me to feel the familiar rushing sensation. I was locked in my dreamland again. There was a girl who I have never seen before just laying out on the couch, I didn't even know when she had gotten there, or at least I couldn't remember, I guess she woke up because of my constant shuffling about the house. 'I need to go home,' she told me, 'Where's Joey?' Joey? I knew who she was talking about, but I had no idea that he was here. 'I don't know, I'm still tripping. Just look around the house, I'm sure he's around here somewhere.' Her make-up was poorly done, and although she had a nice body, she wasn't much to look at. 'Alright,' she told me, 'But look with me, I don't know whoever lives here and I just don't wanna be walkin' around in someone's house and...' Her words started to run together, and her mouth was producing sentences at a million miles per hour. I couldn't concentrate, I was completely zoned out on her poorly drawn make-up, melting face, and fast-talking mouth that didn't make any noise other than complete and total nonsense.

'What?' she asked. Was I talking? Did she hear me? Did I really say all those things to her face? 'I didn't say anything.' So we ended up finding Joey blacked out on the couch with a Seagram's 7 bottle in his hand. She woke him up and asked him to take her home. 'Fuckin' shit alright go get in the car.' I asked to go along since he was coming back anyway. 'Yeah whatever dude.' She got in the front seat and I got in the bed of the truck. At this point the trip was in full effect and was distorting my perception and amplifying everything again. As we took off I felt the truck rumbling underneath me. The ground was moving very fast. Maybe when we move, we ourselves do not move, but the earth itself rotates to create movement. This thought plagued my thoughts as I could not think of anything else. Then I felt the truck stop. The girl got out and left without saying a word, nothing more than a memory in my sick and twisted acid filled mind. 

8:00 AM. When we had gotten back I felt a cool breeze as if the house wanted me to come back in. 'I'm gonna chill out here for a while man,' I told Joey, even though he probably didn't care. He shrugged his shoulders and went inside to pass out. I had never tripped during the day before. Drugs are never meant to be used during the early morning hours when nice upstanding average Joes kiss their average Janes and go off to work to contribute to society. The freaks are the ones who are out at night looking for that next rush, the next push to knock them into another reality, while the Joes and Janes sit in their nice little homes, cozy, not having a care in the world, the freaks, monsters, and junkies come out to have their fun. But, once every so often, one of the freaks will go out on a limb to push it as hard and as long as they can and wander around the average world, not being equipped to perceive or see with average eyes. Theirs are eyes that have seen other worlds and have lived in them for so long, that 'normal' is just a word, not a way of life.

As I sat on the porch bench nothing seemed to be really happening other than my senses being amplified. I looked at my arm. I have a natural bronze-like complexion and long hair, as I looked down my hair fell from my head and landed on my arm, I started to zone out, my arm started to turn into sand with my arm hair turning into small cactuses. Then it started to distort and little hills were starting to form. I had a desert on my arm, and my black hair started to curl around my arm. It formed into cracks which made my arm look like an even more realistic picture. I finally managed to tear myself away from the spectacle on my arm and looked straight ahead to the open yard and saw heaven. 

8:30 AM. The yard was beautiful; I could see the leaf of every tree, each blade of grass, and every bug in radiant color. The whole thing looked like a big high definition T.V. and was so intense that it almost hurt to look at. Walk around the block, I told myself. Get everything out of this trip, you've just taken another hit, you've got another eight hours or so. So I popped in my MP3 player and started down the road. Everything was perfect, I was so overwhelmed by the beauty of everything that it was almost too fascinating to believe. The only way to describe the feelings would be to get in a near death accident, and learn to appreciate everything a little bit more. The road's gravel looked like small marbles that were moving around my feet when I came down onto the ground. Before I knew it I was back at the house. 

11:00 AM. Acid is not always good to trip on when you're alone unless you're expecting it. When you are not alone, but everyone else is asleep, it's truly maddening. The want to talk to someone, to tell them what you are going through always helps, but it's very hard when the person is dead-ass asleep in front of you. I felt like I was going insane. The background of the house had seemed to go from wild and lively to dull and eerie. The sound of silence was killing me, what's to stop me from simply raising hell all over the house? Anything to stop the silence! No, I must remain calm, everything will be all right. I rolled a joint in hopes that it would calm my nerves, the acid had turned on me, I was now stuck in silence, gazing at the melting pictures of the house and trying to keep my feet away from the crumbling floor. Five hours or so of catatonic despair, total cosmic annihilation. Sitting. Waiting for I don't know what. Silence. No thoughts, no noise, just me and the blackness of space that now filled the room.

4:00 PM. Someone's at the door. It's Zac's mom. Luckily she's a hippy and would probably take some acid herself if she didn't have to do her own thing. 'ZAC! GET UP WE GOTTA GO GROCERY SHOPPING!' her voice echoed throughout the house and made the distorting hallway fluctuate like a wave. 'God damn it. OK! Fuck.' Zac got up slower than a glacier moves across Antarctica. 'Hey man, are you tripping again?' His face was twisted and had a very pale tone, I could almost see his skull. 'Yeah dude!' 'Alrighty man, hey do you want to come to the grocery store with us? I'm sure that'll be a fuckin' trip!' I decided to go, I didn't want to spend one more god damn minute in that house. 

4:15 PM. Well as it turns out, the grocery store that we went to was one that I used to work at. Oh man, this is gonna be weird. As we walked up towards the store through the parking lot I started to have thoughts about when I used to work there. I saw the new recruits pushing carts, doing the old shit that I used to have to do, and now these poor bastards were doing the labor mindlessly like zombies. When we walked through the doors I felt the coolness of the inside air blow against my face like it was decontaminating my whole body. Then it got weird.

I saw familiar faces, faces that I hadn't seen in almost five years. I didn't even know that most of them still lived in the same area. Now here I was, tripping on acid and seeing all these faces and ones that I didn't even know, staring back at me. The aisles of the store we lined with different products proudly displaying the pictures of their post-prepared insides. They all looked very delicious. As we walked by the salads I looked at their packages, the pictures of the salads looked like they were coming off the package and were floating right there in front of me, it looked like I could just grab it. But I knew it was just the acid and if I did in fact make a reach I would look like a complete dumb-ass. I walked further down the aisle and people started passing me left and right. What the fuck? They were all looking at me, staring me down like they knew that my head was full of acid.

Finally we were headed to the check-out line, but there was one obstacle I still had to face. The girl who was at the check-out stand was one of my friends when I used to have a job. She didn't know about the freak inside me. The thoughts were starting to give me brain bubbles, what would I say? What would she think? Would she bring the hammer down? Would she..? Would she...? Would she...? 'I'm gonna go wait in the truck dude, I'm fuckin' trippin' balls man.' I had to get out of there. I couldn't fit in with this crowd especially since they already knew everything about me. As I waited in the truck I saw the people going into the store. Their faces all blurred and disoriented staring back at me. I couldn't handle it. I closed my eyes and watched the dancing colors and waited for the truck to move.

5:30 PM. The trip was starting to wear down, all of my senses were starting to come back to their original states. I felt tired, but the beast wouldn't let me go, not yet. My mind was telling my body that it needed rest, but the signals were all out of whack, making me tremble and shake. I lay down on the couch. I didn't want to be like this anymore. I closed my eyes and watched the visuals. I didn't know how long I was lying there. But I never once went to sleep. I was just an empty shell waiting for my soul to come back and take control.

10:30 PM. The visuals were long gone, but the weird feelings still remained. I didn't feel like I was tripping, but I was. My skin was very sensitive, and parts of my muscles were twitching and I wasn't controlling them. Am I going to be like this forever? 'Hey man, do you want me to take you home? You've been lying in that same position for hours, were you asleep?' Zac's voice seemed like I had not heard it in years. 'No, I've just been waiting for this fuckin' trip to stop. But yeah man, go ahead and take me home.' I got up and gathered my things and went out to the truck.

11:00 PM. On the way to my house, things seemed different. I would notice different visuals and get weird feelings about situations. I felt strung out, like the acid had taken my body and out it through the most gruesome therapy ever. The ridiculous amount of stress that was put on my body was beginning to show it's consequence. 

We finally pulled up to my apartment, 'See ya later man, just go to sleep you'll be good tomorrow!' I said bye to my friend and went up the stairs to my apartment. Sanctuary. Then the feelings overwhelmed me, I was so tired I could barely walk. What a crude mistress LSD is, but oh so worth it. I got in the shower and turned the water on. The acid was still in me, but barely. The beast was finally dying and I was the victor. I felt every drop, every molecule of water hit my skin. I zoned out in the tub. I had to will myself out of the tub, I had gotten too relaxed and thought that I was in there for hours. When I got into bed I turned on my PS3 and started watching Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I glanced at the clock. 

12:45AM. I had tripped for 24 hours straight, incredible. I could barely see anything now and the body fry had calmed down enough for me to finally relax. I just lay there watching the movie, I don't even remember going to sleep. I just remember Dr. Gonzo and Raul Duke's words. Gonzo: 'We're your friends, we're not like the others.' Duke: 'GET IN.'

10:30 AM. When I woke up, I felt renewed, confident. I was just up and wanting to go out and do things. I could smell the air, taste the nitrogen and oxygen compounds that graced my nostrils. Everything was vibrant and radiant color. I was ready for anything, come whatever may I thought. Let's get this day started, with a new understanding.

LSD Trip Journal begins: I need to try to straighten out what happened so I can read about it later, or at least just see it written down so it cant keep escaping me. 

Let me note that when I first consumed this Happy Fungus Juice, as Austin has named it, I had no idea any of this mind bending bat-shit insane stuff was lurking just around the bend. I was under the impression that my mind would remain relatively sober while enjoying some crazy hallucinations. This was not at all the case in the very least whatsoever. I was so lost. I was lost in my own mind. After getting off work at five, on a Friday, I walked over to a house my friend was taking care of for somebody, met up with my two friends, and dropped three hits of acid in the form of liquid dropped onto candy. It was about five thirty.

After waiting around for about an hour and a half I began to feel very altered, along with my friends who well call Austin and Ryan. I, however, was feeling much farther off base than they were: a fact I almost doubted in the beginning, but it became more and more apparent as time wore on, because phenomena which I felt acutely in the early hours were later reported by at least Ryan as well. When I come to think of it, I did have 50% more acid. Upon investigation online, the three hits I consumed is larger than an average dose, especially for a first try. As we started to come up we decided it would be good to be outdoors and exited the house on foot, bound uphill to a forested river area. 

Out in the forest on the trail everything I heard seemed to be echoing to me from a tremendous, tremendous distance. I had no idea where I was, and totally forgot my location despite the fact that I was right next to a well-traveled road that I have known for nearly 15 years. This sensation of being lost was so strong that I repeatedly tried to explain it to my friends. Despite that, I was not frightened. I was simply overcome with wonderment.

What began inside myself as a sort of insistent vibration, or rapid pulse, managed to travel outward into the entire world. Everything was pulsing at me so quickly that it appeared to shine and jump out at me, much in the way images are displayed on an electronic screen, I could not differentiate between the different pulses creating the image, but I knew (or felt in this trippy case) that they were in fact separate. They were only streaming together to create what appeared to be a seamless shine or sparkle. They were separate and continuous at the same time.

Depth and size, my very sense of distance was awry in a way I have never before felt or imagined. For example, while on a walkway (perhaps two or three feet tall) I felt as though I were on a very, very tall bridge. And, merely because I could hear a river, I assumed that there was a river underneath this bridge. In reality there was only the ground.  Things continued to seem incredibly far away from me, both in that the space between me and a particular rock, perhaps 15 feet, felt exceptionally far, but also in that things that were far away, say half a mile, appeared to be right next to me. Its as if my normal continuous concept of how deep things are has been sliced into two or three parts (in categories of right there with me, and really really, really far away) there is no in between at all. This was creating some very interesting scenes in my vision, especially since I was in the middle of a muggy, vibrant, rainforest. I continue to forget where I am and feel as if I am on another continent or planet, if not for the fact that my two friends are literally right next to me I would probably have forgotten altogether anything that I knew at all, which is pretty much what happened anyway. 

To put it shortly, I was so astounded by everything, by my wheeling and spiraling thoughts, that I had no mental time space to think about anything else: I could only perceive and wonder. My sense of time vanished so that I was existing only in the present (which is the only way that its possible to exist anyways) I had no concept of the past, or being there, and little concept of the future, and what it would be like when it arrived. My varied attempts to explain the situation to Ryan were incredibly futile.

My thoughts adopted a quick and strange tempo, which was the only thing by which I could pretend to measure time at all but that measure was completely unreliable for my thoughts were spinning as fast, or faster, than they ever have in my life.

Still out in the rainforest, at my friend Austins behest, we began to wander off into unexplored territory which felt more unexplored by several orders of magnitude than I have ever felt about a place before. There was a sort of stream which had confounded us during the entire night up until this time, which Austin had been attempting to make us cross, but which Ryan I were not all that keen to. Looking into the stream was amazing: it was a marvelous cyan, azure rush, brimming with silvery little bubbles flowing over a bed of muted blue, red, and dark grey stones. No less amazing were the trees on which we stood, which seemed to me magnified as though under a microscope even though I was observing them with my own two eyes. They were almost a fluorescent green and orange, or at least the moss, was. 

Austin had been trying to get us to cross it (the water) and I, realizing somehow that I had no way of knowing where I was going, but that if I didnt go somewhere I would be out in the forest all night, just jumped off the shore into the river and waded to the other side.

Being in the river felt amazing beyond comprehension and Ryan and I, not so much Austin, felt strongly that we were in some sort of primal folk tale involving the water and trickster spirits. Austin was the trickster spirit, trying to beckon me into the water, and I was attempting to resist going into the water while at the same time neither of us knew that, or how, we were doing it. The whole incident was particularly surreal to myself, since I had begun to think of the water as a representation for existence itself, and a thing that I must dive into and take part of before I am allowed to leave. 

Not for the first time that night, Ryan and I, myself having seconds earlier arrived from underneath the water, were greeting by the sight of Austin running off into the distance and disappearing. This caused me no small amount of consternation, since I was vaguely aware that should I try something similar I would be instantly lost. Ryan and I thus set out to apprehend Austin, and did find him.

He had done a similar thing two or three times earlier and chose at those times to hide in the woods and surprise us as we came along. We all three found ourselves imagining strongly that we were some sort of forest creatures and ran through the woods for the sheer joy of it. These first hours were euphoric, and yet unsettling. 

When we managed to arrive back at the house, which Austin was taking care of for a friend of his cousins, it was about 8:30  8:50 in the nighttime. Upon or arrival I ended up standing in the entryway, soaking wet yet not displeased with the situation, for about 20 minutes. The reason I could not remove myself from the doorway was because I literally could not think of the first step necessary to get out.

I had not eaten since about nine hours previous to this time (I have now learned that this probably contributed to my exceptionally strong trip), so we decided to order some food. Thank God, my brother came over to visit, or else we would never have managed to obtain the pizza that we eventually ate. Even with my relatively sober brother in attendance it took a remarkably long, long, long time.

Simultaneously, my brother kept repeatedly trying to raise a topic to discuss with me, but for the life of me I had no idea what it was. He explained it several times to my face, yet I still had no idea what he was talking about, because I kept forgetting it the second that it was over. I ultimately just pretended that I knew what was going on so he would stop trying to explain the situation to me. Im now informed that he was telling me to come visit him at school as a side trip to my other travel plans.

After finally contriving a way to escape from the doorway, a process which was hindered by the physical lack of towels to dry off with, I entered a very solemn couple of hours wherein I meditated on the very concept of possessing. What it means to me . . . to have stuff. What it's like when you dont, what people need to do to get it, and the way those desires shape this entire planet that we inhabit. 

I found myself incredibly grateful for the many luxurious accommodations Im afforded in my life here with my Mom and Dad. My every need is provided for, and I have done relatively nothing to provide for it. I felt simultaneously very grateful about this, that things were the way they are, but also I felt like it really shouldn't be any other way. On the one hand, it doesn't feel right to say that my Mom and Dad should do everything for me, but on the other hand theyre the ones that called me into this inexplicable and maddening existence, and if they hadn't then I wouldnt be obligated to provide for myself at all. I felt supremely strange and a little unsettled by these thoughts, since I wasnt sure what I was going to do about them now that I had them.

Somehow I came away from the meditative state with a feeling, which I am presently managing to retain, of new decisiveness. I feel as if I can, if I so choose, send my life in whatever direction I want. I am not yet happily reconciled to the responsibility of doing so, but nonetheless I feel that is a valuable thing to have attained. 

Again and again throughout the night I felt myself thinking, well that is an amazing thought, but theres absolutely no way I am ever going to remember it. I better just enjoy it while it lasts at let it go. This seemed to me the attitude that I should be taking toward every moment in life, and maybe it actually is. I have thought this many times before, on many different levels, but I have never actually done it so intensely.

My thought-scape was continually spiraling into itself, much like the tectonic plates that form the Earth's crust. I felt as though they were all the same basic material, the thoughts I was having, like the rocks on the surface of the earth are all finite but that they were being continually kneaded, milled, or perhaps inexplicably conjoined (although I do not mean to imply the bad connotations that these adjectives typically carry) that when the old rocks finally appeared once more, I could no longer recognize them. I must emphasis that this turmoil was swift beyond measure, and not at all like tectonic plates (not as we imagine them anyway) in relation to speed.

Once I realized this was happening, I also realized that I should just stop trying to explain what was going on to Ryan and Austin, since it was clearly not going to work. At the same time I acutely felt an urge to explain my sensations an urge: which persists so strongly, even now, that I have been typing for hours. I also frequently forgot that they had had the same drugs that I had had. Even now I feel that I was far, far, farther gone than they were, but I have no way of knowing if that is true or not. Either way, it doesn't really matter. 

After my thoughts about possession ended for the time I moved on dwell on the feeling that I did not want any more drugs of any kind for awhile. I wanted to just relax, safe and sound, at home for a time in my own normal mind. I did not know what I was getting myself into when I dropped all that acid, and it honestly feels like a bit of a slap in the face reminding me like, yeah, no kidding, stop taking drugs, when did you decide it was okay. Of course, morally it is perfectly fine, but upon second glance my actions have been in total defiance of the culture I was raised in. Safe to say, I am in no danger from drugs any longer, because I have been shaken by how powerful they actually are. Its like living with a goddamn Bengal tiger in your house.

Oh, yes, let me not forget, there was also a ridiculously large cat in the small house with us. This was odd, because although Austin stated clearly that it was in the house with us, we could not see it in the least, and it was a very small space. Nonetheless, the cat eventually appeared and was unduly astonishing. 

After all this, and no doubt I am still forgetting much of it (although I am impressed with the amount that I have managed to sort out just now), we three travelers journeyed over to the couch and put on Fearless with Jet Li. I was very happy to be under covers (there was a nice blanket on the bed) because, what with feeling for what felt like a literal eternity that I was lost in another world, I was a bit shaken and felt subliminally reassured to be in a warmer place rather than a colder one.

Early on in the movie Austin left, and we saw no more of him that night, although we all remained awake for untold hours after that point.

Fearless, contains some deep and significant themes concerning violence, strife, and making your way forward in life. As I watched I discovered myself pondering the essence if you have any idea what I mean, of those concepts. I was aghast at the way violence finds its way into this world, and felt as though its very existence must just be a big misunderstanding by someone. I was then deeply sorry and unhappy for hours about violence: the fact that it existed. 

At this point I felt as if I had been tossed in a roiling hurricane or river of emotion and thought, for eternity, and reconciled myself to dying in accordance with Jet Lis character as he died upon the screen. I was trying as hard as possible to follow Lao Tzus advice (basically go with the flow), so that I would remain unharmed from the water, and I think that helped a bit. 

It was time to sleep then, or so I thought, little did I know it was not going to work, for the insistent pulsing was ever-present, so Ryan and I made about transforming the couch into a bed to sleep upon. Earlier wed failed at this task after being confounded by the simple mechanism of the bed. I was very slightly beginning to return to normal though, and to my satisfaction was able to conjure up the bed, as it seemed, merely by pushing on it harder in the way I saw fit. I said something to Ryan like, What?! Its not the way we want it!? Well well just push on it till it is! and as I said these words I felt that I was talking about existence itself, and that the pushing was the exertion of our wills upon the world around us. I was unsettled by this thought, because it was quickly accompanied by a yang to its yin, which was a thought that said, but what if you cant push hard enough?

Thereafter, I lay down on the bed with Ryan. It was rather small and we had to share it. Rather than being unhappy with this I was exceptionally pleased that I wasnt just lying in a ditch somewhere. I felt like my comfortable existence was in jeopardy, and that I had better just fucking enjoy it before all creature comforts up and vanished. Somehow, sometime, I fell asleep at what I estimate to have been about 3:00 in the morning. I felt like I had been tripping for days. The fact that Ryan was still near me made this thought difficult to believe, and yet I could not comprehend that it was otherwise.

In the morning we awoke at about 7:00, still with slightly bent minds (I am still out of it to a fairly high degree even now, which is 2:00 P.M. later, the same day). We found ourselves shuffling back and forth in the living room / kitchen area, which was emanating strong vibes of Asia and the sea, mindlessly trying to explain to each other how completely boggling and befuddling the whole ordeal had been. 

Ryan had to go to work, and I do not envy him in the least right now, as I sit in my own bed marveling and tripping over the occurrences of the last twenty-four hours. 

Austin and I left, and once I exited the house I was immersed once again in the sounds and sights of the rainforest outdoors, then Austin drove me back home to Douglas in his car. 

At home I felt incredibly relieved to be there, as if I had doubted I would ever make it back at all. I was shaken to the point that I expect I would be were my life to be placed in serious danger. I did not, however, realize that precise sensation until just now, I was simply happy to be home.

I began to make pancakes. It took me awhile, but I was so happy to do it. I was marveling in the availability of the house, the ingredients, the utensils, the running water, the very air, in the house, and felt that by making the pancakes, which was fun in itself, I was doing a nice thing in repayment to my parents for what they had done for me. The interior designs of the house were amazing. I felt kind beyond measure. I recalled, at this point, the severe lack of towels and other conveniences back at Austins place, but rather than being annoyed I instead felt happy that I was no in a place where I did have things, such as food, and I could give them to Austin, and everyone else around me. I had no idea how it was happening, but I liked it. I found myself cleaning the dishes, the kitchen, and my room several times that day in truth, in a subconscious attempt to restore order to the world.

It is 11:00 PM now, 00:00 + 29 hours and at last my mind is beginning to quiet, I feel oddly refreshed, exhausted, and alive. I feel that I have come to peace with not knowing anything at all. My mind is still unraveling and reveling in the presence of my otherworldly cargo. It has definitely been a positive experience, and I feel that Ive gained a lot. While earlier in my trip I had contemplated saying goodbye to all drugs forever, I think I will explore the other world again with Mescaline, but in my own home, and definitely alone. I feel like a time traveling shaman. I am tired, and yet not, and at a loss for what to do. Happy to be alive. Glad I took the time to write this all down. As I had hoped, writing it, re reading it, adding to it (this log), has helped me cope with what can only be classified as a permanently mind altering experience.

At around 3 pm yesterday, my friend and I each received one dose of acid in the form of Sour Patch Kids and ate them in her dorm room, neither of us having eaten anything else that day. The last time we tripped with two tabs of this particular dealer's acid we got subtle visuals and the trip lasted only around 6 or 7 hours. We decided to stagger our trip this time just to experiment with potentially stretching out its duration. After rolling up two spliffs in my room we ventured off towards the dealer's house. We smoked them both over the course of the ten or so block walk there and I searched for hints of psychedelia in the sky. Other than the clouds seeming particularly beautiful in a vague, intangible way, nothing seemed quite different yet.

We met the dealer in the middle of an intersection and he brought us into his house and started dosing two more Sour Patch Kids. This is when we learned he had just made a new batch which was supposed to be like 'a trip and a half' (according to his first customers). My friend and I each ate one more at about 4:30 pm. When we left his house, the outside world had changed.

This was my first time taking acid in broad daylight outside a city setting. In the suburban town we're in, the trees are very tall and vibrant; walking around on acid they glowed, each soft leaf in its own distinct way. My friend and I were in awe by the different fractal patterns of each tree and traced the unfathomably deep grooves in the bark. We hadn't made it out of our dealer's intersection yet and decided to just sit on the curb and enjoy the surroundings we had familiarized ourselves with. The different greys within the pavement by us shifted around and began to create the same circling, tribal mask/contoured face pattern that I so far always have seen after taking psychedelics (shrooms, lsd), and even at this point in the come up the hues of the designs were slightly more prominent than the subdued visuals I had at the peak of the last trip. Windows of nearby houses seemed like they were slightly waving, and this one particular translucent curtain was slightly melting as it blew in the wind. Meanwhile, my friend and I were debating whether or not we were seeing a unicorn or a seahorse in an epic violet cloud roaring its way through the sky. I thought of James and the Giant Peach, my favorite childhood movie, and felt like a child as we began to walk back.

Our suburban neighborhood was slowly turning into Halloween town in many different ways. For one thing, the entire avenue was breathing and beginning to distort, but also the houses on the block had been decked out with decorations. It's that time of year! My friend and I felt so genuinely excited at that moment, being completely in touch with the bite of the cold and pointing out glistening orange leaves.

Eventually we were back in her dorm room. She played industrial music on her speakers which I normally don't listen to but found myself quite enjoying the heavy percussion and bass. As we listened in silence, I stared into her dresser, watching the remarkably different hues move in front of each other and swim around in the wood. Her floor was beginning to look very tribal and I confronted a couple more realistic looking faces in the linoleum tiles.

Then, we remembered our two other friends were tripping as well -- at 2 pm they had taken two tabs -- and decided to reconvene with them, though after going to my room so I could put on a bunch of sweaters. Walking through the hallways of the dorm gave me a headrush feeling with slow panning-out visuals, similar to the Dali zoom. My room felt and looked very blue (in terms of energy and physical appearance) and we felt very comfortable in it, and after getting warm I crawled on top of my bed. My friend and I gazed at my ceiling, which I had put glow-in-the-dark stars on. The bumpy paint job was a sand bed for the starfish-like stickers that were crawling and sliding around. We decided to watch an episode of Xavier Renegade Angel ('Going Normal') and each got shock-like sensations/the chills sporadically throughout the 20 minute long video. By the end of my episode we had slumped into my comforter and both found our positions to be pretty hilarious.

We left the residence hall in a laughing fit, meeting two other friends on the bench in the Quad who had no idea what we were up to. My friend and I kept to ourselves, commenting on the floating skateboarders and hockey players and otherwise common pedestrians that made up campus life. We called our friends and desperately wanted to meet them but couldn't because they were tripping so hard that they couldn't tell us where they were. Eventually they appeared behind us with a group of people and we all mingled in different circles. The muddy ground in front of the bench had a lot of faces in it now, as did the pavement leading back into the residence hall, the clouds in the sky, and the bark on the great tree in the quad.

The four of us day trippers decided to get weird, returning to the dorm and finding this trio of boys listening to rap music who were incidentally also tripping on acid. We contemplated going to the main dining building to get food. As at this point human interactions seemed incredibly weird to my one friend and I, one of the two we had met up with, we concluded it was the only thing to do, and that it would be a challenge, like Fear and Loathing but in the dining building! Going in there the entire place was shutting down and we had absolutely no concept of time (usually it closed at 10 pm, but that couldn't be right...but it doesn't not feel like 10...but it doesn't feel like 10...). No one else was in there besides the workers and us, and then our one other friend who randomly appeared out of no where talked to us about his theory of the Post-Apathetic culture that is developing and how paradoxical it is -- something I understand on one level, but couldn't quite grasp -- and then literally skated away on a longboard which was kind of bizarre. I asked the worker at the grill for 'grilled cheese,' which seemed silly to me for a couple of different reasons and didn't quite make sense to the guy either so we laughed it off together and I specified wheat bread and cheddar cheese, and then my friend made the same mistake ('can I have grilled cheese please') and the three of us laughed together.

The atmosphere seemed to be perfect for us and we felt like we had conquered the dining building...until we payed for our food and discovered the eating area had been transformed into a casino! It was too coincidental. Card tables were set up, the lights were dimmed and everything was orange and especially halloweeny; the ambient musicians in the background seemed like automatons and the totem poll decorations were ominous. My friend and I picked a booth that was as far away from the scene as possible. We felt like we were in a different entity than the rest of the crowd in the dining room and were perplexed as to how we could all be a part of the same school, and whether or not we were active in the community, and what it meant to be tripping in one of the most prominent buildings on campus. Then we realized he had taken my grilled cheddar cheese sandwich and I had his pepper jack, and also that neither of us could eat, two factors that made us lose it. We were hysterically laughing and staging conversation ('blah blah blah') while pretending to eat our food. At that point we knew the atmosphere had actually conquered us and we decided to leave.

We met up with our other tripping friends plus one kid from Portland who had to catch a bus back but didn't know where to go. This was, again, hilarious -- some dude asking a crowd of acid heads to lead him somewhere. On the other hand, we all felt well equipped for the challenge, especially since the bus stop happened to be right in front of the same 7/11 we visited weekly for restocking packs of cigarettes and such. This time the walk included the tail end of the sunset and went by rapidly quick (all in the small group of trippers agreed on this). Everything I encountered on the walk, especially the people walking in front of me, had trails and was shifting around inside itself. The fact that I couldn't differentiate properties between trees was tripping me out because they were so vivid before; now it was dark and I just saw the same, melting, tribal face in all of them.

By the time we got to the bus stop I needed to pee so I went inside the 7/11. This really old, wrinkly guy with a huge white beard opened the door for me. When I tried to enter the bathroom he came to me with a key. When I left the bathroom (which had a crazy mirror in it that really messed with my brain -- everything about the reflected image was convulsing and morphing at a rapid pace, and the walls had infinite grey faces inside them) he took the key from me. It was weirding me out that this guy was with me the whole time because I didn't (and still don't, really) think 7/11 had attendants that wait outside for people and help them out with the whole bathroom thing.

Meeting up with my friends I wanted to tell them all about it but our Portland tagalong had to catch his bus. It felt like every other passenger on that vehicle was looking into my eyes and I felt like I could see into their sketchy, eerie, Halloweeny souls. At this point all around us was darkness, other than the starry beams of light shooting out of the lamp posts lining the streets.

For some reason as we passed campus these two drunk girls wanted to come with us to this bridge over a huge gorge where we normally chill at and smoke. My friend who I had originally taken the lsd with and I were both very opposed to our clan acquiring these girls because we generally don't like drunken females at all (unless we are them) (very hypocritical, we realized). However, we weren't going to say anything negative, so we just kept to ourselves and took in the beautiful, creepy setting we had immersed ourselves in. Everything felt ancient and almost post-apocalyptic at the same time, and by the time we got to the bridge I could see distinct noses and eyes in all the different pebbles on the ledge overlooking the gorge.

My friend and I tried to ignore the stereotypical nature of the two girls who we were stuck with, but it was hard, especially because we were smoking with them. Everyone's eyes were pulsating slightly and shifting around beneath this magnificent, hazy glow that was all around us, reminiscent of the rain that had passed five or so hours ago.

This is when my trip began to take a turn for the worst. The two girls that were with us ultimately reminded me of a part of myself that I could have easily developed further if I had even a slight change in the way I grew up within my environment. Further more, I began to feel like a failure of a female, and that I could hardly identify with my own gender. I tried to get out of it by suggesting we walk around but before we could stand up this huge group of people approached us including one of my hall mates and his 'home crew,' a group of childish folks that appeared to be rolling around on the bridge, though I'm not sure if this actually happened. We really needed to get out! So we began to walk away and ventured back in time to the prehistoric land, crossing the same intersection three times, not having a clue what to tell our friend when he called us asking where we were (this tripped me out because it seemed to be a motif of the evening, just because I had been on the other side of the situation with trying to meet my two friends that were tripping earlier).

Everything in the street had faces, especially when the light reflected off the slick wetness that coated it. This is when I began to see even smaller faces in everything and nothing, in darkness and in light, in the whites of people's eyes and in the solid coloring of a single brick on a house. I completely dropped out of our conversation and tried to focus on the rainbow, color changing, slow shutter speed view and intense tribal visuals. The drunk girls' voices were echoing in my head to the point of causing me physical discomfort, and I grew very cold, and saw more faces in my breath in the dark night.

Thankfully, I effectively convinced my friends to go back to campus. Though to my demise, we ended up stuck with them, and sat in the hallway waiting for the friend I had initially dropped with as she made tea in her room and talked to her boyfriend on the phone. The hallway was so surreal! I saw incredible faces in the walls and the striped pattern on the carpeting was completely wavy and unstable. Girls were stumbling down the hallway drunk off their asses and I wondered, why me! I could see craters in their faces and the individual particles of the caked-on makeup all over their cheeks and under their eyes. It repulsed me to a state of deeper discomfort and I went into my friend's room to intrude her conversation just because I couldn't take the hallway anymore. Her room didn't make me feel much better even though the tea she made me was very warm and tasted like cherries. Even the dresser was tripping me out a little too much as it began to slide around in its spot. I wandered the hallways, away from my friends and all the drunk messes, to try to call my boyfriend in my room.

The experience of getting into my room was traumatic enough -- I felt like a failure for being confused -- and then I was immediately confronted by my reflection in the mirror near the entry way. The visuals this mirror reflected were similar to those in the 7/11 bathroom mirror but this time I saw even more faces in everything except for my own face, which seemed to completely lack depth, especially as all my features twisted around inside themselves. I called my boyfriend and he seemed to just trip me out even more, his voice echoing in my ear and strangely distant and spooky, though it still felt beautiful to talk to him. I began to cry because I realized how much I deeply missed him. At this point I was curled up on my bed, feeling like I was stuck in a psychological hole. Everything around me was shifting but I finally got up the nerve to go on my computer and video chat with my boyfriend. I tried to explain how I was feeling but could only tell him fundamentally the opposite of what I meant to say. Talking to him was tripping me out so hard and, to make things temporarily worse, he kept sending me pictures of me that I had taken on his computer, and they were really tripping out my brain.

However, the whole spookiness of that experience regained its humor eventually -- I was sitting in my bed horrified by pictures of myself, paralyzed by an inexplicable, unnecessary fear. I came to terms with the fact that my boyfriend wasn't there, though through struggling a bit, which was extremely therapeutic and worthwhile. Furthermore, I found more value in my friends here at school, because I realized they mean a lot to me -- especially on the trip, at that moment. Upon meeting up with them they gave me chocolate and played music for me and we all sat and cuddled in my friend's room. It was just us four. We rolled up splits and went outside into the pouring rain, which had started while were taking that breather all together. The haze that was hinted at before now became all encompassing, the raindrops like an incredible swarm of tiny liquid bees. We stood under a great tree and seemed to hotbox it, our eyes stinging with pleasure. We had an intensely incredible conversation about nature, life, psychology, acid, tobacco, marijuana, the drunk girls, the rain, and our lives as young adults. It was extremely rehabilitating, and I realized nothing is a permanent issue.

The ground on the way back was particularly slick and mountainous, waving around a bit in place. I saw great, shiny faces, with rainbow hues in their glimmer. Outside the residence hall we met some of the people we had seen on the bridge -- the ones that weren't really rolling around -- and they told us they had just taken about five shots each and two tabs of the same acid we took! Them beginning their trip drunk at 3 in the morning, right as we all were starting to truly come down off a more than crazy enough trip, seemed incredibly cyclical in a very intense, distorted, spirally way. We were all forced into a state of reflection and moseyed off into our own rooms for the night.

I took about a half hour to set up my room for myself, keeping all lights off except for my blue and green lava lamp. My glow in the dark stars now seemed a part of the wall, though very distinct from the faces that were crowding the ceiling. I went on tumblr and saw faces in every single image while listening to my library on shuffle and feeling one with technology. I realized how innately nimble my fingers were at navigating my device. I rewatched 'Going Normal' and was only partially distracted by the faces that filled different parts of my computer screen. Even when I closed my eyes to try to go to sleep I could see different colored parts of the faces creating kaleidoscopic patterns. I eventually drifted off to seep listening to sounds of the rain, trying to induce a lucid dream.

I ended up slipping into this crazy, creepy, nightmarish scene where my old roommate came back to my now extremely messy single, physically labeling all of my stuff as 'trash,' calling in her buff boyfriend who started yelling at me saying he was going to beat me up. All I could think in the dream was that I was tripping balls and needed to make sure they couldn't catch me, but once they noticed my pupils their heads turned into serpent faces and they started hissing and yelling. I gained lucidity at this point and melted them away in my brain, into the floor, along with everything else in my room, until I was floating above it all in my bed. I could feel the wind in the infinite, boundless room that I created in my mind and could hear a strange music coming from the watery liquid pool of melted room/ex-roommate/ex-roomate's boyfriend. I dove into it and the music became louder, more intense, and until I recognized it as my alarm and inevitably woke up.

Since then (~36 hrs later) I've been smoking weed pretty consistently and watching the breathing of all solid objects slowly fade away.

Before this trip, I had had a lot of previous experience with other psychedelics, especially acid, and had taken it on approximately 20 other occasions, the most I have ever taken at once being 7 (After over a month of not taking it, so my tolerance level would have been zero), and on none of these occasions had I ever had a bad trip; I had never reached a state where I was oblivious to the outside world, i.e. where all I could see were my hallucinations, I had not had one single bad experience. And at the time of the trip I'm going to describe, I had not regretted a single acid trip I had taken. So I decided to take 3 hits, approximately µg 260 on each tab, [Erowid Note: 
Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be done casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements were derived, it is reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.]   ignoring the very VERY important fact that I was coming off Escitalopram (SSRI), 20 mg daily, which I had been on for about a year, and had stopped taking them instantly without progressively lowering the dose, so I had been experiencing EXTREMELY severe paresthesia to the point of paralysis and black outs, constant light-headedness, headache, dizziness, insomnia, cold sweats- I was about a week into coming off it. Yes. I was an idiot to take acid at this point of SSRI withdrawal.  

This is everything that I can remember: 
T+ 0.00 I took all three tabs at once, my friend (lets call him T) taking two, and Ts girlfriend S taking one. I was at one of my closest friends house, a place where I feel completely safe and calm, with some of my best friends, 5 people in total including T and S, but my friends parents were in And most importantly, my girlfriend and love of my life, wasnt with me that night. I chew the tabs to death, then swallow, and lie down on my friends bed to smoke a big joint and wait for the drugs to take hold.

T+ 0.45 Im laughing hysterically and am extremely excitable and jittery. Very confused but in a good way, enjoying every second of it. Smoking high grade, really enjoying my Beatles/ Pink Floyd/ Bowie playlist

T+ 1.00- Here we go, Im seeing shit. Walls breathing, objects melting, creeping, shifting. Just lying there and enjoying the hallucinations and making loads of jokes, not really able to string a sentence together. Time passes. Dont ask me how much. Im gonna say two hours but who knows.

T+3.00- My friend T is tripping pretty damn hard and says he wants to get out of my friends hotboxed basement flat and get some fresh air and go buy a can of coke at around midnight. So, being on acid, Im extremely suggestible, and I agree to go with him. Of course, no shops are open, but we go for a walk around the block anyway. Back on my friends road, theres some drunk guy getting beaten up by these two guys looks like theyre robbing him. I make T aware of whats happening, and, for a second theres a look of panic on his face. That look of panic triggers something in me and I sprint to my friends door, and ring his bell over and over again. He lets me and T back in. But the buzzer disturbed his parents. They see us. They know were on acid. I go back into my friends room and am blithering and panicking away, shouting at him No-one can understand me except for T, and I cant understand anyone except for T, and I genuinely couldnt understand a word anyone said. I just heard their voices So I decided to sit down and smoke some more weed for about half an hour

T+4.00-	There are sirens that get closer and closer and eventually stop right outside. I realise now that must have been an ambulance for that drunk dude earlier but at the time I was convinced we were gonna get busted and so I gathered all the drugs in the room (of which there were many) and forced S (on her first trip) to stash them all in her bra. I then took all my possessions (Phone, iPod, wallet, house keys etc) and put them down on the bed stating I dont want to have anything on me anyone can rob me for. Im panicking, Ive started talking too loudly, shouting and screaming basically. The hallucinations are very intense; everything is moving, crawling, breathing auditory too music sounds like its coming out of strange places strange noises everywhere. But were making too much noise and have been here far too long, so we decide to take to the streets, T, S and I. This is when I think I went into my bad trip, because before leaving my friends flat, I started having very bad electric zaps (paresthesia) that paralyzed my body and speech, and from now on I slip in and out of moments of lucidity, but mostly am stuck behind my hallucinations, seeing nothing but the horrifying imaginings of my mind. 

T+4.10- The friend whose flat I was at turned to me and grabbed my face and said Listen to me, the worlds about to end. But it has to happen several times. Do you understand? I said What? Ok. Ok.  What do I have to do? Just ride it out. It has to happen. Its going to be hard, but it needs to happen sooner or later, and it happens to be now. I then start screaming to my friends Its all me! Its all me! over and over again and laughing hysterically. They say Yeah man. Its in your head. Its all you. I then run out of the flat, and have another episode of brain spasms and palpitations. Then I pull myself off the floor and the sky above me is on fire. I dont see a moon. I dont see any stars. Just fire, everywhere, that spreads down the houses and onto the streets and I can see in the distance a wall of flames getting closer and closer. Then for some reason I start screaming and shouting, a nonsensical jumble of random swear words and cries. I turn back and run to my friends door, ringing the bell over and over. He answers, and I run inside to his bedroom. Then his girlfriend grabs me and says OK, just stay calm. Youre doing well. Just keep going. I then leave the flat again and S and T follow behind. I then see myself, S, and T walking down the street from an external viewpoint. When we reach the corner at the end of the road, a man throws me to the floor and shoots me in the head. Then I realise Im walking down the street about to come to the corner.  I turn to my friends and shout Listen to me. Im about to die. Theres nothing we can do but, Im about to die ok? They responded with Shut up man, no-ones gonna die and things like that. I then ran back to the flat again and was ringing the bell a hundred times and my friends mother answered the door and I grabbed her face shouting Im going to die. I have to go. Help me, Im going to die. She then grabbed my face and said You have to do it again. Go back outside. 

T+ 4.30- When I left my friends house again I saw rows and rows of cars stretching out as far as I could see, and hundreds of people standing by the side of their cars, facing upwards with their hands up to the sky, waiting to be killed by the huge ball of flames that was engulfing the road, London, and the rest of the world. I then had some kind of a flashback and I was on a rooftop in Brooklyn where I had been tripping about a year before, and I was talking with T about death. I then realised that this trip was occurring at the same point in time as the trip on that rooftop nearly a year earlier, and that all events in my life have occurred simultaneously, and it is only my brain that created the illusion of time to help me process things (Read Slaughterhouse five by Kurt Vonnegut for more on this). Still on the rooftop from a year before, I realised that my friend T had actually jumped off the roof while tripping and fallen the 30 stories below to his death.  His girlfriend S had later killed herself too, and I realised that the last 8-12 months of my life had all been a hallucination. I then realised that I was also dead, whether or not I had actually died at that point in time, and started laughing at the fact that I had ever been trying to avoid something that had already happened.

T+5.30-	Im back on the streets of London with T and S, and I see from afar, all the people who are standing by their cars whispering to each other, one by one, from all the way at the bottom of the road, creating multiple chains of whispers getting closer to S, T and me. Whenever someone was whispered to, they would become completely enlightened and smiles would return to their faces and they would sit down and stop worrying about their deaths and just wait for it to happen. There are fireworks shooting into the sky everywhere and the flames are still there. I see the chains of whispers getting closer and closer from various different roads and then I realise that they are all going to meet simultaneously at one spot in the crossroads- where I am standing. So I will be the last one to be whispered to. I then see all of my friends who were still back at my friends flat, and theyre all standing talking to me, saying It really is all you, man. It really is all you. I then realised that I was the only person who could prevent the apocalypse, and I had to give every ounce of strength and love within me into fighting against the world ending.  S whispers to T, and then T grabs me with a massive grin on his face and is about to shout something but then suddenly theres a guy in the road who runs up to me and shoots me in the head. I fall to the floor, watching my brains and blood pour out onto the pavement next to me. Im lying there, and I realise Im about to die, and then T turns to me and says You know what death is man? Imagine the best orgasm youve ever had, times it by a million, and youre still nowhere near. I then experienced basically exactly what he described. I felt an immense rush of euphoria/ nostalgia/ understanding/ enlightenment fuck knows what. It was incredible. At this point I come to, in other words become lucid, as in back in the real world, for just a few minutes. I open my eyes and see a tree on the side of the street above me and the leaves are crawling and seeping everywhere.  Im sprawled out on the floor of the street and theres a cigarette between my fingers, just lit. I smoke it and turn to T and say Thats all life is man. Its just a fucking cigarette. You fire it up, smoke it down to the butt, then stub it out and flick it down the drain. I then started laughing hysterically and went back into my trip, I was gone again.

T+7.00-	T turned to me and shouted Only joking! Death is actually the best acid trip youve ever had, multiplied by a million. However then I realised I was at the point of death, the world was coming to an end, and everything was over. My vision was gradually getting darker from the edges of my eyes inwards, and I was slowly losing sight and slipping away, I was about to die. I started crying and whimpering and I realised the only hope I had was love. So I started screaming my girlfriends name over and over again, and shouting out things like I believe in the power of good, as well as Love! Love! again and again, and at first, my vision came back the louder I shouted, and although it was virtually impossible to muster the strength to shout out loud after having been shot in the face, whenever I did, I felt myself regaining a little bit of life. But it was no use and after a few minutes everything went black.
T+8.00- 	Its the eve of the millennium and Im in the back of the car with my dad driving, and the time on the clock reads 23:59. My dad is looking at me in the dashboard mirror with a slight smile on his face, wearing a very calm and sober expression.

I say Is (my girlfriend) ok?
Yes. Shes at home, asleep.
And her mother and father?
Yes. Theyre fine.
And mummy? Is mummy ok?
Yes. Shes asleep. Shes fine.
The cars clock still reads 23:59. There are fireworks going off everywhere and were on a bridge, all the cars have stopped and everyone is standing by the side of their cars, but me and my dad are still inside ours. I look at my dad in the dashboard mirror and he smiles. The clock hits midnight.
I love you.
I love you too.
Then everything stops.

The next morning-	I wake up in my bed to the sound of birdsong. I pick up my phone and call my girlfriend. 
Hi.
Oh my God my beautiful. Are you ok.
Yes, Im fine.
Are you sure? Where are you? I love you. I love you so much.
Im at home. Everythings fine. I love you. 
What happened?
You took acid.

My dad told me later that day that the night before, I had taken acid, had had a bad trip, and was running through the streets of London shouting and screaming at people, running in the middle of the road, and at T+8.00, he had to come and pick me up and drive me home.  I later asked T and S if there had been any fireworks that night, they said no. I also asked my dad if we went over a big bridge at any point. He said no.

I think about that night every day. I run through everything I can remember in my head, and try to work it out, but I dont really get anywhere. There are about 4-5 hours in total of my trip that I have no recollection of at all. There was a lot of other stuff I saw that night that I cant remember now. I think thats probably a good thing.

I first tried LSD about 4 months ago. And I haven't tried it since. 
In the past I have been a regular pot smoker, LOVED mushrooms, done coke 3 times, crack once (and never again), and a number of different painkillers etc. I tend to be experimental but not a habitual drug user. (Other than alcohol and every now and then pot)

It all starts with me getting off work at about 3 am. I headed from work over to a friends house to hang out.. We ended up drinking. Well I got pretty smashed, and drove home around 9 AM after my boyfriend called me wondering where the hell I was. (he didn't know that I was at a friends house and had expected me to be home when he woke up) When I got home I was acting pretty stupid, being drunk and all.. And they told me to just go to bed. Well I was a bit too revved up to go to sleep so I hung around the living room. Next thing I know my boyfriend told me he was going to take the acid we had bought a couple days ago...  So I said 'Me too!'

He thought this was a little strange because I'm usually very hesitant and nervous about taking new drugs especially because I have really bad anxiety and tend to freak out even if I get a little too high... BUT I was intoxicated and had a 'What the heck why not' attitude. I strangely had no reservations about this... So he hesitantly said ok.. And put the tiny square on my tongue... He took one, and we also gave some to my room mate. After leaving it on there for a while I took it off and threw it away, or I may have swallowed it I cant remember. I think at this point I decided it would be a good idea to get out my art supplies and start painting. I don't really have a good perception of how long it took to kick in because it was a very slow process... I slowly became more euphoric and I was still a little drunk and now feeling a little high. I ran into my other room mates room and told him to wake up because things were so crazy and awesome cause we're tripping on acid and he's like wtf? I think around this point (after sitting around and talking and waiting) I decided that the acid just wasnt working good enough for me so I took another hit.. This time, I put it on my tongue and immediately (accidentially) swallowed it.. I realized that I wasnt really aware of my tongue. 

So I went back into the living room and started pouring paint all over this huge canvas. Every color I could think of... The sun was shining into the balcony window onto the painting and the colors were extraordinarily bright.. I shoved my hands into the paint and began swishing the colors around.. I felt like a child I was giggling and dancing around covered in paint.. I got my boyfriend to help me... I felt like my eyes were HUGE as I kept staring at the colors... 

Finally I washed my hands and my room mate who also did the acid suggested that we go buy some food. Food? Why would you have a desire to eat NOW? I was confused, but decided it might be fun to leave the house. So we went... About the time that we pulled up to the store I started tripping a little harder... The trees outside the window felt like they were trying to get me, like they were reaching into the window and grabbing at me. I told everyone that the trees were trying to kill me and they thought it was funny... So did I.... 

So my room mate who did acid and my room mate who I had woken up (who was driving and NOT on acid) went into the store while I sat in the car with my boyfriend. My boyfriend asked me if I was ok.. And I just remember I kept saying.

'Yeah......' Really quiet and slow. 

I decided that I had to get out of the car now.... So my boyfriend came around and helped me get out of the car.. Standing was strange.. So was walking.. It was like I was floating and sinking into the ground at the same time. We started walking around the building.. I can't tell you how many times we walked in circles around this building... I was very quiet.. I was somewhere else.. I couldn't speak. It had also begun to rain. (it had turned into a very cold and dreary day and then begun to rain) about the 3rd time we circled to building (and the people in the movie store started looking at us weird) We came around to the back side where there were two dumpsters. I stopped dead in my tracks ..I felt like I was standing there horrified and gawking at the ground.. There was a river of red water coming out from underneath these dumpsters... OMG... Something is dead in there... I couldnt stop thinking.. I imagined there was a dead person.. Or maybe animals dead inside this dumpster and the rain was washing the blood out of it and into the drain below... My boyfriend interruped the thoughts after I stood there for a minute and he was like ... 

'you OK?' 

I said  'yeah.... '

I told him what I was thinking and he told me it was just the rust from the metal washing off in the water.. (does that actually happen?) So by the time we are back to the car I've decided im full blown tripping.. I cant speak anymore, I'm so very far away and everything is very strange... Life is so strange... I'm distant and confused. We're driving along and as I'm looking into the sky I see these intense visuals.. These kaliedascopes of colors swirling and dancing and pusling.. I shout 'OMG, They're real! Its true!' My roomate asks me what is real, I tell him about the designs im seeing and he said yeah, where else did you think they came from? I thought that people were just making those psychadelic pictures up... That it was just their was of interpreting their feelings... But anyway... We get home and when I get out of the car I feel like I sink into the ground.. I can't wait for a minute.. Suddenly I feel so very small.. I feel small and as I continue walking I get bigger and bigger (I may have actually been walking crouched over and slowly standing up, I couldn't tell if it was the acid or me) 

Finally im back to normal size.. We head up to the apartment and I go inside.. I don't eat the sandwich they got me I just lay on my bed.. So does my boyfriend... We aren't talking.. He keeps asking me if I'm ok... Which freaks me out because I think 'do I look like im not ok?' and he said he was just worried about me.. 

At some point I looked into the mirror and became extremely interested in my eyes.. One pupil so much larger than the other... I asked everyone if they really were two different sizes or if I was just seeing things.. They were tripping too so I couldnt get a straight answer.. While looking in the mirror I discover a sore on the inside of my lip. I ask my boyfriend what it is.. He said its probably just some kind of ulcer... I ask him what causes that and he tells me bacteria... Then, when he says the word 'Bacteria' I get this halarious visual.. Of a little man (and some buddues) in a green sweater and cap sliding down my tongue and in a high pitched voice shouting 'Bacteria!' So I get really creeped out and start brushing my teeth to get rid of the 'Bacteria' As im brushing my teeth im imagining the little green men being squished under neath my tooth brush.. It bothers me a little bit but I keep brushing because the idea of little fat men in sweaters inside my mouth creeps me out even more... 

The rest of the night is a blur... But this is were a lot of the worst stuff happens. It goes from being slightly strange but interesting... To downright unbearable. After taking a beautiful walk outside in the rain and picking up some amazingly colored fall leaves on the path I come back inside and lay down. I spent the next 6-8 hours laying in my bed.. Periodically, me and my boyfriend got into the shower in order to feel more comfortable.. I couldn't sleep... My entire body felt like it was dying (possibly some sort of hangover effects being made worse by coming down off acid) My room began to feel like a prision.. I started having this seriously overwhelming fear of being an inanimate object. I tried to stop myself from thinking it... I didn't want to go that far away... Images flashed in my head but they didn't make any sense... My entire brain was jumped up. I laid in bed, unable to sleep, feeling as if my brain was a circuit board and someone was systematically unplugging input cords and shoving them carelessly into the wrong holes.. Every time something was put back the wrong way I'd feel like that hole would then become fried and unusable.. I was horrified...

My brain was being rewired and wired again.. Over and over and over and over and over... Time was lasting forever, I thought I would never be the same again. As I was laying there staring at the ceiling (but not looking at the ceiling) I felt as if my body parts were being taken off and then put back on the wrong way, like my legs and arms were laying at odd angles, twitching and working incorrectly. Every time these thoughts became unbearable and I thought I might freak out I went into the shower and sat there for a while.. We must have taken like 6 showers that night. 

About 12 hours into the trip I was done with it, I wanted it to be over so bad... But it was like a strange and horrifying show that I was being forced to watch over and over again that made less and less sense every time. I had this terrible fear that the acid was destroying my brain, that it was re-wiring my brain the wrong way and that I may never be normal again.. Nothing felt right anymore. I felt alone, god didn't exsist... I was a cold and useless robot or computer progam that had just been struck with lightening and fried, or had just contracted some kind of trojan virus... I felt a lot of remorse. I started taking sleeping pills.. I just wanted to go to sleep. 16 hours after my first hit (and 26 hours since I had last slept) I finally fell asleep... Leaving being the cold icy stare of my bedroom and the items within it... 

I woke up the next day and my anxiety was pretty terrible.. I still felt like I wasn't the same.. Like something still wasn't right... It took me about 3 days to feel slightly normal again... But until this day I know that something changed in my brain that night... And I don't know what it is.. But it was something that was perfectly fine before.. And now its slightly wrong... I wish I could explain it... Every now and then for no reason.. (I know there is a trigger but im not sure what it is) I will just stop and zone out for a second and that feeling returns... Almost like my brain skipping a beat or a glitch... And I just don't feel right... But I can usually come back from it... I just feel like something is missing... 

*sigh*

I don't know if I'll ever do acid again.. I have strong feelings about doing man made drugs.. I prefer all natural drugs, un-tampered with. I feel like acid was made to rewire or even destroy the human mind. (and not rewire for the better) Perhaps its in the eye of the beholder but I lost something about myself that night... Im not sure what it is, but I'd give up the trip experience to have it back. One good thing that happened after the trip... I wasnt able to have a single cigarette during my trip AND after my trip.. It took my almost a week to get over the repulsion I had when thinking about cigarettes.. On my trip I thought they were super disgusting and that if I smoked one, I'd puke... So prehaps the drug has the ability to help with quitting smoking?  But my only suggestion is that people be careful about their surroundings while tripping.. Whatever you see/hear/experience on acid is more likely to get stamped on your mind. I listened to a music video by Cradle of Filth (I dont usually listen to that kind of music) while at my peak of tripping and I swear to god the song kept playing in my head over and over again for the remainder of the trip.. And that must have been well over 5 hours of 'nymphetamine' playing in my head... It became torture.. Even though I kind of like the song...

This could also be a report of my 5g mushroom trip from 3 weeks ago, minus the nausea, as it was very similar and equally terrifying but somewhat more devastating afterwords, because it was from LSD, which had been very gentle with me up until yesterday...

I've taken LSD numerous times over the past couple of years. My 1st experience was with half a hit of a strong blotter, unperforated, no taste/body load and lasted around 12-16 hours but every time after that, it was an 8-12 hour thing with very minor body load and and nothing but positive experiences. I always wait 2 weeks between trips, even tho the literature says a week should be fine...  I'm 28, in pretty good shape and try to live a healthy lifestyle, I watch what I eat, I lift weights, run and don't drink or smoke.

The most I've ever taken was 3 hits, a couple of times, and the last time, although I felt it was a bit too overwhelming, was a very positive experience. It was from the same sheet I took this dose off of. Around that time, I was also experimenting with growing my own shrooms and had some fruiting so I made up my mind to take Terence McKenna's favorite heroic dose of 5 grams couple weeks later with horrifying and decimating results which brings us to 3 weeks after that mushroom trip, which was yesterday, when I took 3 hits...

I work nights and sleep during the day and after getting home from work Friday morning, I passed out and woke up at 6pm.. I was trying to decide if I should go ahead and trip now or tomorrow and after a couple of hours of back and forth, decided to go for it.  By now it was a little passed 8pm. A friend called and said she was gonna stop by with her bf to pick up some stuff for the weekend so I had to wait for them to show up. They finally show up around 9:30 and leave at 10, I'm finally free of any obligations and it's been 12 hour since I last ate so my stomach is totally empty.  Perfect! I cut out 3 hits from the unperforated sheet of what used to be 25 hits, now looking like some weird tetris block... I put in under ny tongue and let it fully absorb for about 10-15 mins and swallow. By 11pm I start to come up, feeling the energy/anxiety building up in my body, some visual distortion start to appear and I start hearing slight echoing effect I always get with LSD. So far so good, I get under the covers and turn on my mp3 player which contains my fav music and some Terrence McKenna lectures for later on when I'm coming down, like I always do..

It's around 11:15 now and I'm getting hit pretty hard but nothing shattering, it's just really good with a hint of overwhelming, like the last time I took 3 hits, no biggie, I'm feeling good.  But another 15 mins pass and something's different... I'm getting stronger sound distortions than usual, people talking downstairs, in the background (the TV was on in the living room) sounds very low pitched and echoing harder than normal but when I turn the music back on, it sounds fine... Hmm, this is interesting... I try not to pay too much attention to this and keep enjoying the experience but something else seems wrong now... The music I'm listening to all of a sudden sounds like it's slowing down to a crawl but the pitch remains the same. Wow, this is kinda freaky, so I feel like I should get up and look around to see what other strange effects I notice... Wrong move... When I stood up and I feel dizzy, feeling as though I'm short and stretched sideways. Running out of breath or I also feel it's harder to breath and I automatically reach for water and drink from the bottle like my life depended on it. Some of it run down my face. I'm now thoroughly convinced I'm having a bad reaction to this chemical. Feeling like I'm going to fade away amd I'm not ready to die here like this, not yet! I definitely have issues letting go. But how can I not? What will my parents think when they find my lifeless body? What will happen to all those that I care about? C'mon! Get it together! You're not gonna die, you're gonna pull thru this and you're gonna fight!  If I say things, if I sing, if I act hyper, I can jumpstart my heart and have it beat faster and stronger so I can't slip into unconsciousness and die... Sheer terror at this point...

Collapsing back on the bed, I put on some music; well, hit play again, since I had paused it previously when I started to freak out and get scared because I could hear it getting fainter and actually slowing down to a crawl, which obviously meant (at the time) that my heart was also slowing down... My senses are severely distorted and wouldn't sync up, for instance, when I would get up to turn on a light, I would see me getting up but somehow felt like my body was still on the bed, trying to catch up to what I was seeing, which was me standing up now, or was it the other way around, was I still lying in bed, just thinking about standing up and visualizing it, I just wasn't sure anymore...  I kept mumbling about the chemical effecting my blood pressure and tried to make myself remember the words blood pressure medication and adrenaline (like my life depended on being able to remember these words after the trip) but somehow just couldn't utter them...  This was almost a repeat experience of 5 grams of mushrooms I ate 3 weeks ago, when I had the most horrific trip of my life... Except this was going to last twice as long.  That last notion was enough to freak me out even more...

This cycle kept continuing for couple of hours where I would sit back in bed and calm down for 10-15 minutes, then this would happen all over again, it was happening in waves, like it would as if it was psilocybin... At this point I had many crazy theories as to what was happening.  One of them was I was having a mushroom flashback while I was tripping on LSD, which was the only plausible explanation because of the similarities...  Looking back now, maybe I would have had a very profound experience if I had just let go and accepted that I was 'dying' and allowed myself to let go but it's really hard when your mind actually believes that you are and utterly convinces you that 'now you've done it!'

Anyway, then when things finally started to calm down, still some OEV's and distortions but nothing of the so called life threatening experience, I started getting that uncomfortable body load feeling and had the revelation that this part of the experience totally depended on how the peak experience was. If it was a good trip, then there would be little to no body load, no physical manifestation, no build up of toxicity but if the trip was difficult, the end result would present itself as a lot of body load. This also made sense at the time and I kinda chuckled at my own cleverness for figuring this out. Now I had to think of ways to get rid of this body load and I remembered I had some herb stashed away so I prepared that and took a hit... When I laid back down on the bed, a sense of calm started to appear all around me, a body buzz started and I had the revelation that this was what had been missing from my trip to calm my nerves all along... Now I was feeling more relaxed, less anxious and I wanted to put back on some tunes... The OEV's also strengthened but it was different, the patterns on the walls wren't really swirling but they were, pulsing now...

The music was sounding heavenly and I couldn't help but marvel at how clear it sounded and kept chuckling, saying 'oh my god..' and 'this is awesome' every now and then..  and it was. The feeling continued for about an hour and I kept taking an additional hit every other hour till the 12th hour mark to prolong the expereience and relaxation. This definitely decreased the feeling of body load... I just tossed and turned in bed and listened to some Terence McKenna lectures, now having a better understanding of what he meant when he said 'difficult experience.' I just never thought I would have this sort of reaction from LSD which has been gentle with me up till this point. I still feel it was the 5g of mushrooms I took 3 weeks ago that changed something in my brain chemistry.

I've now been awake for 26 hours and felt like I have insomnia. Although there were no OEV's or visual disturbances anymore, I still got a slight CEV, some white energy thing just burning and radiating like the sun, or even boiling... I also feel anxiety and slight depression, probably because I was worried that I won't ever be the same now. I've thought like this on mushrooms previously when I completely feel like mentally challenged and that it's gonna be permanent but it always goes away and I come back to regular consciousness after 6 hours or so, so it should have cleared up by now but it hasn't. It's also possible that I feel this way because I haven't slept and I'll feel better once I do but what use is that if I can't fall asleep?  What if I'll never be able to go to sleep again?  What if I'm still like this tomorrow when it's time to go to work?? Negative though loops still continuing, residuals of a bad trip no doubt or it could be an instant flashback, right after the come down, I don't quite know how those work. Not knowing when (if) it's going to stop is depressing and equally terrifying.

The music I listened to while I was tripping was also giving me anxiety when I thought about it, for no good reason. My head feels like it's heavy and kinda numb, almost as if not from LSD but from the weed I smoked, it's just not clearing up and lingering for way longer than I want it to...  I have doubts about re-trying these experiments now, this might very well be the last time I touch these things for a while.  A few more hours pass and it all starts to finally clear up, very slowly.  I'm starting to get a minor headache and it feels as though I'm going to finally start recovering.  I've never been so happy because of a headache! I can feel my head again.  I quickly swallow an Advil cap, anticipating some relief by the time I'll lay down to go to sleep... I was able to go to sleep around 1am, after some 30 hours of being awake.

When I woke up the next day (today), I was fully back to 'normal,' no hints of the haze or anxiety/depression I felt the day before... Now I'm wondering if these things actually precipitate or exacerbate a latent or existing mental disorder I might have...

I have never been an advocate of using powerful hallucinogenic drugs, at least I have never actively suggested it to people. I have, on the other hand, a deep seated belief that if you feel drawn towards doing it and you feel good about it, go for it.

This report follows my second experience and is recounted almost minute for minute taken from dictaphone recordings I made of the night. The recordings spanned a massive seven hours of total record time, most of which filled with speech and description, some of which...well lets just say some of it makes little to no sense at all or is just noise.

RECORDING 1 - 21:28

'It is approximately.....some time at night....half nine, about half nine, and I have just placed two tabs of tasteless printed paper under my tongue, we are all in agreement that this is LSD. No effects yet as I am sure you understand. I am with my two good friends from work who have opted to observe and not partake (they shall be referred to as richmond and charles for the purposes of this report) and the environment is a very comfortable new house with which I am very impressed...*cheers from richmond and carl are heard, though their voices are inaudible*. I shall be documenting the experience in full.

RECORDINGS 2-4 21:55-22:35

21:55'Mild shuddering has become apparent though its not discomforting or anything, its just a little difficult to relax in this chair. I am pretty thirsty, I wonder if thats because I am thirsty or if its the drugs?'

22:15'I am rather comfortable now, feel very very warm...Charles, is it hot in here or is that me? *charles replies that it is just me*, i suppose it is just me, I'm not hot anyway, just warm'

22:35'I haven't said anything for like, ages. I thought it was wise to tell you, even though you probably know, that Charles's room is rather big, I can see every corner from where I am sitting, even ones behind my head. If I try hard enough I can drag them around...*charles and richmond laugh*, they think its funny...blagging a**eholes right there man'

At this point in the evening I was experiencing a great warmth coming from the centre of my body, combined with a deep stillness. If I sat too long my feelings and emotions seemed to mesh with whatever I was touching. I describe this in recording 5.

RECORDING 5 23:10

'It's just totally...I can't communicate I don't know how to communicate. GODDAMN! I wish I could just, communicate! What is it with language man?! I've totally become entwined with this box, you can't have it back, my fingers have sunk into it its like, its like, my soul and the boxes soul have become a supersoul'

RECORDING 6 23:50

'I don't even know what they're both talking about...*you can barely hear richmond trying to explain his question, he is asking me who I think should be president. For lack of a better answer I say Hunter S Thompson, unable to fathom that he is dead*. At this point the lack of concept has taken full hold, I can no longer form ideas in my head or understand simple statements without great effort. The room has descended into a colourful dream world not unlike the artwork of yellow submarine. Walls glazed with oranges and purples, objects shuddering on their spots and morphing into sea creatures and goblins, many of which seem to lack any real form but make perfect sense to me. It may be worth noting that several objects in the room distorted into what I now consider to be meaningless shapes, but at the time they conveyed great meaning to me, and were recognised for their ideals and not their image.

RECORDING 7 00:04

'They put on this song, this blagging song, it's giving me instructions...*the song is giving instructions on surviving a zombie invasion, I became convinced that the house was surrounded by zombies. I saw them out of the window, black hulking masses crawling around buildings. I was not alarmed, merely interested and focussed on the instructions I was being given* I HAVE to follow them...they're all over..I dont know if I should go outside...I can't even have an idea! you know you're messed up when you can no longer form an idea'

RECORDING 8 00:47

'Theres just no point, I cant even form a sentence, I cant speak to this blagging machine....Charles you have a f**kin stripey assed living room man'. I had become obsessed with the walls of the living room, they were striped with colours I had never seen before, colours I doubt I could describe or recreate now. For the purposes of this report it is worth mentioning his walls are painted grey with no stripes.

The recordings beyond this point become rather abstract and are not worth transcribing. I experienced strange visuals involving guitar strings and shuddering of objects. Richmond would close his eyes and shake his head violently from side to side at the end of each sentence, charles become a jesus-like deity in which a white halo appeared behind his head as he spoke. I ascribe this halo to the fact that he has long hair and a beard. I placed my face on their front door to check for zombies, when I experienced the most immersive and overwhelming visual I could have possible imagined.

The door split open around my head and I fell through. Suddenly I found myself flying in an orange and purple mist, surrounded by dizzyingly high black towers. I looked down to the ground some thirty feet away and observed thousands of tiny glowing orbs that were whizzing frantically between the buildings, their movements affected by noises I could hear from charles's living room. Richmonds voice strongly affected the ambient light.

I was shocked, to such a degree I forced myself out of the door and back into their living room.

It was time to ascend to my room for the night, which was a converted loft room with a confusing velux window which opened upward. The flight of stairs panicked me, I felt a sudden urge to have all lights on but charles would not allow it. We ascended in the dark, the stairs conspired against me as my vision was now entirely black. Around me, only wood and carpet, deeply menacing emotions emerged from every surface I touched as they curled and contorted as if to engulf my physical form and eventually control my mind. I got over this fear and managed to reason past the nightmare of this short flight of stairs, we continued to climb until the light of the bathroom freed me.

The final three or four hours of my trip were spent listening to Jefferson Airplane. The music took on a whole new level inside my head, new meanings were discovered and fantastic visuals emerged from every note. Sound and music were being translated into language which only I could understand, and whenever I opened my eyes, the tune would distort the room around me to match its movement.

A perfect experience.

Id like to begin this report by telling you guys a little about myself. I am seventeen, take absolutely no medication, and have already experimented with a small variety of drugs such as marijuana, MDMA to a minor extent, and LSD. Although I have already dropped acid once, it was at a concert setting so I was not able to fully gauge the intensity of the trip due to the atmosphere, let alone enjoy it to the fullest. I was also with a friend who, even though is pretty funny, I am not too fond of. Before you decide not to read this, let me say that it truly felt like it was my first experience with the drug. Since that one time, I have always wanted to try it once more with a special person who I would be able to fully express my feelings and emotions with, while in a more comfortable setting.

I have become increasingly close with my friend who moved here to Miami from New York about nine months ago; well call her S for the remaining of the report. I pretty much consider her as a sister by this point. What gave me the idea to try it with her was a recurring dream that I had in which we both took it and biked through the forest and ended up in the most serene setting. In this vivid dream we both lied down on a long sloped grass hill with a large lake at the bottom while we watched the sun set behind the mountains (I have no idea where I even conceived this place considering there are no mountains anywhere near Miami). After this I told her about dream and asked her what she though about making it happen. She has not done any drugs before in her life, so I was surprised to hear that she was open to the idea. I assured her that the drug is not what the media portrays it to be, and that we would plan it out perfectly so that nothing could go wrong. Although she was originally going to try smoking weed before this, it never quite happened and I am actually pretty glad. She is the most active, hilarious girl I know, so I would hate to see her so lazy and out of it after smoking. I asked her to trust me about the misconceptions about LSD, and reassured her that everything would be ok. We planned to trip the next weekend.

I was giddy with excitement on Sunday morning when I drove to her house to pick her up. Although we were both slightly nervous, we both had a great mindset because it was a beautiful day, and we had no obligations to take care of. Once we were at my house we prepared our backpacks with water, iced tea, sunglasses, an extra pair of clothes just in case anything happens, a bowl of mixed fruit, and headphones. Our plan was to bike over to a nearby nature trail and have a picnic by the lake. We went into my room, hesitantly placed the blotter tab on our tongues, waited for it to dissolve, and swallowed at precisely 1:40 P.M. We hugged each other in anticipation of the great adventure we were about to experience, and sat on the couch to watch TV while it kicked in. After about ten boring minutes we decide to just leave on our bike ride.

My bike was previously making a really loud screeching noise but I fixed it by loosening a bolt near the front tire only slightly. We slowly pedaled on back roads just casually talking about what was to come. We both had that feeling of anticipation, that something was off but we couldnt tell what just yet. As we neared the nature trail, we began to feel the first small effects. As an uncontrollable smile fell upon my face, everything seemed a little bit brighter and more beautiful. When we stopped to make sure we were heading in the right direction, I spotted one of those lizards that run on their hind legs. It was very similar to those Jesus lizards that run on water but it was over concrete. She didnt see it so she sarcastically joked about me seeing things. As we arrived to the park, our first decision was to go through one of the trails.

By the time we both got to the trail it had been about 50-60 minutes since we took it so it just started to hit us and the nature surrounding us was quite beautiful. By this time my bike had also started making the noises that I thought I had fixed earlier, but I did my best to ignore them. We rode over the narrow concrete road as we passed hundreds of mangrove-looking trees on both sides. We looked directly in front of us as we flew by the trees at a high speed. We then both looked down at our tires spinning ever so slowly over the ground and bursted out laughing. We must have been going only two miles per hour but the nearby trees that raced passed us on both sides made it seem as if we were going so fast! Up ahead on the road we saw that a mucky substance consisting of leaves, dirt, etc. Completely covering the road. I picked up some speed to that I could pedal through it easily and reached the end of the mucky road pretty quickly. I heard S behind me say, I dont like the muck and I looked back to see her standing next to her bike waiting in the mucky road. We both made eye contact and laughed uncontrollably. She walked it out to where I was and we continued on our way. After about five more minutes we decided to turn back and head towards the lake for our picnic. Once we were off the trail and back in the parking lot, we went over the curb and stopped to make sure no cars coming. We both noticed a patch of dried mud that had a smooth grey appearance. My noticed visual was when I focused on the patch and saw it morph slightly. We took note of this, agreed that it looked liked quicksand, and crossed the street to begin our picnic. By now my bike was making a horrid screeching sound so I was glad to finally get off it. We parked our bikes next to this old concrete structure that looked like it was built in the 1800s and walked near the lake to set up our blanket.

By now it must have been about 1:30-2:00 hours since we took it. We were both pretty hungry so we took out the fruit salad in my bag and started picking the fruit by hand and lifting it up to our mouth. We opened the top and as we both went for our first piece of fruit we bursted out laughing. Right on the top was the biggest chunk of pineapple we had ever seen! Looks like the supermarket got lazy, I said. It must have taken S about four separate bites to finish that one chunk. After about ten minutes of eating I realized that we brought plastic forks to eat the fruit with. S said to forget about the forks, its only another thing that can go wrong I chuckled and accepted the fact that eating it with our hands felt so much better. For some reason, the cold, slimy fruit that would have made us feel so awkward at any other time felt amazing in our fingers. Once we got to the bottom of the fruit bowl there was really only a few chunks of fruit left so out of laziness we tossed them in the grass instead of walking back to a trashcan. Back towards the concrete structure there were three kids of about six or seven years old playing with sticks with two adults following them. I couldnt help but laugh because of the way the two men were dressed. One of them, who I presumed to be the father, had a long ponytail of grey hair, was dressed in full hiking attire, and even had a long stick he was using to hike with. The other man who looked like he was about 25-35 years old was dressed a little more normal but was wearing a safari-like sun hat. I couldnt help pointing out to S that if you took the kids out of the picture, it looks like these guys were going to spend their day deep inside the African Sahara!

Since we didnt bother looking at our phones much to check the time, these are estimates (2:00-3:00 since we took it). Towards the peak of our trip, we decided to lie down and relax. As soon as my back made contact with the ground, I felt a wave of relief. I had never felt so relaxed and in unison with S and everything around me. We wanted to listen to some music now so S took out her iPod Shuffle and began skipping through songs. Since she shares it with two of her sisters, nothing too appealing came on so I decided to plug in my music. After two minutes of indecisiveness, I chose Dyer Maker by Led Zeppelin. The music sounded amazing and I felt like I was transported back to the seventies. But once the song reached the point where Robert Plant starts screaming, S read my mind and asked me to change it. As we continued to listen to some tunes, we put our shades on and stared up at the clouds. The clouds moved slowly in every direction and the edges of the clouds swirled slightly, it was one of the coolest things I had ever seen. After what felt like an hour of just looking up at the sky, S needed to go to the bathroom. When I checked my phone, only twenty minutes had passed since we first lied down! We were both completely shocked by how altered our time perception was and agreed that this trip was going to feel like forever. I had no Idea where the bathrooms were but S said she saw them earlier before we went on the trail, so we made it our mission to find the bathroom. I hopped on my bike after having completely forgotten about the noise and as I took the first pedal, my bike screamed like a banshee. I felt everyones eyes on me but I laughed it out. I told S that my bike was pretty bipolar because every now and then it would be quiet for a while, but as soon as you got accustomed to the silence, it would start screeching again.

It turned out that the bathroom was about sixty seconds away so it wasnt as much of a mission as what was about to come. I waited outside the bathroom as she walked in and not even fifteen seconds later she came out with a frown on her face. that was quick, I joked. She said there was a spider in the stall and she cant do it. I started laughing while thinking to myself is she serious? So I took a look inside and at first sight it seemed fine, but hanging right above the stall was the biggest spider I had ever seen! The entire place was covered in insects! I went outside in embarrassment and told her to try the last stall, which was the least insect-ridden. After waiting for her to come out I decided that I also needed to pee. Cant I just go in the womens bathroom where I know its safe? 

No we need to be normal people She laughed. So I went across to the mens restroom and finished up in a sec.

(3:30-4:30 since we took it) We decide to look for another spot to chill, so after a few minutes of noisy biking, we found a nice clearing with a picnic table. We decide to sit on the top of the bench like the cool kids. She had brought her sketchbook and colored pencils so it was the perfect time to start doodling. We both collaborated on a drawing on the same page and when it was done, it was the most disgusting, dog/rabbit-looking creature I had ever seen. I laughed so hard at what we created and determined it was best if we try drawing individually for a few minutes. She ended up drawing a picture of us sitting on the bench and titled it The Best She said she was about to write trip but I insisted not to just in case her parents came across the sketchbook. I took a colored pencil and filled it in, The Best Picnic. Then she got her pencil, crossed out picnic and wrote Thing. We both laughed at this war we were having and ended up talking the rest of the time. We looked back where our bikes were and saw the same three kids with those two creepy adults following them. We both noticed a really pretty bird that was in the tree, and little-by-little, more and more birds showed up. These werent pigeons and crows either; these were some pretty exotic-looking birds. Before we knew it we were standing under a tree full of these awesome birds that had colorful patterns on their tail wings. What are we doing here? This is like a prime bird-watching location, S said. We laughed and ended up sitting back down on the bench. As we came down from our peak we talked and messed around for another hour or so before hopping on our bikes and leaving the park. 

(5:30-6:00 since we took it) Once arriving at the checkpoint we previously stopped at on the way over here, S spotted the lizard I saw earlier. It easily could have been a different one but it was cool to see one in the same exact spot as earlier. I later figured out that they are called Basilisk Lizards. As we neared my house, S exclaimed, We didnt listen to Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds! So I pulled up the song on my phone and we began to listen to it. We were practically drenched in sweat, wearing dorky bike helmets, and could barely hear the song due to the loud screeching of my bike. Its like the ending of a really bad movie, S said. I started laughing uncontrollably. Even though we were coming down from our trip, it was definitely one of the funniest moments of the day.

We were both starving when we got to my house so we immediately started making sandwiches. After barely putting anything but meat and cheese on the pita bread, S goes for a bite but I told her to wait, this sandwich has to be epic. So we each put two sandwiches of meats and cheese in the toaster and placed our condiments in between each of our two sandwiches to make something that was worth the wait. About 45 minutes later we scarfed down the food and I went back to the sketchbook to look at what we drew. I saw The Best Picnic drawing and crossed it out and put The Best Sandwich.

As soon as we finished eating we jumped in the pool to relax. S insisted in taking my surfboard in the pool so I couldnt tell her no. We paddled around in the flattest ocean you will ever surf in and I tried teaching her how to duck dive, which she almost got (She at least learned how to sit on the board). After a great day we dried off and I took her home.

Here follows the events of my first acid trip in all its glory. For the purposes of this recollection I shall be C, and my tripping partner will be L. At the time we were both 18, the summer of 2007. Other characters such as J, P, and many others will be named as they appear. As a preface I will say that I had been trying to obtain a hallucinogen to experiment with for over 6 months. Prior to this my only experience with drugs had come from smoking copious amounts of marijuana for about a year and half, and a week prior to this experience I had take a half eighth of Psylocibin Mushrooms (with L) which resulted in my first mild psychedelic experience. Suffice to say LSD was a much larger experience on the whole.

I acquired the acid at a party of all places. I had been talking to my friend L about our recent shroom trip and a very strung out kid walked up to us and said, hey man you wanna buy some acid? Classic, I thought as he told me. Absolutely brilliant. I paid $20 for two hits on shock tarts. I was a little unsure about that but I could see the drops on them so I thought well fuck why the hell not. 

Exactly a week later, on a Saturday, my friend and I parked at a local elementary school. Yea thats right a fucking elementary school. It was actually a pretty sweet spot because the woods behind the school were frequented by bikers and hikers out getting their kicks on the paths that lacerated the woods. We figured we pop the acid and spend 6 hours or so wandering in these woods looking for glorious things. It was actually a fairly good plan. We just didnt realize how much walking this would actually entail.

We parked the car and grabbed all manner of shit that we might need, stuffing our pockets with the stuff. Pipes, papers, weed, iPods, and any other shit that could help chill us out. We snapped into a smart march and made our way into the woods. My friend was getting antsy so I pulled out the acid. I looked at both shock tarts carefully. Red and green. I had really wished they were red and blue, Im a big fan of the matrix. In any case I took the red one and put it on my tongue and he did likewise. There was no taste beyond the sugary sensation of the shock tarts. So here I was finally trying the fabled stuff that had inspired so many songs and powered a counter-culture movement. After about 3 minutes the stuff had dissolved in my mouth and I thought theres nothing I could do to stop it at this point, Im in for 12 hours.

I really think thats one of the great things about slow acting psychedelics. That waiting period before they kick in gives me time to accept the fact that I'm in for a ride before the mental distortion kicks in. I sort of resigned myself to my upcoming fate, even if it is only temporary.

Anyways so at this point were walking through the woods and its about 11:00am. I remember these times very clearly because they seemed like the most important things in the world at the time. We began walking and L told me what to expect because he had done it once before and I settled in to wait. We walked past all manner of shit along the bike trails: old bikes, a rusted car, a washing machine all kinds of shit that just shouldnt have been there. Slightly disappointing but hey you cant let stuff get you down. 

The first moment when I began to feel the effects was when we sat down to rest on some bike jumps. They were real big things that the bikers around my town keep up very meticulously. I was on a bank of sorts and my friend on a taller more normal looking jump when I realized that I was expected a stoned feeling, when I should be expecting something more similar to my mushroom trip the week prior. I looked hard up at the leaves and as I leaned my head back I did feel a bit of a rush up my spinebut maybe I imagined it. Either way this got me pumped and I jumped up and clapped my hands. Bro lets get going! I said. L consented and we began walking more vigorously through the woods. I figured I wasnt tripping and I needed a little bit of help so I pulled out my iPod, but it on mono and put one headphone in so that I could still listen to L talk. 

The choice of what song to listen to was agonizing, not because I was tripping yet, but because I take my drugs seriously (perhaps a folly of mine). I finally settled on a one two punch of Somebody to Love and White Rabbit both by Jefferson Airplane. This was a GOOD decision. Somebody to love made me feel pumped, and White Rabbit absolutely weirded me out. In a good way. You know how it is.

So L gets this powerful thirst and were at our first point of crisis since dropping. L says he is feeling the acid a little but we need to find water really badly. We didnt bring any with us which was a big mistake as it was probably 95+ degrees out. After much deliberation we decided that we would simply walk back to the elementary school and use an outdoor water fountain. I think I really like that about acid. When I'm in trip mode I really sort of use Occams razor as a decision making process: the simplest solution is probably the best. So we walked the half mile back to the elementary school.

It was between those jumps and the school when I began to feel the effects of my LSD. We came up the crest of the hill, and a set of power-lines that snaked along the side of the bike path (which at this point was wide enough to accommodate a truck) seemed to stretch on forever. It was as if the horizon was farther away than should ever be allowed by a rational sane world. The puddles along the side of the path were quite brown. Very, very brown actually. 

At one point we saw a small toad on the side of the path and L and I stopped and debated for a short time on whether or not the toad was actually there. The conversation started as a joke about how some people expect the impossible while tripping but turned into a conversation and investigation into existentialism and what I like to think of as theory of communication. After such an intense discussion my mind was pretty much in overdrive thinking an analyzing. I find that a trip is best with alternating moments of analytical thought and pure feeling and being in the moment and not thinking anything. Of course at the moment I had no idea that this was a good thing and I was just happy to be having such deep emotionally stirring thoughts. 

The next thing I saw was absolute beauty. I live in North Carolina, which is known for its red clay dirt. As I walked onto the campus of this small elementary school the ground was covered in red clay, small grey and black pebbles, and blue gravel. No painting ever had more beautiful colors than that red, grey, black and blue. LSD is amazing like that. Thats what I tell people when they ask me about it. Whats it like man? Everything is beautiful I tell them.

Anyways we went and got our water from a water fountain, which had a drowned cockroach in the bottom. Pretty gross but we were desperate. We walked down to one of the playgrounds and marveled at the colors of the play structures there for a while until we were interrupted by a group of small children (very strange as it was a weekend and they had nobody supervising them). I think some stuff happened to fill the next half hour but its unclear to me now. Eventually we had decided that we needed to walk to Weaver Street (a local organic foods market full of stoned hippies). The only problem was its distance, something like 3 miles away (I was so amazed by the distance we walked that day I calculated it using Google earth, the school was 2.86 miles by the path we took).  Once again we marveled at the ridiculousness of modern society. Why shouldnt we walk a few miles to obtain foodstuffs, it was done by our ancestors for millions of years. So we walked. And we discussed how certain themes in music and literature reflected this traveling mindset that we were experiencing. The only example I can think of at the moment is Ramble On by Led Zeppelin.

So there we trekked, over hills and along roads, along railroads, under bridges and over creeks. We finally arrived at a park where we walked through a family reunion with a good deal of African Americans people and fried chicken. It was pretty funny at the time. Anyways when we got to this park I experienced one of my most amazing hallucinations of the trip. There was a large American sycamore across from the bench we were sitting upon and I pulled on Ls arm holy shit dude look at that! The bark of this tree was literally slithering up and down and melting into the ground. The movement was just like watching lava flow, but over the surface of the tree. I looked at the ground and the grass sparkled and flowed as though underwater. I looked up and my whole field of vision swam likean octopus garden in the shade. Dont know if thats what Lennon was going for, but its sure as hell how I felt (I make that analogy in retrospect).

The next part of the adventure involved walking into the bathroom at this park, which was not only dirty but had no light. As I walked in and the door close behind me rushing sounds emanated around my head and my vision became very enclosed and narrow. I placed my hands under the running water in the sink and splashed some over my face. I cannot describe what I felt because I forgot it just a moment later, but let it suffice to say it was intense.

I emerged back into the light and things really began to break down in terms of what I remember. Time got very jumpy as we walked across another parking lot and began walking into town. For some reason I did not get paranoid as we walked along a fairly main artery into town. L began to speak of the absurdity of large SUVs and how they should be made illegal and whatnot (granted we saw more hybrids than we saw SUVs in our town, but L is very passionate about such things).  At one point in this conversation he uttered the words that stuck with me forever cars are so loud and unfortunate. It was at that moment that my entire worldview changed and Im pretty sure Ive never been the same. I cant explain how, it was a very subtle change. But violent movies arent quite as appealing anymore, angry music seems immature, anger in general is bizarre, and television commercials and the way people act on them seem downright strange. I feel as though it retuned my bullshit detector to high.

We finally made it to Weaver Street, and after a quick stint walking inside, which resembled very much walking around in an aquarium, we exited with some sushi and mixed wheat grass drinks or something nasty like that. We ate and drank quickly but remarked later that we hadnt really been hungry. While we ate I began hearing a bizarre whooov noise in my left ear which I convinced myself was a hallucination because I didnt want to turn my head and look sketchy. Well this of course was ridiculous and I looked and saw that it was a young mother on the lawn where we were sitting, blowing over the surface of an empty bottle to make that very distinct noise to entertain her child. I had a moment of connection with her where we locked eyes, and I was sure she knew I was tripping, and that she had tripped before. She gave me a smile and as I turned back to L I said dude lets get out of here. The ground wiggled to reinforce my decision.

Earlier in the day walking around my elementary school while undergoing such profound leaps of perception had been very eye opening, and had brought about something of what Tim Leary and his Ilk would call ego death. In light of this L wanted to visit his elementary school so, being the liberating walking-light-beings that we were at the time, we decided to go. We had a small mishap crossing the street on the way there, but drivers here are nice and break for absent minded professors from the local university, so had no problems stopping for some local acid freaks either. We arrived at the school and spent a good deal of time staring at the tables and grass. I talked to a friend on the phone briefly and he agreed to pick us up later that evening when we were done tripping.  We lay in the grass for a while and watched the clouds float in one direction, and then stop and race back the way they had come. Bark still crawled on the tree if one looked at it hard enough and other weird shit continued to happen. This detour added a good half mile to our return journey to bringing the total distance we had walked up to 5 miles. 

The next half hour or so was spent in intense deep conversation about life and the universe and the next thing we knew we were back at the elementary school which we had started at. The route we took was very indirect and involved a lot of walking around in the woods making our total distances for the day an eventual 8 miles. We walked around the school again marveling at how gravel showing through imperfections in the concrete would swim like the stars in a galaxy (seriously that is the only way to describe it). Anyways this continued for another half hour or so until I rolled a joint that was pretty much the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. Again. We both talked to our parents on the phone (a difficult task) and waited for our ride to come pick us up. A guy name J who I had talked to on the phone earlier and a girl P (who has recently had her own amazing acid experiences, but at this time had not even considered it) picked us up and brought us back to Js house. 

We were terrified of having to face his parents, but when they said hi to us it really wasnt that bad. Once in his room everything sort of ended. I kept trying to make stuff move with my mind but it was mostly over. The only moment when I felt it again was when about 10 people walked into that same room later after L went to pick them up (he was good to drive at this point). I could feel their combined energy wash over me. The rest of the night consisted of smoking massive amounts of dank marijuana and listening to chill music. I talked to some other people who had tripped at other times and we shared experiences. In the immortal words of General Tarken: This will be a day long remembered.

LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Music Discussion (22), Glowing Experiences (4), First Times (2), General (1)




 




DOSE:
2 tablets
oral
LSD
(pill / tablet)





BODY WEIGHT:
180 lb





I began using LSD in 1970, after a high-school acquaintance introduced me to someone who sold it right on campus. So I bought my first dose of LSD from a fellow student who had Purple Microdot stashed in his locker. My first experience with LSD was anticlimactic because I took a very small amount. Using a razor blade, I cut the one tablet I bought roughly in half, and then I halved it again, so that I only ingested about 1/4th of the tablet. I gave a friend a quarter of the tablet as well. He may have gotten more of the drug than I did because I really didnt experience anything all that remarkable while he seemed to be somewhere in the stratosphere. He couldnt even talk intelligibly to describe what was happening with him.

The first LSD trip that brought on hallucinations occurred a couple of months later. I had bought a variety of the drug called Orange Sunshine, cut it in half and swallowed one of the halves. Within about 45 minutes to an hour, I began to see some incredible things, and I finally understood what people were talking about when they described seeing complex, pulsating geometric designs in bright day-glow colors and so forth. That evening, when I looked at the random designs painted on the ceiling of my bedroom, the textures in the paint began to form into very ornate geometric patterns that appeared to be 3-dimensional and swirling slowly into circles and vortexes. I saw very similar designs in my mind when I closed my eyes, except the colors were starker and more vibrant. The trip lasted about 6 hours, and I never left my bedroom. I just listened to music and watched the swirling, pulsating patterns and vibrant colors unfolding in my mind. And I saw some astounding things with my eyes closed before it was over. 

I enjoyed this experience immensely because I had never seen anything so beautiful and wondrous as the visions my imagination poured forth, so I began experimenting with LSD more frequently. I began to take a whole tablet at one time to ratchet up the intensity of the trip, and I began to love the LSD experience and look forward to repeating it whenever I was able to score the drug from someone selling it in my neighborhood. I thought the LSD experience was incredibly profound, even though I was a naive teenager who didn't know much about the world, and eventually I lost my sense of caution about the possible effects of an overdose. I began to think that if one tablet brought on a really beautiful trip, taking two tablets at a time would give me an even more fantastic trip. Big mistake!

I bought several tablets of Orange Sunshine from a friend who had gotten it in California, and one sunny Saturday afternoon, I swallowed two tablets and waited for the light show in my head to begin. About 45 minutes later, I was feeling the first effects of the drug, so I put on an album by the Jefferson Airplane and lay down on my bed, closing my eyes to see what would appear in my mind. By this time I was beginning to see colors and starkly beautiful geometric shapes and patterns with my eyes closed, more intense and beautiful than ever before. 

My visions seemed to react to the sound of the music I was listening to. Each instrument being played on the album caused a pattern and color that corresponded to that specific sound. The bass created deeper, darker colors, and the sound of the guitar brought forth warmer colors like red and orange.

After a while  I dont know how long  the music began to sound warped and somehow a little ominous, so I got up and went into the living room. By this time, however, some extremely intense hallucinations were beginning to form all around me, and I realized, with more than a little anxiety, that the LSD was affecting me more than I had expected. 

I turned on the television set, and on one of the channels was a narrator or emcee, looking straight at the camera and talking to the viewing audience. All of a sudden I had the impression that he was looking straight at me and talking to me personally, as if he knew I was watching the program and was not just part of a random, anonymous viewing public. He was directing his remarks to me specifically. Then I realized that this was an irrational thought, and that scared me because I wasnt just having incredible hallucinations but was beginning to think in a weird way  to be prone to believing things that were impossible if looked at logically. 

The loss of control over my mind was alarming. It evoked an emotional response that seemed to intensify the garish colors and designs, which by this time were totally animated and looping around the living room in an ominous, threatening way. That scared the hell out of me, so I went outside, hoping to escape the hallucinations in the bright sunlight. It didnt help.

What I saw outside was a completely chaotic scene, with animated designs and geometric shapes bouncing all around,floating on lawns, drooping from trees and hovering above the asphalt street while moving in spirals. Real objects such as the cars on the street looked distorted and warped. 

At that point I thought I was losing my mind, in which case I would have to be institutionalized for the rest of my life because I was never going to be sane and rational again. I felt a tremendous sense of grief over what I had inadvertently done to myself, and I began crying as I paced up and down the street, trying to calm down and keep it together. One of my neighbors was outside, and he saw I was in an agitated state. I managed to tell him what was happening, and he drove me to one of the drug treatment centers that existed in Phoenix at the time.

The drive seemed to take forever, even though it probably only took about 20 minutes in reality because the center was not that far from my neighborhood. When we finally arrived there, several young men with long hair were sitting on a stoop outside. My neighbor turned to me and said something like, Goddamned Hippies, they ought to open up a hunting season on them, just like quail. 

I immediatly came to believe that this drug treatment center was really a front for distributing drugs, and I was more than a little paranoid about going inside. A couple of the young men sitting outside saw me as I got out of my neighbor's car, and they seemed to know what was the matter with me. In fact, I assumed they knew I was high on LSD by the way they looked at me.

I was escorted into one of the rooms, a place with oriental rugs on the floor - kind of a dark space that was meant to be peaceful and relaxing to people who were as stressed out as I was at the time. Two of the volunteer counselors in this room tried to make small talk with me by asking me my name, what I did for a living, whether I was still in high school, etc. I couldnt answer them because I was having a great deal of difficulty forming words and holding onto them long enough to keep a rational train of thought and engage in a normal conversation.

Though this place was supposed to be a place where I could get some help, it appeared menacing to me, and I wondered what these people talking to me had up their sleeve. I didnt trust them to help me. And I could hardly tell them what was going on inside my head, so I sat in silence and just observed people coming and going on the other side of the room, wondering if they were high on LSD lie I was. I must have sat there like that for a couple of hours. In the meantime, the frightening and garish hallucinations began to subside and grow fainter. I felt a tremendous sense of relief because I then realized that I wouldnt be insane the rest of my life. I was going to be OK. I felt like crying for joy.

After a few more hours I was calmed down and rational enough to realize my parents would be looking for me, so I decided to walk home. I must have taken my shoes off at one point, though I didnt remember doing it, because I couldnt find them and had to walk home barefooted, The counselors wanted me to stay a while, but I assured them I was down from the peak of the trip and that I could make it home safely.

It was a truly terrifying experience, the most panic I had ever felt in my life, I was shaken and exhausted when it was all over, but incredibly relieved to be back on planet earth where I belonged. You would think that would be the end of my LSD use, but I eventually began using it again after my fear of repeating the bad trip had subsided. I rationalized it and thought the bad trip was an overdose that I could avoid repeating if I again used more caution.

I never again tried taking a large dose all at once. I didnt want to repeat the experience, so I took smaller amounts of LSD, and those trips were relatively uneventful though quite colorful and thought provoking. I finally quit taking LSD altogether because it lost its allure. Each trip was so similar to the ones I had experienced before that the novelty wore off. The last time I used LSD was about 27 years ago, but my memory of the bad trip remains clear. I will never forget that night.

Id just like to say that this was a LONG trip. I took 1 tab, and about 9 hours into that I had another, effectively having 2 consecutive trips. Then there was the long long come down. By the end of it I hadnt slept in 28 hours and was just fried mentally and physically. So, excuse me if this report is a bit long, but I dont feel my trip is justified enough without the detail.

That aside, this was my second time doing acid. Far from my first experience with drugs though. Over the previous 2 years I had smoked a lot of weed of course, done copious amounts of DXM, DPH and LSA and had done other one-off encounters with salvia, speed, MDMA, Xanax and some painkillers. I considered myself pretty experienced with drugs and at that point impervious to a bad trip, taking into account all the DPH Ive done and all the bad highs Id gotten. The first time I did acid on a school night, alone in my room, and while it was fun I dont think I truly experienced the acid experience. After looking for it again for a year, my dealer-good friend of mine told me that within the next week shed get some LSD and that Im more than welcome to take it with her and her friends. As nice as this was, I dont think I wouldve felt the safest tripping with her Russian skinhead drug dealing muscly boyfriend and his friends. Nice guys and all, but Im sure acid wouldve said otherwise. I asked her if I could buy 8 tabs for me and my friends instead, who havent previously done acid and she said shell see what she can do. 

Fast forward a week and Im in her apartment hallway staring at a tiny piece of tinfoil. She said to me So, remember, theres 4 with a bear on them and 4 with just colours on them. The one with bears on them are the really strong ones, dont give them to your friends who havent done LSD before. The one without bears are... well, strong ones, ha. Enjoy! and just like that she guided me towards the door, gave me a hug and told me to take care. So begin our LSD journey. My friend who was waiting outside had a huge grin on his face; we couldnt wait to take it anymore. But we decided to at least wait till were on the bus to our friends house to take it. We came to the bus station at about 7pm. Full of impatience, we just said fuck it and went to the bathroom. Opening up this magic piece of tinfoil, we both glared down at the tabs. I carefully picked up my tab, a colourful little smiley bear was on it. I felt nervous. He took his colourful tab and we stared at each other, having second thoughts if we should do it or not (at that present moment). We did anyways, of course, and made our way to the bus stop.

Waiting at the bus stop I felt really nervous. I dont know why. My foot was tapping and my heart was racing. My friend felt the same, but we felt confident. My mindset at the time was ok. I was doing fine in college, had good friends, but I was piss poor and was arguing with my girlfriend of 3 years. I kept thinking about spiders for some reason (I detest spiders) and my girlfriend. It made me feel a bit scared, what if these thoughts just turned up while I was tripping and then I had a bad trip? What if I started to freak out on the bus? Too late, I thought. Its slowly melting on your tongue and you know youre not going to spit it out.

The bus arrived and neither of us could wait to start tripping and to arrive at our friends. The bus journey was 1 hour 25 minutes, so we really needed to occupy ourselves. About 50 minutes later we began to feel good. REALLY good. Just very happy. It was identical to LSA happiness to say the least. We began to talk about rubbish, like how it feels like this bus is a womb and us 2 are twins. Our friend, a female, was coming to pick us up at the bus station. Then we theorized that she was our mother, meeting us at the exit of the womb and would guide us through the world (the city) to happiness (her house where our friends were). The excitement of thinking of seeing her was unbearable! The second we got off the bus we ran towards her and gave her a HUGE hug (so much that we hurt her breasts!), like a dog running to his master. Her already knowing we were a bit fucked up, she gladly purchased all of us an inter-city bus ticket to the house. On the bus, the LSA happiness started to wear. Not that we werent happy still, but the LSD silliness began to take over. We sat on the bus just grinning. Then I said to him Hey, what if we fartled? Fartled...? he inquired. You know, when you get startled by someone and at the same time you fart. On the finishing of my sentence the two of us roared into laughter. Just laughing and laughing and laughing at the top of our lungs. On a public bus full of people (no one seemed to hear us though, at least thats what our friend said). After our little laugh attack (which there was way more to come), we asked our friend how long had we been laughing maniacally. She told us Uhm, about 20 minutes! Neither of us could believe it. It really felt like we had been laughing for just 10 seconds.

We got off at the bus stop close to the house. We stopped into McDonalds first though, our mother was hungry and we were obedient to our mother, like 2 little babies.  While she was getting food at the counter, me and my friend stared at a marble table. The hallucinations were starting. We both saw kaleidoscope patterns along the marble table. Cool, can see you it F, can you see it!? Yeah man, its moving all over the table! At this point our friend grabbed both our arms, bag of food in mouth and dragged us out (not in an angry way). She told us we literally shouted it and there was 2 men behind us, staring at us. After devouring our burgers, which tasted more amazing than usual, we had our little walk to the house. To get to the house you have to go down this little alleyway in between 2 neighbourhoods. This was fine and all, I was in good company and the house was just 2 minutes walk away. Upon entering the alleyway though everything had a dark feel to it (it was 10pm by this point). The trees begin to get sharper and seemed to be pointing at me. Then I heard this loud metallic scraping, followed by the hissing of a snake. I, without thinking, sprinted to the end of the alleyway. I realized what had happened and laughed it off, I knew it was just the acid beginning to take effect and waited up for my friends.

We finally got to the house, where there was good vibes everywhere. All my friends were there, the atmosphere was good and I was on acid. It really began to take a hold now. I saw kaleidoscopes everywhere. My bodily feelings spiralled out of control. I just wanted to stretch and touch everything, my teeth felt really sharp and kind of sore. My hands numb. I didnt care, I felt completely at one with the world. I handed my friend his tab of acid. Now there was 3 of us whod be on acid. Nothing much happened for a while, me and my other tripping friend just enjoyed the patterns everywhere and kept having laugh attacks, which felt amazing by the way. Another friend arrived at the house to pick up his 2 tabs of acid. We offered him to trip with us, but he declined. Thats cool, hes got things to do and places to be. While we were all having a cigarette in the living room, the friend that arrived began to talk about the acid experience. He was somewhat experienced with it, having taken it 5+ times. He said When on acid, youre like a little school child. Anything can you make laugh, take these 2 idiots for example (referring to us) He began to smile really widely and waved his arms about. Me and my friend exploded into laughter. I just couldnt help it, he looked so silly. We begged him to do it again and again until he finally said Im not gonna be your personal clown for the night! Later guys! and like that he left. 

Our other friend who had taken it began to trip. This is when all of us entered question mode. Every little thing, every idea and word, wed elaborate and question. Having a basic conversation would turn into an elaborate, pseudo-intellectual conversation. An example would be this (each line representing a different person);

Could you please pass the water? Wait, why dont I get the water? Why do I even need the water? Im hydrated and really dont need any water

What do you mean by hydration though? Do you really feel hydrated and dont need the water, or do you just think it? How can you tell what your body needs? Why am I making decisions for you? Why dont I just let you get your water?

But why do you THINK you know if hes hydrated or not? What if he really is? Where do you think you know how he feels? Why do I think I know how you think?

Yes, that whole conversation ensued over me asking if I could get a bottle of water. This was a daily occurrence over the night, over ANYTHING. An apple, a name, what time it is, etc. It was pretty cool, but towards the end of the trip you just wanted to have a normal conversation without turning it into a question everything discussion. 

We didnt do much apart from wonder around the house in amazement and talk (that is, us 3. Our 3 other non-tripping friends stayed in the sitting room). I feel like I should mention my brief bad trip. While my 2 friends wandered upstairs, I looked for a mirror to look into and went into my friends room. A girly room it was. But that didnt change anything. For some reason, when I stepped into the room, I felt REALLY alone. I just stood at the door, confused. Then the leopard patterns on her bed started turning into the shapes of spiders, her big mirror began to turn into an angry face and an absolute terror overcame me. I was so scared and felt so alone. I ran back to my friends upstairs and told them what happened. Then we had another big discussion about evilness and why the mind manifests these things. Then I wondered why that incident occurred, analyzed it and felt that it was absolutely pointless. However, my friend decided to turn off the light for a second. That was fine, I wasnt scared anymore. Until he, in the darkness, turned really pale, grew big fang teeth, had red gleaming eyes and his hair turned into a big nest of barbed wire. I got scared again and turned on the light. We analyzed it again and I definitely felt I could take on the dark now. I wanted to get an evil hallucination. We turned the lights off and I looked at my friend. Sadly (or not so sadly) my friend turned into a Chinese man (hes 100% white) and we all burst into laughter. The period of bad trips is gone I told myself and I smiled.

It was about 3am at this point, the hallucinations began to wear off and I didnt want to stop tripping. I took another tab and wandered around the house where I met the first friend I tripped with. I told him I took another tab and he said Uh oh. I got kind of angry at this and asked why did he said that. He said Well tomorrow, youre going to be tripping really hard and no one else will be.... Wanker I thought to myself. He doesnt know a fucking thing about LSD, this is his first time doing it. Doesnt he know that since I didnt take 2 at the same time I wont trip THAT hard? Fuck him. Then I explained to him that Ill trip in the same way I just did and Ill be fine. He said Oh, ok. Youre more experienced with drugs so Ill take your word. I calmed down and went upstairs alone to think for myself. I sat down on a friends bed and felt normal. Emotionless, I guess. I heard a loud buzzing noise out of nowhere. Then I heard my friends talking, even though everyone was downstairs. Within seconds I felt like everything was caving in on me and evil faces began to appear everywhere. Amongst a bundle of clothes, on an ipod, etc. I ran downstairs back to my friends and sat in silence with them thinking Youre only happy (can you even say you are?) because youre with friends. In a few hours most of them are going home and youll be alone. Youll have to go back to your house with your lame housemates and youre going to freak the fuck out. Oh, and your girlfriend hates you. I saw evil faces in all objects and began to feel really nervous, until my tripping friend said Hey, Im going for a walk. Space seems like itd be awesome to look at! I felt happier and comfier, I felt like I could talk to him one on one and Id be safer. When we went outside, he told me Im gonna go get F (our other tripping friend), one sec). I told myself, standing outside in the grass completely alone in the dark at 4am, Youre alone now. Fight your fears and just like that I felt completely good about myself. To brighten it even more, my friend told me he wanted to take another tab and would buy the last tab off me! I felt great. Now I had money for some grub during the week AND another partner to trip with for the next few hours. Bad trip phase was really over. 

After staring and discussing the stars for 40 minutes we all went in. Everyone had went to bed and the first friend I saw began to sober up. He was really tired and hit the hay. I was left alone in the living room with my friend, and both of us began to trip extremely hard from our new tabs. EVERYTHING was changing. The walls were shifting radically, the chandelier was constantly morphing into some psychedelic multi coloured pyramid with an eye on top and when we both looked at each others faces for just 2 seconds they would morph radically, REALLY radically. Anything from 8 eyed multi coloured aliens to native Indians to pirates. Typical LSD stuff, but it really is completely mind blowing when you experience it. Could we BE any higher? We laughed about it, and just sat in the living room listening to psychedelic music for 3 hours, chain smoking, enjoying the visual effects. Then the sun came up.

We had an excellent but cliché idea. Lets go sun worshipping. We stepped out into the chill Irish morning air of 8am and stood in complete awe at the sun. Now Im not really the guy that gets amazed by nature, but this was beautiful. The sun was radiating so many colours. It was purple, with a blue outline, giving out green, red, orange, yellow, pink, every type of colour rays. The clouds were full of colours too. The whole sky just revolved around this huge bright psychedelic sun. I saw faces, animals, people in the clouds. Swirling colours, birds flying and yes, again, this huge bright psychedelic sun. I cannot describe in mere words the stunning beauty of this sun. It is something you must go and see yourself. I think we just sat down and stared at it for 2 hours (then our eyes began to hurt ) and went back inside. The drug started to wear off, we had minor visuals but still had an LSD mindset.

I felt complete, tranquil. I went to an empty room of my friends (gone away for the weekend)  and switched on the laptop. I went onto my facebook for some bizarre reason (not something Id bother doing on psychedelic drugs) and saw an angry, disappointed comment from my girlfriend. My mind fell apart. I felt angry, confused, and sad. This is it I said. Im going to solve everything. I wrote her a huge message, telling her how Im just a human, I can never be perfect, but despite my flaws I do my best to make her happy and I love her with all my heart. That Im sorry for everything Ive done, that relationships are built on mistakes and understanding and I beg her to talk to me. I texted her from my phone telling her to come online to MSN and to check her facebook messages. She did, surprisingly, at 11am. She read my message and felt touched by it. She began to apologize too, saying how shes sorry for always criticizing me, that she knows Im just a human, but she just needs some reassurance of my love sometimes. She told me that whenever we argue, she still always loves me and never has doubts about me. She finished it by saying shell always protect and defend me.  This made me cry so much.  Knowing I had a partner whod always be there for me and who will love me. Every little doubt I had, every fear or worry I had, just went out the window. The argument which we were having, which was pretty serious, was just solved in a matter of seconds. Both of us are confident well last as long as physically possible. I really could not be happier with the result. And to think this all happened over the internet!

With that little encounter finished and her gone back to work, I realized I was extremely tired. My head was pounding, my body just exhausted and my eyesight blurry. I was still having small hallucinations, but not really tripping mentally. I remembered I took acid at 7pm yesterday and that it was now 12pm the next day along with the fact I woke up at 8am the previous day. I walked back home, lay down on my bed for and slept for 20 hours. I woke up the next day feeling super content with life. I tackled fear, saw the most amazing sunrise of my life, felt in love with the world and was completely satisfied with my relationship.

LSD is easily my favourite drug now and I really hope to take it again, in higher amounts. This was only 2 tabs spread out over a day! I can only imagine the beauty and wonders my next trip will be like.

(blotter / tab)





Its been a week and three days since I dropped LSD for the first time. Ive previously smoked salvia a few times (by far my most abstract and terrifying psychedelic experiences), tried psilocybin mushrooms once, dropped ecstasy a few times, drank one opium tea and smoked weed on and off pretty heavily over the last two years (a habit, since experimenting with more intense hallucinogens, Im beginning to lose interest in). The notoriety of acid flashbacks always intimidated me, Id always been given the impression that theyre extremely intense and could strike at any time, the safety (and sanity) of my future self, and those around me, never seemed worth the high. When I heard down the grapevine that a chemistry student from my college was getting hold of a couple of tabs I decided to investigate acid flashbacks and see how dangerous they can actually be, the fruits of my research comforted me and I decided to drop a tab the following weekend.

Although a little unfit Im generally in good health, I take no medication and there are no mental health problems in my family (as far as I am aware at least). Before trying new drugs, especially hallucinogens, I usually experience a lot of anxiety but I felt really positive about trying LSD from the moment I realised the chances of it ruining my life were slim to nought. Previous difficult experiences with drugs have taught me the value of caution and I decided to drop half a tab first and see how I felt after that. Dropped the first half at about half past 12 and pressed it firmly to the mucus membrane beneath my tongue, held it there for two or three minutes then chewed and swallowed it.

My sitter and I took a bus into my city centre and milled around while I waited to come up, I started to feel off baseline after about an hour but my impatience was getting the better of me and after an hour and a half I dropped the second tab. A trip to the local art gallery was pretty strange, we only spent about fifteen minutes in there but by the end some of the more modern abstract art was beginning to take a decidedly trippy feel. One of the unexpected effects the acid gave me was that it made my ears pop really frequently, similarly to when they do as a passenger on a plane taking off or landing. Id earlier arranged to meet some friends at a jazz gig in a student bar, so me and my sitter headed to the station to wait for our bus. 

On our way I accidentally shattered the airtight Perspex tube the tab had been sold to me in, rather than immediately discarding it I spent a while rubbing my thumbs over the serrated edges and spreading blood over my hands. It took me a while to realise what Id been doing and when my sitter noticed he persuaded me to throw the shards away before I seriously hurt myself. It was around this time (about two hours after dropping the first half) I became fully aware of the LSDs affects, my concept of shape became pretty flexible and I was noticing a lot of unusual patterns (for example the speckles on the bus stations floor tiles were forming patterns a lot like fossil shells). One of the things I found most difficult about the experience was the time dilation, seconds were genuinely stretching into minutes, although this in itself isnt much of a problem the confusion it fostered brought me close to anxiety a few times. 

After what seemed like an eternity sat waiting for our bus to depart we were on the road. The bus ride itself didnt seem especially weird, in hindsight I remember noticing quite a lot of trippy patterns and visual distortions but at the time they really didnt seem to matter at all. I think the time dilation must only come on really strongly when you stay in one environment for a while, because I spent the bus journey staring out of the window at the different streets and we were at the bar in no time. Id been there two or three times previously so it was an environment I was fairly familiar with. When we entered we unexpectedly bumped into two kids I know from college (C and J, for convenience) so we pulled up chairs and sat with them whilst the band played.

I cant remember much of what the bands set was like, the few times I concentrated on them I found their music really positive and uplifting. Disappointingly I experienced no visual synaesthesia although changes in tempo and intensity had a definite affect on my perception of temperature. Over the next few hours (about three to five hours after dropping the first half) the time dilation reached its peak and I began to feel very comfortable, at this point I was already glad of the experience but was beginning to feel like I wanted to come down. The dragging time was making me impatiently text my friends to find out how long theyd be, texting took a look of concentration but the messages were far more legible than ones sent drunkenly.

As the acid was peaking I felt really fidgety and started shredding placemats into ridiculously small pieces whilst rocking my legs quickly under the table. I had the feeling of energy running underneath by skin, all over my body. Its hard to describe properly, the closest I can get is to imagine the bubbles in boiling water over your entire body. My friend H arrived during the peak and stayed for about half an hour, she was wearing a leopard-print coat which I amused myself with for a while, watching the spots rearrange themselves into feline faces. Although my general perceptiveness was reduced I felt a lot more perceptive about peoples emotional states but the time dilation was making conversation a disorientating experience, I had to keep asking if I was speaking too much/not enough. Eventually, a couple of hours late, my friends V and B arrived and we were able to head back into the city centre for the days main attraction: the citys Christmas lights display.

Our departure was delayed for a while because I was beginning to feel really rooted to the bar and afraid of what we might encounter if we left. I cant remember if I reasoned myself out of this or was talked out of it, but eventually we set off on foot. Although the dark made me a little apprehensive at first but once we were outside the cool air and lights on the wet concrete overwhelmed me with euphoria. Walking felt absolutely effortless, as if I was being carried around by a conveyor belt and colours, rather than being cartoonishly exaggerated as portrayed in the media, instead just seemed much more intense. It felt as if I was seeing colour with clarity for the first time, shapes and patterns (existing ones, not just my hallucinations) also seemed to have real significance. My most powerful ecstasy experience doesnt even come close to the absolute peace and euphoria I had wandering those wet streets but although not as intense ecstasy is at least stable. LSDs volatility ensured the bliss way to be short lived.

On the way into town we stopped by at a Tescos, I cant remember exactly why, presumably for food. The shop was crawling with police (looking back I may have just hallucinated some of them, Im sure there were definitely three but at the time everyone inside looked in uniform). Every authority figures eyes bored into me, every corner I turned revealed yet more cops. I darent risk leaving the shop in case they corned me alone so I followed my sitter around the shop. He was talking quite a lot and concentrating on his voice as we wandered about the shops confusing layout helped me focus my attention. We were finished and back on the street within minutes but the experience was nevertheless taxing, my euphoria was totally vanished and the streets assumed a new hostility. After talking to my friends for a while and watching the reflections of the streetlights in puddles I began to feel more comfortable again, looking ahead I realised we were close to the city centre.

We entered the city centre through the back of the newest shopping centre, a towering, well-lit glass structure. The combination of the lights and glass looked staggering and heralded the return of the euphoria, somehow even more intense than that experienced earlier. My friends assured me that the citys Christmas lights were overwhelmingly disappointing but at the time I was convinced Id never seen anything more sublime. The auras around each bulb dissected into elaborate and radiant rainbow light spectrums. My friends complained of hunger and busied themselves with staring through shop windows whilst I staggered, open-mouthed down each street gazing above me. I was struck by how easily my friends allowed cynicism or physical/material distractions to divert their attention from such a profound pleasure. When I tried to explain this to them they seemed totally unconvinced and after a while of nonsensical rambling I eventually gave up trying to expand their consciousness. Although I would have happily wandered the streets for hours more, my friends decided they wanted to leave so we returned to the bus station. As walk walked I realised my cheeks were stained with tears.

The bus station was busy when we arrived, full of loud young people. My patience with gobshites is short at the best of times, in that frame of mind their raucous was eliciting a combination of dread and frustration. Time dilation, my frustratingly constant companion through the day, returned at this point and the wait for our bus dragged badly. At the point it was about six or seven hours since Id dropped the first half and the effects were noticeably tapering off, although for a while passers-bys faces looked a lot like the android Kryton from Red Dwarf. Eventually V and Bs bus arrived and me and my sitter went and caught a bus to his house.

Although the patterned seats were being a bit mischievous the bus ride wasnt too bizarre, once again because I think I had a lot to concentrate on. Peering out of the front window of the bus just before we got off was fun, I felt like a passenger on a space ship. By the time we got back to the sitters house the visual effects were all but gone, I just had to wait out the comedown and try and get some sleep. We sat and read old issues of Vice Magazine until about 1 in the morning when I eventually decided to go home. I felt incapable of sleep so I sat on my computer for a while and then tried reading. I picked up Dead Souls by Gogol at first but that proved too difficult to concentrate on so I changed to Nineteen Eighty Four and leafed through that till I fell asleep at around 6 in the morning. I woke up two hours later not feeling too bad, although I resented having to get up for college.

Date and Time: It was the weekend of Halloween, and Devils Night (the night before Halloween) to be more exact. It was Monday, October 30th, 2006.

Long-term Background: I was attending Bridgewater College for my first semester. It was midway through, and I was absolutely annoyed with life on that campus. I sought a way out of it wherever and whenever I could. Drugs and alcohol become the easiest means of escape, and that is mostly what those chemicals were used for, like one who prays once to some god and expects all of his or her problems to be instantly solved, at least for some time. 

I had experimented with various substances up to the point of LSD, including hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, zycam, psilocybin mushrooms, marijuana, hashish, xanax, cyclobenzaprine, seroquel (taken ignorantly), and dextrostat. The use of those drugs was spread out over the period of a year. The most recent experience I had prior to my LSD experience was the mushroom experience, which was amazing, and which will be mentioned in another post. I used mushrooms about a month before LSD AT MOST.

My girlfriends birthday was to be taking place on Halloween, the day after my LSD experience. She made me paranoid about using because she hated drugs of all kinds, and she hated when I used them in particular. She had threatened to end our relationship prematurely on several occasions when she discovered my mere monthly marijuana use. This may have attributed to the negative after effects of this LSD trip which I am going to discuss. I attained the substance through a guy for a very fair price, and even having the substance on me made me rather paranoid, because I knew if my mother or father or anyone outside my sphere of trust discovered my possession of it, they would destroy it. So, there was a great deal of fear revolving around the substance the entire time I had it, as well as wonder that I even had it in the first place. Attaining it was very easy, and yet finding the time and place to use it was very difficult. I locked it in a safe, and hid the safe in a closet. I couldve sworn I would return to my dorm room one day to find an officer waiting there to handcuff me and put me away forever. 

Short-term Background: I was in Waynesboro, VA, which is where the trip took place. I was alone in my room. My mother and father had drifted off to sleep, and I had the house to myself. Unlike most other experiences, I had no purpose for this trip. I was anxious to experience it, but without a purpose, I feel the resulting lack of focus and chaos attributed to the anxiety I later experienced. 

10:00 PM. I put a hit in my mouth. I waited.

10:10 PM. I could not recall how long LSD took to react with the mind, so I put anther hit in my mouth. I was beginning to fear I was sold something inactive. 

10:15 PM. Since I had three more hits left, I decided to throw one more in just to seal the deal, and be done. If nothing happened, I thought to myself, nothing happened. If something does happen, it will be very pronounced. I licked some whitish powder which was at the bottom of the bag thinking it was pure LSD. I believe it was actually cocaine, as my tongue went slightly numb. I walked down the hall to the room in which my computer was humming to itself, basically waiting for me to hop onto erowid and look up LSD experiences.

10:30-11:00 PM. I still didnt feel anything pronounced. I was reading that LSD could take up to an hour and a half to react, so I grew more patient. I started to read peoples reports, some of which were negative, which was probably a bad idea given the circumstances. I began thinking to myself Well, there is no way back now. I must ride this wave back to the shore. I printed off a pornographic image to see how LSD effected ones perceptions of sex and sexuality. After attempting to jack off, I realized how uninteresting the image was, as well as the premise of sex itself. Pornography had always repulsed me unless I was aroused prior to looking at it. I was becoming a bit drowsy. Hmmm, I thought I should probably leave. I dont want to wake my parents up if I start making odd noises or knocking things about. 

11:00-11:30 I began my quest walking about Waynesboro. I called my brother and told him of my predicament. He laughed, and said Well, have fun ____, and dont laugh too hard! I felt very childlike, which was nice. I was full of wonder, and could not easily recognize things. I would look at a trashcan and notice the top, which i could set something on, or the sides, which I could use as walls. I did not see it as something to merely put trash in. I walked down a street known as Woodrow, which I thought would be pretty. It was mostly frightening. The shadows seemed to know of my mental state and picked on me by taking the forms of dark, cartoonish monsters. Although the street is named after the president, it could easily be mistaken as being named for the row of trees planted on the sides of the road. The trees themselves were beautiful when I looked up at the sky through theyre branches. Those were my limbs, and I was reaching skyward.

11:30-12:00 I called my roommate. I was very paranoid. It was late, and if any of you are familiar with Waynesboro, there is nothing there to do after around 9 except go to Wal-Mart. Occasionally a car would pass, and occasionally I would hallucinate the sound of a car coming up behind me. There was no one out but me. The entire town was dead, and it felt awful to experience it as such. I was so lonely. I was constantly turning around. I recalled a time 2 years previous in which 5 cop cars in a row traveled down the curvy Wayne Avenue hill during one of my early morning outings. I was not 18 when I had seen those cars, and was subjected to curfew laws if discovered to be a juvenile out after 12. I feared the same thing would happen, and this time they would mistake me for a juvenile only to discover I was 18 (an adult who can be punished as such) AND under the influence of LSD, with two hits remaining on my person. I really did not want any contact with the police at that point. My roommate helped me keep my head. 

12:30-1:00- I made it to the post office, and realized how close I was to the police station. The sidewalk tiles began to lift up and spin about under my feet, which obviously made it very difficult to maintain my composure. I believe I did quite well, considering. I took a side road, and walked through some residential neighborhoods, and remarked something like Man, this whole town is dead. The dreams of these people are only found in sleep! They would be repulsed to know my condition, and yet they will be very intimate with me in the grave! The grave is not something terrible, but a union, a negation of hatred and love which forms neutrality and sameness. Then I sat down. The sky and the earth became a sphere, the shape all things attempt to maintain. The stars were swarming about in the sky like bees, and I felt as though they were producing the sweet, honey-like sense of well-being I was experiencing. 

And then I realized I was lying on someones front lawn, became extremely paranoid, and ran down the street. Motion interrupted all of the visuals, I realized. Sitting down was a terrible idea if I didnt want to look suspicious, because the experience became VERY heavy when I did (the next time I use anything, I will be stationary for the majority of the time, or moving only slightly). I eventually made my way back to the curvy Wayne Avenue hill. Upon passing the YMCA and crossing the bridge, I began to fear I would jump or fall off, so I walked very slowly. I cannot image what I looked like walking about under the influence. My limbs felt absolutely EXHAUSTED. I dont know whether this is common, but I experienced a similar lethargy with mushrooms (although the mushroom lethargy also granted EXTREME euphoria). This lethargy felt more like my muscles were shaking and losing strength than being actually tired. I was slightly trembling, and sweating a bit. I definitely wanted to sit down. I was more coherent than when I use marijuana, and far more coherent than when I used mushrooms, but I felt as though I was imagining my ability to rationalize and speak, when in reality, I believe I was speaking and thinking like a lunatic. I felt as though I was imagining everything, which was a sentiment which stayed with me for nearly a year. Before making it back to my house, I felt as though a little white man, reminiscent of the little white man with sharp teeth in the album art of Future Sound of Londons Dead Cities CD, was right behind me, peering over my shoulder with a smile. I could feel his nails on me, and no matter which direction I turned, he was always behind me. This terrified me, and resulted in another phone call to my roommate. 

1:00-2:00 AM: I made it home. I got into my car and became afraid I would try to drive it. I made sure not turn the engine on. I listened to some Smashing Pumpkins and closed my eyes. I was afraid I would hallucinate something hideous outside my car, but I did not. Instead, I saw every word Mr. Corgan sang in the very center of my mind, and expanding out millions upon millions of times, infinitely. The word car showed me the image of every car I had ever seen, coupled with every car I could imagine. Of course, I did not see them all, because to see the entirety of the infinite is impossible, but I saw as many as I could see while the words filled my mind. Every word, including words like and that lesser hi, had sensory richness associated with them. Eventually, I realized I should call my friend while she was preparing to go on lunch with my best friend (who didnt have a cell) so that they could pick me up.

2:00-3:00 AM I was picked up by my friends. My best friend (male) drove me and my other friend (female) to his house. When we arrived, he told me not to make any crazy noises. I didnt. In fact, I communicated very little with them. I mostly had conversations with them in my head, and I could never tell when we were really talking or not (my male friend later told me much of what I thought I talked about with him was never even mentioned). There was a very large knife in his kitchen. In my mind, I asked him Do you mind if I pick up this Knife? and he said No, be my guest. And I said Given my current mental state, you do not feel any regret in saying that? and he said No, why should I? and then I said out loud Because you just sealed your own doom! and laughed. He said this made him very uncomfortable, and he left the room for a moment. I held the knife. It felt nice to grip in my hand, and I didnt want to let it go. I felt the power associated with wielding a weapon. I held the knife in front of my face and looked at my friends. It seemed we were in a bad horror movie, and I was the horror. I thought my role to play would be to use the knife on them, but then I realized how bad of an idea that was, and how much I loved them both, and how my mental state did not accommodate friedns and knives equally (try to keep weapons out of the trip). I set the knife down, and went into my best friends room, where I proceeded to crawl under the covers and discuss how much it felt as though I was in a cave made of mystical water. I was swimming in his blankets. 

After a while, he told me it was time to go. The light in his house demolished my eyes, so I wasnt too unwilling. I just didnt want them to leave me alone! I missed them both beyond understanding, and yet they were right there in front of me. I was predicting their departure, and my future loneliness.

3:00-5:30 AM (Trip ended by sleep around 5:30) I made it inside, and walked down the hall to my room. Everything was very large. I crawled into bed and listened to the Smashing Pumpkins some more. Billy was in my bed, naked and singing to me, which was soothing. I felt intimately bound with my mental perception of the man. And then I heard a noise from the intro of one of the songs which made me think of a huge wall of old fat womens heads, gnawing at their fingers. These heads had black eyes, curlers in their hair, very red lipstick on, and fat faces. They were biting their fingernails, which were also very red, and grunting. They seemed to look through me. I could not tell whether the red was cosmetic or blood. Needless to say, I became paralyzed by fear. Then I changed the song, and my peace returned within 30 seconds. I remembered that I wanted to experience masturbation under the influence, and so I jacked off. It was very difficult to attain an erection, but the orgasm was supreme. I seemed to be stuck in the peak moment of my sexual arousal for about 2 minutes! WOW, I frantically texted to my female friend, Orgasms are AMAZING on this, although it is very difficult to attain one! (She used my remaining two hits the next day, and said she tried very hard, but could not reach climax, which was a vast disappointment to her, given my reaction to climax under the influence). Falling asleep was difficult. My mental image of myself kept conversing with my actual consciousness. I learned from this that I am a very annoying, inconsiderate person to myself when I am trying to sleep! I was yelling, and telling myself not to fall asleep, because I didnt want to be bored awake without myself. And then I fell asleep, much to my imagined self's dismay :p.

AFTER EFFECTS: The after effects of this experience, an experience which would otherwise be rated as mediocre and fairly meaningless, are what caused it to be rated as a bad trip. I felt paranoid for a full year about whether or not I was changed forever. I eventually realized, a year later, that all the paranoia was nothing more than fantasy, or a theory which, like most philosophic theories, cannot be proved or disproved, only entertained. I decided to stop entertaining the idea of me being somewhat insane, and the effects went away within a month! After all, even if I WAS insane, I was still very happy, and very much able to function in every day situations without difficulty. Oh, and this insecurity manifested primarily at night, or when I was fatigued, so it might just be that my expectation of a permanent change was attributed to something with no relation to LSD, such as mental fatigue, and therefore LSD didnt change me at all. However, the fact that I was so insecure about my state of consciousness has made me wary of LSD. Using LSD CAN AND WILL make known whatever is in your recent memory and current subconscious, so it is a relatively bad idea to use it without a purpose during a time when life is not very good (as I did), or in a place which is not very suitable (as I did). Having a purpose can make the experience much more rewarding. I will probably use it again at some point, but for now, Id much rather stick to the psilocybin. So before you experiment, remember how serious a substance LSD is. It gives the mind much power, but that is power which it can use to destroy itself with paranoia or doubt (as I believe it did in my case), or make itself more beautiful. Remember: it really is all in your head...

Background:
I'm a 19 year old university student in North America. I consider myself moderately experienced with psychoactives, with a handful of adventures with mushrooms, LSA, and LSD under my belt. I've had dosages of up to 4 grams, 10 grams, and 2 hits respectively. I've also dabbled in other psychs such as 4-AcO-DMT and diphenhydramine, not that I can recommend the latter to anyone. I'm not on any medication currently and consider myself an introverted but open person. This trip took place on the weekend before my final exams, on a cold but pleasant winter night.

I went into this trip having no obligations or worries to deal with. My reason for choosing one hit of LSD instead of doing the typical increase in dosage was based on all my previous trip experiences combined. For me, the best part of tripping lies in the wonderful emotions I find myself subject to, not the visuals. I was curious to see if I could elicit these same feelings from one hit, saving money and hopefully allowing for an easier integration of highly social environments. Living in a dormitory is not the same as being alone on a mountain.

Takeoff: 6:10pm
I eat one geltab of LSD from a trusted source who I have had prior transactions with.  The only food in my stomach at the time was a moderate lunch of pasta and cottage cheese @ 2:45. I put on the album Come With Us by The Chemical Brothers while I took hits of some cannabis out of a vaporizer, preparing for the coming novelties. I started off in my dorm room, with the lights dimmed as I read and waited out the come-up.

About thirty minutes after eating the acid I noticed some time dilation, and light feelings of anxiety started to come out. I had always tripped with a partner in the past and I was excited at the possibilities that were in front of me, though this also made me nervous. After reminding myself about how I was only going to be on a light trip this particular evening, I was calmer and ready to begin.  

T+ 1:00
About an hour after I had dosed, I decided to take a lengthy walk. As I got dressed for the cold weather outside, the wood grain on my closet door began to dance about.  Wood grain is a foolproof illusion-initiator and it made me glad for the familiar sight.  Exiting the building, I ran into a friend of mine who commented on the grin I was wearing and wished me a good trip. I tried to think of where I should go, and remembering a great bike-path route that followed alongside a highway before curving back towards campus,  coming to the conclusion that there would be no better peak to my trip than by myself in nature. While on my walk, I became very appreciative of the increased sensitivity to light that I was receiving. The way shadows and beams emitted from streetlights play with each other when under the influence of psychs has always been one of my favorite little marvels, and during the nighttime in winter the refractions of light hitting falling snowflakes and ice on the ground is even more pleasing. The clear night sky gave a wonderful display of constellations that shimmered on a backdrop of blacks and blues.

As I made my way parallel to the highway, memories of taking walks through forested evenings with my family as a youngster came back to me. It's true, I realized, that the things I enjoyed most sober were the things I enjoyed most when tripping.  At this point in time I was close to the peak of my trip and was taking in all of the stimuli through my heightened sense of vision, but what came to me next was probably the most important thing that the trip brought with it.  I had returned to the feeling of gratitude and wonder that I had gotten a taste of on my last mushroom trip. I reveled in just being able to witness Earth's splendor in its accentuated state that I had chosen to employ for the night. It took me less than two hours to find what I was seeking:  the simple euphoria and joy of being that you don't need a heroic dose to achieve. Ecstatic in my discovery that one hit of acid was providing me with as much happiness as another other psychedelic experience had ever given me, I noticed that the glow of car headlights coming up behind me on the road would pulsate behind me, so that watching the ground around my footsteps was like watching a breathing nebula of white light. I saw a fractal overlay on some runaway clouds that were moving across my path as my walk came to an end.

T + 3:00
Upon returning to my room, I made funny faces at myself in the mirror, something I do on a daily basis just for fun. On acid it's even more fun and I chuckle at my reflection, taking care to recognize the dilated pupils that Hofmann's potion had blessed me with. Focusing on my face and ignoring the rest of what the mirror shows me, my doppleganger suddenly popped out of the mirror and I am literally face-to-face with a 3D replica of myself. I found this especially entertaining.

I come into contact with my friend T over the phone, who wishes to join me for the remainder of my voyage. I assist him in finding some mushrooms and relax with some good friends as he eats ~2g. While we hang out I notice a slight tightness in my chest, but it isn't something I'm unacquainted with and it doesn't bother me.  Approximately :45 after he finishes, our convoy of about six people--all either drunk, high, or trippingdepart to a popular local sledding hill a stone's throw away.  Through this point in time my visuals were quite subdued, although my elated mindstate was just as intoxicating as ever. I did not experience any nystagmus during my trip, but did notice a certain acuity in the dimension of everyday objects that had not been there before. I chalked it up to the notion that LSD was helping me receive reality through a less filtered template than normal and noted it as just another thing to be thankful for.  

When sledding, I seemed to have boundless energy surging through my body when faced with the task of climbing the hill for another run. Sledding is a thrill as a kid, one that doesn't go away no matter how old you get. My balance and proprioceptive abilities were not affected as they might have been had I simply been drunk, something else I found reason to be happy about.  The general mood of everyone at the hill was positive and when I wasn't chatting or flying down the slope on my stomach, I took time to watch the horizons sparkle with the various pinpricks of light that came from all the various buildings, lightposts, and cars.

T: +5:40
We make our way back to campus, satisfied with how the brief outing has gone.  I spent some time watching a television program about the planet Earth with my compatriots before remembering that even if I was not feeling hungry at the moment, I would be quite soon.  I say farewell to everyone and head downtown for a sandwich.

T: +7:00
On my walk I notice that the only real effect I had left to be dazzled by was the twinkling of lights that greeted me all the way down Main Street to the Deli.  My mood had stayed constant since the beginning and I discovered myself continuously praising whatever had created this universe in the back of my mind as I picked up my food and returned to campus.  On the way back, everything extra-sensory diminished to levels no longer perceptible.

Retrospection:
This trip, though mild in many ways, gave me a very valuable lesson in tripping. Less is more, especially when you expect to find yourself in a variety of different environments with different people and different expectations for how one is to act.  I came into contact with the Resident Advisors of my building (read: authority figures), sober adults at the sledding hill, and even the public as a whole when I was retrieving my snack during my trip. Being on only one hit made it so that there was no need to transition to 'acting normal.' I was able to integrate into these circumstances seamlessly, something that can't be done on a higher dose.  I am still interested in exploring higher doses of psychoactives, but I'm not seeing as much of a reason to as I had thought there was before. This trip was amazing to me and there was never any regret regarding my dose. It affirmed my love to be alive, which is the most I could ever ask of a trip. My opinion of LSD has gone up. Way up.

LSD (2) : Small Group (2-9) (17), Nature / Outdoors (23), General (1)




 




DOSE:
2 hits

LSD
(gel tab)





BODY WEIGHT:
220 lb





12:42

Two hits of acid, reportedly weak ones, consumed. mm, gelatinthings. They taste funny. I thought they were friggin' plastic at first! I was like... 'durrh? How's this supposed to work???' Then it dissolved.

1:05 

I'm hungry. I think I will nibble on something.

1:15

Yay! Mama's homemade rice gruel! With shreds of chicken and scallops!

1:23

Something is... off. I feel different, though I am at a loss to describe exactly how. It is as if I'm me, but I'm not me. I suppose the philosophical implications are that either I am undergoing a change in state of mind or I am undergoing a change in dimensional occupation. Somehow, I like thinking about the change in dimensional occupation. Why? Because this dimension sucks ass.

1:33

Why am I choosing these strange, non-rounded times to write my entries, now? I don't know. I'm noticing a rather definite change in the space around me and the method in which it is being processed through my head. I mean, everything's still there and where it should be, it's just the relative identification my mind has with is... drifting somewhere. Wait, that was terrible. It's... changing. Yes. No. Argh.

1:37

Motion is as it is supposed to be, but my ultimate perception of it is defying explanation. In techie terms, the end user is misreading the EULA (End User License Agreement), the lawyer defining it is a pothead, and the lawyer that wrote it is probably a crackhead. Yeah. The telephone game at its finest. 'Mm-mm good!' turns into 'O RLY?' by the time I hear the last guy say it. Besides that, my initial impressions are good. Amusing. Why bother to do something if it does not serve a purpose, yes? When the purpose is fun, it is technically devoid of meaning and, simultaneously, full of it. With that in mind, is there anything that is truly devoid of meaning? Any given action we have. Even if we consider the seemingly pointless and shallow actions of, say, Paris Hilton (may she burn forever). Is any of it truly meaningless? Purpose in purposelessness. Intriguing concept, is it not? I could probably write of this for days, but I shall not bore you.

1:55

As the effects intensify, I am forced to grin at the possible futility of logging my experience. The very basis of all of my perception is being altered in what seems to be a systematic desynchronization of interneural communication. The keyboard seems to shift with every mental waver, but it does not. My muscle memory retains its integrity, and allows me to type with barely a blink of effort. I've been noticing a mild tremor or jitteriness in just about every skeletal muscle group I know about. The last time this occurred, Ecstasy had worked on me for the first time (details later, I suppose). I would say the trembling is anticipatory, but that does not seem to be the case. Rather, it appears to be a reflexive adrenal outburst in response to an unknown (and possibly dangerous) situation. Rest assured I am fully alert, though I cannot promise the integrity of my feedback on... anything, really.

2:02

The computer screen appears to have turned a mild, but no less dazzling array of colors. The text appearing onscreen is practically meaningless. I hardly want to look at it. Far more fascinating are my fingers, which dance a song unheard of in any human land in any human tongue.

What I am appearing to experience is a complete and utter defiance of every physical law I was told was fundamentally irrefutable. Obviously, these people have never done acid in their lives.

2:08

I think I'm still making sense, but I am... not entirely sure of this anymore. I made one statement with the perception of two... states. Think Gollum from Lord of the Rings, except as a coin flipping so fast I can barely identify which side is where. Fascinating. This idea is... somehow a revelation to me. The image of a coin... It's all in my head, too...

2:15

I was completely and utterly enthralled and entertained by nothing. I spent a few minutes just laughing. I think after a few seconds, I was laughing at the fact that I was laughing. Because laughing is infectious... and I cannot deny that when someone bursts out laughing for no apparent reason, that in and of itself, is worthy of a laugh. May laughter consume our world, then!

...no. It doesn't work that way. Though I may wear a silly smile on my face, I harbor a bitterness towards mankind many people will never know, and that is probably for the better.

What upsets me is not the pointlessness of it all-- no. I already have that internal debate as to whether or not anything is truly pointless or meaningless. What upsets me about mankind is the needlessness of it. Let me say that again.

Needlessness.

Call it a vicious appraisal, call it contempt for the greater good, call it what you like... but the things that man has suffered at the hands of man... the things that animals have suffered at the hands of man...

There was never any need for it.

Never.

Needless violence. The only violence one need engage in is the violence requisite of ensuring one's own survival. Anything past that is as I've said: needless.

Beyond survival. Let's discuss that. What does that mean? It means... more than I need to do to survive. It means... I'm kinda full, but I'd like to have a little more.

The violence involved in the rise of all these great empires which we are so quick to revere is all invariably condemnable by man's own standards. Man's own standards. That's the punchline. That's the fucking punchline. All these heroes... they were born in strife and made by horror, not this brazen glory we paint them in... not these ridiculous renderings of marble, gold, and brass...

How much glory could I possibly bestow Jesus Christ in that tiny little gold necklace of mine? How much love can I possibly depict in one gesture that I would so rightfully call myself a child of God, that I truly know his intentions and can speak his mind?

2:25

...I digress. It seems I've lost myself in a little swirl of anger. Yes, that happens sometimes. Then again, I am here for the trip, so to speak. I suppose... you're all my passengers-- you being whoever is reading this, of course.

This involuntary trembling-- this shivering... it needs to stop. It's rather unnerving. I have a good idea what is causing it, though I can't say it is of much relief.

2:30

I'm noticing more and more during this experience that I am susceptible to suggestion. ...being a bitter person at heart is one thing, but bringing it up is fuelling the fire. Ha. I probably make no sense. I'm forced to laugh at myself. I'm forced to smile at the preposterous nature of all of this writing-- all of these letters all neatly lined up like they're marching into a slaughterhouse. Mmm... meat... Lots of little letter-lambs...

--what the fuck is wrong with me? Really, what is all this? Obviously, speaking as someone who is not within the experience, I would say 'dude... you're tripping. It happens.' when what I should really say is: 'Obviously, you.'

Now that's the fucking trick, isn't it? The best of comebacks are spawned by their point of origin. It makes sense, right now, I swear! You're staring at this like 'WTF, mate? Why the fuck am I still reading this bullshit?'

Why? BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE SECRETS OF THE FUCKING UNIVERSE! BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Guess what? There aren't any! Because if I know about it, it's not a fucking secret anymore, is it? But if I don't know about it, then my lack of knowledge of its existence really makes that question moot, doesn't it?

HA!

Expansion of the mind, this is... Strange (a word that has been appearing a lot), but... I lost my train of thought. Nevermind. It'll come back to me eventually. Like a snake. rar.

2:40

Oh, yes. Acid is definitely an expansion of the mind, and should be used with that purpose in-hand. Needlessly (there's that word again) 'expanding my mind' is ultimately pointless, though the fun involved in it is not. Oh, the decadence of considering needless brain-expansion for fun... It makes me want to put on a brilliant peacock-array of feathers in blue, purple, and green... and vomit.

See, that is what has been upsetting me about mankind. Needlessness. Yes, back to beating on that old, dead horse... Whatever.

Bottom.

Fragment mind.

Unsure.

Fear? Should I intentionally invoke fear? Dare I?

2:50

...Incredibly fascinating. I've found that by digging into my own head I can weave virtual realities and simulated experiences that essentially feel as real as the things I touch to send out this message.

Death. It is many of our ultimate fears. In some cultures, it is a phenomenon to be embraced. In others, such as our arguably more narcissistic and hedonistic American society, it is the ugliest of the ugly. We daren't touch it with a ten foot pole. 

As someone who's felt the movement of his hand one too many times... I find it as another unknown... another infinity to explore, much like this one, though attempting to write about it might be a little difficult once I know what it really is like.

I've dug into my own head and explored some of my fears-- darkness and what it portends. It seems silly to most, but my great issue was the simple fact that I have 'seen' shit without drugs... for years.

It doesn't help a child's natural fears of the nonexistant beasts beyond the shadows waiting for a barely noticable soul to cross by its macrocosmic path to be consumed. Am I making any sense anymore? I understand that I am not trying to, and this is all... quite hilarious... I must sound like some pretentious goth doing the basement troll thing. Rarrarr.

3:00

This is driving me MAD! I am attempting to pursue my darkness, but I am simultaneously avoiding it for fear of my life. Why? If I am my own darkness, then what is there to fear but that which one instills upon themselves? Does that theoretically mean fear is a moot point? Hmm... ... ... ... With that in mind, what need is there for any aggressive action? It all seems so ludicrous.

All these technologies we develop to kill each other. It really is enough to make me burst out laughing at the hopelessmess of it all. This computer you sit at evolved from a machine that projected the trajectory of a battleship's multi-ton explosive shell so that we humans could put it where it would do the most damage. The irony of the origins of our information superhighway.

And this journal seems to reflect such bitterness.... why? In a way, that in and of itself is pointless. The bitterness at the actions of man. I need not punish myself for foul deeds of others, yet philosophically, we all cut off our noses to spite our faces. That is-- some of us would forsake our conveniences so that we can feel better about ourselves. All these concepts... they are so ludicrous, but as humans, we are so attached to these ideas... these... models...

3:10

Fear. It produces a very distinct 'burning knot' sensation in one's chest. Confronting it feels like fire through the very heart of you. Right now, it is difficult for me to explore, since I am easily distracted. The things that would typically make me cringe--things like rotting veins of flesh on my body-- I can see them when I close my eyes... but I don't feel fear when I see them because I am aware that I am controlling them. It would be redundant to fear the product of one's own mind, but if that were the intention, would that mean I was unsuccessful? Or not entirely, as I continue to flip-flop about this like a dying fish? The images are funny-- hardly fearful.

You're probably asking, 'why fear? Why do you -want- to feel fear? Right now, of all times? Are you FUCKING NUTS?' Yeah, I guess that's your answer.

I'm trying to come up with the most terrifying means by which my existence would consume itself... but to no avail. Odd.

Is it because I want to be able to feel real fear without being in real danger? What is this human obsession with being close to that? Because we can barely touch it, perhaps....

...

...

I might be thinking too much...

...Oh my god it hasn't been ten minutes.

Revelation two seconds into pissing:

Remember, the key is to embrace my mind rather than eviscerate it.

6:39

I know I've had a good trip when all the muscles I've used for fucking have officially been labelled 'overused'. The lovely headswimming details of which, I'm afraid, I must deprive you all... but for the record... this has been a definitively positive experience. 

Well, I suppose images of anthropomorphized drugs swimming in pools of liquid of questionable origin will have to suffice. 

Without any surprise, I must note this powerful hallucingen's near-miraculous qualities in the right hands while simultaneously remarking on the immutable truth of the following quote: 'with the ability to help comes the ability to harm'.

Anything involving the mind can be thought of as a jigsaw puzzle. All the pieces are there. I just have to pick out the pieces and arrange them myself. Just as this drug can make a mind whole again, it has the ability to completely shatter one. It doesn't really matter whether that happens by my own hands or someone else's, the potential to go in either direction is still there.

The best results come when you fuck someone you really love, during the acid trip. Thats when the nervous system is most open, most unconditioned, and ready to take a completely new imprint.
-	Timothy Leary

Background: I am a male, at the time of this experience I was 24 years old and weighed 125 pounds. I take no medications but use marijuana and yerba mate on a daily basis. My partner is female, at the time of this experience she was 19 years old and weighed 135 pounds. She takes no medications but uses yerba mate on a daily basis. Both of us are experienced with a variety of psychedelic drugs. This was one of our first and most fondly remembered acid trips together. 

The experience: The trip was off to a rocky start. Halloween, and some drunk-and-rowdy types came over to visit just minutes after the four of us had put three blotters each of Sacramental LSD under our tongues. My partner got sucked downstairs, into a whirlwind of thrashing guitars and bongos played, without much rhythm. My roommate Star and I winced at the percussion, saying I think Im staying up here, man! Star and a friend who wasnt on acid were deep into discussion about art. The acid was beginning to kick in, gently, slowly. Sitting on the deck, I admired the wispy clouds blowing over the night sky, and watched the other two smoke. Its funny, thinking about how much time Ive spent hanging out with smokers waiting for them to get their fix. I like not smoking. If I get cold before the ciggie is finished, then I can go inside!

I donned my white labcoat, and ventured downstairs. There was something comforting and familiar about the garment. Stained yellow and brown pockets, but otherwise crisp and white. Just wearing it provokes me to think within a scientific framework. Suddenly, Im not just getting a snack from the kitchen. Now I am performing a perceptual test, in cutting an apple whilst ignoring the low-vibration drunks. I wander around the house, feeding slices of apple to people. Control group: People not on LSD! How would you describe this apple? My control group told me is was sour, and crisp. Those subjects on LSD were in agreement, though perhaps perceiving the taste of the apple more vividly. Our senses had been heightened by the drug.

Stars room is high-energy. Brightly lit and warm, dominated by earthy red tones, playing rock music at high volume, filled with intense crystals and involving conversation. I found myself jittery and anxious, not being in my comfort space. Retreat! Retreat to my own room which is the antithesis of Stars. Calm, cool and dimly lit with a salt lamp (AKA psychedelic-safe light). I flopped on the bed with the requisite fuzzy blue blanket. Ahh, thats better! My partner came up and joined me.

With LSD I find it is easy to be distracted by worldly things and stay on the surface of the experience. If I had chosen, like Star, to involve myself in conversation and other normal activities too much, it would be easy to ignore the effects of the drug. I have programmed myself so well that, for instance, I can go down to breakfast whilst coming up on eight hits of acid, and no one will even notice! The breakfast program still runs smoothly, no matter how high I am. In such a case, the trip becomes about having attention placed on our conditions reflexes and responses. High on acid, and watching the program run. As long as I am clear with my intent, everyday words and actions can be carried out as usual. Though it can be hard to maintain, and not burst into giggles at the hilarity of the situation.

Instead of getting involved in wordly things like Star, I was sitting with chill ambient music, in dim lighting, paying attention to what I was experiencing. Sitting close with my partner and feeling the psychedelic shift. The experience changed; I was no longer the water-strider rippling the ponds surface. No, a big trout came up from the depths and snatched me. I was pulled down, immersed now fully in the experience. To me, this is a difference between mushrooms and LSD. An eigth of mushrooms will always immerse me fully into the experience. With LSD, I have to choose to engage, and give the drug something to work with. Thats when it becomes deep. My partner and I sat facing with legs around each other, forehead to forehead. Third eye lined up with third eye. Consciously choosing to open, and let the energy flow. I chose to open my mind fully and unconditionally to hers. There are no barriers between us. We started to cycle energy, pulling it up through the core and flowing back-and-forth from eye to eye. Up and out through the crown, then back down to be recycled, grounded and pulled up once again. A vortex spiralling up through us, a bio-electromagnetic energy field surrounding us and pushing at the edges of the room. 

The door was open, and whenever someone would walk by or speak from outside I would feel and see in my minds eye a protective network of energy sparkling in front of the door. It is all about vibrations, the vibrations we choose to pay attention to. Vibrations from outside were nothing more than distractions, to be dampened and then ignored. It was our own shared vibration that was being amplified. I pondered what it would be like, to sit this way for six or eight hours in a chaotic environment, focussing ones attention on nothing but the other person. Not letting your attention flicker from that connection to the other, not even for a second. Now that would be a profound exercise in trust, dedication and love.

There came a point of openness where I could touch her essence directly with mine. Her mind, her soul, her spiritual light body... Her essence was earthy, dark and animalistic. Moving with a fluid motion, like a young colt or water acting within earth. Like a school of fish, capable of evaporating and fleeing with speed, should she be startled. Her essence was simultaneously shy and warmly welcoming, half drawing away then opening back up again invitingly. She was touching my own essence, gently, gently. It was beautiful. I realized that this is the level on which I interact with various DMT entities. When seeing the essence of an entity, nothing can be hidden. The energetics of that person, warm and welcoming or tricky and malevolent, is immediately obvious. Id never before touched another humans essence, this was new territory.

You are beautiful, on all levels, and no matter which way I take you apart! I say.

Yes, and you are beautiful too! She replied.

Even on a cellular level, each cell has a DNA blueprint to make you, and it is perfect, and it is beautiful... Touching her essence made me think about what it is like when other beings touch my essence. I, too, was one of these tricky human things. You never know what you are going to get, with a human essence. So animalistic, tricky and shifty like animals can be. Trained to have instinctive and sometimes dangerous reactions. Some of us are so open and loving, others are quite the opposite. Be cautious, when interacting with humans on the energetic plane!

Different sensations about my partner flooded me. I felt a strong water aspect. Deep blue waves of the ocean, lapping against grey rocky islands covered in green trees. A heron, standing in the shallows to fish. The heron (earth) acting within the waves (water). The way she moves her body, precisely and delicately, is like a heron. Turn the heron inside out and you get the colt, the essence, the spiritual energy body. Flowing water, acting within earth. As below, so above. Water and earth, earth and water, working together. Grounded but surrendering to the flow of life.

The two of us exploded outwards. No longer confined to our bodies, now the body was just a central point, one where we localized or focused our consciousness. Our edges ran far out, the lotus petals blooming and unfolding far beyond the edges of the house. We had become expansive. Now we lay, with me on top of her, so that all our chakra centres were in alignment. Our total mind-body organisms were synching up, on all levels. I felt myself opening up to every aspect of our relation to each other. To the totality of what we experience together and teach each other. In my minds eye I saw a channel from head-to-toe through my body, being filled with green glowing light as we continued the energetic exchange.

Would you like to make love? I ask her.

I would love to make love! Came the enthusiastic reply. We shut the door, shed our clothes. Align our bodies and chakras again. A little foreplay, feeling the energy flow very distinctly. Feeling her response vividly, with each touch of my fingers. We are as one. One plus one, makes one... but with the power of three. Magic. She is tight as I push, penetrating... a little cry escapes us both.

We made love differently than ever before. Neither feels towards the normal back-and-forth of penis in vagina. No. My lingam pushes deeper, seeking inwards. Feeling clearly each shift of her yonis smooth muscle tissue. In this state of heightened awareness, my partner feels vividly all the muscles in her body. She moves her legs in rhythmic stretching patterns, causing cycles and patterns of pressure applied to my penis. The energy between us continues to build, and build. I guess this is what tantra is about. Sacred love. Experiencing the divine by raising the vibration between us.

Fondly beseeching, my
Mouth murmured worship
Breath, heavy. Skin, fire.
Please,
Spread her labia open.
Half perilous penis deeply
Closetted herein pink vagina.
Let me come in your naked ecstasy!

Eventually our tantric acrobatics stimulated me to orgasm. So intertwined within her that she feels every pulse just as clearly as I do. Release, release, release! In the quiet moments after I open my eyes. Everything is covered in buzzing fractal patternings now, whereas before my visuals had been very light. No wonder, though! That kind of sexual release had blown me wide open. I was very, very aware of the energy flow and expression in everything. Now lying cuddled up, there was a curious feeling in my mind. My mind was like a blank slate, I had turned off the usual internal chatter. My mind was silent and empty of thoughts, open to whatever would impinge on it. My attention seemed to focus on a distant point past everything I could see. I didnt look at things, as much as I looked through them. Focussing past the material surface, to the essence. I began to get a few thoughts, information that seemed to come from nowhere in particular, but which felt extremely vivid and real to me. Archetypical information which held a feeling of trueness. Thinking a lot about jaguars. I saw the soft footfalls of the cat stalking through the jungle, and heard the moist, breathy growl of its voice. I saw the pyramid at Teotihuacan, vividly as though I had lived during ancient times.

I remember as a child vacationing with my parents. While visiting Teotihuacan, we were walking up some stairs inside one of the buildings, and I knew before I got there that I would see a golden jaguar statue at the top. I was having a serious déjà vu, though too young to know what it was. When we got to the top everything was as I remembered, except that the jaguars eyes did not glow a fiery-red as in my vision. The jaguar again. The jaguar was here at Teotihuacan. I embodied the jaguar. Holding my partner close, I felt my arms covered with spotted yellow and black fur. I became the jaguar. The jaguar was the totem animal of shamans. It was a role I could choose to take on. The jaguar. Woah. Woah. My monkey mind screamed in confusion, afraid of the implications. 

My partner feels the fear go through me, my body becoming rigid. There is a scared look in my eye. I try my best to explain what I am experiencing and downloading. Having indulged in fear, I am now shut out of the experience. There are no more cosmic downloads or past life regressions after this point in the trip. When my mind recoiled from what I was seeing, in shock and horror, meant that I had seen all I was ready to accept tonight. All I can do is accept these kind of experiences at face value. I dont have to believe that what I saw was true or real, but I have to at least accept that I had the experience. Ive tried denying experiences before, and it was very distressful. The monkey mind does not like having the rug pulled from under its feet.

The rest of the trip was smooth and comfortable. We lay together, talking openly and enjoying as the acid began to come down. It was a very contented and clear-headed state, in contrast to our last experience which was a combination of LSD (at a lower dose) and MDMA. Taking the LSD on its own was a much less frenzied and chaotic experience. More focussed, more aware. Less sensual surface, more deep energetic connection. We smoked a little joint to soften the edges. We exchanged massages and made love a couple more times, as couples are wont to do. Using the same techniques as last time, deep tantric muscle movements rather than the old innie-outie.

Around five in the morning... fully satisfied but still tripping and unable to sleep. We arose and reconnected with our roommates. The drunk-and-rowdy types were gone. I had my intention set on making everybody a nice strong cup of yerba mate, and some oatmeal with superfoods (gogi berries, blueberries, raw almonds, raw mulberries, maca flour, raw cacao nibs) and a little cane sugar to taste. It is a meal that is quite easy to digest and bland, but not too bland. Nothing that would offend the psychedelic and up-all-night mentality. Food with a high amount of nutrients, vitamins and minerals, antioxidants and so on.

Despite the yerba mate, cacao and whatnot, I was very sleepy after breakfast. I went to bed and my partner joined me soon after. I had very vivid and interesting dreams that night. I cant remember the details, but in the dream world I ate another three hits of acid. Actually one blotter fell into my mouth, accidentally somehow, and then we consciously chose to eat the second two. In my dream-land, those tabs of LSD seemed to get me high, too!

Tim Leary cautioned that one should choose a partner carefully if one is going to make love with them while high on LSD. You cant just go out to the bar, pick someone up, and expect to have a good experience taking LSD and making love with them. The nervous system under LSD is opened up so much, it is important to me to feel a real loving connection there. What can be experienced then is the essence of tantra, feeling the energy flow back and forth between each other, and amplifying that sensation.

My partner wrote a poem based on her experiences of the night, which she wishes to share:

'As I sit silent, away from you, you come into my mind. Caressing me gently with your limitless body. Stroking my heart with soft sand, holding my hand. Unwinding my mind, intertwining to the divine, into the forest we slip, deep, dark, unknown guided by light, you gently lead me to the unfolding lotus. Kissing me with blue petals of love. 

I open my eyes as your mouth passionately bites my neck, taking me up the tree of life, tall and strong. I grip to stay hold but loose all tension making the dark forest fractal with light. Fairies and elves begin to play games, passing me around as if I were a dancing pixie. Filling the sky with magical loving hearts, exploding rainbows full of life. Passion bites again gripping me higher and higher up the tree of life, as I see above and beyond everything. 

I fall limitlessly into bliss, soft luscious lips kiss as I bite to see if its all real. Something solid comes into my mind, an eye. Complex and divine, which line should I follow down into your mind, it glides like ice into a crystal cave, reflecting only light, sparkles, beauty of the night, expressed through a once solid object. But soon all boundaries had disappeared, I float through the crystal cave, unlocking the flame, healing the pain. 

I jump to see what I fall into next a misty morning where I lie on the beach moon still in reach, nothing needing to be preached. A beautiful creature, black as night, a panther, it seems to be. I breathe as it attacks me slowly and gently showing me the ocean, deep, deep, deep. I relax, it pulses and sends me wisdom in and throughout, like a quartz crystal, grounded, aware, so sure of its power. But as a panther only jumping the prey ready to take on its heat. 

Like a fire I burn, sparks flying everywhere, my hand moves to touch something soft, a body naked nothing to restrict its beauty. As I breathe, and breathe again feeling myself coming back to my body, my eyes open to a limitless beauty. I see you, as I sit silent, wide open heart, ready to bleed and let everyone see the panther that came inside me and left me open to breathe, to flow. 

Gently, softly as you touched my soul.'

Thanks for reading
Love

After a very mild and unexciting acid experience about 3 months earlier, I was not expecting anything close to what happened. I had purchased 4 tabs from a friend so that I could take more if 1 tab was not strong enough. I was supposed to meet a friend in a couple of hours and thought I had some time to kill so I found the tabs and took one. 

At first, I was watching this asinine TV show about people running into things and acting like idiots. It called Americas Funniest Videos. Normally I would leave the tv on while doing something else, but suddenly this became the funniest thing I had ever seen. I started to laugh my ass off uncontrollably at every video and could not stop even when my roomate came in. One thing that made it very uncomfortable was that I had not warned my roomates beforehand that I had taken acid and found it very difficult to explain once I was on it, so I just kept trying to avoid them, but that was very hard considering how small our apartment is. Also considering I would keep staring at them and smile which they probably found to be very creepy.

So I was watching the television show, still partly in reality, thinking that this acid must be the mild kind without any hallucinations. Then my eyes settled on the fan that was rotating. There was a light source emanating from the center and the colors became like water, swirling and melting from blue to light blue to white. I was surprised that I was hallucinating and stood up and the entire room became wavy and I felt a bit motion sick. I hobbled to the bathroom with my arms out in front of me and looked in the mirror. I could see my face and it was huge. My flesh was sort of moving around, I felt like I was in an illustration like Scanner Darkly or Waking Life. That is actually the best explanation of what everything around me turned into. I then accidently locked myself in the bathroom and did not know how to get out. I did not want to bother my roomates or freak them out so I stayed in the bathroom for what felt like an hour and thought maybe I would have to climb out the window. I tried with the doorknob again and finally it turned and I was back in the room.

In my mind, I thought I was going on a journey, which I guess I was, and started to pack my backpack with the supplies, laptop, camera, pencils, sketchbook, ipod, ipod speaker, jacket and brought it all to my bed. I spread everything out and opened my laptop and started playing Thelonius Monk. It was the most amazingly beautiful music I had ever heard. I sat on my bed and stared out the window at the condominiums across the street and it was so unexplainable beautiful and the lighting was incredible. Prior to this experience I had felt uncreative and uninspired living in New York because of the superficiality, my school, and the city, but at that moment I realized that the creativity and potential was inside me and all of us and I could find wonder in everything if I looked for it. I realize this all sounds incredibly cliche, but I felt so inspired and all these self revelations were coming to me and I was completely happy and at peace with myself and my abilities. I think I stared at the condominiums for about 5 hours. I cannot really remember my thoughts then, but I remember seeing the most beautiful lights and colors and patterns everywhere and the music was amazing. I also remember thinking that I could never go back to my old life again. That this had completely changed my life and I could never go back knowing what I knew now and thought I understood.

Then my laptop died and without music it became less pleasurable. I had also turned my phone to silent because I did not think I could handle talking to anyone. The friend I was supposed to meet had called and when I listened to the voicemail, I started to laugh happily and felt his presence with me. I had opened my window and the cold air was coming into my room, but every time I would shiver, waves of euphoria would flow through my body and I would look at the the lightshow and feel incredibly at peace and happy. Then I realized that I had my ipod with me and started playing Comets on Fire. It was the most intense music I had ever listened to. I went from Comets on Fire, to Volcano, to Velvet Underground, to Blue Cheer, to Jefferson Airplane, to the Wipers. I thought they must have all been on acid when they wrote the music, because it was just too perfect.

Time was totally random. I took it at 12 pm and the next time I checked my watch it was 5 pm and dark. The darkness totally intensified the available light. I could not get up and turn on the lights in the room, mostly because I became scared of my roomates and was afraid they would call the police for some reason. At the peak of the acid I was scared, and there was no one to console me except myself. I told myself that it was a journey and that it would eventually end, which helped. So I took out my notebook and started to draw with the light from my cellphone. I believe I did this for like 4 hours. Every pen stroke would light up and then go dark.

This made me very happy to draw. Everything I drew felt like some sort of revelation and it felt like anything was possible. I felt so sure and so capable, like I had found the inner artist in myself. I felt like I had realized my potential. I felt like I was underestimating myself previously and wondered how I could not see the wonder in everything. I remember saying to myself 'why did you not realize the blinds before? they are amazing! The highlights and the shadows alone would make a great painting! I've never realized how wonderful the blinds are!' I pretty much thought shit like this about everything including the dresser.

Every once in a while I would have to get up to go to the bathroom and it was extremely uncomfortable because I did not want to see anyone. I wanted everyone I knew to be with me and experience this new world, and was very sad that they could not see what I was seeing. I was in another universe/dimension and at some point could not distinguish between reality and the trip. I thought the trip had become reality and that I would never go back. Around 10 pm, I was tired, my eyes were tired, and the trip would not end. I sort of wanted it to end, and was uncomfortable because I had been laying in my bed for 10-11 hours at that point without food, water, or any interaction. I could not go outside because of my roomates and did not want to talk to anyone.

It ended around 3 in the morning, and I waited until my roomates were in bed and I went to the bathroom and ate some food and sat on the couch for a while. I then realized that there was writing all over my body and could not remember when or how it got there. One thing that was written was 'The laughing mocks me', I have no idea what that means. I also looked at my notebook and it looked like another person had written all over it. I finally went to sleep for about 4 hours and had to wake up at 9 to go to class. I felt totally out of it. I could not interact with anyone, and felt like I was not stable and could not hold anything. I could not really focus on anything and my eyes kept darting from one person to the next. But I felt like a different person. I was totally sure and at peace with myself. I did not wear any makeup or care, because I felt like I had transcended all of that. I realize this sounds very cliche and retarded, but I felt like I could finally see the beauty and potential of every human being. How much potential I had. How limited we all are.

I knew though that I could never do acid in my apartment again. I had to do it where there is a bigger space and a canvas set up with art supplies. I would want to do it alone I think, I do not think I could handle someone else tripping out next to me. I couldn't do it without music either. Yesterday when I was off of it, but still had some feelings left, I wanted to get back to reality, and never thought I would get back there, but now I am back in reality and I want to experience it again. I probably will do half a tab next time. LSD took me to someplace I could never conceive of and showed me how far I can push my senses. It was a really intense experience, and words can never explain what happened. I did not even try to explain it to anyone afterwards because I couldn't.

The Heart of Christmas, the Beat of the Beast That Drives Us.

It was Christmas break and I was returning home to Portland, the City of Roses. Since I was returning from Eugene, the culture shock would be nonexistent. Portland, at least the west side of the river where I grew up, is littered with coffee shops filled with ironic, sweatshirt-wearing indie rockers. Or pretend indie rockers, but it doesnt really matter. They mix with the hippies who sold out and started running more corporate businesses. Portland is a liberal colony, and I was planning on being very liberal with my pursuits.

It had been immensely boring the past week; I was growing tired of the green glow from my Xbox 360. I had been out and about with friends, but nothing interesting had happened in a long time. Of course, in my experience, when things are not interesting is when theyre great (like a day at the beach where all you do is relax and enjoy), but since I have not had a nice boring year yet, I am not accustomed to a lack of action. Yes, it would be time for sightseeing, but since I didnt need to see anything in the City it would have to be of a different nature. I made the phone call and a childhood acquaintance picked up. He was at work and he could arrange the sightseeing around 12 p.m. I was going to take substance A in hopes of gaining some insight or intuition that would allow me to make drastic changes in my life and perhaps lead to world domination, but I digress. Mere boredom was more of a primary factor than anything else.

I met the man at 12 outside his office, which was conveniently located near my house. The problem was that his supply of A was on the other side of the river. Under the cover of night, away from my parents prying skepticism, I borrowed the car and helped him grab his movie collection from his old house and finally returned home. I was feeling somewhat apprehensive about doing the substance with this individual and was wishy-washy in my intent that night. This is, of course, a great character trait, and my friend was taking it like a true champ. Under constant peer pressure assault for the entire two hours that picking up substance A took, I finally relented when my friend had imbibed it and freaked out when I told him I didnt want to join in his experience. The catch was that he freaked out in a public street and eyes were on me despite the late night hour. So I did what any rational person would do; I acquiesced his request so he would shut up and not blow our cover, the poor fool. I felt bad, and forced into a strange situation.

The restaurant I had worked at was open till 3, so we decided to go and allow the drug to kick in. Three cougars (slang for older 'horny' woman, the word changes every 10 years or so) descended upon me, so I thoughtfully reverted to childhood boyish antics. Unfortunately, this seemed to interest them even more, but finally my lack of commitment shook off the leader of the group, a completely-wasted 28 year-old blonde woman. Now was no time for sex; I was starting to lose basic functioning abilities. My ex co-workers were all veterans themselves save one; she was a rookie.

Drunks piled in and out, and I slowly began to notice that the restaurant I used to work in was filled with all sorts of terrible dark things. A plastic rat figurine creepily perched on a speaker overlooking the whole place; a clay snake with the head of Richard Nixon; a Superman figurines hanging from the ceiling with a condom taped to their backs; Wonder Woman mid-coitus with Spider-man by the bathroom; and the Queen of England with a Nazi Swastika imprinted on her face and horns added to her head above the entrance to the kitchen. My ability to speak sentences understood by human beings was slowly decaying and confused looks flashed upon my ex co-workers' faces. It didnt matter. The male ex co-worker, not the rookie, understood. The awkwardness never settled in, and in retrospect the place I worked was full of interesting people. A real stepping stone into a future career in the restaurant business if I chose to take it, but such things took a backseat to a college degree.

The night itself was not particularly interesting or unique, but I played some good guitar and enjoyed Radioheads In Rainbows in a whole new light. City of God was watched and then my friend and I parted ways.

By then it was 7 in the morning. Sleep would not come to me. My mind was racing and my desire to accomplish something while I was conscious overwhelmed me. Lyrics to an album were quickly written down and 8 tracks later it was finished. Around 9 a.m., I called my best friend and said nothing other than to meet me in Pioneer Courthouse Square. He agreed and then fell back asleep, but at that point it was too late and I was in transit to the Square. It was the heat of Christmas shopping season, and although the main effects of the drug had worn off, my new perceptive abilities hadnt changed. Under its influence, I started to notice all sorts of strange things about the people that I had filtered out before, and Portland is strange as it is. Everyone looked to be twisted in some way. Indecision, amidst the consumers flushed and in lines, deciding what to buy. The madness of the Christmas shopping was an intense sporting event for the women in packs, and the men were no different. There is a campaign called Keep Portland Weird. Im not sure how a campaign like that could ever be successful on such loosely-defined terms.

I texted my other best friend in the peak of the drug's wrath, with the incoherent demand: come Portland now kthxbai. I did not expect to see him as he lived far away and was working for UPS, which of course was very busy at the time. At the Square, I played my guitar while my fingers froze and I bitterly waited for my best friend to show up. I ran into members of my college community in various states of Christmas shopping panic. The happy marketed outlook of the holidays was stricken from the eye of every soul. A collective chaos had descended upon the citizens, presumably due to the late date; procrastinators were abundant.

A panhandler came up to me demanding to play my guitar; I looked at him, decided he posed no threat, and in the spirit of the season let him have it. He sat down and began playing Stairway to Heaven, one of my least favorite songs for reasons I cannot understand. The song fills me with a terrible sadness. The panhandlers' skill quickly deteriorated after the intro bit, which is my least favorite part, adding to my contempt. The panhandler looked at me intensely and I looked back. He gave me the guitar adding 'Do you have a hat?'

'No...wait why?!?'

'We could make some money. Here I'll go get a hat, actually come with me'

This, strangely, for an odd second, was appealing. I stood up and wiped my nose. My contact lens began attempting to remove itself from my eye and I countered its intent with unorthodox blinking. The panhandler looked at me while I struggled, waiting impatiently. He moved his arm in a 'follow me' motion, and I complied.

'Alright so first we gotta ask someone for a hat, or steal one. There's bound to be some silly Christmas hats around unattended and you could make some money with your guitar playing, and when you got tired I could play,' the panhandler reasoned.

'Uhm I don't know man. I'm just waiting here for my friend. He should be here any minute.' I began to want no part in this panhandler's design. Stealing is not something I condone, especially in the Christmas season. Making a quick buck to help score some heroin or crack was not in my Christmas plans. I glanced at the homeless panhandler's eyes. Yes he was definitely on something. I guessed an upper due to his disregard for social norms. A certain confidence exuded from his deluded state. I was sure of it.

'Come on it'll be easy. HEY! YOU Sir. The panhandler approached a stranger with a Christmas hat on, Which way is Forest Park!?' At this point I quickly left saying 'Nah man its alright, but I got to go.' The panhandler glared at me and I saw him move on to someone else as the stranger quickly removed himself from the homeless man's presence. I circled the Square just long enough to make sure the panhandler would forget about me, and returned to the amphitheatre. Bitterness began to exude from me. The idea of this season of giving and brotherhood began to take a backseat to mistrust of my fellow man. Fate had tried to warn me; my contact's loosening must have been an act of God to alert me to the panhandler's schemes. Or my still-dilated pupils. I couldn't be sure. 

A girl approached me, demanding I play in the amphitheatre, and I reasoned with her that I wasnt skilled enough and my fingers were too cold. After some small chat she wandered away only to circle around me and the rest of the amphitheatres inhabitants (one vagabond homeless man and one older woman waiting for someone) for what seemed like some time. I was pleasant with her the whole time, again testing the spirit of the season, but my pleasant polite indifference fueled her and led her to engage in conversation multiple times. But I could not be trifled with; I was on a mission; I had ideas.

What were these ideas? I couldn't be sure, but for a second I thought I had discovered some horrible truth about the situation I was in. A sleep-deprived coma became my state, but completely alert and aware, just lacking the ability to remember any of it in any real coherent sense. Two hours after the initial phone call my friend arrived. The moment I entered the car, he took one look at me and said What did you do last night? After I turned to make eye contact with him, he grinned and his question was answered. How did you know? I asked, but he merely waved his hand away and responded with Can you get more?!! Rodriguez apparently understood the desire to go sight seeing.

This delightful unexpected proposition put me into a crisis situation: Do I do it all over again, this time doubling my dose and try to make it the rest of the day, or do I thank my friend for showing up and then promptly pass out in his car? I decided to do it for scientific reasons and because living hard is something I had never really tried before. For science. I made the call and my friend was awake and we went to go meet him by my house at his new apartment. 2x was applied and 1x for my friend, and I started to think I had made a very, very bad decision. Such thoughts are not good for the mind when encountering an altered state. Happy thoughts, use with force, into existence: prime rib sandwiches, Philly cheese steaks; I was starving! I hadn't eaten in over 12 hours, or had I? I distinctly remembered breakfast with my mother with her only comment being 'Youre funnier than usual.' She had no idea.

Suddenly I got a call from my other best friend Smedly. He was coming to visit me and was already at my house. I was walking a fine line and I knew it, but no changes would occur for hopefully an hour, and maybe he wouldn't notice substance As effect. He was not the adventurous sort yet, but a yearning for the unknown was definitely there, for we would not have been best friends otherwise, I'm sure of that. Rodriguez and I were walking on our way to Subway when we encountered him. 'I need to get a present for Syd (his girlfriend of 3 years)' he explained. I recommended the chocolate shop, but first Subway. He agreed. Rodriguez said 'I'll pay for your sandwich Phil, but you have to pay me back in some other lifetime.' I considered the implications.

I was terrified.

Maybe some caffeine was necessary.

Lots of it.

Jesus. 

'Honey oat bread please'

Something had changed. The tense. The atmosphere. The Subway store.

My childhood acquaintance who had supplied this nightmare is accompanying us to Subway. He decides to take off for business purposes and Smedly becomes severely confused about his whereabouts. I try to explain to him that we couldn't be sure he existed in the first place. This explanation doesnt settle so I propose: 'He clicked his shoes and vanished back home!' This rouses a good laugh and Smedly relaxes, but he will not be denied. 'No, Seriously where did he go!!?' 'How can you be sure he was there?!!' Rodriguez supports my hypothesis and the subject is changed. It would be very difficult to prevent Smedly from knowing. So far it had been a smashing success, but the lack of sleep and the nightmarish beginning only meant one thing. The trip had begun.

I stare at my Subway sandwich with animosity that it does not deserve. I am very tired and nauseated, and feel like a balloon is trying to escape my esophagus. Smedly wants to go, and I wrap up the sandwich and take it with me. As we walk to the chocolate shop, I ask God if he would be so kind as to turn all the sidewalks into conveyor belts like at the airport. Solar power could run the damn things, with a Nazi-engineered weapon that magnifies sunlight to pinpoint the solar energy. God disagrees, and I trudge onwards slowly, feeling a descending sense of doom and despair. Rodriguez seems to be settling into the experience and is looking around every which way, while Smedly talks about some cool sound project or movie idea. However, words seem to appear in one ear and then leave my other ear straight into Rodriguezs; we cant understand Smedly, but keep up the facade for we are in the middle of a public street. It is going well as long as the gesticulations continue to deceive.

We arrive at the chocolate shop and Smedly eagerly runs inside. I follow him and the moment I walk into the store, I swallow the gum I had been chewing. The nausea escalates and I feel like I am going to die. I turn around and rush outside and sit on the chairs outside frantically looking for a trash can or coffin. Smedly, unperturbed by my mysterious fleeing, buys his girlfriend the box of chocolates he had been planning on. Rodriguez comes outside and looks at me. We both laugh.

'I think that its kicked in!' I exclaim.

'Definitely, there are some weird uneven people out.' Rodriguez replies.

'This was a bad idea man. I feel awful, definitely like I'm done for. Tired. Going to puke--maybe.'

Rodriguez looks at me with haughty insolence. This rouses a good-natured grin upon my face that washed out as the bad waves of exhaustion and nausea crashed back again, stronger and not settling for less.

'You better not die on me.' A smile spreads as a goofy higher-pitched tone emerges from Rodriguez: ' Wai-T we'll just get some CoffeE.'

'Hey guys, got Syd her gift. Why'd you leave Phil?!' Smedly says, as he exits the shop.

'I swallowed my gum, give me a second I need to rest, bad vibrations you see, ominous dry heaving could be around the corner at any se--I contained the urge to vomit, there was no trashcan close enough--just give me a minute.'

'Alright, that's fine. We'll sit here then.' Smedly sits down as does Rodriguez and they watch as people go by. Rodriguez's brow is furrowed, awash in angst and waves of worry for my wellbeing, but it could also be the terrible drug that causes this perceived commiseration. Smedly looks thoughtfully at his box of chocolates and raises his eyes up to the sky. My eyes follow his and I noticed it is very overcast, but bright nonetheless. Two stragglers, shoppers in the Christmas spree of panic, hurry by.

The first shopper says, 'What a hellish Christmas.' The second shopper replies, 'It isn't going to snow in this city and Santa won't come on his sleigh.'

Words billow up inside of me and for a second I am not sure if I am going to actually vomit all over the white table where we are sitting, or speak. 'He'll COME on the last SLEIGH FROM HELL!' I exclaim to the passing shoppers. Of course, there were no shoppers, by the time the words left my mouth, they were down the street. If they had even existed. Had I heard that?

Rodriguez looked unsettled and Smedly looked like a tabby cat that had been rubbed the wrong way. It was becoming apparent that a change in scenery was necessary, if not for my mind, but for my life to continue. I had never felt so terrible and so sleepy and yet so awake. It was very much like a lucid dream, but stuck within the confines of some nightmarish reality. Perhaps this is what those bad trips are I keep hearing about, but I remain optimistic that it would turn out, and stare blankly with no expression at Smedly while the thoughts work their way through. Smedly blinks. This is his most notable tell to the vigilant poker face inspector, who might mistakenly think Smedly is bluffing, when he merely blinks. Often.

'Hey there's a Wolf's Cameras nearby!' Smedly looks away from my blank face and up the road towards the Plaid Pantry. Sure enough a Wolf's Cameras sign is there. Rodriguez gets up and explains he is going to the Pantry for a personal mission. I stare at my right hand and find a Subway sandwich there, deciding I had all the rations I need for the day's undertaking. I follow Smedly into the camera store.

Once I step inside the store, I feel instantly less nauseated, but am overcome by the geometric patterns of the buildings lights dancing on the display case. I was in a mad house with display mirrors and odd light fixtures designed to fill my mind with panic, and the two women behind the counter did not suspect a thing. Smedly calmly states that he'd like to see a particular model of Canon camera. Confusion settles upon the women's faces, and my bemused, irritated and somewhat scared appearance forces Smedly into action as four female eyes examine me. 'I would like to see this one.' he points at the camera. 'Oh of course.' said the woman and she hands him what appears to be a thousand-plus dollar camera. Her co-worker glances at me again with a raised eyebrow and looks quizzically at Smedly who blinks again.

Suddenly I feel my left leg give out. I swoop toward the ground and recover, awkwardly driving the store's inhabitants eyes upon me. Shit. If I stand still I'm going to collapse, CURSE taking this on no sleep, Fuck the science of things. Keep the mind active or else. I could kill for a cigarette, but do not possess the motor skills. The woman was looking at me, getting nervous. I would have to start talking to assuage her fears. To calm her down. 'We're photographers, see,' I lie. 'Really,' the woman retorts a little on edge. 'I just want to check it out feel it, compare it to the camera I already own,' said Smedly, ignoring my blatant lie. He is wise in the ways of the world, but unaware of it nonetheless. I mentally thank him for getting the attention off me, but the two women's eyes came vying back filled with mistrust and loathing. We weren't there to buy anything and we weren't there to pick up the girls. To the women, we were wasted time. 'Check the flash, gamma reduction, you know Smedly the fundamentals! How does this camera compare pixel-wise to my friend here'sSmedly finishes the sentence for me with the Canon model number.

'I don't know I just open the case and sell them. I know nothing about them,' the woman explains. She is another victim of the quick hiring policies of the Christmas system of business. My attention shifts to Smedly, who has a look on his face that says this excursion is doomed. Out of the corner of my eye, a street freak was looming and had entered the shop. As he enters, a strange smell secretes through the camera shop and I fight back the dry heaves. Now there are three non-customers and the shop keeps are getting afraid. The street freak shuffles about, his rank odor giving him an aura of stench so powerful that no adjective could describe it. It was time to leave. 'The camera's NO GOOD! Shoddy shutters and the likegoodbye!' I rush outside. Smedly follows. The street freak comes out and chuckles as he walks away. The smell was bad, but the fresh outside air provides relief, a cool and rushing sensation.

'That felt very weird. That street freak who entered was sketching me out,' Smedly said, still oblivious to my mental maladies. 

'He knew too much,' I explain, but did not explain at the same time. Yes, that street freak had seemed uncomfortably keen on viewing my face. The dilated pupils must have given me away, hopefully he wouldn't perform any acts of vigilante justice on the unkempt youth today during the Christmas season.

'What!? You are making no sense Phil. The display case sure had a large number of cameras,' Smedly says as he shifts his gaze. 'Rodriguez is coming.'

Rodriguez was leaving the Pantry with a big silly grin on his face. The Cheshire cat had competition now. 'I got cigarettes,' Rodriguez proudly proclaims. 'You smoke?' Smedly asks.

'I don't know, I just bought them for today.'

'This is why you are my best friend,' I interject, overjoyed at a possible wake-me-up. 'Both of you, now please tell me one of you has a lighter.'

'Haha here you go.' Rodriguez extended the torch, a beacon of hope in a dreary nightmare. 'I never thought I'd say this, but cigarettes are saving my life today!' I exhale and a rush of wakefulness fights back the overbearing hellish feeling of doom that had previously descended upon me.

'How so?! What have you been talking about? I'm so confused. I didn't know you smoke!' Smedly shoots off rapid fire. I look at my best friend and realize that the middle of a Plaid Pantry parking lot was not the place to discuss theology of the drug user. 'Let's go to Urban Outfitters, I'll explain later.' This seems to settle Smedly for now, but there is one issue of importance before we descend into what is going to be a very packed store.

'Hey guys, one thing before we go. Do I look presentable?! My contact keeps trying to fall out my eye and my nose is runny, but I look fine right? I ask the group. Rodriguez smiles and says that I look the same as I always look. Smedly stares at me for a second and then calmly explains, 'Phil, you never look presentable.' This rouses laughter from the two fools and I shrug. There was nothing I can do for the poor bastards. If Im not looking normal and presentable at all, at any time, then it is a mystery to me as to why they would chill around me in the first place. Details though, minor details. Time to force the legs to move, look around and enjoy the Christmas spirit in a whole new light. I notice several souls in various states of Christmas stress. The stressful vibes on the common people's faces intensify as we enter the densely packed Urban Outfitters.

Gripping the large handle, I pull open the door as heat radiates from the building. My runny nose has intensified, a most unpleasant result of the dry air, but I cannot be certain. People are popping into perception. People of all ages are everywhere. A group of three moves past us, and I begin to wonder if my 'not being presentable' will become a problem. The thought is dismissed as silly and not important as we slowly move our way from the women's floor to ascend to the platform in the middle (male section) of the stairs, pushing people pleasantly aside as we climb. There is an assortment of gadgets and silly accessories like fuzzy slippers that any straight male I knew would never wear. I felt the slippers. The soft fuzzy feeling I expected quickly became disgust as I jerked my hand back. The slippers were sticky. I rubbed whatever horrible thing that had eaten my supposed softfeeling slippers on the first thing I see, a polka dotted t-shirt.

Questioning how male this stores male section is, I turn my gaze to a strange-looking book with an arch nemesis: George W. Bush, on the cover. Smedly and Rodriguez are scampering about, digging into the doodads and tacky objects like I am. We are out of our element here. It is unbearably hot. I open the book and stare at the abstract art that permeates every page. It is entrancing. For a moment that feels like a decade, my mind discerns what the repeating background art is. Che Guevara and George Bush in a compromising position. 'Hey you guys check this out, how rad is that?!' I sniffle and say. 

Smedly examines the book thoroughly and thumbs through it in half the time it took me. He then re-opens it at about the halfway point, his hands on both covers as he states, 'It's pretty cool, I guess.' At this moment Rodriguez turns his attention to the book and stares at it. His large pupils are mesmerized by the page. He looks at me. I raise my eyebrows and glance at another abstract artists interpretation of George W. doing a Nazi salute with an endless array of swastikas in the background. A horrifying truth begins attempting to correlate Hitler to George in my mind, echoing at the edge of consciousness. This book is filled with ingenious design. As Rodriguez and I cannot even take our eyes off the page, the pages turn by Smedly's hand. Another hypnotizing image consumes Rodriguez and I, as thousands of George Bushs fill the page, in a pattern similar to the four-paneled Beatles album cover. Only this time there is no musical creativity behind the picture, and what remains is an artist's ghostly ode to a completely differently-layered type of mind.

A vision then comes to me, flooding my minds eye with a future America: consumerism at its peak, large corporations raking in the cash, subduing the buyers with bigger buildings. The American dream of two cars in every house destroyed, giving way to the corporate American dream. I see four large buildings each with a neon sign taking up a four different blocks. The buildings rise into the night sky as I glance down upon them from the heavens. Wal-Mart glows in blue, K-Mart in red, Disney in black-white neon, and U.S. Government in red, white, and blue. My view from the heavens quickly returns to Newton's laws as I see my point of view fall rapidly down to the sidewalk, on the intersection of this future hell, looking in the windows as my neck cranes up looking at the bland buildings blur into the night sky.

I enter the store and a directory flashes into my mind. 'Find your healthcare needs, 4th floor. Starbucks, 1st floor second building to your right. Military, 5th floor, Women's undergarments, aisle 6.' Each building is filled with the same thing. There is no existence outside these stores. Everything you could ever want or need is within them. Apartments trapped between floors. No more real estate. Socialism, disguised under an illusion of choice. My mind ascends up the building, adjacent stores as each stores layout proves the same. At the top floor, there is a sky-bridge connecting each of the four buildings to one another. A large fat man smiles from his desk, and on the other side of this room, across from the desk, was a screen filled with an image of the same disturbing image of a fat man, just with a slightly different toned tweed suit. This was America's future if run by the major corporations. I was sure of it. 

The loud snap of the book closing brings me back to reality. 'There's nothing I want here.' said Smedly. Rodriguez looks at me, his eyes wide. 'Pretty cool book, huh,' I say to him. 'Yeah, that was pretty abstract art,' he replies. 'Let's go then Smedly, Rodriguez, to Starbucks for I need fuel, we will find one soon enough as there are three within ten blocks that will take us back to around my house.' I propose with shudders coursing through me. 'Alright Phil, sounds good let's go to the one with the plush chairs,' responds Smedly. 'An excellent idea,' says Rodriguez. As we turn to leave a group of people follow us, and by the time we leave the store, we leave as ten. Our crowd disperses as we move down the sidewalk, I ponder the strange vision. Starbucks' number was at five within my neighborhood. The remnants of a Blockbuster from last year had recently converted to the coffee cause. Strange tidings, paranoia, as they open stores close to one another in this overpopulated neighborhood. 

Two homeless citizens huddle together in one of the bus-stops littering every two blocks. None of the frenzied frantic shoppers spare them a dime. I ridicule my changeless pockets as we march down 23rd avenue. We decide to stop at a novelty store, but inside there are too many people and Rodriguez leaves. I find a 'Ministry of Silly Walks t-shirt and show it to Smedly. He smiles and we both re-enact the silliest walk we can remember from the sketch. This drew a few eyes, but everyone is busy and locked in-to a shopping frenzy, so our antics are ignored. We conclude we are done with this silly shop and proceed outside. Rodriguez is there smoking a cigarette and the adventure continues as we pass an inadequate Starbucks, one without comfy chairs for lounging.

We venture down the avenue and walk through the crowds gathering around the streetcar. My stepfather was very involved in bringing the street car to the City, but I would argue, thinking that the era I live in is one with scientifically feasible jet-packs. An awful thought enters my head. What if I encounter my parents walking along the avenue?!? This hadn't occurred yet, so the terrible idea was fresh and powerful. We arrive at the Starbucks, which is a place my mother frequently visits, and I dart for the comfy chairs. Rodriguez looks at me with a worried face, for he would have to order the drinks; I had beaten him in. The girl behind the counter was exceptionally attractive, so my friends fate would not be entirely negative. Smedly gets a chia tea, as he enters first, and comes to sit down. The challenge of ordering drinks is overcome by Rodriguez and he comes with two in hand.

'You get me something?' I ask.

'Yes, a Carmel macchiato,' Rodriguez replies.

'Excellent, I can't wait for the caffeine to kick in.'

'Phil you want to go to your house?' Smedly asks. This was a question I had hoped would never come up, and I try to look grim as I sip my coffee.

'Let's see a movie!' Rodriguez summons up a perfect response. I telepathically send him thanks, but there is no need. He is one step ahead of me already, and is nodding before the message is sent.

'Yea, my house is lame, we are facing some unusual circumstances. The outside world is far more interesting at the present moment; my house is filled with nothing to do.' I inform my friend.

'Into the Wild looks pretty good.' Rodriguez suggests.

'I'm down, what else is there?' Smedly implores.

'Golden Compass, Charlie Wilson's War--'No thanks!' Smedly adds and I agree wholeheartedlyJuno, Atonement,' Rodriguez lists them off. Strangely, Into the Wild seems like the only good choice on the list. There is unanimous agreement. 'My financial situation is not good. I don't know if I have enough cash for the movie,' I say, examining my destitute status and empty wallet.

'I'll cover it. Just pay me back later,' Rodriguez states.

'Alright, where is the movie going to be?' I question.

'Pioneer Courthouse Square,' Rodriguez informs.

I look at him with mounting skepticism. I would be returning to that crowded cesspool of Portland's strange, weird, and busy landmark. 

'The Square?!? Are you sure?! I guess we could take the streetcar. First I have to go to the bathroom.'

'Yes, that sounds like a good idea, we can ride for free,' Smedly says.

I stand up and walk toward the bathroom. A man is sitting about 6 feet from us, busily typing some career-defining paper, or so it appears, for he looks intently focused. I pass him and continue on towards the bathroom and as I approach the door, a man exits looking most uncomfortable. My head follows him as he passes me, but his eyes do not waver, determined to find whatever destination brings him away from his experience in the bathroom. I put my hands on the door and push it, opening into a scene with a dirty man at the sink, intently focused on something, and making strange grunting and intense sniffing noises. A wave of absolute terror comes over me and I do not look at the man again, bolting for the urinal.

Great, some man in the depths of some drug experience is behind me and going to shank me at any second! The fear overwhelms me. I can't pee. Focus, dammit! Use your enhanced imagination abilities to work Niagra Falls past the fear. It works, and I let it flow. I slowly turn my head, ready to face the monster in my mind. Ignore this horrible drug, he is most likely just fixing his teeth. My eyes look at a mirrorreflection of a man using a straw to snort cocaine. In a public restroom, at a public Starbucks, in my neighborhood. We share a moment, me and this man. A fragment of time, of deep understanding, a strange rising feeling in the depth of my soul. He knows I am impaired, and he is scared. My pupils are ginormous, and his right blue jean leg is holding him on the sink, closer to the mirror, closer to the cocaine. My contact tries to jump out and I blink awkwardly. I turn and flee the bathroom as he sniffs again. Outside I zip my fly and apply my belt, and rush to the comfort fifteen feet away. My friends look at me with amusement and smiles. I return the smiles with a frown and sit down, only to stand quickly and say 'Let's go! I'm ready to leave.' I grab my coffee and walk out the door.

As I leave the Starbucks, I take the moment alone outside to gather myself. I am shaken by the encounter in the restroom. A travesty, a terror, a freak like myself was trying to enhance the holidays, but with a different poison. The entourage assembles outside and as we walk to the streetcar, I try to explain the monster in the restroom. My friends agree that it would be an uncomfortable situation and the moment is lost as we board the streetcar.

The streetcar never checks for tickets, and we take advantage of this and ride for free. It is a packed car, white on the inside with grey paneling, and I, now aware of my large pupils, sit down in the only single seat. My friend drops a cigarette during the ride, and a large black man mutters, bringing it to my attention. I look at him thankfully as he pounds his chest, acknowledging and understanding without a word being said. This form of communication is appealing and advanced, but impossible to duplicate without such prior understanding. I turn and hand Rodriguez the cigarette, and he asks me where it came from. I tell him a guy in the other section called out, but he did not hear it and doubts me. 

'Where do we go when we get off the street car?' Smedly asks, a perfectly logical question that had yet to occur to me. 'Uhm, I can't remember right now, but we'll figure it out when we get off,' I reply. 'Alright, where do we get off and how many stops are left? Smedly counters. 'Uhhhh....' I have no idea. Looking at the map provided by the streetcar provides little help. Surely there is some solution to his question. But a solution fails me. 'We'll find out when we get there.' I say hoping that will suffice, but Smedly would not be satisfied. 'Hmmm, that does not bode well for our future endeavors,' he sagely states.

I look at my friend, my best friend of many years. He is wise beyond what I, and he, can imagine. We must find the solution to his question in order to make it to the mall. The distance between words and reality is starting to increase. It appears the peak is at least one hour away. At that point, we should be in the audience of Into The Wild. The thought settles my mind and my soul. An intense movie like Apocalypto would not be viewed this time around, not on this experience. Intensity is already around anyone and everyone, angrily advancing through the shops. Instead, a more pleasant flick involving a man who decides to throw away all his worldly possessions, and go into the wild. 

Throwing away all possessions at a time like Christmas was unfathomable. The buying of future possessions is what keeps this season alive. No more do we practice arcane pagan rituals of saying what we are thankful for at the time of humanitys supposed savior's birth. At least, not at the families I visited. The majority, 70%, was not even as heavily practicing as my own. The heavy moral consequences were weighing on my mind. A distraction from Smedly's important question to be sure, but what was the most important question? What was more important? The implications of everyone I had seen, ignoring their fellow man, and frantically buying strange and 'fad' items. What was I witnessing? I was not sure anymore, of anything, much less where I was.

Rodriguez quickly straightens up and looks around, I take a quick look at my pants pockets, and Smedly looks at the passengers around him. We are currently passing the Pearl, the booming business/residential district. Despite my years in this part of town, the terrible triumphant drug has effectively rendered my terrible sense of direction null. I am lost. I look at the upcoming stops. Jefferson Street. I always liked that president. Yes, it will have to do. I turn my eyes and look at Smedly, 'We will get off here, at Jefferson.' I inform him. 'Alright, how far is the mall from there?' He retaliates. 'Smedly, to be honest, I haven't been to this part of downtown in awhile, and I can't remember.' Smedly looks at me quizzically. He doesn't know yet, he does not suspect. He trusts me.

The stop arrives at that exact moment and I jump off. Smedly grabs Rodriguez, who is starting to succumb to the drugs almighty wrath. His scanning eyes are black orbs, and he nods as I ponder the situation. We all look around us at the scene. I start walking in a random direction, confident that a solution will present itself. Sure enough, about two blocks later we encounter three street musicians, twenty shoppers, and two homeless people. I smile, for we are not even into the heart of downtown. A metaphor was growing within my mind: Christmas, the season of giving, was currently being consumed by some sort of beast. The beast of consumerism? The beast of greed? The beast of bastardized Santa outfits being worn by 1/6 of the people we pass? I was not yet sure of what type of beast it was, but it was littering the Citys streets. I explain this hypothesis to my friends:

Well Smedly, Rodriguez, we are walking at a good clip and should arrive at the mall soon. Take notice of the large number of people, all possessed with the desire to give, two days before the giving's proper time.

'What's your point?' Smedly candidly counters.

'My point my friend, is we are about to enter a monster at the mall. If for any strange reason I myself or our friend Rodriguez here, should raise up our arms, and turn and flee, please just meet us back at the Square which we should... be passing shortly. I'm not sure what we may encounter in there, but I do know that it may be terrifying, a quirky fear of mass claustrophobia magnified by the masses.' I end my monologue to Rodriguez's agreeing smile, and Smedly's doubting stare.

'Flee the mall? Why would we do that?!' He asks. The words come out to me wrongly as, 'Freeeeee the MAAallL? We should DO that.' Naturally I do not respond and eye him suspiciously, so he asks again.

'Oh sorry, well, uhm, you see Smedly nothing about today is normal. You see, well...' I had no idea how to proceed with the sentence. It fell off a cliff in my mind as I stare at a Santa citizen chugging a bottle of Jack Daniels. Dear God, this city is filled with chaos. Soon they'll be breeding. What will happen then? Images of different Santas, some large, some fat, some strapped with vodka, dancing about in a drunken Christmas orgy, engaging in sinful satanic rites, gluttony . . .these thoughts take over my consciousness. We have now entered the Square. I now notice, strange I had not before, a giant Christmas tree smothered in dancing lights and ornaments, reflecting the flickering image. I need something to snap me out of this, this horrible funk.

'Smedly, what Phil is trying to say, is we may not want to go through the mall at all.' Rodriguez says, understanding and absorbing the fear.

'What about the movie?!' Smedly is clearly confused.

'We must see the movie! Screw the Satanic Santas, Fuck the panhandlers, I'm ready to enter this hellhole!' I cry.

A pause among our group. Rodriguez looks at me, his mouth is slightly askew with a downward tilt, and he says 'I do not know if I can do this. Let's smoke another cigarette before we go in.' We all try to walk faster, to get past the crowds, but I trip and wipe my nose, disturbing the pedestrians. 'What are you about!' the old lady pushing the stroller cries, and I respond with 'sorry about that, just trying to pass, enjoy the holidays...ho ho ho.' I adjust the cigarette lighting it. 'Just passing through, don't mind us,' Rodriguez politically pontificates, and the old lady smiles. What we are about would never be possible to explain, and why she asked consumes me.

'What, you guys really don't like the mall or something huh?' Smedly asks us, but does not expect a reply. I can see it in his eyes, he assumes that it is his fault he doesn't understand. Or so I suspect. Doubt on both sides must be settling in. Scrutiny.

'Apparently, you haven't considered everything,' I say, adding: 'expect the unexpected.' The cigarette adds relief, another snap of energy fighting back the cold and nose drip. Morale must remain high or the mall will be unbearable. Right as Smedly is about to ask me what I mean by everything a man in a white bunny suit walks up the Square's brick stairs. He is wearing a black star emblem eye patch. Did I just see that? Smedly's mouth drops affirming my suspicion as another bunny figure pops out behind a crowd, and another from behind the tree. This one has a different eye patch. They are gathering their forces. 'Quick! Into the mall!' I shout, and dart in as we enter the entrance, redundant as it may seem. We move past the crowd gathered around a silver statue man. His eyes follow us, haunting my reality. As I turn my head, a man juggling five golden balls, comes into my vision and I step aside, tossing my finished cigarette. Jesus, we have not even opened the doors and already we are sucked into the madness of sensory overload. My senses were heightened enough, or so I thought.

The two large glass doors open, and the first thing I notice is that the Sharper Image is not a sharper image at all as snow hits my eye. Snow?!? Here?!? What the hell? There is snow everywhere. People are everywhere too. The Urban Outfitters was a populated puddle with tadpoles, compared to the algae-infested lake of people filling the mall. I sneeze a snowflake that does not melt, but sticks to my clothes. Fake snow, an enemy I had not considered. This is sheer madness! Christmas songs beat to chatter that rises, but never seems to fall. There are more people in this mall than there were people in the Square. I stand there, thinking these thoughts while Rodriguez is pressed against me and Smedly behind me. Football tactics would have to be used to traverse the terrain. Madden moves.

Why was I here? The movie! Of course! It resides on the top floor, but before that goal could be achieved, we'd have to work our way through the chaos. 'I'm dreaaaaaaming of a white Christmas' bellows, but babies bawling add an adverse negative connotation to my ear. 'I want I WANT I WANT!' passes my left ear and I feel the fear rising in me. I want to get out of here. I break free of a cluster of people and gasping, I grab the escalator handle. Smedly has passed Rodriguez now, and is four people and five steps behind me. My fear of heights jumps to my attention so I look up. There, at the top of the mall, the apex of the architecture, lies a fake snow machine pelting out white flakes that harass everyone. I see Rodriguez struggling to break through, but finally he does and he smiles, apparently avoiding any semblance of the fear consuming me, as he rides the escalator. He likes heights. How many more of these were there? I look up. Two more. There is no movie theatre on the top floor as I had remembered, we must be in the wrong section of the mall. Stiff-arming my way through two jovial Santas I spin move past a group of five, and creep onto the next escalator.

I stare over the edge, trying to fight the urge to jump off, screaming 'Damn you, Pioneer Courthouse Square Mall, Damn you for ruining order, the pristine condition of prior Christmas.' But I know it's not the mall's fault. It is just a building after all. I don't want to die, not to make this point, not now. Into the Wild will provide relief, the great outdoors, images of nature not defiled by 'tickle me Elmo's' and Nintendo Wii's. Fake snow gets in my eye, and my contact decides at that moment to try to jump out again. My contact adds to the ante of chaos. Curse this decision, the science of things is a science I no longer want to understand. I stumble and fall, but Smedlys hand catches me. I mumble thanks and look at him trying to point and explain where the movie theatre is. 'WHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU!' is his reply. Rodriguez is catching up to us, but this floor is louder then the last.

The beat of the beast that drives us rears its ugly head as a small army of Mexicans, Koreans, and other melting-pot families converge on our location bustling with boxes of gifts. Five children forming a pentagram outline scream 'I want to see Santa,' as a drunk man in a Santa outfit stumbles to a bench. 'You can't see this Santa, he is not the real one,' a mother replies. The Santa burps. Two of the children start to cry, the other three join in realizing that Santa, may not appear as he seems on the hallmark cards that sit on top of their boxes. 'YOU TOLD ME Santa was real!' they wail, a zooming, piercing sound that fades out thankfully, as I climb the next escalator. I peer over the edge and my heart leaps into my throat. My contact tries to escape and begins to fall out of my eye, but a blink and a finger poking it stop it. This of course hurts, and I cry out, but stop to sneeze again, shedding fake snow onto the handle of the escalator. We have reached the top floor. Thank God, and his son Jesus, there's a sky bridge leading to the next part of the mall! 

On the top floor, there is an Electronics Boutique, filled to the brim with gamers of all ages. Inside, parents too confused to know the difference between a game and a game console scream for verification above the racket as employees' faces fluster. Maybe we do practice the arcane pagan rituals, I begin to consider. Just replace praying, with spraying, fake snow, so that the people do not know, what hinders them, the beast of greed within. Yes greed, or the need, to bring Christmas to the lead, of buyer's impulse decisions. Do I buy the collector's edition game with the sexgunsrapetheftfun4 on the cover, so my son can gloat like no other, or do I buy some other game, for a different console, the right console, this is driving me insane, goes the prayers refrain. But I do not remain. I no longer want to hear, what it is that these buyers fear.

I must get out of this madness. I walk across the circular floor determined to arrive at the surprisingly sparse sky bridge. Smedly has gotten ahead of me, and is looking out the window, and Rodriguez is not far behind me. I walk up, grab the silver handrail, and peer over the railing at the streets below. Thankfully, within this haven, there is no snow. 'Come on, let's press to the movie. It should be at the end of this sky bridge.' As the words leave my mouth I decide now is the time to explain to Smedly, what exactly causes my weird mannerisms. 'Smedly before we continue, Rodriguez and I took substance A before you arrived, because we didn't know you were coming.' I feel no weight lifted from my chest. The ball had moved into Smedly's court, and I wasn't sure where he would dribble.

'Seriously?! This whole time?!?' His voice rises and I prepare for condemnation. Rodriguez pulls the draw-strings on his hood. 'Man, if you hadn't told me, I would never have known.' The words leave his lips and bounce off my minds wall, hitting me with stupefying surprise. 'I couldn't tell at all. You guys were acting completely normal.' He finishes this startling thought, and a long moment of silence passes between us. Completely normal does not even begin to describe what I have seen. Fuck it. Along with not being presentable, Rodriguez and I must always appear as if on drugs. The peripeteia of our unusual circumstances begins to dawn upon me.

Oh well, at least honesty is being achieved in this dishonest location.

Rodriguez starts to laugh, a chirping sound that echoes off the sky bridge wall as my laughter joins in. Smedly does not understand the ridiculousness of the situation, but he joins in and he is right in doing so. We are alone, the three of us, on this abandoned sky bridge; as if in another world, but 15 feet away, the beat of the Christmas beast continues to bellow. We have conquered him, for now, for on the other side of the sky bridge lies a vast and barely populated movie theater. Sanctuary. What we consume will provide us with food for thought. This is what our Christmas hath brought. Anticlimactic I suppose, but what the truth is . . . who knows?

It was 10:30, a friend and I had just made it to our friends house and we decided to start early. They ate 1 tab each and I ate one with a microdot. The three of us then attempted to prepare everything for the trip. This was the first time they would be tripping and they had no idea what to expect, so I was partly their guide. Over the next hour or so I felt my trip slowly come on as I watched the curtains begin to breathe slightly. I pointed out that my friends may feel a little nauseous as well or some other weird feelings. One of my friends explained that he was feeling cold and sort of numb but hadn't noticed any other alerts yet. 

At about 12am we decided to walk the neighborhood and perhaps head to the shops. Everyone got supplies and we headed off, down through a few streets. I began to feel the trip taking a hold as I started to see different sides to my friends personalities and began to think about my prospects of life and how beautiful the surrounding world is. My friends kept complaining about not seeing anything, and I had to explain that the patterns they were seeing and the structural type of visuals were that related to LSD and it's something one has to get used to. In retrospect it could have been their lower dose. We then smoked some weed and this is where the trip changed rather dramatically.

We walked back up the hill towards the house and sat down somewhere in between our journey. As we sat around staring at the visuals, my friends seemed to be pulling me down from the depth of my trip talking about T.V. shows and video games, the type of things that become so insignificant under the influence of psychedelics in my opinion. LSD to me offers an experience to accept and allows me to 'just be', Just a window to spontaneity.  We got back to the house, collected some warm clothes, and got ready to go for another walk up a steep hill and this is where they began falling into the mental loops that LSD inspires, which had also been amplified by the weed.

To fast forward, a lot of running backwards and forwards through ideas for them went on as they started to cycle through the loops of thought in their brain. One of them was paranoid about someone being caught with a $50 of weed on them, he didnt want to hide it because he was afraid hed forget where he left it once he'd come down and he didnt want to give it away because he was afraid one of us would steal it. Basically he was getting paranoid over a simple idea. The other kept saying we had to make it to this place (another house), and I kept reminding everyone to just forget about the situation and stop placing emphasis on getting anywhere, but enjoy the current moment. 

In my mind state I was prepared to go wherever, I was happy just being who I was. So whatever would make both of them happy made me happy. They argued and got more paranoid. I tried to rescue them but they opted for the easy option Valium, they both had 5mg each, not too much but enough to take the edge off. When it took effect they started to feel sedated, so we decided to head back home as it was about 4am by this time. 

We smoked some more weed and now that I was finally able to disconnect as my friends had stopped talking as much I was able to really trip. I ran down the hill back to the house and it felt as if my body was alive as if it was some primitive instinct to run down steep hills through bushes, as we hunt our prey or whatever. I was pouncing and leaping from here to there. It was one truly amazing exhilarating feelings. Like all my senses were so accurately divided to achieve peak efficiency during this moment.

Now that I was alone again I was able to trip without any constant distractions of my friends. My mind constantly wonders off when I'm tripping, often losing hold of the idea I was previously thinking. But this time I was able to dwell on a theory about loops and fractals and how they occurred throughout all of existence, every single idea, thought, habit, lifestyle, animal, religion, pattern, followed these spirals or fractal patterns, and in retrospect upon research, it was like the golden ratio. I imagined the whole universe as a fractal that repeats itself. I imagined the universe as just one cell of an animal or human body.

Earth is part of what makes up one individual being. But the thing is that person could be us or the person next to us, it doesnt matter because it is all part of the fractal pattern, and we as humans are able to transcend it and be anywhere we want if we stop focusing on the single solitary reflection of just one individual being. We are a part of everything and everything is a part of us, if you enable perception to perceive it that way. Everyones constantly seeking pleasure, what else do the majority of people live for in this world apart from a rather limited seeking of happiness? I saw my life going through my future as it hit the loops and I would be reborn only to experience the same thing again, or infinitely different each time which could eventually cycle through to the same thing without me realizing. I was everywhere at once, and no where at the same time. Meanwhile there were strong sensations of my body evolving into loads of different creatures or dimensions.

Its all quite hard to relay and I dont think I can ever do a good job, but it was almost as if I finally understood the way the universe works in terms of its infiniteness and parallel dimensions. Life and death being so irrelevant while the essence of time and the idea of 'backwards' and 'forwards' as being a false measurement developed by man. There is only experience, and through experience we create reflection and after that we create a backwards and forwards in order of post and prior experience dimensions, but without these confines it is impossible to determine which way is forwards and which way is backwards and if we are even moving at all. Whos to say we are actually moving forward in time right now, for all we know we could be the very things that are going backwards. We had fixed ourselves into transcendence, and now we are all just going backwards screwing it all up again like cancer, killing a human being back into transcendence. 

I went through all the theories of religion in my head, all the subcultures the evolution of the world and the trickery of plastic surgery and medicine to trick our natural selection senses, how screwed up evolution has become, keeping alive those who really shouldn't have survived and perfecting a race that is now flawed by the decisions humans make. We are tricked into what would make the best child or the best adult by the media, by pop culture, by everything, by the essence of socialisation. 

I wonder if it's just a hallucination that acid gives me, an all powerful feeling like Ive worked it all out. As I start to come down, I try to seek solutions to the questions that were just proposed to me, but I don't find answers exactly, just questions that lead to more questions. When I felt as if Id worked the entire universe out into the way in which we are here, I was overcome with a feeling of sadness as I got a strong sense that I was now so insignificant, and that my life lacked any real meaning. Going beyond why humans are here why is the earth here why is the universe and why is the looping fractals that are our alternate realities/dimensions here for. What is existence here for, I found nothing; as I saw everything will start over anew ready to loop following the ways of the fractals. Ideas follow the loop but occasionally branch off to form a new spiral that will get smaller and smaller too, and all anyone could ever hope for was a death that free'd them from it all.

Id hit the peak of my trip and was coming down here and it felt as if I had hit the peak of my life and now I am coming down. I have appeased my mind and now I must appease my body. It felt as though the rest of my life could never quite humble me the way this trip did and it would be a downward spiral into the contemplation of death as it approached and I would no longer ever be as blissfully naive as I was prior to this trip. I watched some trippy videos on the computer that only reimbursed my theories in a weird yet acid like way, I listened to some psy/goa trance and watched the visuals. Throughout the whole trip most of my visuals had been fractal/spiral based, seeing little fractals make up every individual colour I saw and then seeing everything I saw make up an even bigger fractal which was then tied to my thought patterns and that of evolution and history making up fractals, then humans, habits, lifestyles etc. but one interesting thing was that I actually started hearing in fractals at this point, little fractals of sound or the sine waves being digested in my ears as little spirals that got digested through their sine waves into the language of perception. 

Like with all acid trips, after the ego loss it all comes flooding back and I felt a part of the future, the past and the present, I looked into the past and made insights into the future. Just started enjoying being again, enjoying the taste of food and having a lust to learn again. The day continued and lots more happened that day, but they more revolved around life choices and making my friends, family and loved ones feel loved. I took a Valium for sleep just when I realized it was the last day to enroll for Uni. So I enrolled for Uni to start studying Neuroscience and then found out that it was my cousin's birthday. So it was a rather dramatic day following the trip, but that's another story of intense life integration.

Sorry if the story jumps around a bit, I was writing it as the memories came back, explaining that theory is definitely hard, its still something I cant even believe I thought up the complexities of, but I cant explain it very well. It also makes me think we could be the cancer of this earth, the one with the wrong genetic mutation that started rapidly multiplying that will expand until it kills off the whole universe, but it doesnt matter itll all start again right??? It felt like god was saying YOU HAVE WORKED IT ALL OUT GO BACK TO JAIL, DO NOT COLLECT $200, like I'd learnt something I wasn't meant to learn before death and I could never go back to naievity, but in saying that, I must now teach everyone peace of mind, I am someone with knowledge who must bring knowledge to those less enlightened then myself, and not by telling them what I experienced but by challenging their consciousness too, to achieve a transcendental consciousness of civilization.

Now Ive got to work out who are the teachers and whos being taught in this world. Who I am to learn from and who is to learn from me, the cycle of evolution, and the black holes of knowledge that are a vacuum for depth and knowledge. Science Vs Acid is a beautiful thing. If there is no start or beginning where is the meaning of making measurements?

How deep can these theories go into medical theories, perhaps humans are just a form of cancer rapidly multiplying and some greater being has attempted to cure us such as the cell/earth we live in by providing us with healthy air and drugs such as psychedelics, homosexuality, art, chaos and order and whatever other antibodies it wishes to throw at us. Its all up to what you want this world to be, because for all we know it we could just be a dream teaching the waking life of another organism, just like our dreams teach ourselves about our life. We are the keepers of a transcendental organisms universe. 

I guess there are many things I may be satisfied not knowing without conviction, As avoiding conviction is the best path to open mindedness. Knowing all the answers would make one very boring life, but if one assumed these answers were just questions then the potential for learning new questions is limitless.

When this experience took place, I worked in a club as a barkeeper. The shifts were usually quite straining because it was one of those clubs were they play stupid pop songs and sell very cheap alcohol (one beverage - one Euro), thus the customers were all very loaded and quite annoying. Also the club was usually very crowded so as a barkeeper you would run under adrenalin for about six or seven hours without any break. Just as that night. I drank a few beers and Jägermeisters during the shift so I was a little light headed when I got home around 6 am. 

I shared an apartment with a girl that was on a long trip to India at the time so I allowed a friend, let's call him B, that didn't have a flat and obviously no intentions to get one, to live with me for a month. It really eased the life of my other friend, let's call him M, because B has accomodated himself at his place for a long while now. So when I came home, tired and looking forward to my bed, these two guys were sitting on the couch watching TV with a bottle of Jägermeister and a few beers - obviously in a good mood. It was the winter of the glorious Hoffmann 2000 acid papers (if you remember those :-)) and these two guys where having a nice evening with each a half of one. M had bought himself a few sheets so he was always very well equipped and taking acid was at that time for M (my closest friend back then) & me a very common thing while B was more a Cocain-guy and experienced but not used to acid. 

As I sat down, opening a bottle of beer and taking a sip of the Jägermeister, they exposed me the plan for this morning: Taking a cab to M's place and split up a whole sheet of Hoffmann papers. First I was very doubtful but they were so enthusiastic and infected me with it, so I agreed and we went to M's house. We took one sheet (25 Hoffmann hits) and placed it in a cup of water. We then counted together up to 25 (so the trips were nearly half a minute in that water) and shared it. We immediately called a taxi back to my place and started to get dressed. It was very could outside  middle of January. Just when I put on my jacket, just a few minutes after taking the acid, I felt the first acid rushs in my body. Then it hit me: Jesus, I just took up to 8 hits of Hoffmann acid. That was the biggest dose of acid I ever took and I thought this could be the night I end up in a mental institution. I saw in the faces of my friends that they were feeling and thinking similar. We were all nervous and a bit scared but I also knew it was to late now so I tried to just let go. During the ride the acid kicked in fully and when we deboarded the taxi we couldnt really talk anymore and just giggled and snorted with laughter. The taxi driver, an elder man, must have thought were some kind of idiots.

The first hours were really hard. We lied down on some matresses. I lied on my front and lost the feeling for my body. I became two wide opened eyeballs lying on the bed and watching the television, all the impressions just battered in my mind remorselessly. None of us was able to talk so we communicated with strange noises, gasps and desparate laughter. It was more like an impulse-reaction thing, not a controlled perception. The trip ascended and ascended, the intensity grew stronger for about two or three hours (I completely lost my sense of time). Sometimes I thought When will this end? or Will it ever? But I tried not to concentrate on that, I tried to stay in the flow. My hold was the television which gave a little bit continuity in that exploding chaos in my mind. There were the Teletubbies which I saw the first time. Very funny and yet intense, the sun with that stupid baby face even gave me some freaking kind of awe. Then there was this ridiculous guy from the educations shows that are on at forenoon in German TV, who wore an awfully ugly wool sweater with corny patterns and colors. The imagination of him unwrapping his Christmas presents and getting that sweater made us laugh for at least 30 minutes.

All three of us had the urge for free air and kind of an electrifying summer feeling inside. We opened all windows in the apartment to let the sunny weather and blue sky in. It was about minus seven degrees (Celsius) outside but we were sitting there in T-Shirts feeling like on an open air festival in summer. The coldness was just one more energy shower in my body. We stood at the window laughing at the people walking by because they were all walking like robots. All the city life appeared to be very mechanical, cars holding at the traffic lights, then one direction flows, holding, then the other etc., in-between that robots walking with a straight direction, energetic but cold, like it all was a computer program or something like this. We laughed our asses off at some people which they must have realized as the apartment was only in the first floor directly to the street, but either they ignored us or somehow didnt recognize us. As if we were in a different world or at least a different energy level.

After some hours I felt that the peak was over and that the trip reached that steady level that I like so much where I have control over it and not the trip over me. I was relieved because I knew by then I wouldnt land in the nut house today. M and I wanted to listen to some music. The problem was the hifi was plugged in the other room, not where our camp was. So I tried to manage it and put the music to our camp. That was a real intellectual challenge. All the materials were very abstract and meant absolutely nothing to me. All my intuition was gone far away and busy with the looks and feels of the cables and speakers so the only mental source I could use for that matter was my intellect, which I found out wasnt very helpful. After decomposing my room for about 20 minutes I managed to have the speakers in the other room, the cables laid and a CD running - but still no music. I was very confused and strained the laughable rest of my mind to find the source of that problem, but I just couldnt find it. M helped me without success. After a long while I saw that I laid the cable correctly but forgot to plug it in the speakers. *Doh* - so much for assembling technical things on LSD.

Its always fascinating how the sense of hearing mutates on acid. We had a nice and floating psychedelic trance CD running and I couldnt tell how loud it was or if the music was fast or slow. The velocity kept changing all the time. But simultaneously I was able to hear the slightest little sounds in the background, some of which I have never realized before on that track. Also I was able to split up sounds, so that I could concentrate on one and observe its behavior like an investigator would observe some exotic animal. Furthermore my rhythmic sense was highly increased. It was as if I could predict the percussions coming up. It was great. M and I started to dance and it shifted me into another dimension. I could physically FEEL the sounds floating through my body.

At that point our threesome trip unity broke up. While M and I, acid-heads that we were, floated into the music and tried to explore the trip now that we had control over it, B, coke-head that he was, started to act very sober. He stood at the window and continued to laugh at people but not in that frisky childish manner from before but in an arrogant Cocain manner. For instance he laughed a people who would drive BMWs because this would be a shitty car and so forth. It was very destructive and had nothing to do with that trippy world I was in. Unfortunately M tried to join him  I guess he stood between me and B. I then felt a bit left alone as if they tried to limit my trip. Fortunately I was a quite experienced user so it didnt bother me too much, it just was annoying. Beginners can get real confused from such situation, I know that very well.

Later, when the trip started to descend, I got flatulence which is a normal reaction on acid. But I farted once and that was truly the mother of all farts. Although all windows were open, the ugly smell just wouldnt go away. We fled into the kitchen but it came after us. We laughed a lot and my friends were a bit angry at me for that. I couldnt help myself to be a bit proud for that achievement. In the kitchen there was a newspaper with a picture of that mouse they genetically modified with a human ear on its back and that really gave me the creeps. I was very empathic for that mouse and its fellow mice on which the experience was tried and failed before.

The trip lasted much longer as usual I still felt on at 11pm in the evening. In retrospect it was a good experience but despite the high dose it was nothing spiritual like I had before nor was it too scary. It was just a confusing and funny trip without any real deep thoughts. When I think it over we were all very lucky because with that high dose, it could have gone completely wrong. But I think as it was such a spontaneous action I just didnt have anything special in my mind, so it didnt get difficult at all. Im glad that I experienced it because it was one of the most intense trips I ever had but I would never take such high dose ever again without preparation. I usually take LSD in small amounts and dose it higher later if I like to go higher. But this was a decent and good experience.

And if youre asking yourself now why I called this article Going on a bicycle ride than think of the Hoffmann sheets that have a happy man riding his bicycle through the Swiss mountains. In my peer group then, going on trip, would be called riding a bicycle.

20, October 2005: As I had rose from my bed, the sun was neither rising nor falling, just pasted onto the surface of a sky whose gradients fell into streams of silver and bronze.  To justify myself for reasons left unsaid, I had thought it proper to drop into my eyes (through an eyedropper) one splash of liquid LSD, than falling into sleep; allusioning toward the causes of unconciounse hallucinatiosn as related to ones unnatural self.  From what I can recall of the time, it had been somwhere around 5:00 AM when I had began to feel the effects of the substance I had thrown myself under.  Recognizing the surface of my bedroom floor shifting from its usual gray toward an unusual maroon color, I came to the conclusion the effects were setting in.

As soon as I accepted this illusion as a factual reality, my window spread open from its base and gaped a furrowed jaw which bent the glass into a suffocated bulge of mercury, than releasing an opaque mist into the air landing upon the tip of my nose leaving my eyes crossed to juggle about the image, conquering any primary feelings I had of fear and disgust.  With the window absent, a breeze sunk into my new stage leaving my body to catch the watery stain of helplessness, though enjoying the feel of submersion where I could breathe deep while still wondering if a new river of waters had risen from my heels (now submersed in a quagmyre).

My insides had felt loose, absent, if I could have not been able to recall the fact that at one time I had been of a solid form, consisting of parts and mechanics that at present I was unsure of.  My heart felt as a separate mammal palpitating in my lap, as I stroked its continuous threads of pastel vein wishing not to harm any part of the world I was yet to see, and except those sets of eyes I was yet to share a glance.  The regions of a micro-cosmic love had found there way into my conscience, as I had become obsessed with the feeling of de' ja' vue', understanding that the universal self, the strong hand of our conscience, was trapsing about in a constant state of retrograde until we allow ourselves the severe chance to reflect what could have once been a stroke of luck, or fame, or lascivity.  Every moment I had ever experienced, and every 'fact' I had ever been told had seemed to find its way into my immediate thought.  Its relevance to the nature of my situation, and to the situations of all things, was more apparant than it ever had been before, and ever would be again.

By this time, I had no longer been in my bedroom, as I am still unsure if this was a hallucination or an awakening of some spiritual guise that had been wearing my SELF as a mask for all of time.  I found myself at the base of a large tree, examining it not through an hallucinatory imagery or unconscience elements, but just acknowledging its placement alongside my shadows pose.  I had became tired with this stage, and proceeded to sit onto the ground, soaking into the ground as a melted orb, masquerading beneath a tangle of leaves that had decided to wrap themselves around me, just as much as I had decided to wrap myself around them.  This was our mutual choice.  I had accepted all of this while still, all the while, fully conscience that I had ingested a drug and that indeed I was allowing an illusion to occur.  This is a very important thought to digest.

Moons had grew out of themselves, and the sun had shed a breathe that expelled aromas from the ground that rose to a olfactory climax that contested the worthy odor of any perfume I have ever since encountered.  For it was the smell of every experience that had ever been, and ever would be.  My eyes were shot blind with the severity of my cause, and my appendages were granted leave to roam about the terrain scattering their subliminal seeds of excess from hither to thither, appointing themselves back onto my form out of choice.  I had become tired and ventured back to wherever it was that I came, where I proceeded to sleep between a day of revolution.  I woke with a need to relay my experience through words, and this is where I had chosen to fall.

Having not tripped for a few months, I decided to grab three tabs of acid and have some fun.  I took them at 6 pm on a Tuesday night.  This seemed silly, especially since I had to go to work the next morning, but there was no time in the next few weeks in which I'd be able to use the acid, so I decided to go for it.  I was alone in my room - I didn't want to freak out my roommates, they have no idea that I've ever touched drugs, and I couldn't find anyone to trip with.  However, I had had experience with psychedelic drugs, including acid, so I was sure I would be able to handle it.

The effects started in about 20-30 minutes.  The effects were strongly physical - a tingling, tense, nervous sensation.  As the body load increased I began to recognize it as extremely pleasurable.  I sat listening to music, psychedelic trance and drum & bass, and I just felt incredibly alive.  The effects increased and I started sweating, twitching, and feeling unsteady.  I looked very strange in the mirror.  It occurred to me that intense body sensations may be a prerequisite to a fundamental mental or spiritual experience.  I understood why people often require strenuous physical work, like climbing a mountain, to have spiritual experiences - the bizarre physical sensations put you out of your element and lower your boundaries to prepare you for a deep mental experience.  I am an atheist, but I kept thinking 'If I was only religious, I would be so enraptured by god right now!'  For a moment I thought I believed in god, but I am such a died-in-the-wool nonbeliever that it didn't quite happen.

The music was unbelievably spellbinding, in a very different way from cannabis.  it was loud and had a 3D sensation, bouncing all around my skull.  But more than that, the sounds seemed to 'mix' with my other senses in the sense that they were at times unrecognizable as sound, but appeared as thoughts, emotions, or just some general cognitive input that I perceived as 'more than just sound.'  The music acquired an insanely dramatic and emotional quality to the point where I was quivering and utterly gripped.  The time dilation was very noticeable - I'd listen for what seemed like forever and realize that the song hadn't changed.

I lay down on my bed for a rest.  At that point, my phone rang.  The call-display said it was my dad.  I didn't answer and he left me a voicemail message, which I listened to.  At that point I started to get very emotional.  I love my dad but in my life I have let him down.  My dad is a far better person than me - he loves me and wants me to succeed but I know I am a disappointment to him.  I have become extremely isolated and distant from him even though I do love him in my heart.  The thought of me not being able to talk to him because I was strung up on drugs made this fact really hit home.  At this point I imagined how my dad feels - totally out of control, not understanding what happened to his son, not understanding why his years of efforts have slowly gone awry.  I cried uncontrollably, which I haven't done in years.  Tears seemed to explode out of my eyes for several minutes. I imagined how my Dad must feel to 'lose control' and see his son growing so for apart from him, and my brain actually lost control, spiraling in random directions and confusion as I imagined his confusion.  I kept apologizing: 'I try my best Dad!  I really do!'  but the tears kept coming.

Eventually I stopped and decided to enjoy some music again.  I started to get another curious mental effect I have gotten with other hallucinogens, in which my brain produces thoughts composed of sounds, images, memories, and colors all mixed together in an incoherent way.  For instance: the sound 'Lendel' or 'Mendel,' the color orangish/brown, the image of a fat, elderly European woman spinning, and a vague emotion of embarassment and a trace of a memory melded together to form a thought.  This thought was very ephemeral - I could not form a mental image of this fat lady, the thought would just fire for a second and disappear and I couldn't actually introspect about it to form a more fully detailed picture.  A few thoughts like this fired in a loop, over and over.  It occurred to me that when I think of, say, an elephant, the brain is linking together numerous concepts - the word, the color, the image, the memories associated with it, and so forth.  All these thoughts are triggered simultaneously when I think of 'elephant.'  Well, on acid, my brain was forming thoughts based on inputs from all of these concepts, but the concepts appeared to have been chosen randomly so the actual thought I generated did not correspond to anything real.

The synthasesia and 'mental garbage' effects, the most striking aspects of the LSD experience, disappeared after an hour or two.  But I was left with the ability to think weird thoughts.  These thoughts were not so much 'new' as creative extensions of beliefs I already had.  I was able to think about them with peculiar lucidity.  Example: in my line of work lots of people are super egotistical, clawing their way up to a more prestigious position.  I have long been somewhat embarassed about this prestige-whorishness and self-contragulation but unable to prevent it in myself.  On acid, the word 'prestige' actually became a disgusting, vile word.  It didn't make me think of negative attributes, it had negative attributes, in the same way that the thought 'red' is linked to a mental image of the color 'red.'

Meanwhile, the following wonderful thought occurred to me: perhaps true virtue, something you are truly skilled at and for which you deserve respect, is by definition something you cannot recognize.  The moment I start introspecting about how good I am, I cease to be good; only the unconscious exercise of competence or quality constitutes legitimate merit.  Therefore, the less egotistical I am, the better I am.  This seemed to make perfect sense and be an excellent way of going through life and it pleased me quite a bit.  However, it was not really a fundamentally new insight - it was a logical extension of my own internal discomfort of the egotism and prestige-whorishness; just bringing the thought to a more sweeping, aesthietic, and creative conclusion.

After the initial 2-hour or so peak, the effects slowly but surely declined.  After about eight hours I was able to walk around outside - things were still weird, but I was outwardly coherent.  The dropoff was very slow and there was no way I could sleep that night.  At 8:00 AM, 14 hours after I took the acid, I was still strung out and had a headache without being able to sleep.  (Note: all psychedelics seem to last inordinately long for me.  Salvia often persists for half an hour to an hour, a 60 mg AMT trip lasted 23 hours, etc.)  I went to work and a hellish, headache-filled, exhausting day.  I got almost nothing done.  I got home at 5:30 PM and slept for about five hours.  I felt quite renewed afterwards and called my elderly grandmother for the first time in a long, long time; she was delighted to hear from me and we had a great conversation.

Overall, this was a very positive experience.  Next time, I would like to take it outside and with a group of friends.  I would also like to take it with some cannabis to enhance the bizarre synesthesia/mental garbage/mental randomness effects which I find so weird and fascinating.

I started by taking two tabs in my room at +0.00. The guy I got them from said that each tab was 100-150 micrograms. The tabs tasted slightly bitter/metallic as soon as they touched my tongue, but after they were wet they had no taste. I left them under my tongue for 30 minutes, then chewed up and swallowed. Apart from the utter excitement, around the +0.30, I started to get my first effects. Uncontrollable laughter and a general feeling of something happening, something changing. After about +1.00 I saw the first signs of visual distortion, the face on my digital clock is flat, but it looked like it was bubbling up and the numbers were morphing. I could look at my clock, then look at the wall, and still see the time on the wall. At this point I realised Id finally got good tabs, and was pleased. (last holidays I bought bunk tabs)

I decided I go out to the kitchen and get a drink of water, and have a look at what was going on out there. As soon as I walked out of my room I realised how much of a bad idea that was. I felt extremey uncomfortale walking around, with everything feeling so foreign and knowing I might run into my parents at any minute didn't help either. I made it out to the kitchen and filled up a cup with water. I headed back and had to walk past my mums room who had her door open, she called out to me and and I jumped about 20 feet in the air and spilt my cup on the ground. My mum didnt notice that I'd spil my cup or jumped, so I walked back over to her. She said 'you can have your pens there in my cupboard'. Pens, what are pens I thought, not being able to think clerly caused me not to really understanding the concept of this word, I sort of looked at her confused and asked Can I have them? she looked at me very strangely and said yes. I realised how dumb I was and immediately thought my mum knew that something was wrong with me. I walked into the cupboard, grabbed the pens, and as I picked them up I completely forgot how to act around my parents. The person who I really was just became so foreign, I had completely forgot who they were, let alone trying to act like them. I walked out and my mum was staring at me real weird, or so I thought, I quickly muttered, I cant sleep, im very tired, Im gunna make tea then ran out. I got back to my room and thought for sure my mum knew I was on some sort of drug. I kept seeing her face in my mind, it looked as though she was analysing me, she knew something was up. Being around people who aren't tripping and even worse who you don't want to know that you are tripping is extremely weird. I felt so de-tatched and so far away from her, like on a completely different plain or level.

Now I had to go back out to the kitchen and make tea! Not cool, I was coming up really fast and getting more confused by the minute. I walked back out to the kitchen, boiled the kettle and as it came to a boil the sound slowed right down. I could hear every pop of each bubble, the sound of the bubbling and click when the kettle had finished was slowed down so much. The usual click of the kettle button which takes around half a second to click, took what seemed like 2 or 3 seconds to finally stop. All while this was happening, everything was moving, sort of stretching and shifting, everything around me, which continued all night, the strange thing was, although I always thought hallucinations were going to be cool on acid, visal or audio, at this point all they did was confuse me more, I didnt find them cool. I didnt experience any anxiety or fright, I just was confused, I was trying to piece together what was happening, while the acid was completely ripping away these pieces and any sense of logic. After the kettle boiled, I ran back to my room with a cup of water, completely forgetting I was supposed to make tea, luckily my mum didnt see me on the way back. I got back to my room, and this is where things started getting really intense.

I think it was around +2.00 now and I got back to my room and jumped in bed. There were many times throughout this trip I had to coax myself out of a bad trip. It was a very mental trip, I had to face any fears or worries I had ever had with acid or anything else which arose. Luckily, instead of becoming impulsive and letting the paranoia feed, I had researched these worries and knew it would be OK. I was able to think bad thoughts through before indulging in them and bringing on a bad trip. The first fear which arose was when I realised if my parents came in I could not act sober. I would probably not understand a word they were saying, let alone be able to talk with them. It scared me, and I started to feel nauseous, then I realised, they have never came into my room during the night, why would they start now. I felt much better and started listening to music. I saw the album art on the screen changing colours, and becoming extremely 3D the longer I stared at it, it did this all night. It was a psytrance band, so the album was trippy, I understand why psychedelic art was invented in the 60s  . I remember at one point myiPod and my hand actually shrunk, the bottom half was the size of a matchbox and the top half growing out bigger than normal. The clicker wheel turned cheese yellow. Another time my iPod actually started to melt away in my hand and I could feel it melt. Now as I was lying in bed, I had no idea what was going on. I was losing touch with reality at light speed, yet the clock was moving so damn slow. I thought two tabs might have been too much, because at the rate I was watching myself go up compared to time was scary. After about 10 minutes of deep thought (it's very hard to focus on anything whilst on acid), I realised the come up on acid was about 2-3 hours long, so realised I probably had another hour of going up. At this point I completely lost all familiarity with myself and my surroundings. Everything became amazingly foreign. This was the most frightening and confusing part of my experience. It would have been around +2.30, and I kept forgetting where I was, who I was, falling into these deep mind traps then jumping out of them for a split second just to touch with reality one last time.

I stood up and didnt know what to do. I felt like I was enjoying myself, but so confused as to what was going on I couldnt make sense of anything. I realised how fucked up I was and being so unfamiliar with my real self, thought there was no way I could come back to myself or being sober. Reality and soberness just seemed so distant and far off, it scared me. Although the acid was telling me I was never going to be normal again, I knew deep down I would be back to myself again by normal, and just stopped thinking about it and enjoyed the experience, knowing that one simple thing was probably the most important aspect in warding off a bad trip this whole experience. Things kept happening in which the trip was so close to turning bad it wasnt funny.

My dog started barking and yelping outside, I didnt know what my dog was at first, I thought it was some alien creature come to get me, then slowly I realised I had a dog, and immediately thought it was a puppy theif (recently heard about them on the news), I thought someone was trying to steal her. As soon as I thought this the sounds morphed into grunts of a human and yelping of my dog. This was very hard to deal with as I love my dog very much, but I tried to convince myself it couldn't be real. I thought to myself if I was asleep, there is nothing I could do, with a head full of acid, theres even less I can do. I wasnt sure if the sound of my dog was real or fake, but I warded it off to deal with in the morning. The next thing I know I feel this incredibly uncomfortable urge, creep up on me. It hits me like a pile of bricks. I have no idea what this is. After analyzing the feeling for a while, my best guess is that the water I drank now has to be pissed out, so I stumble to the toilet.

I get outside my door and hear my sister talking. The words are all jumbled and fragmented, and IMPOSSIBLE to understand. They echo over each other and sound like complete gibberish. I had no idea whether she was talking in her sleep or talking to my mum. I think its OK to go the bathroom, but I dont want my mum to think Im still awake, as I already thought she suspected something, so I leave the bathroom light off. Bad idea. I get in there, close the door and the whole room is close to pitch black, I can only mae out outlines. The walls start to rise up around me and start dancing around in circles. I get very frightened and have no idea how I am supposed to get out of the bathroom. I put my hands out and walk and hit the shower. I know I am close to the door, and used the shower to guide me there and turn the light on. I walk over and try to piss, it takes about 5 seconds for anything to happen, but when it does happen, it feels like everything in my body just lurched out through my piss. Very strange feeling. I wash my hands and look in the mirror to see my face. I used to have mild acne, but its cleared up, so theres still a few red scars/spots left, my face becomes covered in the red spots which turn into big red pimples and I grow hair all over my face. Normally I would think that was awesome, but I just thought it was confusing, not scary or fun, just weird. Another time, a little while after that I had to do another piss. The feeling was still very confusing to identify. The same thing again except this time when looking in the mirror I saw my skin not melt away but sort of become really tight on may face, so my head took the shape of a skull.

I really didn't understand what was going on. I manage to get back into my room and lay down. It is silent. I begin to hear this audio hallucination, it sounds like mechanic bubbles popping, the silence sort of bending back and forth. Any time in which there was silence throughout the rest of the night, I would hear this strange noise. I watched a movie on my iPod, and turned on an episode of heroes. It's like there are frames missing as the film sort of skips a beat. The characters have a soft glow, sort of aura around them, which occasionly becomes stronger for a few seconds when they move. Watching it some parts completely scared the crap out of me, I saw a guy jump off a building, then guns and shooting and some guy all alone in the middle of the desert get stalked. Concentrating on the movie was impossible, so I sort of just stared at the screen while my mind jumped from one thought to the next. At one point, I became convinced I was going to lose control of my actions and kill myself. It was quite scary but I tried to stop think about it, and reasoned with myself to make sure I knew I would never kill myself, and felt a little better.

I tried to get up and draw, but as soon as I stood up I forgot what I was doing. It took me around 10 minutes to walk half a metre across my room as I' realise what I was trying to do for a split second, take a small step then forget again. I ended up getting to my desk, but was too fascinated with the construction of a chair, that I forgot about drawing. I finally ended up realizing I wanted to try and draw, and sat down, but I didnt know what to draw. Any decision I had to make like choosing a song, episode, what to draw etc. took almost 10 minutes to decide. My mind was racing so fast, if I didn't pick straight away I'd forget about it for another 5 minutes. I picked up the pencil and drew a face, whenever I pressed the pencil on the paper I saw squiggles in the paper come all across the paper and I could see right in the texture of the paper. When there were a few things on the page, I sat back and looked at the paper and could see all the drawings move around the page. Took me about half an hour to try and draw anything as Id get halfway through and forget what I was doing.

I gave up trying to draw and just sat on my bed, amazed at how unfamiliar my own self was and my surroundings. I remember at one point every time I looked at the clock, the time would be further back than last time I looked. I think knowing the time on acid is pointless as I never would understand what it meant. Then another time I was holding my iPod and the song sped up in fast forward, I heard it speed up then go back to normal and saw the blue bar speed across the screen. I hadnt touched the iPod, so it wasnt me fast forwarding the song. There was a tarp outside, anytime the wind blew it, it would echo very strangely, it scared me at first, as I had no idea what it was, but I remembered the tarp and calmed down. The audio hallucination were amazing in retrospect. The way they echo and slow down is really cool. When I was tripping, I'd hear something echo or slow down, but my perceptions being so altered, I had no idea what it was.

Somehow I stumbled across almost controlling my audio hallucinations. I could think up words, say them in my head and hear them out loud as they would echo in my ears. I could think up any song I had recently listened to, and play it in my ears, without speakers or earphones or anything. Again though, being so confused it wasnt special to me, just confusing as to why it was happening but still slightly interesting. By +4.00 or +5.00, my head started to clear up, and I began to surface back to reality. The first 4 hours of my trip were the most intense and confusing of my life, I had no idea about anything, almost like being reverted back to a baby or child and experiencing everything again.

Everything was so unbeleivably foreign, I had no idea whether a chair was as normal or a hallucination, and thought both were just as interesting. Its very hard to explain. The best I can put it, is as being a baby, in a sense. As human beings, we think it awesome that a baby gets to have so many new experiences. Even the simplest of things like a chair or flashing toy can be of great interest to a baby. Yet take the baby to a theme park, although to us, a theme park is much more interesting than a chair, to the baby it is no different, just another new experience. The baby takes all the new experiences, and doesnt question if they are normal or not. That is how I felt. The hallucinations were the same level of interest as a chair to me. Both new experiences, both very confusing, both equal in their intrigue. I always imagined the hallucinations would be fun to look at, because theyd be awesome sober, but when tripping they were just another added bit of confusion to my jumbled world.

Well after that intense 4 or 5 hours of my trip, my mind started to clear up, and I started to float back to reality again. It got to the point, where I felt, in my mind I was normal, I became familiar with my surroundings and somewhat more familiar with myself. I ended up spending the rest of the night watching the hallucinations at my computer screen, while trying to make sense of what had happened. After a while I got bored, and went to look in the mirror again. I felt very clear minded at this point, the only part of the acid trip left was the hallucinations, or so it felt. While I was sitting at the computer, the mechanic bubble sounds still played, when it rained heavily it sounded like a machine. The sound wasnt all in one long sound, but it would rain, then stop and echo, then rain, then stop at echo, sounded like a washing machine in a massive cellar. I felt quite exhausted, mentally and physically, so headed back to my room. On the way I stared into the mirror and saw myself grow hair all over my face, and then morph into some giant ape like being. I fumbled around a bit more, till the hallucinations and almost completely ceased. It was around +7.00 or +8.00 when I went to bed. I drank some chamomile tea, and fell asleep, I remember I was still getting slight visuals as I fell asleep.

I Woke up feeling basically normal no hallucinations, no hangover no nothing, except a slight feeling of dis-attatchment with reality. Its just confusing merging back into this life which was so foreign only a few hours ago. Im still in utter confusement/astonishment over how powerful and intense this whole experience was. I am still slightly confused as to what happened, its like Ive been hit by a ton of bricks. In my naivety, when the trip was at its most intense, I only had my room to explore as my parents didnt fall asleep till late. Although I was really only exploring my mind, I would of liked a larger environment to experience other objects in such a perplexed state. Once my parents went to sleep, the intense phase had passed and I just sort of mellowed out. I was super confused and could of easily done something stupid, a trip sitter would have been preferred to help me out. But the powerfulness of LSD still amazes me, I was completely shocked and would have never expected what happened, to happen. Although I was prepared to accept anything, the intensity still overwhelmed me. I think if I am to do it again, I will make sure I have a much better environment and a sitter, but overall, the experience was not frightening, it was not bad either, it was not fun or exciting, but simply astonishing now and confusing at the time. All in all, it was quite rewarding in experiencing new perceptions.

A little background information. At age 15 throughout 10th grade of HS I dropped Lucy every other day and was able to even keep composure throughout high school while doing so. Never once did I have a bad journey or anything that felt remotely wrong at this point in my life. At this point in my life I was a worry free kid. The drought set in and my life changed drastically. I got into hard substances and became very depressed with my life. My last trip with Lucy was on February 13, 2004, 11 days before my daughter was born. It was a rough one but I had my daughters mother who I was very close with at that point to guide me through. She had also been my chemical companion throughout various past experiences.

Alright so here it is all laid out. Not a very perfectly planned journey by any means but I did learn a few very important lessons about my life and life in general and all around it was a very good experience. Throughout the night before dropping I had around 4 or 5 beers. Around 4:25a.m. I decided to dropped 3 hits of the condor blotter which I recently acquired from a loving brother. The first hour was spent in my room just laying down watching TV I dont exactly remember what was on the TV at the time. When it reached 5:25a.m. I was feeling nothing so I decided to drop one more. Layed there and watched some more TV until it reached about 5:40 a.m. when I felt like I had diarrhea coming on from some little caesars pizza and crazy bread I hate ate a few hours earlier. My mother was just getting out of the bathroom and getting ready to head to work. 

I got up and went into the bathroom and opened up the window nice and wide which faces to the east. While sitting there I could feel it coming on slightly and in my mind I got very excited and felt as if I was purposely purging out all of the negativity in my life. I felt nothing but good vibes radiating at this point. After getting out of the bathroom I went back into my bedroom around 5:50a.m. and sat back down and took a nice swig of beer and could still feel it coming on slightly. It felt like as soon as I sat down my mother called me from downstairs to print a report for my little sister because she couldnt get it to print. I went downstairs with minor anxiety and printed it and headed back to my room. 

At this point it was 6:00a.m. Once getting back into my room I laid there feeling out Lucy and letting her get a good feel of me. Everything felt right at this point. Everything was beautifully coming together but I was not totally satisfied. Around 6:15a.m. I went to grab for the last 2 hits and my phone started ringing immediately as I reached. It was my mother asking me to wake up my little brother for school. I felt like this was an omen not to drop anymore because she had stopped me while my arm was outreached. I woke up my brother and went back upstairs. Sitting on my futon things were starting to take hold even stronger but I still was not satisfied and while looking at the last two hits I thought to myself well I can either sit here and have a low to mild experience or I can see how far the rabbit hole will go with all of these. Seeing as this has been my first experience in over a year I dropped the last 2 hits.

At this point it had reached 6:35a.m. The sun was up in the east but my windows face the north and the west so my room was fairly dim at this point. This is where things really started to go into overdrive. Laying on my futon I was watching Funny Farm because it was on HBO at the time and seemed suitable and non violent/threatening. At around 6:55a.m. it hit me like a ton of bricks. I was totally blown away. I laid completely flat on my back on my futon breathing deeply in and out keeping a good mindset and watched spots on my wall begin to swirl and take on what looked like a life of their own moving in various motions.

At this point all was good and I was enjoying. I turned back to the TV and it was annoying me so I shut it off and laid back watching the ceiling. The visuals were utterly phenomenal. At first in a good sense but then they started to get a dark feeling to them. I brought my blanket up over my head and shut my eyes and inside my mind I was having some very wild visuals that I have never experienced to this intensity before. Things that seemed to look like skeletal figures with geometric lines forming their shape. Utterly amazing but at the same time frightening.

It felt as if the demons (how my mind put it at that time) were closing in on me. I felt like I was fading out and I became very closterphobic and felt as if something was making it hard for me to breathe while under my blanket. Very overwhelming feeling. I pushed off my blanket and laid on my side staring at my futon gazing into what looked as if it was the fourth dimension. While gazing it became dark again and what looked like a demons face came before my eyes totally white face made up of total energy nothing physical with black eyes.

This messed with me bad so I sat up and tried to regain composure. At this point only a very small amount of time had passed. It went from 6:55a.m. to only 7:15a.m. I couldnt believe my brothers and sisters hadnt even left for school yet because I wanted to go downstairs where it was more open and bright. Things were very intense so I decided to try and give my daughters mother a call who used to be chemical companion and would guide me through when times got rough. With 3 back to back failed attempts at calling I think it set me off very bad.

I laid down on my back again and stared at the ceiling. The next visual was the most intense I have ever seen in my entire relationship with Lucy. Above me on the ceiling were physically lifeless forms. They were made up of complete energy with a light white glow. They were in a circular shape all connected at the head, arms at their sides, and legs spread out. They were moving in a circle in a counterclockwise position. I felt like fading out again and began to but things started feeling negative and I felt as if the demons were grabbing for me.

I closed my eyes and I was seeing some very cool but scary visuals. Things that looked like ancient egyption pyramids and peoples of that time along with skeletal figures and demonic looking faces. I needed somebody to be there with me and help me understand and comfort me. I attempted to call my daughters mother again with no luck and became upset and realized that it had only hit 7:40a.m. and that my little brothers and sisters were gone at school. At this point I totally lost track of time up until the end.

Downstairs I went and turned on a fan and pointed it at the couch and headed to the bathroom. In the bathroom nothing too spectacular happened. Just the usual off and crooked look to everything. I came out of the bathroom and laid down on the couch and watched the TV hoping it would keep me leveled off.  This did not work and I found myself gazing off and getting an overwhelmed feeling of anxiety. I forgot the purpose of why I was journeying in the first place and only wanted to come down. Things felt off and not right and generally blue. I tried calling Erica one last time with no luck. The air from the fan started to annoy me so I turned it off. I stared out the window and became annoyed because I couldnt go outside feeling that overwhelmed and not knowing the purpose of what I was doing in that realm and feeling like nothing was being accomplished and very overwhelmed of the intensity of what I was seeing.

I had to figure out something to do. Right in front of me was my answer. The computer. I walked up and hit the mouse and the screen saver shut off and Windows popped up. I looked at my desktop and it was distorted looking, the buttons seemed larger, the color was off, out of the corner of my eye the printer looked like it was lifting off the desk and coming back down over and over again everything on the desk out of the corner of my eye was floating and pulsing. Exact words that came flying out of my mouth was F*** That. I got up and sat back down on the couch. Everything was just so very intense and I felt so lost after only a few minutes I jumped back up and made my way back to the machine determined to get here to talk with some people I knew would understand where I was at and be able to help me through.

The visuals were still intense and throughout my whole time on the computer it was very intense. I felt like I was inside the monitor at some point and others I just watched everything on the desk float. I made my way to a web forum I visit frequently with little trouble. Ive been a computer nut since I was 11 years old. I went to a post I had made earlier when I had first dropped. On the screen I read a fellow brothers post that I hadnt previously read before dosing saying Its been a long time coming. You know what to do.

Its like exactly the opposite what I had been thinking but I could relate so well. That I had no clue what I was supposed to be doing. I had totally forgotten the purpose of my journey and why I was gazing into the astral plane. I have so much respect and appreciation for everybody who helped me out throughout that thread especially in the beginning. Everybody was throwing short and compact hard hitting good spirited punches at me. I will never underestimate the value of words even on a computer screen ever again in my life. Where I was at that point in time I was clinging on those words. I will also never forget what you guys did for me. You may not realize it but Im telling you, you truly helped set me in a good place. I have much love for you and I feel a much deeper connection with this forum then I previously had.

Sitting with my face close to the monitor I felt like I had a connection with each and every one of them. It was absolutely beautiful. I could honestly feel their good intentions and felt like I was making a connection with their spirits through their words and avatars. It was like I have known all of them my whole life and they understood me and where I was at that point. I became very calm at this point. This is when I could not connect to the forums. I had just started to feel better and I felt like something very demonic was keeping me away from the love I was feeling while here. While here I felt as if all of the negativity in my body was being purged with the help of the vibes I was receiving.

I went back and laid on the couch and reached out and felt like I made a spiritual connection with my uncle who I was very close to growing up. He was like my role model and I respect him. He is a very wise spiritual man. I felt overwhelmed with good vibes again and once again felt like I was purging out the negativity in my body. I called him and when he heard me rambling about how I dropped 7 doses and was tapped the f*** in and didnt remember what I was supposed to be doing here and I am totally lost and on and on and on he laughed.

He said 'Matthew you need to go outside. Its a beautiful day and the earthly spirits will love you right now. Get up go outside and lay down in the grass and let yourself be engulfed with the positive spirits who will help you figure out what you are trying to do here.  I replied saying I cannot go outside. He shot back Its not that you cannot go outside its that you are setting boundaries for yourself as you always do. Let go of your boundaries and travel outside.

I looked out the window and it all looked so big out there. I havent been out of my house at all in literally 3 or 4 months, except for a few times with my daughters mother. I ditched most of my friends due to my anxiety that I have a hard time controlling. I just couldnt do it. My uncle continued to laugh and told me that everything would be alright and to keep purging out the negativity and thats the reason I had come to purge the negativity, the boundaries, the fear of responsibilities and maturity, and thinking to much of what other people think of me. It still didnt seem to clear to me at this point. What he said made since but he cut me short because he was at work leaving me confused and sort of upset with him.

I got back on the forums. The pictures they all posted were absolutely beautiful. They produced some wild visual distortions and I had to close some of them because they were very intense. Especially this one picture of a trippy girl From time to time between posts and such I laid down on the couch. I watched the ceiling and many geometric patterns that looked like grafitie letters and designs were pulsing on the ceiling and changing form constantly. At one point the ceiling looked as if one big spiders web. I think the web represented many personal problems of my own that I have weaved. I could see it perfectly but became lost inside of it and lost my way.

At one point I tried to call my daughters mother again and things were slowly coming down at this point. This time she answered and I tried to tell her where I was at but she didnt want to hear me. She started screaming nonsense at me that I couldnt understand. One thing I did understand was her last line. How often in the past year have you been here for me Matt? I was there for you last time this time you are on your own. It made perfect sense to me and I needed to hear this from her. It helped me contemplate on many personal issues and set me back on track as to what I was doing and trying to accomplish.

Things slowly faded out. Visuals became less and less robust. The mind grip let go slowly. Around 1:30 p.m. The effects were totally gone for the most part. The afterglow is still upon me as we speak. From 1:30p.m.  4:00p.m. I laid on my futon and contemplated many personal things. I have come to some conclusions and some things are still left unsettled. 

All in all it was a very very good experience. It taught me a few valuable lessons and left me with a few questions to answer on my own. I am anticipating my next meeting with Lucy with open arms which probably will not be for a while.

And this chapter comes to a close. That was a long time coming.

This may serve either as an enticement or caveat for psychedelic trippers. I've gone into an egoless oblivion twice on tryptamine psychedelics, once on mushrooms, and once again on lsd about 7 years later.  This is a report on the latter lsd experience, in which I was out of my life/body/identity for around four hours.  That's a long time when you don't know your ass from a hole in the ground and are bent over in time warped tryptamine space!

I was renting a small cottage by myself in the Indian Himalya, in a place close to the origin of the ganges river, which also registers the area as very sacred to hindus.  I was interested in esoteric types of Indian mysticism such as aghora tantra and advaita vedanta and this interest led me, I believe, to experience what I did when I did.  I feel strongly in the saying 'be careful for what you wish for, because you may get it.'  I put a lot of mental thought into cosmic consciousness and the void, and I got an unexpected and massive taste of it.

A very young German man I met in a small himalyan town gave me a hit of acid, and warned me 'This is VERY special acid. Maybe only take half.'  Seeing the tiny hit of blotter, I truly had my doubts that it could have much effect on me.  I've tripped many many times.  I was very wrong about the acid.  It was stronger than anything I've ever had by a long shot.  And that was from one hit!  I was also having numerous stomach problems at the time, which is a common experience in India.  I was taking some antibiotics which were very strong.  I wonder sometimes if this had a chemical reaction with the acid, strenthening it considerably.  It may just have been truly special acid.  I don't know.  I tend to think that it was because of my intense practice that month with vedanta, which relaxed me to the point where some acid thrown in the mix would trigger a full on psychedelic blow out.

I chose a day to take the acid.  I tried to clean my head out of it's rubbish for about a week prior to the chosen date.  I know that nothing can can prepare one for a wild and unique trip, but I still think that these type of preperations are helpful.  There was, however, no way to prepare for what would happen to me.

I meditated for two hours at sunrise, than dropped the whole hit and went into the forest.  At first it came on very sweetly, after about 45 minutes.  I sat on a rock about halfway down the mountain and felt the magic of the sunlight.  It was warm and loving and I felt very good.  I remember thinking that the acid was indeed very clean and gorgeous feeling.  I foolishly thought that I was having a blessedly beautiful trip because of all of my preparation and mental training.  Slowly, though, the trip began to escalate.

I was very happy and delirious, and I think a peculiar kind of drunkenness was around me because I didn't really notice just how out there I was getting.  My sense of time was totally shot.  Some farmers off in the distance where shooting their rifles to scare away a mischevious band of monkeys who regularly raided all of the crops on the mountain.  The last thing I remember while I was still lucid, that is I still new my name, date and location, was the sound of the riotous monkeys screaming and running down the mountain sounding like charging bison or something.  I remember feeling some fear because I didn't want to deal with those monkeys in my state.  They are very intrusive and clever little bastards!

I had nothing to fear with the monkeys, but rather had much bigger things ahead.  This is when I lost consciousness.  It was around two and a half hours after dropping the hit.  I was so far inside my mind that I had no clue who or what I was.  I've heard of others who reach this state with acid, but it seems rare.  I encountered not a single person for several hours, leaving me on my own to decipher this new universe which seemed to be made of pure thought.

Looking back on it I have many memories of what I felt, but at the time I was lost in a place where there was no up, down, left right, sight, sound, scent.  I tested this new world to see if there was pain, because I remembered pain, and I tested it by reaching out a grabbing briars with my hand.  As the thorns dug into my hand I remember laughing because it wasn't at all painful but rather ecstatic!  Thousands of colors shot outwards from where my hand contacted the thorns!  My senses had blurred togethter fully and I felt that I was invincible.

I continued the experiments, thrusting myself into thickets and letting all of the thorns cut my body.  It just felt liberating.  My reality had truly crumbled.  I felt that now I truly 'knew' that pain and all material was a product of the mind and I didn't need to be a slave to it.  Reality was finally peeled aside, appearing as an illusion.  It's strange that as I thought this, I didn't even know my name, but I thought in terms of vedanta philosophy.

I wonder if I could have gone farther.  I wonder if I could have really hurt myself in that state.  Without fear of harm or dying, I could have jumped off a cliff or who knows what.  Fortunately I didn't.  I did climb up onto the roof of my cottage and stare into the sun, an acid trip cliche.  This is where I felt that I may be a being who is 'between worlds', something that had recently died.  I felt this once before on mushrooms several years earlier.  I was there again, but of course I had no context and no way to find myself to compare this current trip to the previous one.  

I began to feel that there was a 'mystery'.  When my old reality slowly creeped back, there was a fear.  I knew that I knew something, but what?  Where the hell is this place?  It seems familar, but how?  Being in India, on the other side of the world, made it even more surreal, because it clearly wasn't MY world or MY familiar territory.  The setting lent itself to me feeling that I had somehow (died? entered cosmic consciousness? gone insane?) sublimated into an alien place.

At one point a felt such a profound emotional pain that I screamed at the top of my voice to try to purge the horror from me.  I was standing in front my cottage.  As I screamed I thrust my arms behind me and smashed a window out with my elbow.  the glass cut my arm open.  The pain felt magnificent.  Again I wonder how much further I could have gone hurting myself.

The scream alerted the farmers up the hill, whom I was renting the cottage from, as to my strange state, and someone came down to see after me.  I did not recognize the man, although I knew him well as we had talked often.  I thought that he was a 'concept' in my brain, a part of my mind which was oriented to challenge me somehow into solving the 'mystery'.  I thought that all of these bizarre and alien feelings I was having was me entering another level of consciousness, that the mystery I was feeling was the 'test', the challenge, like in classical literature, 'before entering these gates you must face a great challenge.'  I thought this man who came down to see me was like an adversary, a program sprung from my mind.  His questions to me (are you okay? what's going on? etc.) seemed like game.  I remember, embarassingly, that I was laughing and yelling at him.

He went back up the hill to his home which had no phone, and debated with his family about whether or not to go up the mountain and hitchike to town to get the police.  He was certain I had cracked up.

I started to come down from the acid after about 6 hours after dropping.  When the man came back down to check on me, I decided to ask him the key question, 'who are you?'  I was beginning to think he wasn't my 'adversary' but rather a friend from my 'former life'.  He told me his name and instantly I knew all that had happened.  I 'remembered' that I had taken acid, after four hours of raving and wandering around!

I was astonished.  For the second time in my life, I had gone totally off the deep end tripping.  I was covered with cuts and my arm was bleeding rather a lot where I put it through the window.  I was embarassed at acting like a lunatic and frightening my very gracious Indian hosts, but more important was my sense of amazement.

I wasn't scared, though very disturbed by what I'd seen.  I had felt a great joy as well as a total abyss where no love exists.  There were many things which are far too complex or deep for me to even put into words.

I was seeking a spiritual experience, and I got one.  I wasn't ready for it.  I haven't tripped since then, 4 years later, because I feel no need.  I want to explore that area more, but I need to find a different approach.  The potential was there in that trip to have really hurt or possibly killed myself.  I'm still gathering bits and pieces of mental debris from that mind explosion.

LSD (2) : Alone (16), Mystical Experiences (9), General (1)

LSD





BODY WEIGHT:
150 lb





One fall, a number of years ago, I had an experience that completely unraveled, completely obliterated every idea I had about myself and reality. I went camping alone with 12 hits of LSD. I wasn't after any experiences. I just wanted to see what LSD had to offer. From the writings of J. Krishnamurti I had become convinced that the spiritual journey is just an illusion. You're either awake or you're not. There's no in-between of becoming awake I had come to believe. But I wasn't completely convinced of this idea. I thought that LSD might be able to help me wake up a little, move me along the spiritual path a little, the path that Krishnamurti saw as an illusion.

I had read Stanislav Grof's book 'The Adventure of Self-Discovery' and in it he relates stories of people who overcome various psychological problems through the use of LSD during psychotherapy. I hoped that LSD could have the same positive psychological effect for myself. Lessening my psychological burden I felt could bring me a little closer to waking up to my true nature. 

A friend dropped me off in the woods, and I found a good camping spot a fair distance away from any roads and people. I was going to wait and take some LSD the next day. I thought it would be a good idea to spend a day settling into a more tranquil mood. I was aware of the power of LSD. That's why I had just bought a walkman and headphones and a tape of Gregorian chant. I felt that listening to Gregorian chant would help induce a good trip. 

Well, I decided not to wait until the next day. In the early afternoon I took four hits of LSD. I lied down in my tent to listen to Gregorian chant. In less than half an hour I was tripping. I looked up out of my tent (I didn't have the rain-fly on) and saw the tree branches and the ripples on the tent from the wind moving to the Gregorian chant. The movement of the clouds slowed down. An indescribable beauty infused everything. 

I opened up the tent door and was stopped by a dead leaf lying right in front of my tent on my groundcover. The veins in the leaf weaved and undulated. Looking more closely I saw smaller and smaller divisions in the leaf. The sun shone through small holes in the leaf reavealing a deep red-orange glow. I said to myself, 'It's soooo beautiful'. The whole existence of the leaf revealed itself to me. I saw the leaf being born, growing, reaching its' glorious fruition, and then dying and shriveling up into nothing, only to repeat the whole process again. It was so glorious. I was awe-struck. I watched the the cycle of existence of the leaf happen over and over. 

Then I looked at the blue ground-cover of my tent. It undulated like ocean waves. I felt that all it contained was immense. I saw the oil taken from the earth to make it. I felt the oil of the earth being thoughtlessly, selfishly plundered in the ground-cover. I saw the war and hate and energy and greed connected to my ground-cover. I cried hard. But then I saw that it was just part of the earths' trip. Part of its' trip was to have a 'bad trip'.

I stepped out of my tent and looked at how beautiful and meaningful the whole world was. I wondered how it was possible to have a bad trip. I couldn't understand how people could have bad acid trips. 

But then I thought that a good friend of mine knew that I was going to have this good trip and having it would show in his mind that I was inherently different from him because he had always had bad experiences on acid. I thought that he'd feel alienated from me now and bring a permanent rift in our relationship. I now realized the good trip could actually be a bad thing. This troubled me, but I put it out of my consciousness. 

The next thing I knew, without thinking it was strange, was coming to after a lapse of consciouness in my tent. The first time I didn't know I had had a lapse of consciousness. I again looked at the leaf outside my tent, and then got out of the tent and looked at a particular tree by the tent. The next time I came to in my tent I thought, 'Hmm, this is like deja vu.' But I still didn't think it was strange reapeating the same experience for the third time in several minutes. 

The fourth and fifth times it happened I thought, 'Wait, something strange is happening.' I wondered who or what was playing this trick on me. I began to doubt the essential beauty and benevolence of the world which I'd had no doubt of just shortly ago. I decided to lie down and listen to Gregorian chant for the rest of the trip in the hope that the beautiful music would block out my troubling thoughts.  

But now as I looked up through my tent the trees and the sky looked lifeless, cold and distant. This disturbed me. I threw off the headphones and unzipped my tent to look at the leaf again. I saw it shriveling up over and over into a grotesque, gray, lifeless leaf. There was no life in it. Only death. I told myself that the world wasn't really like this. I told myself that existence itself is the highest meaning and life is at its' core and that it was only the LSD that was making me see the world as meaningless and dead. But then I thought that I wouldn't have to affirm the inherent goodness and positivity of the world to myself if it really were true.

Yet once the doubt had slipped in there seemed to be no way to get rid of it. My earlier wonderful trip became increasingly hellish. I told myself that I was just having a bad LSD trip and that the world was in fact good. But then I thought that if the world really was good I wouldn't be able to have a bad LSD trip. Before I realized it everything had ceased being beautiful, good and meaningful and had become grotesque, sinister and meaningless. 

I worried that the bad trip might never end and thought I might need to go get help because I'd damaged my brain. But I still had some objectivity on my experience because I thought how I didn't want to draw others into my hell and paranoia and just further confirm the meaninglessness of existence. I decided to stay alone in the woods, but then I began feeling sick to my stomach. I wondered whether I was just imagining I was sick or whether I really was. I tried to remember something I had done early in the day that could be making me sick. I remembered that I hadn't purified the water that I had gotten from a spring early in the day. A scoutmaster out camping with his troop had even offered me some purifying tablets but I had turned him down saying I never purified spring water. I thought the untreated water might be killing me. I thought I might die. All because I was too arrogant to accept some purifying tablets. And it was the arrogance not just of this moment but of my whole life that was now going to kill me.

As I sat in horror deciding what to do next everything merged and coalesced with everything else destroying the tangibility of each individual object. Time and space dissolved. My sleeping bag and tent stretched and contracted. I wondered who I was. I was no longer sure. Most of the ideas I had about who I was no longer felt tenable. It felt that my whole life had necessarily culminated to this moment. All I felt I knew was that I had to come to terms with the fact that I was a wretched human being and that life was meaningless. I could either leave right then and go back to my friends on the farm where I lived and let them know I knew they knew I knew that life was meaningless and that all humans were in eternal conflict with each other and everything and that all we could do was feign communion and happiness. 

I also knew that if I went back to my friends I'd have to go to the hospital and my parents would find out I'd taken LSD and had almost killed myself as a result. I felt like I'd be reduced to a pathetic, worthless, repulsive individual if my parents found out what I'd done.  

My other choice would be to stay in the woods and die. Either way my identity of being a 'good person' would be destroyed. I felt overwhelming dread seeing that I was caught in a vicious Catch-22. But, I thought, there'd at least be some redemption if I went back and let everyone know that I realized all of my 'idealistic' dreams were selfish and arrogant and that I was a worthless person who needed to beg for forgiveness. I felt my friends and parents knew what I was going through at that very moment and were just waiting to see whether I had the humility to admit to them that all I'd thought and done with my life was completely self-centered and wrong.

But then a more terrifying thought came over me: that my whole past life might be fictitious. I thought that all of my memories may have been implanted in me. I was becoming uncertain of everything. My grip on reality was slipping away. I realized I no longer knew who I was or where I was or what was happening to me other than something unspeakably horrible. But I tried to keep reminding myself throughout this that I had just taken four hits of LSD and was just having a bad trip. Yet saying that to myself helped less and less as time went on. It was irrelevant after some time how I had gotten into the state I was in. The hell I was feeling was too real and powerful to pass off as the play of my mind. I felt that the LSD was just bringing to the surface the truth of myself and reality. But I thought if I could just remember what LSD was I could stave off the bad trip. I thought that what LSD was was what LSD stood for, but I could not remember what it stood for. 

The trip became even more frightening when physical reality had pretty much lost all substantiality. Nothing had any distinct identity. Everything was fluid. There was nothing to get a grip on psychologically. Everything I touched lost all feeling of solidity on contact. I decided I should eat something to help me get a hold of reality. Feeling the solidity of food in my mouth and stomach I thought would help.

I took one bite of an energy bar and spit it out. It tasted disgusting. That food could be repulsive further confirmed my idea that life was essentially indifferent and meaningless since negative things were possible. I looked down at the food I had spit out and saw it turned into clumps of writhing maggots. I looked more closely at the spit out food to see that it really wasn't maggots, but I only saw the maggots in greater detail. More fear welled up in me. Now I had further, tangible evidence that reality was a malignant, indifferent, untrustworthy miscreation at its' core. The lusus naturae of all lusus naturaes so that any and everything that could exist in all possible realities was necessarily a deformed, grotesque aberration destined to bear nothing but total chaos and randomness so nothing ultimately made any sense and no perception or interpretation could ultimately be trusted.

But beyond the fear of the indifference and meaninglessness of reality I was terrified that the solidity of the world had dissolved. I had to get in touch with something solid, either from the present or past, something that would show they were real and not just figments of my imagination. I opened up my journal to read some of the entries I had written to help confirm to myself that the past I remembered having happened really did happen. I thought that if the thoughts in my mind could be confirmed by something outside of myself it would provide solid evidence of my past and put solid ground back under my feet again, and more so, put solid ground back under my ideas about myself and reality. It would also help confirm my belief that I was having doubts about who I was, and reality in general, because I was on a bad acid trip. But when I opened my journal and started reading I  became afraid to read past the quotes in the beginning of the thinking that if I read some of my personal experiences they would only create a whole other series of worries and doubts.

Then I remembered I had my watch, and I remembered that I had taken the LSD at about 1:00 pm. I felt that seeing my watch would give me something very concrete to hold onto. I could check the time and the date, and I knew that if the time was about what I'd expect it to be and the date was what I thought it should be I'd know that I was just having a bad acid trip and that it was only the acid that was causing me to lose my hold on reality. I looked at my watch and the time said 5:48 pm. That was good - about what I expected. And the date was 11 - 18 - 95. Also very good. Those outside facts confirmed my inner thoughts. The watch felt solid and real in my hand. A wave of relief came over me. 

But then I doubted that what the watch said or that the watch itself was real. I didn't know anything outside of my own thoughts that could prove what the watch said was real and true. I saw what the watch said as part of a lie. I realized I was waking up to the 'Great Lie' - the lie that is past on from generation to generation of humans that the material world is substantial, solid and that our ideas and measurements of it reveal reality. I now saw this was not true. It was clear now that there is never anything to get a hold of and call 'reality'. I realized that everything in my inner experience and in the outer world had no real substance. I realized that nothing could be trusted, that there was no solid truth to hold onto. I looked down at my watch and it melted in my hand. Any substance and weight it had had a moment before was gone. I threw it to the ground in terror.

Any and every hellish scenario began to feel possible now. I decided to open myself up to the most bizarre and hellish possibilities. I saw a comfort in realizing that anything could go wrong - then at least I could take comfort in knowing what the truth was: that reality is hell. I decided to see if I could jump through the earth into another dimension. I ran and jumped into the air. It was deeply comforting when my feet landed firmly on the ground. Layers of fear immediately dissipated from my mind. Some of the substantiality of the physical world returned. I felt security in the returning solidity.

But it was short-lived. The nausea that I had felt earlier suddenly returned, and much worse. I vomited food and then blood. I was sure I was dying. I knew I had to get back to the farm where I lived or I would die. I put on my boots. I was ready to take off for help when every direction I looked in looked the same. I didn't know which way was the right way. I realized it was dangerous to try to get back to the farm for help since I had no idea which direction was the way back standing there in the middle of the woods.

I conceded to the fact that I might just die out there in the woods. But I again reminded myself that I had taken four hits of LSD and that it could just be the bad acid trip that was making me feel that I was dying. Though I didn't find that thought very convincing. I felt that I'd be lost for good and definitely die if I headed off into the woods having no idea if I was headed in the right direction or not. 

I lied down in my tent trying to accept the fact that I might die out there in woods. Facing immanent death made fear of the meaninglessness of existence and its' insubstantiality pale in comparison. Accepting the fact that I might actually die a deep sobriety came over me. With the sobriety I no longer felt a need to avoid anything, however frightening. A deep desire to face the truth, to face reality, however good or bad it might be, filled my being. I didn't listen to Gregorian chant. I didn't want to try to create any feelings of a good world. I wanted reality to come to me on its own terms. I'd accept whatever it gave me. 

I moved my butt-cheeks while lying down so I could get more of a sense of my physical being. The world was feeling more tangible. I realized I just needed to be interacting with physical reality, that I needed to be completely living in the here and now, in each and every moment. I noticed that storm-like clouds had formed in the sky. I got up and put my rainfly on my tent. A said out loud what I needed to be doing each step of the way, 'OK, attach the rainfly there. Good. Let's go over here now.' I just wanted to be fully in the present, no matter how mundane it happened to be.

I realized that living in the present moment no matter how 'mundane', 'routine', or 'boring' was beautiful compared to the horror acid trip I had just been experiencing. Physical reality, with all its' solidity was slowly coming back into focus. Then the bad trip was completely gone. And without realize it, the good trip wasn't there either. I didn't notice that the feeling of tripping was diminishing. It was now about five hours after consuming the four hits of LSD. Exhausted, but greatly relieved, I went into my tent and lied down.

I suddenly came to, and it was like the other times I had lost and regained consciousness. There was no feeling of having fallen asleep. It felt like I had blacked-out and suddenly come to. I spontaneously, without thinking it was strange, or even realizing what I was doing, jumped up and out of the tent. I knelt on the ground and grabbed a fistful of leaves. I pressed them against my face. The bad trip, or any feeling of tripping was completely gone. I hugged a tree. It was solid! Solidity! What a joy! And sounds had substance again. And everything I looked at was hard, firm - solid.

It didn't occur to me that it was very unusual for all feelings of tripping to have disappeared only after five hours from taking the acid. I went back into my tent and lied down again, now even more deeply relieved that the trip from hell was over.

I suddenly came to again after a lapse of consciousness. Again, I spontaneously jumped out of my tent and knelt down grabbing a fistful of leaves. I stood up realizing that the world felt very different and that I felt very different. It felt as though a burden had been lifted from every cell in my body. My body felt amazingly light, and every movement I made felt effortless and completely natural. Then I realized that my sense of having a personal consciousness was gone. I knew in that moment, beyond any doubt, that I had awaken. I felt that I was in a fairy tale land. 

Everything felt so close. I could feel the whole universe right there in front of me. It felt like the universe was laughing and clapping and saying, 'Welcome home.' I literally felt that I had awaken from a dream. It truly felt that I had just been born, just, in that moment, truly come to life. I repeated out loud, 'This is so funny' (awakening from taking LSD) and 'This is so incredible.' I looked at the darkening sky and the ground and the trees. Everything looked so soft and light. It seemed that the world had been turned inside out.

I realized how meaningful suffering is. If people truly knew that suffering was a natural part of existence then they would attend to their suffering instead of trying to avoid it. Suffering is a reminder that there is something wrong with our perception (understanding) of reality. We need to ask, 'Why do I suffer?' and see that the answer is in the question: because of 'I'. We suffer because of the idea of an 'I' separate from and standing apart and independent from the rest of the universe.

I saw so clearly how most humans are still caught in the illusion of separateness, but I no longer saw the irrational acts of humans as evil or tragic. I saw suffering as an essentially natural outcome when reality is not percieved correctly. There was no pity for the human condition, only compassion.

I could feel how we all originate from nothing. The best way I could think about it at the time was that we are all crystallized points of eternity. I thought, of course something that is eternal and infinite is going to suffer if it thinks it is something temporal and finite. Thinking you live in a human body is necessarily going to be very suffocating, claustrophobic, when you are, in fact, infinite, which doesn't imply endless space but its' transcendence. 

My head felt like a void, and I had a feeling of vastness and emptiness up through my stomach, chest, neck and mouth. I loved the sound of my voice. I felt like I was speaking out of a void. Every sound and syllable I made was effortless and sounded perfectly crisp and clear. I realized before that I had always been afraid of my voice.

As I tried to think of 'myself' I found it very hard. There was nothing to hold onto. There was no longer any concept that could contain who I now recognized myself to be. I saw that my life as 'Chris M.' had been nothing but a dream. There was nothing substantial about 'Chris M.'. I asked myself, 'Who is Chris M.?' and found I had no idea. He was a dream, an illusion, a mirage. My whole past life felt like a dream that I had just woken-up from. It was hard getting a hold of past memories. Nothing specific came to mind. It didn't bother me in the least. It seemed that I had been dropped off in the woods about a month ago.

I thought to myself that it was worth next to an eternity to reach the state I was in. I laughed at all the things people identify themselves with - political causes, religions, their color of skin, nationality, being cool etc. I saw the ridiculousness of so many acts of humans.

I thought of my family, and my friends on the farm where I lived, and saw how much I loved them all. I felt that they were right there with me. The earth, the universe, felt so small, as if everything was immediately present. I thought of what I would do next with my life, and I found there was nothing to weigh my thoughts against. Everything I thought of doing was just, 'Yeah, OK, whatever.' There was no seriousness or worry or doubt to my thoughts. It was just, 'whatever I do, I do.'

I remember shouting out, 'Hello!' expecting the universe to answer back. I had never felt so incredibly alive. The world had been transformed from a 'serious place' to a place of pure magic and wonder. I just wanted to help others wake up and say, 'See, isn't it awesome and miraculous? See, the world's already perfect.'

I felt completely safe and secure and at home. I laughed at the thought that people are actually afraid of being attacked in the woods by another human. Being afraid felt so absurd, so completely unjustified, completely based on an illusion about one's true nature and the true nature of reality.

I decided the next morning I'd go back to the farm to be with my friends whom I felt an intense love for. I kind of felt like a father. I wanted to let everyone know that everything is alright, that everything is already perfect.

I decided to pack up my stuff right then (it was about 7pm) and go over to see some Boy Scouts whose Scoutmaster I had met earlier in the day and who said I was welcome to come to their campfire that evening. I wanted to share my love, myself, or maybe I should say, lack of self.

It was a funny experience trying to make it over to where the Boy Scouts were. I got lost in the dark. I thought that was pretty ironic. Yet it didn't bother me in the least. At one point I was going to start over from where my tentsite had been. I turned around to see if I could trace my way back, and I stumbled over mentally. I realized that I had always had ideas, presumptions about everything. I mentally stumbled over because my mind automatically was trying to hold onto my ideas of where I had been, but a deeper part of me could no longer make the error of mistaking my ideas about reality for reality itself. My perception was no longer obscured, and it was obvious what was reality and what were just my thoughts about reality. So I stared at the ground, and the trees and the earth seemed to be saying to me, 'Well, here we are. We're all the information you need to find your way back. We're reality.' It was a wonderful feeling - to just see the world without it being cluttered up with ideas, opinions, beliefs, presumptions.

My fifty pound pack felt like nothing on my back. I hardly noticed it was there. And I hiked up and down the mountain like it was nothing as I tried to find my way to the Boy Scouts. It didn't matter at all that I couldn't find them. Just being alive was an exhilarating experience.

Feeling no inhibitions I called out and tried flashing my headlamp in a signal-like fashion. Not living in the normal human realm of separation and fear I didn't think that my actions would be taken as strange by everyone else camping out there in the woods. There were a number of people camping in the area, and people's responses were essentially, 'What the hell are you doing yelling out trying to find somebody in the dark, dude?' I felt such intimacy with the rest of the world that it didn't seem strange to me at all. 

Well, I finally found my way to the Boy Scouts. Actually, it was the scoutmaster and about eight adults whom I finally came across. I could see that they were wary of me, and the scoutmaster was definitely not the friendly person I had met earlier in the day. I could see they were just checking me out - making sure I wasn't some psychopath or something. To me their behaviour was ridiculous, so unjustified. It was merely based on the illusion of separation. But I only had understanding for their situation. 

I told them I was coming to join their campfire, and they told me that it had already ended. When I spoke with them I felt awkward speaking in a way that I never had before. I realized after that I felt that way because I had no ideas or expectations or fears deciding what I should and shouldn't say. It was a completely new experience for me. I was really struck by their irrational fear of me based on the false belief of separation. Their behavior seemed almost silly. As they walked away from me talking they seemed like silly cartoon characters going, 'mumble grumble, mumble grumble.'

I was now in a clearing up in the mountains at night with the stars overhead. I layed out my sleeping back in the open beneath the stars, a feeling of total freedom, of oneness with all, permeating my being. The temperature was dropping. My body shivered from the cold, but coldness was just coldness, not a 'problem' as I'd normally related to it. I no longer felt any pain in my right knee which had been bothering me for weeks. 

I lied down in my sleeping bag looking up at the stars. They felt like they were right in front of my face. Everytime I opened my eyes I mentally jumped back at seeing how close the stars were. The mountains also felt very close, and the sound of the wind and trains and voices and other noises felt like they were right next to me. The sights and sounds were perceived without ideas or beliefs or any thoughts coming in the way.

The insubstantiality of time and space was completely tangible and obvious. They were still there, but I now saw them as the thinnest of veils lying across the vastness of the void. 

Possibly the most powerful part of the awakening was that all existential suffering and all existential doubt had ended. I had attained 'Certitude' of certain things as the Zen priest Steve Hagen had spoken about in his book 'How the World Can Be the Way It Is', which I think had had a significant influence on me having this experience. I had read the entire book the previous day, and one of the main themes of the book is trying to prove that there is nothing substantial in the material world, and yet, there it is. He says that the world is filled with paradoxes until we just see things for what they are beyond all conceptualization. I have no doubt that all the ideas in that book were mulling around in my unconscious mind when I took those four hits of acid.

Who I was and my 'place' in the world were meaningless questions now. I Knew that I had awaken. I Knew that existential human suffering is based upon an illusion - the illusion of separation. I Knew that what I was could never be harmed. I had no fear of anything. Fear is a product of the separate self. Fear goes hand-in-hand with the feeling of separation. The individual, separate 'I' is fear.

Two men came up to me while I was lying in my sleeping bag. They wanted to know if it had been me they'd seen walking along the mountain ridges, or rather, the headlamp that they'd seen. Every word I spoke came out effortlessly. I felt a naturalness and comfortableness in my being that I had never felt before. I felt the infinite in me communing, unaware to the two men, with the infinite in them. It was a joy being with others because I felt no separation with them.

Another amazing thing I noticed was seeing that thoughts were no longer a problem. I could easily put aside any thoughts in my mind and just see the world void of any concepts about it. It was such an exhilarating feeling of liberation - there was finally space, boundless space, in my mind.

Not long after I had initially woken-up to reality I felt I had realized what LSD is. I felt that it had been created by the collective unconscious of humanity to show humans deeper aspects of reality to help them wake up, ultimately, to the ground of being itself. I thought the same idea about Chaos Theory. I saw that everything is happening to help us wake-up. I saw, without any doubt, that the only useful thing to do in life is to wake-up. All the works of humanity, all technological progress adds up to nothing. The only thing that is of any value is to wake-up to reality.

The next morning the voidness in my head and body had greatly diminished. I didn't feel as light, though my voice still seemed to be coming from a void, and objects still felt lighter than 'normal'. I thought that maybe I was already growing use to my new state, but as time went on it was clear that the awakening was fading. Any effects not attributable to memory had faded completely within eighteen hours. 

It was a let down at first to realize that what I thought had been a permanent awakening  turned out to be temporary. The intense acid trip had been a catalyst for a brief, though extremely powerful transcendence of my mind. I have no doubt that the brief awakening was genuine. LSD can only effect the mind and I had gone beyond my mind. It was like the high dose of LSD I'd taken acted like a rocket ship that broke me free from the gravitational pull of all of my ideas about myself and reality to temporarily wake me up before the powerful karmic pull of my habitual center of gravity in the known, in ideas and beliefs about myself and reality, pulled me back. 

And then there I was believing I was 'Chris M.' again and huddled in the security of all his ideas about the reality around him - a reality of unfathomable mystery and wonder. But now that mysterious reality was wondered down by concepts to make the world 'safe' and 'secure' for myself.  

I am deeply grateful to have had a glimpse, even for a brief period of time, of reality. LSD can show us deeper dimensions of reality. It can take us on trips to subtler levels of consciousness, and in my case, it can even catapult us beyond the mind altogether, though, almost inevitably only temporarily. Only temporarily, because whe have to go through the actual day to day practice of living to let go of all our ideas about reality and ourself to finally stand in total nakedness and vulnerability and humility in the knowledge that who we are and what reality is will always ever be a mystery.

My girlfriend and I have been exlusive, and in a serious relationship, for a good long while now.  At the time (about two months ago, in May 2004) we'd been dating seriously for about 11 months, almost a year.  I love her more than I love life itself.  I'm most definitely what they call 'the romantic type', and she is pretty moderate in that department compared to me, but definitely has some 'romatic' qualities to her.

I waited to submit this, because this experience is very personal to me and very personal to her.  Neither of us have ever even told someone in person about this in great detail (all we've really said was, 'We tripped together on acid, and it was simply amazing,' and all that kinda basic jazz).

Having had some experiences with tripping, and having found her to be someone I've become very, very close to, our plan was to trip together on LSD.  I've done mushrooms a few times, and acid twice before this trip.  I've also got a lot of drinking experience under my belt, and of course have smoked lots of weed.  Out of all the things, acid is my favorite and easily the one I find most euphoric.  My girlfriend had taken mushrooms twice before, and she wanted to try acid after all the stories I'd told her about it, so she tried acid (and I was with her for some of her trip, and she handled it perfectly and enjoyed it like I did).  She told me how she felt about it, and obviously she knew how I felt about it.

Our objective was to have a romantic, LSD-induced experience together.  We both know that the mindset, setting, etc. are all very key factors in the trip.  Anyway, onto the story.  We have good friends out there, often with connections, so if anyone is curious, it was with one sugarcube each, which we were told was 'very potent'.  I got two from a friend I know I can trust to give me exactly what I need.  The dose turned out to be perfect, like this entire trip turned out to be. My girlfriend and I dosed about two hours after breakfast, at about an hour 'til noon or so.  Our plan was to start off listening to music together, have a romantic dinner, and possibly go to the local park at a time when we can be alone later on.

We were just listening to music right after we dosed, and I knew pretty quickly that the acid was better than I experienced before (certainly was much more potent).  We were sitting on a couch, holding hands, with the lighting as dim as it could've possibly been during a considerably sunny day in the broad daylight (it is pretty dark inside the house naturally).  We had some tapestries on the wall, and they gradually became a little more vibrant.  The music became more vibrant.  My girlfriend is very beautiful, and I can honestly say that she really is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, and she was also becoming more vibrant in my vision and mind.  I told her how I was already starting to feel it and she said she felt the same way.

Now, I always had felt connected to her, more than anyone else in this world, but on acid, it was REALLY intense.  It might even be the most intense I've ever felt in my life.  I really can't describe it exactly as I was feeling it.  The music, also, made it a lot more intense.  I felt like acid had brought me to a very small, euphoric, perfect, but temporary world which only her and I had been occupying.  Not just physically, but mentally; I wasn't even thinking about anything or anyone in this world but her.  Never in my life have I felt so close to someone.  Peter Gabriel, who had some songs we were listening to at the time, said something along the lines of, 'Sometimes, you will see a couple so close together that it becomes hard to distinguish which one is which...and between the two, their two worlds become one, in what we can identify as the Secret World...' for the track 'Secret World' on his Growing Up Live Tour.  This applied perfectly to the experience.

It was bizarre, how I knew we both were feeling the same way, but it was all perfect.  The word 'high' is a rather genuine way to describe it.  It was the ultimate high.  It justified my having lived my life up to that point, and living afterwards to have the memory in my head for the rest of my life.

We began to make love, which has never, before or since, for me OR her been either more intense, more euphoric, or more amazing.  Afterwards we held each other very closely, and talked about how we BOTH had NEVER felt so happy or so 'high' or 'ultimate' in our lives.  Right when I was about to say it, she told me that it was the best experience of her life, and if she had died tomorrow, she would do so having a life that she'd never trade for anything in the world because of this experience.  I'll never forget the words.

I hesitated, because I was amazed, because I understood her perfectly even though all she could use was mere words to describe an obviously immense, ineffable experience.  One cliched way of portraying romance in movies and such is to say, 'Words can never encompass the real depth of what I feel for you,' or something along those lines.  It was EXACTLY how we both felt.  But we still managed to understand each other.  I then told her I felt exactly the same way and that I need nothing more in this world, and no matter what exists outside of the experience that we have essentially created here, I don't need anything else except her beautiful face right with me.

We did end up going to the park as soon as it got dark out, and went to as secluded a place as possible.  Fortunately, it was warm enough out :).  We made love again.  We even slept there for the night, with only blankets to wear (it was reasonably private because it's surrounded by foliage and trees and such).

She woke me up at about 6:00 AM and we figured it might be a good idea to get up and get dressed.  We did so and assessed over breakfast how amazing an experience we just had, and how awesome it was that we'd have it for the rest of our lives.  She and I have since never been closer or imagined ever being closer to another human being.

I'm not too far removed from popping the question in the same spot in the park.  I cannot imagine ever leaving her.  And this experience has completely solidified her in my mind as the only person, only thing in this world I will ever need.  The acid was amazingly perfect.  The weather was amazingly perfect.  Everything came together perfectly.  Absolutely nothing went wrong.

Perhaps nothing ever could.

I have been trying to get acid for a long time. I had previously tried sugar cubes on two different occasions but they were bunk. Aside from the appeal of experiencing stimuli that do not exist, I was very interested to see how it compared to mushrooms and DXM, both of which I have done numerous times. I got into an argument with a friend who believed that Acid was far more intense than either of those, however the argument fell short because I had never done acid, and he had never done DXM. Needless to say, when my friend called me up saying that he had 2 hits of blotter acid for me, I rushed over to his place and dropped both on the spot.

By the time I got back to my room, I could already feel it building somewhere inside of me. The anxiety was the first symptom I noticed, and as time went on I got more and more giddy and excited. About a quarter of an hour later, I noticed the first visuals. The ceiling of my dorm is textured plaster but I did not remember it being THAT textured. The bumps and marks stood out more than usual, giving it a more 3d look to it. Soon after that, it began to visibly  pulse and swirl, not fast, but slowly, like it was a pool of standing water. I was quite amused at this point because I had finally gotten acid that worked! 

After giggling to myself at the strangeness of the moving ceiling and walls I noticed a striking similarity to mushrooms. The room would lighten and darken seemingly randomly, much like it does indoors on a partly cloudy day when the sun is blocked periodically. I reasoned that this was because my eyes were contracting and dilating, allowing more or less light to my retina. These effects held steady for the next hour or so while my friend used our printer for her homework. At one point I went into the bathroom, and watched my face change dramatically. I couldn't help but laugh like a madman, enjoying how the trip was going. 

After another half hour or so, I was beginning to worry that I had reached the peak. After all, I am used to mushrooms which peak much sooner than LSD. Finally, I decided to walk my friend back to her dorm on the other side of campus. I would soon find that I was the one who needed to be walked, not her. 

I stepped outside, smiling constantly and examining the fall night. My first experience with a tree was when I realized, quite suddenly, that the LSD had far from peaked. 

I stared at the tree for a second, not particularly, but then I got a strange feeling. I think it was because the whole tree canopy was writhing and flowing like the walls inside. It felt as if the tree was some alien creature. I imagine I felt much the same way a person would feel the first time they saw a tree. For some reason I felt that this massive organism was trying to reach out and grab me which creped me out slightly. I was still smiling though, and took it all in stride, walking on towards the opposite side of campus. 

By the time we made it to the Student Union, I was barely able to communicate. Fences, trees, brick walls, anything with an existing pattern would seize all of my attention to the point where I felt no need to talk, just stare and watch. I was able to tell my friend that if I were to stop and look at any one thing for too long, I would get lost in it, unable to communicate or look away without great effort. If I had been walking alone I surely would have explored this further, but we had a destination and that fact kept me on track, though just barely. Walking behind the Union, we passed a construction yard, another awe-inspiring sight. The shear amount of geometric shapes in the scaffolding, fencing and construction equipment threatened to steal my attention once again. I stopped and stared for a bit, watching the shimmering and waving patterns turn into a kaleidoscope of colors, all twisting in at the same direction and speed. The longer I stared, the more other-worldly the hallucinations became, and I was thoroughly happy. This was exactly what I had hoped for. 

Past the construction yard I spotted something that looked like a tomato near a dumpster. I approached it, and was thoroughly surprised that it was a squishy foam apple. This discovery made me ecstatic, like I was meant to find this apple. I kept it for the entire trip, and still have it on my desk now. My connection to such a simple and useless item confused me, but again, I just went with it, carrying my apple around with me like it was the sensible thing to do. 

We were within sight of my friends dorm by now, and as I walked down a path (that I thought seemed similar to walking down evolution, though now that I think about it, there was nothing special about this path at all) she exclaimed that I had never heard her play piano. After excitedly agreeing to listen to her play, we took a short walk to the nearby performing arts center. As I walked in the front door, it looked as if the walls were designed with skull motifs above the doors. I stood and stared at them, fairly sure they didn't exist at all, but unable to ask my friend if they were real. When we walked into the lobby of the center, I nearly lost myself again in a fit of laughter. The place, by any standard, is impressive. 

The 20 foot ceiling with balconies and crisscrossing supports grabbed my attention first. We then walked up a large staircase which also looked crazy, though I do not remember why. After walking down multi-colored hallways with posters and bulletin boards decorating the walls, I turned the corner into a bright orange passage. The color change hit me like a train, and this time I couldn't control my laughter. I cackled like a crazy man as we walked to the practice room. The whole place was nearly empty, and the only evidence of others was the drifting sound of piano being played from one of the other practice studios. I remember comparing it to the aroma of a freshly cooked meal, wafting from a family kitchen.

We got into a vacant room, which was no larger than 12 by 12, furnished by 1 piano and a few seats. I took a seat and She began to play. Now, after 13 years of practice, it goes unsaid that she is very good, but when she started playing, my world exploded. The body rolls were all-consuming, triggered by certain notes and sounds in the songs that somehow flew from her fingers. To me it seemed like she should be playing in front of a crowd, not in a small back room, she was that amazing! Individual keystrokes would cause different colors to flare, much like playing with different saturation levels on photo editing programs. There is no way I can even hope to explain this in a way that gives it the correct credit. It was amazing, truly and utterly.  She played Grande Valse Brillante Op 18 E-flat major, Funeral March from Op. 35, and Fantasie Impromptu Op. 29 in A-flat major, all three by Chopin, Rondo Capriccioso by Felix Mendelssohn, and Prelude in C-sharp minor Op 3 No. 2, by Rachmaninoff. Songs triggered different emotions and feelings, thoughts and visuals. 

I truly understand now the power of music and its ability to portray deep emotions that no written word can even hope to describe. Ive always had a strong connection to music, but nothing remotely close to what occurred in that room. I sat there, in complete amazement as the room around me became everything but what it actually was. My fingertips glowed neon green, non-existent entities left color trails through the air, the walls pulsed and swirled to the music, and notes seemed to hang in the air. My friend changed numerous times throughout her performance. At one point she became an 18th century court elite entertaining a dinner party. At another, she was a fat farmer playing piano, and still other times she was simply a silhouette of strange flowing shapes. The piano legs turned into a roman colonnade and the desk surface I was sitting in front of was a spiraling floral design. I noticed that acid created an amazing amount of external stimulus, but not too many internal thoughts to go with them. I don't remember thinking too much of anything during this period, too intent on the eye candy that was materializing from nowhere to pay attention to my own brain. LSD seemed to hold my attention completely .

She played for about an hour, able to change my emotion with a single chord. At one point we tried to analyze what each note did, with limited success. One series of notes she played reminded me of the cold, and I watched as the room froze in a bluish crystalline pattern, spreading across the walls and ceiling like ice. I kept trying to explain what I was seeing and feeling, but the words wouldnt flow correctly. I was constantly speaking in confusing and awkward sentences, which normally would irritate me, but I was just too happy to care. The performing arts center closed at 12, so we had to leave. I realized that it felt like so much happened in that little room, like I had run a marathon with my eyes alone. I was exhausted from listening! When I got outside, we parted ways and she went back to her dorm and I headed to mine. I noticed that the hardest hallucinations had stopped by then, even the level of intensity I felt when we first left my dorm was gone, as if the music had drained it all out of me. Now that the trip was back down to a mushroom high, I was confident that I could function again, but disappointed that it was all over. 

The walk back was rather uneventful until I got to a cement design near my dorm. Supposedly, a fire burned down one of the buildings long ago, and now the area was cursed. If I step on the center of the design I won't graduate on time, or so the story goes. I decided that if there WAS any bad energy here, I would be able to sense it on acid. I stood, looking into the crisp night fairly confident nothing was going to happen. But then I started getting unexplainably uncomfortable...almost scared. I was so surprised that I was actually feeling something that the fear turned to curiosity. Then I saw it. A strange bipedal  shape blacker than the night, blacker than anything I have ever seen, moved with super-human speed from the fringe of my vision towards where I was looking. I saw it move from the edge of a nearby building, behind a tree and disappear. I couldn't believe it! Did I just see some manifestation of a ghost? I saw it again, this time on the other side of me. At this point I decided that whether it was a malevolent force or not, it deserved respect, so I left it alone and continued to my dorm. 

I took a walk to an abandoned frat house, wondering if I would get any more freaky hallucinations. Supposedly, the place burned up in a meth-lab explosion a few years ago, and a kid died. I sat down on an overgrown blacktop and looked at the building. The windows were boarded up and I watched them change from brown to white. Strange shapes and faces looked back at me from the windows, but only the windows, none of the rest of the building changed in any noticeable way. After watching the clouds race by for a few minutes, I felt as if a great change was occurring, the weather foretold something about the future, but I couldn't place exactly what it was trying to say. 

After meeting my friends who sold me the acid, I was both glad and disappointed that I could talk coherently again. 

I headed back to my dorm after talking to them for awhile. My head was starting to hurt (similar to the first time I did mushrooms) and when I got inside it had become quite painful. I decided that maybe smoking a bowl would help, so I packed some Northern Lights and smoked it while hanging out with my roommate. As I smoked, the hallucinations hit me again, nearly as intense as back in the performing arts center. He was playing football on PS2 while I smoked. I saw that there were Referees sitting in different locations around our common room. One sat to my left, one to my right, and one stood in front of me near the TV. My roommate changed the channel to cartoons, commenting that watching them would have been strange on acid. Fortunately the trip hadnt ended yet and I watched him turn into a cartoon himself! When I told him this, he stood up and began waving his arms around, which promptly turned into flippers. I laughed hysterically. He thought it was amusing that he had flippers as well.

It was about 2 am by this point and I decided that it was time to go to sleep, after all, I did have class the next day. I laid down in my bed, staring at the morphing ceiling and eventually passed out. I woke up again at 5 am with a splitting headache. It was so bad that I had to walk to get some Tylenol before I could get to sleep again. This, in my opinion was the only negative of the whole trip.

In my personal experience, Acid is very similar to mushrooms, but it lacks the overwhelming emotional aspect of mushrooms. The emotions were intense, yes, but amusement and joy predominated. I was never once truly afraid, depressed or angry. Other similarities include the anxiety during the come-up, and the milder hallucinations. Acid most certainly surpasses mushrooms in visual intensity however, but left me much more drained than fungus does. I also noticed that my brains attention was strictly on the hallucinations. Not only were these strange sights interesting in a logical sense, but it actually felt good to look at them, much like eating a piece of candy. 

As for my previous argument about LSD versus DXM, Dex still holds the title for most intense. Never once did I feel like I couldnt handle what acid had to show me. Never was I panicked or confused which is fairly common in the midst of a robo-trip. LSD and DXM are nearly opposite in how they affected me. All of the visuals on LSD were external. Everything that I saw, heard and felt, came from outside. I tried to close my eyes at one point, curious to see if I would still hallucinate, but I did not. DXM requires no external stimulus at all and closing my eyes often increases the depth and intensity of the trip. This, among other chemical synergies between LSD and DXM leads me to wonder what taking both would be like.

It has been just over a year since my first and only LSD experience, but the impression it has left on my waking life is no less than it was a day after I took the substance.
A little background is first necessary before I delve into the long story that this trip report will undoubtedly become.  I was 19 years old at the time, and not exactly new to altered states of consciousness.  I had experienced mushrooms four times previously, ecstasy numerous times, nitrous oxide, speed and smoked weed almost every day.  I was also at a stage in my life where I wasnt quite sure of who I was in the world and, as I later realized, not very aware or awake in the Buddhist sense.

My experience on LSD, during the first semester holidays of my second year of university, was to change all that in a dramatic way.  A friend of mine, whom I had always considered a close friend, had obtained some trips and we planned a day to trip together.  We had had mushroom experiences and ecstasy experiences together in the past, and I figured that I was ready for whatever LSD was going to throw at me.

We took two blotters each at around 11:00 in the morning, at my house (I share a house with some university friends), and sat around on the verandah in the sun waiting for it to come on.  About 15 minutes of cigarettes and idle chatter passed before we decided to walk to the store and get some juice and something to eat.  The trip to the store passed uneventfully, and we returned to my house approximately half an hour later, still with no noticeable effects.  We decided to put on some music (Radiohead - Amnesiac) and sit in the lounge room listening to it. 

I started to notice a mild alteration of perception, and a slight lethargy come over me.  My friend was noticing similar effects.  The music also started to sound different, and if I closed my eyes I could almost feel myself melting into the couch.  After listening to the music for a while we decided to venture outside to explore.  By this time my perceptions were heavily altered with everything taking on that unexplainable look that only a trip can cause.  I remember walking past a neighbours house and being unable to keep myself from laughing at the strangeness of the plants in his front garden.  We walked the streets for a while, laughing and exploring the normally familiar neighbourhood that had taken on an entirely different appearance due to the LSD.  I remember thinking that the arrangement of plants in everyones gardens looked so fake and artificial.  The chaotic expression of nature had somehow been curtailed with this strange arrangement of plants all in neat little rows, an assortment of plants that would never be found in similar locations in the wild.

Somewhere around this point in time, I started to have an uncontrollable flood of introspective thoughts, from what must have been my subconscious.  We made it back to my house, and I was beginning to feel quite anxious, edgy and generally negative.  My friend and I smoked a few cones, and although I was momentarily amused by the whole action of smoking and the novelty of the bong, the weed didnt seem to have any effect on the experience at all.  The introspective cascade that was beginning centered around issues that plagued my life (and probably most peoples lives), but which I would normally refuse to acknowledge at a conscious level.  They were surfacing at a rapid rate and I was being forced to accept them, and deal with them.  

It was very stressful and I felt like my mind was being contorted and twisted.  At the same time that these issues emerged, I was able to look at them from a point of view semi-removed from my ego, the same ego that would have normally prevented me from acknowledging them to begin with.  The issues consisted of worries, fears, obsessions, subconscious motivations, etc. that would all normally, day to day, be operating somewhere in the background of my psyche; but the LSD had magnified them a million times so that they were inescapable.  At this point I was feeling very anxious, uncomfortable and stressed, to an extent I had tuned out my friend and was only paying minor attention to external events.  Although not significant to my trip experience we watched cartoons, surfed trippy websites, listened to music, played computer games, etc.

My friend had to leave at around 11:00 pm, because he had to work the next day, and while the peak of the experience was over, I was still tripping.  After he left I was at home on my own, and whatever external things had previously provided slight distractions to the introspective cataclysm I was going through were now totally gone.  At this point I ended up wandering into the bathroom and caught myself staring into the mirror.  Through will, I was able to change how my reflection appeared, from ugly to beautiful, from young to old, and eventually I realized the triviality of external appearance.  I was beautiful.  We all are beautiful.  Suddenly one of the great weights on my mind, that of a concern for body image and self-appearance, was totally lifted.  
What was the importance of appearance, if we all loved each other for who we truly are at heart?  I got this notion that true love transcended appearance, and while body image seemed to be something that modern society places such a premium on, in the end it counts for nothing.  This had special significance for me because prior to this I had been into working out and muscle building, and while tripping I almost felt disgusted with myself when I looked at my body.  The muscle I had worked so hard for seemed wrong.  I was able to totally see the motivations behind my actions, that I was aiming to improve my appearance so that I was more fitting to the modern notion of attractive, but what was the point of that?  If I was in a relationship with someone, or more, if I was in a relationship that involved true love, Id surely hope that my physical appearance wasnt that significant.

I decided to write a message to myself and save it into my mobile phone, so that I could remind myself of it in the future and generally have it handy as a way of connecting with the experience that was sure to fade as the drug wore off.  I wrote You are truly loved by someone when you are loved for what you are at heart.  Not for what you are trying to be, or for what they want you to be.  Within everyone there is a true notion of who they really are.  Their true inner self as such.  In everyday life such a notion gets buried in most people by the acting and role-playing we feel necessary to conduct.  People act in a manner that they think other people would want or expect them to act in, out of the fear that they wont be accepted if they dont.  Our big game of acceptance I coined it; everyone constructing a persona that they feel will allow others to accept them.  This was also cast aside by the LSD mind state.  I reconnected with my true self, a childlike, fun-loving, happy-go-lucky individual.  Something that had been semi-buried under a constructed exterior.

I eventually made it to sleep, and when I woke the next day I was the happiest and most mentally serene Id been in my life.  Anything that would have normally been troubling my mind, preventing me from being happy and free right at the moment, was gone!  This state of mental tranquility and happiness lasted for a few days, and slowly faded as new issues settled back into my subconscious.  My true self was somewhat tempered as time passed, but Ive made a conscious effort to not let it become completely buried.  A few months later this experience spawned an interest in Buddhism, which Ive taken to practicing, as a way of training my mind.  I firmly believe that through meditation the mental tranquility that I attained during this experience can be cultivated and continued, without the aid of any drug.  LSD just showed me that it was possible and that the key to happiness in this world lies in our minds.

The intro:
Let's start out with your basic introduction.  I am your average late-teen, early-twenty year old psychonaut.  I've injested countless quantities of short acting tryptamines, phenethylamines, cactii, mushrooms, and I quit counting after my 55th acid trip.  Don't get me wrong though, I'm not an escapist.  I don't want to leave what I have.  I love every aspect of my life.  I have a wonderful girlfriend, maintain a Dean's List standing at a University, and have a job that pays well.  My parents have always cared for me, and although haven't always approved of what I've done, they've never left my side.  So maybe you'll call that typical, boring, or ordinary.  Well it's extra-ordinary!  I adore what I have and what I felt I almost gave up.

The story:
It was my birthday.  It was July 9th in the extraordinary summer of 2003.  I just turned 21 and all was peachy.  I had 5 days off of work and I was on a road-trip to see my best friend in the world, Nathan.  At the time he went to school in Alabama and I was at U of M.  Last time we were together had been over a year ago.  At that point, he had come to visit me and we painted the town red.  Needless to say I was very excited to go see him.  I had never been to his condo before and was so anxious to give my friend a ginormous hug.  Since I had just turned 21, I was of legal stature to buy beer and we just planned on getting really shitty.  I am not much of a drinker, but sometimes it's wonderful to just get hammered and reminisce.

During the 5 and a half hour voyeur to Tuscaloosa to visit my comrade he called my cell phone and told me that he had a birthday present for me.  I sped up to 80 miles an hour in anticipation.  Finally, with punk music blaring I pulled up to the unfamiliar territory and was greeted by him outside.  I dropped my backpack on the driveway and hugged his neck.  It had been damn near a year since we last spoke in person and even when I arrived we spoke, wordless.  Nothing but pleasant company was to be had.

We walked inside and sat down.  He offered me a drink and some food and I graciously accepted.  While he was making preparation, I was thumbing through a stack of Calvin and Hobbes books on the coffee table.  It was just mindless occupation before I asked where the bathroom was.  He motioned around the corner.  It was at this point that I actually looked at the set up.

It was a relatively typical condo.  After walking in the front door, immediately in front was a kitchen, to the side, a living room.  There was a spiral staircase between the kitchen and living room that led up to the computer 'room'.  The staircase was wrought iron with grating for stairs and there was a light set below it.  It was more or less a balcony on top that overhung the den.  The bedrooms were set in the very front of the place and I was to sleep in his roommates sister's room.  I set my stuff in there, peed and came back out.

I looked around and Nathan was there on the couch with a little box with an itty bitty bow on top.  I asked if that was to be my birthday present and he replied with a smile and nod.  He said that I should open it now and that's exactly what I did.  All I saw inside was a little plastic bag on top of a cotton cushion.  Inside that bag contained a 9 hit square of extremely potent blotter.  Later, I would find out exactly how powerful this was.

Each hit was imprinted with a black Timothy Leary face with whatever array of dazzling psychedelic color that lie behind him.  Instantly I knew what it was.  I had heard about this going around from a previous trip to New Orleans but had not managed to put my hands on any.  Nathan's roommate had, however, bought an entire sheet of the stuff and sent us on our merry adventure.  I didn't plan on doing this through the course of the evening, but plans change.

He asked if I wanted to drop that evening or tomorrow.  I just shrugged my shoulders and put it under my tongue.  He laughed and did the same.  

Okay, I know what the readers are thinking.  What a moron, he just ate 9 hits of acid, rumored to be quite good.  Well, my friends, I must concur, but my concurrence will come later in this tale.  Right now, I just want to reiterate how little of a stranger I am to the discovery of Dr. Haufmann.  I've consumed as many as 10 hits of powerful acid in my day in public places, unfamiliar places, with a sour state of mind, etc.  I've dealt with 2 relatively bad trips and one was on a 9 hit escapade.  Let's just say that I'm very familiar with my body and it's reaction to LSD.

The hot wings finished cooking about 15 minutes later and we ate them.  I kind of needed something to settle my stomach because that first wave of acid influx had ocurred.  I'm not used to such a rapid onset, but I take it in stride.  It was when washing my hands after peeing again that I noticed the amide starting to take effect.  The sink seemed a distance away and my hands did not feel like they were on my body.  

I loved that first rush of acid.  It felt like something wasn't right but I am unsure of what it is.  That twinge in the front of my head and the shifty body buzz that moves ever more pervasively through me.  Anyone who has eaten acid knows this feeling of initial uncertainty.

So feeling heavy and odd yet smiling I go to consume the hot wings.  They tasted like something Emerill would make.  We each sit down with our plate and turn on comedy central.  It was 7 o'clock because a new episode of South Park is on.  We finish our hot wings and wait a while longer.  The sun sinks into it's western horizon.  It was an omen, a forebearer of the night to come.  As it set, so the acid set in.  Sparking of South Park characters Kenny and Kartman was proficient in their eyes.  I looked outside and saw a pink sky that began to change color to orange then to red.  My arm itched, I looked down and my hair was growing, moving, shimmying around a fly that wasn't there.  I smiled and invited my friend to go outside and enjoy a cigarette with me.

It tasted strange but I was so enthralled with the surroundings that were consuming me, that I didn't really notice.  The sky was a kaleidoscopic display of stars coupling with the sunset.  It was the perfect natural ballet.  The grass was growing very tall in the very back of his yard and they seemed to be carassing the sun that had almost left the sky.  The grass grew into distant trees and I started hearing the colors, especially the greens.  They were whispering peaceful thoughts about nature.  The leaves on one tree started laughing so I asked it what it was laughing at, telepathically, and they said that the stars were fucking.  I smiled and told them to hold on.  I looked at the stars and saw them with an unknown clarity.  The sun waned further down.  Only a stark blue tinge was left.  I laid down with Nathan crown to crown and we watched the stars produce more stars.  I could command them with my thoughts.  I asked their permission to see constellations.  They bowed and whatever constellation I wanted to see, they gave way.

At some point, Nathan had left the outer realm to go and play the guitar inside.  I went in after who knows how long to see what goodies I could find inside.  I wanted to talk with Nate about the beauty and awe that we had eaten.  I saw his door was shut.  I heard a noise from that direction and saw it open.  He ran naked through the den into his roommates sister's bedroom, into the closet and shut the door.  The only thing he had was an acoustic guitar.  I laughed at the thought and retired to the Salvador Dali book.  How vibrant!

His roommate walks in the door.  I didn't know who he was and he asked if I was the guy who was going to eat acid with Nathan.  I had forgotten I ate it until that point but said that I was.  He said it was cool and asked how much I had eaten.  I remembered it was a square and told him 9 Timothy Leary heads.  He looked at me with shock or some sort of emotion that only a head full of acid could describe.  So the roommate grew into the floor and turned into an alien and started speaking in a language I didn't know, or didn't think I did.  However, when I really concentrated I knew what he was saying.  

'9'  It was a question, not a statement.  He then did the absolute stupidest thing that one can ever do to another while on a strong acid trip.  He said, 'Uh-oh.'  The beautiful reds and yellows of the room turned into a violent violet and deep blue with hues of shadows looming over me.  I was getting the fear.  I managed to ask him what Uh-oh meant in my newly found tongue.  His voice turned to static.  All I heard was garbled, muffled foreign language.  I again concentrated on the statement as much as I could.  It was like listening to Chinese on a cell phone, but I made him write it down.  All the page said was two things really big.  'Double dipped' and '18 hits'.  The 1 from the 18 slithered off the page.

Instantly the trip intensified to an unparalleled degree.  It was a personal insanity.  Things streched and grew.  People from far off places appeared in the brick walls.  The couch threatened me.  I did everything i could to keep from thinking that I took double the acid that I've ever taken, but alas, I was peaking and couldn't help it.  The furniture changed colors and began melting into puddles. The liquified cotton and wool spread around the apartment and it began to flood.  I began to cry to Nathan to get out of the room because the house was sinking.  He never heard me.  I was sure he had died.  The only way I could survive was to climb the staircase.  The staircase was unfriendly and very hard to navigate.  I just crawled, and crawled until I reached the carpet above.  I laid down and looked at the ceiling.  I looked through the railing down to the floor and everything down there was completely normal.  I finally calmed down a bit and remembered that I had eaten acid and this was a result of the drugs I had consumed.

I wasn't done yet.

I was too scared to go back downstairs.  The fear still crept in me.  I thumbed through a magazine of fashion that was up on the indoor overhang and saw a picture of a really odd leather jacket.  It was red and pinstriped.  There was a hat above it as well with the same motif.  

One thing worth mentioning is that I am sitting on the computer chair using the monitor's light to help me out.  I couldn't find a light switch and Nathan, for one reason or another, unplugged everything in the house that was electronic except the computer.  He told me later that the clocks were fucking with him.  

Anyway, while looking at the picture, the computer went into power save mode and suspended itself.

Dark.  A more pervading nothing than anyone can imagine.  It was terrifying.  It was ultimate void.  I got dizzy.  The fear started knawing at me.  The pages of the magazine got hot to the touch and I threw it on the desk.  I got so scared that I tried to throw up, but I could not.  I paced, and all the while praying for whatever else was left to hurry and end.  In my clumsy disorientation I hit the table and the magazine fell.  With luck, I hit the table hard enough and the monitor flicked back on from the mouse movement, I think.  

The pages were making a noise on the ground, muffled and strange.  I picked it up and there was the leather jacket/hat thing again.  This time it was different though.  The blackness that I mentioned earlier wasn't anywhere around me.  It had concentrated between the collar of the jacket and the brim of the hat on the paper.  This blackness was emotionless.  It was deeper than space and time.  It was a black that only hell could spawn.  Yet I was strangely drawn to it.  I heard the voice again.  It erupted from the depth with a shy and booming voice.  

It communicated with me.  It asked what I wanted.  I didn't know I responded.  Should you go deeper?  Should I travel the void?  I didn't decline.  Whatever it was told me to look at the grandfather clock.  I did.  The pendulum stopped.  Slowly the second hand halted.  I looked at the page again and it was just a black blur.  I put my hand on the page and remember closing my eyes.

I was frozen.  I was no longer a human being.  I was a cog in the 4th dimension.  I was the extradimensional being that existed only in the space of time.  A voice surrounded me.  It asked what my perception of time was.  I didn't know.  It explained to me the difficulty that people have with time.  He said that the reason so many people are late for so many things is that they believe in time, but are unsure if it exists.  I said that time didn't exist.  We invented it.  He said that an idea is stronger than a piece of stone.  An idea will live on forever and that stone will crumble.  Time is only as real as we make it.  

I could move again, but I still couldn't see.  Time was now a figment of my imagination.  Age, clocks, birthdays, years: all meant nil.  It was an offspring of an idea that was in itself non-existent.  I made it down the staircase.  Finally I felt as though I was coming down.  However, this poignant thought still rebounded through my head.  I walked into the bathroom and made the mistake of turning on the light and looking in the mirror.  

I was older.  Not much, but enough to notice.  I contemplated myself and my existence.  Then I remembered the voice in the void.  Age isn't real.  Time is an idea.  I looked at the pimples and my 5 o'clock shadow.  It wasn't hair on my face.  It was black ants and they were moving rapidly up and down my cheeks.  They were biting me and turning into wrinkles and made me look really old.  I felt as though I were 100.  I was weak and tired so I sat down on the toilet.  I was exhausted.  Finally I stood up and I had returned to normal.

I walked out of the bathroom and looked around.  Color shifting had almost ceased.  I think I fell asleep on the toilet for an hour or two.  The den had lightened a bit.  I looked outside and the sun was rising.  Had I really been panicking for 12 hours?  What part was real?  Was it a nightmare?  The answer is 'yes' and 'no'.

Conclusion:

A personal quote of mine is: You don't go to the fair to ride the carousel.  Well faithful readers, I definitely rode all the roller coasters.

LSD





dear psychonauts, those who would be such and simply curious ones, this is an email I wrote today to my very close friend describing my latest LSD trip that I would also like to share with all of u:

Hello sweetheart,

Thank again for your courageous input. I understand I mustve spooked u out quite a bit with my previous email. I was at a low ebb, true. But things drastically changed soon after, I had what seemed like a short-term breakdown on the day of the equinox which was the 20th I believe and the next morning things just fell into place, I understood what the problem was and was able to resolve it. I understood the nature of human games, to use Tim Learys lingo, and remembered who I really am and my relationship with these games, which until that morning was grossly misconceived. The advice in your emails was of tremendous help, concise and right to the point. I was able to use it as a sort of a guide. Thank u. As for psychedelic drugs, Ive done none since leaving Vancouver (3 months ago) except for trying a few new things of semipsychedelic nature and smoking pot less then a dozen times. However my odyssey in the magickal and phantastik Montreal has generated a great psychic buildup revolving around many synchronicities, internal changes, great philosophical highs and new experiences and people. 

I was waiting to release this psychic buildup in one culminating experience, which is what happened on the morning of march 30th in the form of an LSD trip with my friend (it was his 1st LSD trip) on Mount Royal, a mountain overlooking Montreal. As expected, I obtained the sacrament through interesting means (many thanks to my cybermystic friends) and needless to say it was of very high quality, strong and clean. We started our gradual dosing at 2:30am. I am very cautious when it comes to dosing because Im physically hypersensitive to this chemical and because it was my friends 1st time and thus his reaction to it was unknown; in the past Ive made the mistake of not being ultradiligent about gradually dosing myself in small doses (1/4 hits in this case) in timed succession which resulted several times in adverse physical reactions such as ultrarapid heart rate and severe cramps as well as negative psychological reactions such as panic attacks. What follows is a brief account, omitting many important details and nuances, of the highlights that I was able to bring back to baseline memory from this trip. It is important to keep in mind that less then 1 percent of such experiences can be expressed through words.  

We met in shivering mountaintop cold an ultrapsychedelic sunrise which began at about 5:20am with a view over the entire city laughing our heads off, having a sci-fi rock star trip, but it was when the final doses kicked in that things got weird (there was a total of 1 and ¾ hits consumed by each one of us over roughly 2  2 ½ hours). I went into a peak sitting on a bench all hunched and curled up in my red psychonaut suit. My heart pumping hard and all my muscles trembling, I plunged into a world of death and decay, every part of my body being violently ripped apart (mind u I was hoping and intending and ready for this), a sensation well captured by Alex Greys painting journey of the wounded healer. 

It is difficult to recall an accurate chronology of these things now but eventually: I was a mythic character fighting a giant eagle; my body was exploding in razor sharp light; I experienced the one mind as a golden conical pillar studded with faces, myself being just one such face, which would morph into this pillar as this pillar itself would morph into circular spiraling fractals only to reform itself again; I clearly heard as if it actually was consistently and unalterably outside of myself Tibetan monks chanting (Im not Buddhist or of any religion for that matter); I found myself in a crib in a different higher frequency dimension being what I nicknamed an alien morphonogenic baby which was hooked up at its nerve centers (or chakra points if u prefer) and other nerve/energy points to high frequency energy wires/channels with zany alien entities hustling and bustling over and around me. They seemed to match the descriptions of what Terence McKenna called the self-transforming machine elves, entities often encountered during DMT trips (which I have yet to experience). 

They seemed very preoccupied with my well-being, communicating with each other in an elfish language that was based on frequency modulation instead of syntactical blocks of sound; this language was rather well imitated at the beginning of a Shpongle song called shiva space technology. As I have said, these alien entities seemed very preoccupied with my well-being and I realized that my ego and being in this physical world is a test for this alien morphonogenic baby to endure and complete. It is like a birthing process or strengthening and maturation process it must go through to be ready for life in this other dimension where these alien entities are waitingwaitingwaiting hopinghopinghoping that it can make it, monitoring its progress. 

As the intensity of the peak decreased slightly, I was forced due to circumstances to leave the bench and the area it was in with my friend. Now about my friend. He is an incredibly intelligent and creative man close to twice my age (Im 20 now) and has many therapeutic issues. He however has undergone several major awakenings (for lack of a better word) in this past year thanks to the use of psilocybin mushrooms and nitrous oxide and the Burning Man experience as well as experiences of regional Burning Man events near Montreal, so I was hoping he would address these issues in this trip since I believed he was ready. As we roamed through the sunlit Mount Royal forest paths, my trip was making me increasingly more mellow and balanced and centered, while he was increasingly breaking down in the classical LSD therapy style. This included regression and surfacing of repressed material as well a spiritual urgency for transcendence. I knew however that I must stick with him through this and help him through it no matter what, this was my mission and purpose, the application of the psychedelic experience in this world instead of letting it be just another tv show. 

As his breakdown was increasingly intensifying, communication between us was becoming more and more difficult and since I was just as loaded as he was, forming coherent sentences and soberly reacting to the situation and thinking in linear logic was a great challenge. We eventually ended up at his grandparents grave in a cemetery on Mount Royal. At this point he was becoming increasingly paranoid and suspicious of me. He later told me once we were back to baseline that at that point he was perceiving me as Satan who was trying to keep him in the human game of mundanity and suffering and prevent him from mustering all the courage and bravery in him to use this very special opportunity to climb to the top and leap into and take off with the solar wind, as he was then incoherently and graspingly describing it. Kneeling on his grandparents grave, he then proceeded to murmur a prayer Is there any remover of difficulties save God? Say praised be God. He is God. All are His servants and all abide by His bidding, over and over and over again, him being a very open minded adherent of the Bahai Faith. 

I was lying beside him on the grass a few feet away with my eyes closed during this recitation when a face formed out of my closed-eyes fractals. I felt right away that it was a face of what some may call a spirit or angel and it was looking mostly at him, sometimes at me. When his prayer recitation stopped, we had another confrontation that finally pushed him to his edge that we both so desired. He stood up and began reiterating the prayer again. Only this time it was becoming louder and louder, until he was bellowing it at the top of his lungs, foaming at the mouth, eyes closed, head raised, arms extended, fists clenched, in deep deep trance, possessed, the prayer thundering rolling resounding across the mountain, a religious epiphany at its ultimate. This went on for a few minutes and when he was done, he marched off amidst the gravestones never looking back as I stood there with the most gleeful grin on my face, knowing that my purpose of being one of the links in someones life towards such an epiphany was complete. 

I lay back down on the grass, watching what I see before me form out of fractals, still hearing the elves talk and particles shrilling by, every thought plunging me into its own well of infinity. And finally I understood that there is no need to break down such experiences with rational skepticism, that critical and rational and skeptical thinking must be applied to what u choose to do with such experiences when u come back down in order to avoid superstition and bigotry and cultish thinking and behavior. Yet it is equally important not to use the thinking of materialistic science, or what I call archaic or immature science, to declare such experiences invalid. I just take them for what they are, an experience in itself, a gift I can apply in the mundane physical reality. And so I did, lying there in the grass under a tree amidst the graves, floating off into an ocean of suns.

Location: Chapel of Sacred Mirrors, NYC... Alex Grey live painting event
Dose: 10 strip of good, clean white on white.

I had been saving some paper for the past couple of months to do a higher dose trip with when I got the chance. About a week ago, a friend of mine told me that Alex Grey would be doing a live painting at his space in Manhattan, along w/ psychadelic dub/trance, and this sounded like the perfect place to take the dose i wanted.

I have been to CoSM in the past and really enjoyed the space. It has a main area that is used for dance classes, yoga, etc w/ a big open floor and mirrored wall... this is the room that had the music and artists. There is also 'The Chapel' where the original paintings of Grey's that everyone knows are on display... unfortunately, we found out when we got there that this room wouldn't be open.

On saturday I worked until 11pm when my girlfriend and two other friends met me at my work and we jumped a cab down to CoSM. After making it up the 4 flights of steps and paying the $15 entry, we made our way into the main room. There weren't really many people there at this point.. maybe 30-40 total. I managed to find my friend that told me about the event pretty easily. I had brought a couple extra pieces of paper and gave them to him. My girlfriend took 1.5 hits and I placed the ten strip on my tongue...

This took place at about 11:30pm

When i take 'cid, no matter what the dose, I know it right away... I feel this feeling start at the base of my neck and carry down to right below my sternum, not quite in my stomach. It's a strange electric feeling... like 'the tripping' is just waiting in there to come out.

We took a few minutes to check out the area we were in... it was one big room that had been partially partitioned into three areas using hanging tapestries/curtains. In the corner when you first came in was the first painter... he was doing a sort of cathedral on dark canvas.. it was in the very beginning stages so it was hard to tell exactly where it was going. To the right of him was where the musicians and visuals people were set up... they had two live drummers, trumpet player, dj, vj, and a lot of equipment. When we first got there the music was very organic and chill... nice psychadelic electronic dub, for lack of a better description. The visuals screens were playing cool shots of plants opening that had been computer altered to have eyes on flower petals and the stems of the plants... and some cool cgi of robotic plants. Across from the musicians was were Alex Grey was set up... He had laid out a sacred geometric pattern on a black canvas prior to coming and was painting a skull over that, using an actual skull in his hand as a model. To his left, in the back corner of the room was the third artist... she was the only one that wasn't painting on dark canvas and was using a much more airy, light style than Grey or the other artist.

Now, i had come to this party w/ work on me... hopefully you all know what that means. So, for the first 30-45min i was doing a lot of favors... and the place was gaining people pretty steadily. I don't generally talk to people i don't know.. so, i just floated the word with my friends that if people talked to them, they could come find me. It's a pretty safe method, and i know a couple people that work at CoSM which helps reduce the risk, too.

After this, I took a minute to sit with my friends and smoke a bowl of some 'mist' and eat some fruit snacks... I could feel the tripping feeling coming on pretty steady and was starting to notice the wobbly vision in the corners of my eyes that lets me know the fun has started. I watched the visual screens for a while and talked to my girlfriend and friends.

It was now approx 12:15am

I got into a pretty lengthy discussion about high dose tripping with my friend that invited me.. (I guess we'll call him matt). Matt had taken 20mg 2C-I, 1.5g mushrooms, and some sort of tea that i can't remember, that night... but has had some higher dose mushroom trips and L trips. At first I listened to him talk about his theories about different psychedelics and their different 'resonances'... this is was basically an idea that on some super molecular level all psychedelics resonate at a different pace... this causes subsonic vibrations that alter your visual perception, aural perception and mood... all in all a pretty interesting theory, but he can dive really, reallly deep into that stuff.. and while i'm interested in the science of psychedelics, i don't necessarily like getting to deep into it while actually tripping.

We started talking about my half oz experience and what it was like in comparison to an 11g experience he had. This in turn led to a conversation on death. We talked about our different theories on what the actual 'dying process' is going to be like... all in all it was a pretty interesting conversation.

As I was talking to Matt, I started noticing pretty strong visuals coming on. There was a pattern over my entire field of vision that pulsated and pixellated along w/ the music and dancing... waves of color would start on one side of my vision and sweep to the other, constantly fluctuating in brightness and color tone. At some points I would notice a bright spot in the center of my vision that would sort of 'explode' outwards in all directions. Within this patterning would also be spots that would appear closer to me than others, and spots that made things seem farther away... it gave a really strange, carnival-mirror distortion to everything around me. Once i started to notice these things, it took me a minute to be able to focus correctly and navigate the room.. it was getting more and more crowded very quickly.

It was getting close to 1am by now...

I broke off my conversation on death with matt to join my girlfriend for a bit. We decided to check up on the paintings that were being done and to watch Grey paint for a little bit. It was really cool because he was on the same floor level as the crowd and totally amongst the crowd... you could talk to him while he was painting, and while i didn't personally do this he seemed very accomodating of the people that chose to speak to him.

My girlfriend wanted to try and get to see the chapel even though it was closed.. so we headed off to find my friend that works at CoSM to see if we may be able to get a peek inside. We were told that this wasn't possible, as it would risk him getting into trouble, which i didn't want to do. So, we settled for the next best thing.. the prints that are in display in the hallways and sitting room outside the chapel.

We looked at a few prints and sat down to talk. At this point i was tripping very hard visually. There was no unaltered point in my vision.. the world had become a very, very interesting place. I would have stalls in my vision where everything would go 'stop'.. then motion a few seconds later.. a strobe-light like effect, i guess. I really don't remember what exactly we were talking about.. I think I was just recounting my conversation with matt and some of the scientific aspects of psychadelics that she really doesn't think or know about.

In the middle of the conversation this guy comes out of nowhere... and i mean this almost literally, considering the amount of distortion in my peripheral vision he basically appeared our of a colorful box. He appeared waving a $20 bill in my face and saying something about $10. I was completely thrown off and really didn't know what this guy was asking me... I didn't recognize him and definately had not talked to him that night. At first i thought he wanted two tens for a twenty and told him i didn't have change.. then he said something about wanting something blue, and i told him i didn't have anything blue... and then he said he wanted '$10 and $10'. I'm getting really frustrated with this guy at this point.. i'm like, '$10 of what? i don't have anything for $10'... and he took off. This was in front of about 15-20 people and was a pretty uncomfortable situation. I didn't really handle it the best, but all things considered I did my best.

I decided I wanted to go find my friend to see if he knew this guy. I found matt pretty easily and he told me that a guy he knew had just come and talk to him and was looking for something for $10, but that he had told him not to talk to me. After a few minutes, the guy came back around... it was the same person, and somebody I had met once before but didn't recognize at all. I politely explained to him never to run up to me waving money and to try and be a little more discreet in his personal business... he appologized and everything was kosher.

It was getting close to 2am at this point...

My girlfriend and I went to find our other friends.. they were all near Grey watching him paint and dancing. By this point in the night the dynamic of the event had completely changed. The organic, chill music and evolved into psy-trance... the crowd had changed... there were a lot, a lot of people and the place was really hot. We came to find out that a psy-trance party that was being thrown elsewhere had been shut down so all the people there had headed to CoSM. Amongst the new immigrants to the party was a large segment of eastern european men that are at a lot of psy-trance events in the area... they are generally thuggish and show up to push a lot of substances really fast. They add an uncomfortable edge to things, I think, and I wasn't happy to see them there.

After talking to our friends for a bit, I got too hot and headed back into the sitting room to cool off. I took off my hoodie and sat down. I just kicked back and did some thinking. I thought about my job, i thought about my side work, i thought about my girlfriend and our relationship... and the whole time i was just blown away by how hard i was tripping. It was completely manageable for me at this point.. it took focus and some mental power to be able to navigate the crowd, do favors, hold conversation, etc.. but it was w/in my grasp. I have taken many, many 10strips in the past.. but that was during a time when i took acid about 2x a week... so the tolerance factor was obviously there. This was about as hard as I can ever remember tripping on acid.

I started thinking about where I was right then.. I was in an environment I love.. in a scene I love.. with people I really enjoy. And I thought about how much risk it took to live a life that I really enjoy.

This is time for yoschie's personal history 101.. or this trip report won't make sense.

In the beginning of 2000 I started working for a sound company that did sound/light production for clubs and raves throughout new england. We did events every weekend in NY, CT, MA, NH, ME... all over... and on the rare night we didn't do an event, I would use my status w/ a production companies to go to events for free. I met some really good people during this time... and also made some really nice connections for obtaining quantity of L and other substances. It wasn't long before I started investing in sheets of paper and getting rid of it at parties and concerts.

I was in school full time and hustling in all my other available time. I had VIP access to so many events and was granted free roam at a lot of places. This led to a pretty big business for a college student. I started out making about $500 extra on the weekends.. but by the beginning of september when i hit my biggest night, i pulled in $11,500 in one night.

I have always hustled, since highschool.. usually just buy enough of something so that once everyone else pays for what they want, mine is free... but, this was actual business.. and lots of money. I loved it.. I loved the lifestyle.. I loved the fact that i could hold a lot of shit together at one time.. I loved the risk, even.

By september of 2000, i had graduated from school.. and jumped on the fall phish tour. I only made it about half way across, to Chicago, when I was arrested. Basically, I ended up charged with 9 state felonies and 4 federal charges relating to the possession and distribution of controlled substances.

I was released and had to return home to my parents for the duration of the trial period. In the beginning of 2001, I took a plea for 1 felony and walked with 2.5yrs probation and fines... not really a bad outcome.

Over the next 4 years i tried all the time to start really working and stop hustling.. but, at the same time i didn't try and quit doing drugs at all.. I didn't want that. and as long as I am around these things, I hate paying retail for any of them.. so it leads to a pattern. Especially since with my new felony to put on my record, it was really hard to find a job at all, let alone one that actually payed well.

I worked off and on in PA and CO.. and got arrested again in CO in 2003... I wound up doing almost 5 months in jail at the beginning of 2004 and then was put on probation upon my release. I totally fucked up my probation.. I had 7 hot UAs in like 3 months and went through a few jobs... the entire time i was working, i wasn't really working. Finally i was sent back in front of a judge, but my probation officer didn't show up to court and the vioations were all dismissed. I was refiled into the system... and apparently my file was lost... I waited 8 months and was never contacted by anyone. That's when I moved out here to NYC, with the intentions of changing.

so, the point of all that back story..

--

back to the trip..

I was thinking about all this past history of mine.. and how I had really tried to stop my repetitive actions, but that I really don't want to. For some reason, I really enjoy it. Maybe I have some fatal character flaw that when I think about the consequences of my actions.. and the effect that my going to jail would have on my family, my girlfriend, and my friend... that it hurts me to think that they would hurt, but that i don't get the thought that I should stop. I just think, 'that's reason to be more careful.'

I recognize this thought pattern, and constantly do battle with myself about how to change it.. or if I really even want to. So, that's what I was doing now... looking at the night and just how risky it had gotten.. with the random man waving money and the unsavory crowd element.. and the fact that I was tripping really hard. I also started thinking about the fact that i had to work in approx. 12hrs.. and while I knew that I wouldn't be tripping then, I knew that I was going to be tripping for a while and would enjoy it more at home now.

I decided that it was time to go... it was not a major decision.. I wasn't having a bad time.. I would have been able to stay and have fun, but I had to work and wanted to be rested.  I debated it in my head for a few minutes.. but decided that leaving had definately become a process at this point in the evening.. I had to get my jacket and girlfriend.. find and say goodbye to about 5 people.. and take care of some the last minute business that people always want when you're leaving.  It was now that my hoodie decided to get the best of me and proved that it was really time to go.

It was roughly 2:20am.

When I took my hoodie off, somehow i pulled the one arm w/in the other arm. When i went to put my hoodie back on, I was met with a formidable opponent. Basically the arms had become like one of those liquid filled tubes that slides back and forth. I was sure that my hoodie had two arms.. i had just taken it off.. but i couldn't for the life of me find the one arm due to the fact that they had been connected. The dark room and visual distortion made this task very difficult. Thankfully, after a few failed attempts and getting into my hoodie, Matt came by and after humorously explaining my situation to him, he found the culprit arm and helped me into my hoodie. I'm sure this whole sequence was extremely enjoyable for all the people around me to watch.

After defeating my hoodie, I went to locate my girlfriend and tell her that I had decided that I was leaving. I wanted her to come with me, too. I located her, and told her, 'it's time for me to go.'... apparently she thought this meant I was not ok.. and after a few questions on why I wanted her to come with me, she came. I left looking like i was having a bad time, apparently.. but it wasn't really that... and I just didn't feel like sitting there and explaining that I wanted my girlfriend to come w/ me so that i had someone to tell all this shit to... so, when she asked me, 'do you want me to come with you because you can't go by yourself?' I said, 'yeah.' It just made the leaving process easier.


It was about 2:45 by the time we finally headed to the exit..

On the way out, I was really excited to see Alex Grey standing with a bunch of prints near the entrance, so I took the chance to go say hello.. shake his hand... and to tell him 'thank you for the artwork and opening your space to us all like this... it's really been an honor.'.. he replied with, 'thank you for coming and sharing this with me.' It was really pretty cool.

So, we headed back into the world... down the 4 flights of steps and onto the street. It was chaos out there. CoSM is on the same street as like 4-5 other large clubs, so there were tons of people on the street, people shouting, cabs honking... and the wind was howling... it was crazy out there.

We managed to flag a cab, and after a brief altercation with a couple girls that tried to steal our cab when it moved to a safer loading location, we headed to my girlfriend's apartment in Brooklyn.

The ride to her apartment was spent by me trying to explain to her my real intentions behind having her leave with me.. about how we were a 'unit' and I just though that it was the best idea for the both of us to leave then so that we could spend some of the trip alone. I also explained to her the dilemma I felt that I was in regarding my current and ongoing relationships with drugs... and how I thought that for me to really quit doing more than just doing drugs, that I would have to quit doing drugs.

It was a little after 3am by the time we got back to Brooklyn...

After getting back to her apartment, we spent a few hours looking at some photo books and talking about a lot of things regarding our relationship, our relationships with our friends and where we see our lives going in general.. individually and as a couple. I talked myself out of hustling and back into it about 5 times during the conversation.. and really reached no real conclusion. As bad as I can make myself feel for living the way I do, I see the side of it that is ok just as easy.

I also tried to explain to her the visuals I was seeing.. and in the process had one of the strangest acid visuals ever. We had been talking about me getting a ktten at my new apartment earlier, and as i'm standing talking to my girlfriend I see one of those explosions of color.. but coming from the left side of it is a black silhouette of a cat.. like a halloween cut-out, sort of.. and it comes with the wave of color, but then it's like it entered my head at the left corner of my eye and i saw the image of a cat in my head. Totally bizarre, but pretty cool. It led to me kind of flinching and saying, 'a cat just jumped into my head.' hehe.. it obviously made no sense to my girlfriend.

The visuals were still really strong at this point.. about 4.5 hours after dosing... but much more enjoyable in a home setting.. much more controllable for the most part and more able to be focused on. I when i looked straight ahead, i described my visuals to my girlfriend like this,

'About one foot in front of my face there is a plane.. it's sort of like there is a really fine screen right in front of my face. I know that's what past this is real, and what i see on this screen is altered. Now, it looks like behind this screen there are orbs.. or something round making alternating areas of spherical vision.. rounded edges, etc. And, the whole thing is pulsating lightly.. it's like if you were to lay on level with a speaker.. and watch it play really low frequency sound over a long period.. that slight vibration that the speaker cone has is what this screen looks like. But, that will change with the pace of music or sound in general. And, on this screen there is a basic pattern.. sort of like an escher drawing... but, this morphs at times, too. sometimes the pixellation will drop out at one point and just be very clear on one side of my vision and then wave from side to side. Sometimes I have like rainbows of color that just appear from nowhere and completely change the tint of the room. Sometimes there are explosions of color and patterning that make it really difficult to see what is real at all. That's why sometimes you'll see me stop and either close one eye, or close both eyes and shake my head.. it's like a kaleidoscope, it changes my focus.'

6:00am - We put on some music and went to bed for a bit... considering my girlfriend had taken a substantially lesser dose, she was done tripping before me and went to sleep. I spent the remainder of my trip snacking and relaxing.. and took a shower.

I layed down for a little bit, and then headed to work at 3pm.. still with a little visual distortion from dosing at ~11:30pm.

--

So, all in all a very nice trip.. taught me that for similar situations a 10strip is not really kosher anymore if I plan on doing people favors, too.. that I have to just be tripping to do that much in a social setting.. 10strips+ are no longer party dosages for me... but, are still well within my enjoyable trip range.. it leaves me anxious for the next step up.

SET + SETTING
This is the 4th high dose trip Ive had in 5 weeks. I have not written trip reports for 2 of the other ones unfortunately so there is a big gap to where I was before and where I am now. My setting is that of my condo in the woods. A private place with electricity, running water, a computer with good music, eyeshades, art-supplies, and most importantly PRIVACY!

I was feeling very sick and weak from a cold I had caught a few days before dropping the 8 hits. I was worried that the weakened state of my immune system, body, and mind collectively would change my acid experience. With these concerns in mind I still dropped the acid. Within 30 minutes I was flat on my back with my eye-shades on and tribal music playing. It was the fastest LSD has ever come on for me.

Now Im not so hot at writing descriptive trip reports, its really a difficult thing to do, as those of you who have tried Im sure know. So many things happened, that I will try to go over the themes in a relatively chronological order.

Blast Off
The first theme was definitely death coming on. My arms felt like they had 50 needles in them sucking all the blood out. My arms felt heavy and extremely, extremely, cold. I really felt like I was in danger with dying as I wasnt sure if this state of psychological death would help the cold virus take over my body and actually kill me. I said fuck it, and let the trip continue with no psychological defenses. Its important to note by the way, that I used to have huge psychological defenses, but the LSD through these 5 weeks has systematically destroyed them, and now ever deeper parts of my mind are coming to the surface. Fascinating.

The trip continued to a scene similar to the movie Contact with Jodie Foster. I found myself saying good-byes to everyone I have ever known, and everything I was in my life. I was in a little space capsule and I blasted off through the cosmos. I was space traveling, a large part of my ego was missing. But I was still there as in I could think and be like  wow - this is interesting.

Meet your Maker

This was perhaps the scariest and paradoxically at the same time, most soothing part of the trip. I found myself in a big factory. I was a Model-T so to speak. There was like millions of empty bodies and gadgets and dark scariness. I felt like I was in a factory for making human beings. I met the maker of these human beings. He started giving me gifts, he said, telepathically of course, here are your hands, you will make beautiful things with these Here is your charm, your wit, your sense of humour, you will make people smile and be happy with this. Here is your body, you will love it. At this point I actually climbed inside of my body- and kindof zipped it up, and was like dang this is a nice body (really helped with my negative body image so Im finding today =).

You are Being brainwashed

The next scenes were very scary. I started having fears that I was being brainwashed by the LSD. This was the case because I have successfully over this 5 weeks been giving up more and more of my personality to LSD and on this trip the drug actually started taking over my thoughts. Yes my thoughts, the thing I pride myself in (Im a big thinker), and the LSD started brainwashing me and stealing my thoughts. I went with the flow. I did not fight it, though I could see how less strong people would definitely fight this feeling of going insane and being brainwashed. Then I saw a huge arena and my head was sawed open so my brains were sticking out in the open.

A big surgeon type dude with many many onlookers were in the arena. I understood that the process that was to be done was a lobotomy. A real lobotomy. It wasnt going to be done now, but when the final ego death came, he would cut out my brain, and I would never be the same EVER again. This might sound scary, but I loved it. I am so ready to lose part of my brain. If you have ever seen the movie Pi my life is kind of like that. A very smart mathematical genius who is miserable with his paranoia. Until he takes a drill and drills his brain so he can just enjoy nature and human contact without the insanity of truth anymore.

Ride the Snake !!

So it was at this point that the most difficult part of the LSD experience came to the surface. It is important to note that I had previously been seeing snakes in all my previous LSD trips, and they seemed to be against me. Like I was always fighting the snakes, because they seemed evil.

Well on this trip, I rode the snake. I was the snake. And the snake brought me to some very FUCKed up parts of my personality. I have had some serious sexual abuse from my father while I was younger so that set the stage to want certain sexual things from my guy friends, because my father set such a great example.

Well the snake showed me EVERY SINGLE friendship I have ever had that the snake (unconscious Gay sexual desires) was involved in. I felt like I was riding a roller coaster, the snake was squirming so fast through all the relationships and memories I have ever had.

I had to re-live every single polluted friendship I have ever had, and my God it was the most difficult thing seeing friends I cherished in the unconscious gay way that I really perceived them. Me being not gay just made the process even more hard.

But like a trooper I re-lived all the trauma and gay-ness, and my god,  it was difficult.

BPM I Out Of Body

Towards the end of the trip I believe I was governed by BPM I. I felt like I was merging with my surroundings. I felt unbelievably at peace. I felt like my body and mind were dissolving into my surroundings. I was listening to some monks chanting on CD, and my god. I was never so moved by music in my life.

Conclusions.
The good vibes continued into the evening.
This trip is a big turning point in my LSD psychotherapy. I worked through my 3 greatest fears, Death, being called Racist, and Being Gay. I also opened up some sort of feminine appreciation in my psyche. I have a newfound respect for women today that I have never felt in my life. I feel their presense is godly and I have found myself hanging around them much more and being much more at ease with them, which is definitely a new thing for me.

The final ego death (brainwashing) has not come yet, but I am predicting next trip, or the trip after that. I am getting extremely confident that LSD therapy will work for me after this trip and how I feel today.

My heart chakra has opened up even more than before, and I feel true love towards my ex-girlfriend [she doesnt want me back after I told her how I really feel =( ], my friends, and even my former enemies. Forgivness and light surround me today. I am also pleased that the LSD took over my thoughts, I find myself thinking a lot less today. I am just in the groove of existence without analyzing it so much.

Holy shit, this might work out good =).

Some Backgound

My first LSD trip was a relatively weak fractal blotter taken on the second night of Phish's 'IT' festival over the summer. The emotions, the music, the 70,000 person glow stick war, all were perfect. The LSD heightened, but did not distract me from the incredible experience at hand. My second LSD trip was another weak blotter. Very weak visuals, but a very nice mental change and great music enhancement made for a fun night. My third LSD trip blew the door wide open. During this trip it became obvious that LSD had a lot to teach me, and this first real trip simply outlined the lesson plan revolving around peace, love, friendship, and psychedelia.

My fourth LSD trip was a complete overwhelming of my senses. For a couple hours I could do little but sit in one place absorbing all the sensory input that was flooding my brain. Then I started to draw three dimensional solar systems with my finger in front of my face, flicking the planets around their orbits and setting the system in motion. On the comedown, I was able to let all the sensory input coalesce into the second lesson: Apply the ideals of peace, love, friendship, and psychedelia which are obvious at the height of an LSD trip to my real life. Become a more peaceful, loving, friendly, and individual person.

The Trip

This trip took place almost two months ago, so I may fast-forward through blocks of time if I can't remember anything really interesting happening during that time.

I had two 'eyeball' blotters, one blue and one orange, saved with the intention of taking LSD with my girlfriend for her first real trip. She had one of the weak blotters from my second trip, but apparently got less from the experience than did I.

The eyeball blotters were from the same batch of silver crystal as the flies that blew me away on my third trip (see report above). However, while the flies were said to be 80 to 90 micrograms of silver, the eyeballs were said to be about 160 micrograms. Others who had tried the eyeballs said they were stronger than the flies, so I was ready for an intense experience.

[Erowid Note: 
Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be done casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements were derived, it is reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.] 

Our decision to trip was a spontaneous group decision. There would be four of us tripping that night: Myself, with an orange eyeball; My girlfriend, Psilosara, with a blue eyeball; My buddy 'T', with 16mg of 2C-I; and a new friend 'M', with about 25mg of 2C-B.

T always takes a long time to feel his 2C-I, so he dosed around 7:30pm. Psilosara and I dosed around 8:30pm, and M dosed around 9:00pm because we couldn't find him for a while. I knew the acid was real after about 10 minutes, because I could already feel the slight mental change taking place. During the comeup, T wanted to boil his pipe clean in the kitchen of our on-campus theme house. Sure, go for it dude. Soon the whole house smelled like boiling resin, and we decided we should keep the weedy smells to a reasonable level while tripping, so we opened some windows and considered the pipe boiling done.

The comeup was strange, because I spent a fair amount of time half-tripping and feeling like I was in limbo. Psilosara apparently felt this even more, and she wanted to go upstairs and listen to some music in my room, so we all went up there and put on some mellow tunes. This was around 10:00pm, and T was just starting to trip, and M wasn't feeling anything except a little 'off'. I told him he wouldn't be peaking on the 2C-B for another hour and a half and that the first 2 hours on 2C-B were usually pretty lame and uneventful. Meanwhile I closed my eyes and let the music absorb me. As I closed my eyes I was greeted with CEVs of my body folding in upon itself over and over again. I meditated on this and it became quite intense until I saw Psilosara pop in to view until her face was in front of mine. I thought I was seeing through my eyelids but when I opened my eyes she was still sitting on the bed to my side.

Around this point I noticed that I was very high.

The LSD 'high' is unlike any other that I've experienced. It does not stone me like cannabis, DXM, or AMT. It doesn't give me a 'buzz' like 2C-I, mescaline, or cannabis. It also doesn't make me feel warm and fuzzy like mdma or opiates. Instead, the LSD high is a combination of a feeling of pleasant vibration, a 'pull' upwards that makes me feel light and floaty like I can partially defy gravity, and a great feeling of awe and enlightenment. I can feel the LSD pumping through my arteries. The change in the way my body works under the influence of LSD feels drastic, but fortunately it also feels relatively harmless, especially compared to most of the phenethylamines I've tried.

Everybody was smoking pot, but I only took one hit because pot likes to raise my heart rate, sometimes by a good margin. My heart rate is one of the only things that ever scares me whilst tripping, so I've learned to keep the pot to a minimum, especially on drugs that already increase my heart rate. Anyway the one hit was enough to relax me and synergize nicely with the LSD high.

We went downstairs to Psilosara's room, which is decorated with lots of cool tapestries and strange and colorful lights and lamps. It is a very trippy and cozy room. I leaned back against her bed and looked at the wood grain on her dresser, and watched as the entire image of her dresser repeated in on itself until there were infinite representations of itself within the larger image. This occured right as T and M asked 'what I was seeing'. I was also watching the lights wiggle around, and carpet crawl, and some really bright blue and green lines surround the edges of many objects. As always with LSD, my vision was impossibly crisp and the visuals were of amazing detail and clarity.

We chilled here for a while, talking about random stuff which I can't recall. I remember having a hard time finding a comfortable position on the bed, and thinking my insides were caving in. I realized a few minutes later that this was because of the way I was sitting, and adjusted myself much to my comfort.

At one point I noticed the entire room take on a dark, scary theme. My visuals became eerie, and my 'high' took on an uncomfortable feeling. For some reason I was starting to have a bad trip, but I didn't know why. I tried to hide my fear and work it out in my head as the others continued their conversations. I could feel the life being sucked out of me, and I feared that I would spend the next several hours freaking out. But then I remembered that everything that happens on LSD happens for a reason, and I began thinking back about my last LSD trip and what I had learned. I realized that I had done a reasonably good job applying the teachings to my life, and I did consider myself a better person because of it.

I started to feel a little better...

Then it came to me: Reconcilation. I need not doubt myself in the face of others. I have chosen my path in life, and that is one of love and spontaneity. And that is wonderful. I had reconciled with myself! No longer would I need to feel shame or self-disappointment for small failures.

I started feeling *much* better!

Then I thought, 'Thank you LSD'...

The wave of euphoria that washed over me right as I thought that is indescribable. To have gone through pain and fear, and through a very valuable life lesson come to feel as good and alive as I've ever felt in such a short time span was incredible.

Then the room started to turn dark again, and I looked over at Psilosara and noticed she looked a little sad. I made eye contact with her and smiled, and as she smiled back at me the room lit up with joy. She looked absolutely beautiful. Throughout the night she had been acting with the confidence and honesty that I know she always has in her, but she wasn't holding back and it was wonderful. I looked at her sitting in the chair in front of her desk, and watched as all the objects around her: her computer, her lava lamp, her posters, her keyboard, etc, turned rapidly into different, constantly changing objects. I was amazed, seeing her in all her beauty in a thousand different times and places.

M was enjoying his 2C-B, looking at his hands and laughing about things. Unfortunately communication was difficult for me during this trip, but I felt like we bonded a bit throughout the experience anyway. T was talking about Nirvana and how beautiful and powerful Kurt's music was. It was really great to see how moved he was by the whole thing.

Soon enough T and M left, I guess it was getting late, and besides I like to spend time with Psilosara one-on-one anyway. She went to use the bathroom and I started in the mirror for a while. I was expecting to look into my personality or something like that, but instead the wall around the mirror rotated into a gradual slope, and the image inside the mirror took on a look of a Van Gogh-ish oil painting, constantly in fluid motion. I was amazed at the detail and beauty! Then Psilosara came back in and we tried talking for a while, which was really hard because we both were getting really confused by each other. I said something like 'LSD really confuses you!' and she agreed, so it was perfectly allright. We put the Phish documentary Bittersweet Motel (excellent!) on the DVD player and tried watching that, but we were both too distracted by our thoughts and visuals to devote our full attention to it. Occasionally a part of the DVD would come on where Trey would play an amazing solo, and we'd both watch in awe.

Our trips were winding down by the end of the film, and we had been making out and fooling around during much of the movie anyway (unfortunately sex was not possible for these few days of the month), so as the sun was rising we fell asleep.

We woke up feeling a bit tripped out but overall refreshed and with a whole lot to talk about

peace all-
bluedolphin

Pre-Trip Musings

Friday night I was at a keg party, tossing back some beers and having a pretty good time, when my friend Nick approached me and asked if I wanted to take acid on Sunday. Initially, I was unsure. Among the many considerations I had to take in to account was the fact that I didn't exactly feel like taking LSD. Since there have been times when I felt like doing LSD pretty frequently (and did so) I thought I might as well give my poor battered brain a break from psychedelics as long as I don't feel the urge to trip.

And the fact that he wanted to take LSD was another concern. First, I only had a little bit of blotter stashed away and it was damn good stuff so I was going to save it for a summer festival, or maybe a candyflip with my girlfriend.

I did happen to have a little bit of 2C-E that I hadn't had a chance to properly trip on yet (I had tasted 3-4mg, which didn't do anything positive for me). So, because I was honored that of all people Nick had asked me to be the one to trip with him, I told him that I would certainly be there with him, and almost certainly take a psychedelic with him that night, although it would most likely not be LSD.

Now, I've tripped with Nick a few times over the past few years... a few times on DXM, a couple times on morning glory seeds, once or twice on shrooms, and a couple times on LSD. For the most part, though, he doesn't trip very often at all and stays away from nasty drugs. I basically turned him on to LSD earlier this year and now it seems to be by far his favorite drug. These days I am pretty picky about who I trip with and the environment I trip in. Luckily Nick had not yet been crossed off my list of people I like to trip with, or else I would have had to make up some excuse why I couldn't do it ... Another factor that made me choose to trip with Nick is the fact that he is an exceedingly smart guy and is earnestly interested in finding answers to the 'big questions' posed by the introduction of a psychedelic drug to one's mind. In other words, he approaches psychedelics with respect, which is something I try to do. Especially with LSD, because of the many psychedelics I've tried, LSD is by far my favorite and has brought me the deepest, most relevant experiences. So I try not to fuck with that.

Let's Trip

Sunday afternoon came along and I wondered how much 2C-E I would eat. But then Nick came over and opened up a bit of tin foil containing about 1.25 squares of purple blotter. Mmmmmm LSD.... so of course I had to open up my own little bit of foil which contained my own tiny stash of the very same purple blotter (which had been stored not-really airtight and room temperature for the last 3 months). These blotters were really of top quality - I had eaten just 1 a few months back and had a very colorful +++ trip, although that particular trip was a bit too hectic for my tastes because there were so many people tripping at my place that night and I was worried about drawing any unwanted attention.

Anyway it took me about 10 seconds of staring at my blotter before I decided I should definitely take LSD and save the 2C-E for another time.

Since Nick had 1.25 blotters left, which happened to be about 40% more LSD than he'd ever tasted before, I decided to dose the same amount. After we each drank a big glass of red wine we took our doses. I noticed that Nick had eaten 1 blotter and left the .25 blotter bit in his foil.

'Hey, you forgot some!'
'Yeah... I don't know...''
'What are you going to do, waste it? That's the last of your acid so you better eat it now... plus that little bit could make all the difference.'

I actually had no idea that the extra sliver of blotter paper would make the big difference that it did.

Stage 1: The Rocket Ride

After we dosed we spent some time looking at funny web sites and listening to Sound Tribe. We both noticed the faint metallic taste in our mouth that LSD always seems to bring. The come-up was happening fast, in stark contrast to the long, gradual come-up I experienced with this LSD last time. Nick seemed to be coming along about five minutes behind me.

The first things we noticed were a mood lift and a lowered threshold for breaking out into laughter. Right after this, I was getting kind of fidgity as I felt the rushes of restless energy start to flow through me. This felt somewhat like amphetamine, but my thoughts and actions were far more scattered. We kept looking at funny web sites because there isn't much else to do while you're waiting for a trip to kick in. Also I was a little nervous about people coming around during the trip, and I'm sure Nick was a bit anxious about tripping in general, so it was something to take our mind off the come-up.

Not half an hour after putting the LSD on my tongue I was getting visuals. The floor was shifting in segments, just a little at first but quickly increasing. Wood grain began to flow, and soon I could make out the faint neon-yellow-electric ora which seems to enervate off objects on LSD.

Around this time one of my friends who knew I was tripping that night sent me an instant message:

'the electric yellow has you by the BRAIN BANANA haha'

We both thought that was pretty funny, and then started thinking about it and realized it was pretty much an accurate statement. The restless, almost nervous energy was building and sitting at my computer became too intense. Now, I've experienced this restless LSD-energy plenty of times before and I know there are basically two options: First, there is the option to allow yourself to bounce off the walls and get wrapped up in a whirlwind trip. Some people routinely choose this option, but I personally find much greater value in the alternative. The second option is to channel all this energy, learn to control it, and to direct it throughout your body. I find that I can direct the majority of this energy into the palms of my hands, and by sitting cross-legged I can enter a state of deep relaxation.

And I would personally prefer to be deeply relaxed than to be jittery, tense, and without focus.

I guess Nick hadn't yet figured out how to control this energy because as the trip was getting stronger he started wandering around and looking fairly confused. I have a lot of faith in LSD's intent, so to speak, so unless somebody is obviously distraught or having a truly bad trip I tend to let them work out their own issues while tripping, so I didn't intervene as he wandered off in apparent confusion. Besides, forming sentences was becoming difficult and I was really in no position to be a trip sitter.

Now I was alone in my room, and the Sound Tribe was starting to sound a bit too repetitive and 'electronic' for me. So I switched to The Breakfast, starting at the first track of one of my favorite live shows. Ahh, much better. I closed my eyes to check out the CEVs, because 15 minutes ago there had been none, and I was amazed by the beautiful waves of technicolor which flowed around in infinite 3D space behind my eyelids. As each psychedelic wave washed over me I felt a feeling of peace that I have only experienced a handful of times on LSD.

After a few minutes I broke my trance and opened my eyes to see that everything was breathing, flowing, and patterning very nicely. My eyes were also playing tricks on me. For example, I kept thinking I saw somebody walk by the entrance of my room out of the corner of my eyes, and then I would quickly look and nobody was there. This happened a few times and I decided it was probably because I didn't know what Nick was up to, so I went to check on him. He was downstairs watching TV, which seemed really strange to me. He said something like, 'TV is good'. At the time I thought his trip must not have been that interesting for him, and watching TV was just about the last thing I felt like doing, so I went back upstairs and got lost in my thoughts for a while.

Next thing I knew it was probably half an hour later, because I had been so absorbed in deep thought and surfing the cosmic peace-waves in my mind that I didn't really know what was going on around me. I wouldn't say this was a result of a dissolving ego... I was just extremely relaxed and in a very groovy state of mind. Dispite my relaxed state I noticed my body was a bit tense and my heartrate was elevated (though not to a distracting degree) but I didn't dwell on that.

I decided it was time for a change of scenery, so I went over to my girlfriend's room which is brightly decorated with nice tapestries, colorful lights, and is generally a pretty sweet environment to be in while tripping.

Nick happened to be in her room too, still seeming very confused and asking my girlfriend stuff like, 'You're sober, right?', and frequently asking me, 'How long ago did we eat that?' For a while I could not answer his questions about time because though I was pretty sure what time we ate the acid, and I was pretty sure what the numbers on the clock read, for some reason my brain would not do the simple math needed to answer the question. My concept of time was totally out of whack. Eventually I realized that it had only been about three hours since we had dropped the acid, even though it felt much longer.

So I spent some time with Nick and my girlfriend basically hanging out. My girl has taken her share of LSD and psychedelics and she did an awesome job putting out a positive vibe during our time spent with her, even though she was worried that Nick had gotten in over his head.

Stage 2: A Spiritual Cleansing

Pretty soon she left to cook some dinner and I laid down on her bed while Nick laid down on her floor below the bed. During this time the rough edges of the come-up had smoothed out and I seemed to have settled into an intense, but comfortable plateau.

The visuals were absolutely stunning. I have had more outrageous hallucinations in the past, but the beauty of what I saw that night was unmatched. In addition, as with past LSD trips, the visuals I experienced were deeply symbolic and directly linked to my thoughts and feelings. The razor-sharp and crystal-clarity of my thoughts during this period was a complete contradiction of stereotypical impressions of LSD as a drug which has a huge mindfuck. While it certainly is true that under the wrong circumstances, LSD can be a confusing mental funhouse-from-hell. But I was so deep in the groove and in such a state of beautiful calm that my internal dialogue was as clear as it would be if I were sober...

... as clear, yes. The same? Hell no! But back to those visuals...

I was watching the ceiling for a while because it was so fascinating. It had a rough stucco texture and segments of the ceiling would crawl, lift up, float away, and change colors quite dramatically. While this was happening I was aware of the walls changing colors, patterns forming on the walls and all kinds of objects, and the lamp in front of me (which has five bulbs, all different colors and pointing in different directions) moving around quite freely. I noticed an aloe plant on top of a shelf which was planted inside a nice piece of pottery. The leaves/branches of the aloe plant were in motion like tentacles of an octopus under water and in my mind this plant took the form of LSD. I wouldn't go so far to say it was an entity, but it did take the representative form of the parts of my mind that were under the control of the drug.

This aloe plant then seemed to mediate between my visuals and myself, both directing the visuals (because it was the LSD) and assigning meaning to them. Immediately after this I noticed that some segments of the ceiling would blur, regardless of my attempts to focus on them, and then these segments would violently shake, before finally the other normal segments (if you could call them normal, they were still squirming around and changing colors quite dramatically) would overtake these messed up segments. Very quickly it became obvious to me what was occuring. These segments represented parts of myself; some which were pure and some which were impure. As a segment of the ceiling began to blur and vibrate, I thought about what aspect of me that might be, and when I realized what it was (sometimes thanks to the aloe plant) it would be overtaken.

I was witnessing a war between good and evil in my own brain and it seemed like the good was kicking some serious ass. Then this very thought seemed absurd to me, for the aloe plant seemed to be telling me that 'of course the good always wins'.

When there were no more impure segments of ceiling left to be flushed out I looked back at the aloe plant just in time to see a translucent spiral coming out of the plant and heading towards me. At the very instant that spiral touched me I felt my spirit being quickly scrubbed down, as if the aloe plant was giving me a final spot-clean. This happened almost instantaneously, and in my mind there was no doubt about what was going on. When it was finished I felt totally pure and clean, and even more relaxed than before.

It's a Long Way Down

Though the visuals were still stunning, I felt there was no more need to stare at things. I heard The Breakfast playing from my room and thought it sounded pretty sweet, so I left Nick laying on the floor (he hadn't budged) and went over to my room and laid on my bed. I probably spent 45 minutes listening to the music, feeling that every note was perfect, and watching the visuals behind my eyelids react to the sound.

After a while my girlfriend came into my room and laid down on the bed beside me. We talked about the evening, how my trip was going so far, and how Nick was doing. I felt that I was starting to come down slightly, and after talking to her for a little while I said I'd go down and eat some food because I realized I was very hungry (LSD always makes me really hungry at some point during the trip, plus I hadn't eaten much that day).

So I wandered downstairs, looked at the food, and then wandered back upstairs without eating. I went back upstairs because I wanted a sweatshirt, but once I got back upstairs I felt like staying there. So I listened to music some more, spent some time looking at my feet and thinking that feet take a lot of bullshit compared to other parts of the body.

Then my neighbor came by and I gave him some pot to smoke. He also ended up smoking a little DMT he had, which was a pretty halarious process. I was pretty much coherent by this point but still tripping at about 50% intensity of the peak. This ended up taking a while, and then I wandered over to my girl's room to see her and Nick watching Ice Age on DVD.

About half-way through Ice Age I guess Nick started remembering who he was. Apparently he experienced complete ego loss and that's why he was watching TV... to relearn how to be human. And apparently he was even further gone than I thought he was for quite a while. Luckily my girlfriend is awesome and she chilled with him through rough times he had when his life, memories, and humanity slipped away from him.

When he came back to reality he seemed overwhelmed by the intensity of the experience he just had, and was amazed how strong the experience was and how much difference that extra 1/4 tab of LSD made. To be honest I didn't expect to trip as hard as I did either! But LSD doesn't seem to demolish my ego so much as let me pick it apart and toss out the parts I don't like, at least at the doses I've taken. Mushrooms, on the other hand, have a tendency to tear my ego to shreds. I find this is only useful once every long while, so I much prefer to work with LSD.

After that we drank a little wine, ate some food, watched Beavis and Butthead, and chilled out, both of us in awe of the power of LSD.

I got to sleep around 4:30am (12 hours after dropping, which is pretty good for me), got a solid 7 hours of sleep, and woke up feeling great the next day.

LSD remains my #1 psychedelic ally... and it never ceases to amaze me. My dose felt like 100ug, maybe slightly higher (1.25 tabs from lavender crystal). Keep in mind that my friend Nick is sensitive to acid, and I tend to get a lot of mileage out of relatively low doses of LSD too. So your mileage may vary. But, when I hear people say it takes more to get much in the way of visuals, that pretty much just cracks me up :)

Introductions

W: A new friend and housemate, an overall well intentioned and fun guy to hang out with. W has only tripped once before, on a half 8th of shrooms. Supposedly during this trip he freaked out and ran for 6 miles down some railroad tracks. So tonight, wanting to trip again, but hoping for less of a mind-rape nonetheless he decided on about 16mg of 2C-I.

T: Another new friend. His experience with psychedelics is limited, but he takes the psychedelic experience very seriously. T had managed to get a hold of two and a half of the reputably strong 'fly' blotters that now seem to be flooding the northeast US. By my estimates these are 2 to 3 times as strong as the 'fractals' that everyone was so excited about during the summer jam band tours. T would be eating 1.25 flies.

S: My girlfriend, soul mate, and true love. After a short breakup we got back together only a few days ago. Her psychedelic experience is close to mine. She would also be taking about 16mg of 2C-I.

Me: The last two months of my life have been loveless chaos, going through the motions of everyday life. I am experienced with enough psychedelics that I don't need to list them. I have taken LSD twice before, but never anything nearly as strong as these 'flies' would turn out to be. I had very high hopes for this night, and my mindset was excellent. I was ready for anything from a trippy buzz to rebirth. I would be eating 1.25 fly blotters.

The Experience of a Lifetime

Around 7:15pm we all took our doses. While waiting to come up we chilled in my dorm room and listened to some tunes. After about 15 minutes I swallowed my blotter and could already feel the familiar tingle. We put a DVD in my computer with all the Smashing Pumpkin music videos, and we watched a few of them. By the third music video I was already paying equal attention to the vibrant and changing colors of everything in the room.

We decided we'd all had enough music videos and I went to use the bathroom. I walked out of my room and into a hallway of ever-changing pastel colors. My first attempt to open the bathroom door failed as the doorknob bent out of reach at the last second. I grabbed it and walked into a tile and glass funhouse. Rainbow patterns were sliding across the tile floor as paint was dripping down the door. Already I was amazed at how visual and vibrant the trip had become, and it was just over half an hour since I dropped.

I got back to the room and we all decided to go for a walk. I suggested we walk to the sunken gardens, an outdoor mini-ampitheater of sorts surrounded by modern art sculpture, and in a very secluded part of campus. As soon as we stepped outside I noticed that the air quality was vastly superior to the air quality in my room. I also felt like I was about 10 feet tall, and floating above the ground. I was able to walk normally, save a few times when I stopped dead in my tracks to ask 'where are we going?' On the walk to the sunken gardens S and T had begun tripping, while W was feeling the 2C-I's energy and euphoria, but not really the psychedelic effects yet. We walked down the long secluded driveway to the gardens running back and forth across the road creating a 4-person weave.

We finally got there and I had no idea that the sunken gardens could be so alive and chaotic. Light was strobing over the grass and structures like some kind of trippy spotlight. Every sound was amplified to such an extreme that I thought cars driving down a road far off through the woods were right next to me. I lay down on the grass and closed my eyes only to melt into the earth below me and witness the most complex, detailed, crisp, and colorful CEV's I've ever seen. I can't really describe it, but if you've seen some really trippy and complex art before, it might be something like that. Except imagine it being alive, and having deep meaning.

By this time S was having the most intense psychedelic experience of her life as well. She was flooded with visuals from the 2C-I and seemed to be handling the intensity of it very well. W was standing below a tree that T had climbed, and now was apparently stuck in. After some time, T got down, to his great relief. T then went behind some bushes. W asked him what was going on and T said he had become the tree, and was feeling the needs of the tree. I was observing all this from my point of view, which was laying down on the ground next to a stone wall. I saw a shadow in the stone wall turn into a man and walk away. Curiously, without even mentioning this, S said she saw a shadow turn into a man and climb a tree near the wall.

W really wanted to move on, so we decided to go down to the boat house by the lake, and maybe take a walk along the railroad tracks right next to it. In order to do this, we would likely encounter some heavy foot traffic, since we would have to walk down the main road that goes through campus for a while. Well, as long as we kept going and don't get distracted along the way, I guessed that would be allright.

Yeah right. We made it about 100 feet before we encountered the weirdest tree ever. It was shaped like a mushroom and had no leaves and weird droopy branches. It seemed to be growing, and when I walked towards it, it moved towards me as well. This surprised me and I dodged the tree just to make sure it couldn't grab me. I spent a few moments admiring the bright and growing grass next to my feet, and then noticed that T was using one of the pieces of modern art sculpture as some kind of ergonomically designed seat. We all thought this was halarious, until we realized that the art didn't seem to be holding his weight very well. Anyway, we kept moving and got up to the main road. When we passed by my house I decided it would be a good idea to carry some water and herb with us, since I planned on staying down by the tracks for a while.

We crossed it up and went inside where many of my housemates were sober and watching a movie. I went upstairs to fill up my water bottle, and then went into my room to collect myself and rest for the journey ahead. I sat down in my chair, put on some Sound Tribe Sector 9, and closed my eyes. Soon afterwards I felt another presence enter the room, and I watched our energies intertwine. I opened my eyes and said 'Wow'... T was sitting right in front of me. I hadn't heard him come in but somehow I could feel his energy there. I told him what happened and he seemed to understand. Soon enough everyone had come up to my room, and we were chilling up there listening to music for a while until we remembered that we had intended to go down to the boat house. I grabbed a Butterfinger, opened it, and stared at the shimmery butter-brittle after breaking off a piece for T. It took me about 10 minutes to take the first bite, meanwhile we had all forgotten our intentions to go down to the boathouse again. There was so much involved in the experience of taking a bite of a Butterfinger that it was pretty intense, and not something to be taken lightly.

Somehow we ended up outside behind the house, slowly getting back on our way. S was tripping hard (and looked absolutely beautiful), T thought he had broken his sweatshirt and was in tears, and W was cracking up at the halarity of it all. I still had only taken one bite of my Butterfinger. I asked S to hold it for me. After I gave it to her I said 'That Butterfinger had become a burden.' Apparently this the was the most halarious thing any of us had ever heard because the whole campus could have heard us all laughing behind the house for a solid five minutes.

We walked back up to the street, and there were some cars coming so I waited to cross. Apparently not long enough though, because I stepped out only to realize that there was one more car coming and stopped dead in my tracks in the middle of the road to let the final car pass.

Across the street, we walked along the lake and saw a couple of girls carrying a sign and a large stuffed dog. They were campaigning for the stuffed dog to be mayor, and obviously rolling so I stopped to chat with them. I ended up having an interesting chat and getting a hookup for rolls. Not bad!

Soon enough a huge crowd was heading our way down the sidewalk seemingly out of nowhere. W was finally starting to trip (the 2C-I took forever to hit him completely) and he got a little freaked out by the crowd. S and I stood there exchanging nods with the people in this huge group of party-crashers as they walked by. T got distracted talking to someone in the crowd, and we lost him for a few minutes. When we found him seemed pretty disoriented, so we walked down the path to the boathouse.

Along the path, as we passed by a few other students smoking bowls, I noticed how good I physically felt compared to just about every other psychedelic. My stomach felt a bit tight, but not to the point where it became a distraction. Otherwise, I felt like I was walking on air. We got down to the boathouse and walked out on to the floating segmented dock. We all laid down on the dock and felt the waves below us. I felt like I was melting in to the water as I closed my eyes and enjoyed the serenity of it all. With my eyes closed, complex psychedelic visual stories took place. With my eyes open, the stars above would dart about freely in the night sky. We spent a good amount of time sitting out by the boathouse enjoying the warm breeze blowing over the water. I sat there with S resting her head on my lap, and she looked absolutely beautiful. After a few moments though, her face began to morph into some frightening and contorted distortions. Inside of each of her eyes was a burning fire. I wondered what it meant, but decided not to dwell on it.

After a while we decided to go for a walk down the railroad tracks. On the way there I saw creatures with glowing eyes looking at me from the brush on the side of the tracks. I mentioned this to S, who said that the creatures were friendly. Good enough for me.

Soon we came to a fire pit between the train tracks and the lake. W stepped out into the water, holding his hands up in the air in the direction that the wind was coming from. I watched his spirit extend out from behind his body. By this point I was finally ready to smoke a bowl, now almost 6 hours after having dosed. But we realized that we didn't have a bowl to smoke out of, so we decided to head back to my room. On the way back there were lots of kids sitting out on the boat house deck. W and T are sailors, so they yelled 'Get the fuck off the boathouse!' and 'Security!', and threw a few pebbles towards the kids. Basically being dicks, but we all cracked up uncontrolably after that.

We got back to my room and smoked a bowl. After this my trip came back almost full force (although it hadn't worn down significantly anyway). T went to Erowid's art gallerys and we looked at psychedelic art for about an hour.

I have never looked at art that way before! Not only were the images coming out of my monitor in three dimensions, often levitating inches away from the screen, but every part of the art was constantly growing, pulsating, and changing with infinitely more detail than sober eyes could ever behold. In each piece of art there were thousands of stories to be told, and I could follow the progress of each living piece of art through the image. It was absolutely beautiful.

I went to use the bathroom again, and once again entered a glass and tile funhouse. I stared at my face in the mirror and watched it morph for a while. Then, somehow, the image in the mirror became another 'me'. I realized I was looking at myself in the mirror from the perspective of everyone else. Normally, I think I must seem a bit odd to other people, but I realized that I am to everyone else as they are to me.

W had decided to wander off on his own, as his trip was still going full force (since it took so long to kick in for whatever reason). T hadn't slept in two full days, and his trip seemed to be wearing down so he called it quits as well. Now it was just me and S, and we were both still tripping fairly hard.

What took place during the next two hours was the most incredible and perfect love that has ever been made between two people. Words can't describe how amazing it was, nor would I want to try. I will say it was the most passion and the best sex we've had in the almost three years that we've been together, and our bond is closer now than ever because of it.

Afterwards we laid in bed talking. I was amazed that I was still tripping, and said that if this were any other time I would love to trip like I was tripping right now, but by this point (around 4:00am) I was physically exhausted. The 2C-I was still keeping S awake. Likewise, the CEV's that consisted of complex and random chain-reaction Dali-esque machines were keeping me awake. So we stayed up talking, and generally confusing each other, cracking up frequently until finally exhaustion won the battle and I drifted off to sleep around 5:00am, almost 10 hours after having dosed.

Retrospection

What I experienced last night was indeed the perfect trip. I am amazed at the power of LSD to provide such a full, complex, beautiful, and important trip. I believe LSD is indeed the holy grail of psychedelics, and I can easily see why this chemical is considered by far to be the most important psychedelic in modern history. Please do not take LSD if you are looking for eye candy and a buzz; take LSD if you are ready to have your mind blown in ways you never imagined possible.

Let it flow!

LSD





BODY WEIGHT:

This trip took place in the winter of 2001, my first year out of high school. I had first tried marijuana a year earlier and had taken a fondness to it, to say the least. The effects of drugs fascinated me so I was extremely eager to try LSD. I had already tried it a few months earlier but I had only felt really high. Perhaps it was weak or maybe it took more to break my tolerance.

When my very close friend told me that he wanted to try LSD and could get it, I told him, Dont worry man, Ive done it, I know what its like. I was wrong. We each took a double dipped Smartie candy and drove back to my house to hang out for awhile. Frustrated from feeling no effects, we made ourselves a bong from a three liter soda bottle and took a few hits. We went back into the kitchen, where the cat, Chester, was having a little nibble on some food. We found this to be the funniest thing in the world and were laughing harder than ever at the cat chomping down on his food. When the cat was done and we had fully realized that now we were tripping, the cat began weaving around our feet, looking up at us. I had this feeling that the cat knew we were tripping, even that it was his fault! Thus came the cats nickname, Tripmasta Chesta.

It took us forever to get out of the house and when we finally did, we did the most moronic thing in the world, got into the car. At the time though, this was not moronic at all. We felt completely clear headed, carefree, jovial, playful, and better than I think either of us had felt in a long time. We were acting calm and normal, only much more enthusiastic and fascinated. In the car we popped in the White Album by the Beatles and sang along, driving in the cold snowy weather. We went to a nature preserve and walked around for awhile, amazed at the beauty of the snow covered forest. Then my friend remembered an even more beautiful place to walk around and we drove there. It was a nature preserve called Plotterkill, in the hills of upstate NY. We wandered around the forest, no cares for time or temperature or even direction for that matter. We looked out over the hills into the valley and the hills beyond and could not stop commenting on the beauty of the natural surroundings. We talked about we felt and the experiences were completely similar except with the natural difference in perception. We felt like so much information was entering our minds at one time, like our brains were melting or going to explode. We felt emotions and feelings that we did not even recognize, as if the drug had opened pathways in our brain that we rarely used or have never even accessed. All of the bullshit in the world, the bullshit that I was only slowly coming to realize, was thrown in my face at that exact moment and I saw the world in a way that completely changed the way that I had been approaching it. We stood in silence as I played with a plastic wrapper in my hands. It crackled as loud as bonfire.

We then made our attempt to leave the preserve which was somewhat difficult for a few moments when we looked around and all for the trees looked similar and direction was impossible to determine. Then, logical thinking back in order, we recognized a tree with a small pink spray paint mark and found our way out and back to the car. Coming back down from the hills, Revolution 9 on the White Album came on and turned into utter chaos, panic ensued and my friend suggested I turn it off. I did and the calm atmosphere returned. 

From there we went to a supermarket and a diner. I have no idea, or no remembrance, of why we were at the supermarket. However, I do remember walking around feeling almost superior in a way than all the other shoppers. Not superior in a conceited way, but in that I felt I was on another level from them. A level of higher awareness, not concerned with trivial things like groceries and daily troubles. There was life to lived! We looked each person we walked past directly in the eyes with a huge smile on our faces. We were on acid and damn proud of it! 

At the diner I ordered French toast. Im not quite sure what my friend ordered; food was of little importance. I barely finished my French Toast, it tasted like wet cardboard. We talked a lot about people and the way they view life, how were we feeling on the drug, how good yet incredibly intense it felt. I wanted to feel like that forever, to forever explore the world on acid with my friend. Yet, I still had the common sense to recognize that the real world and the daily routine would not permit such a lifestyle and neither would my sanity or health. But in that moment though, we bonded, as if by looking into each others eyes, we could feel one anothers thoughts. It was not as if we actually heard each others voice in our mind or that random images flashed by. It was simply an understanding of intent. A complete relinquishment of barriers and norms and hidden emotion. It was trust and truth and caring and dependence and love. 

We talked about a lot in that diner, we were probably there an hour and a half. We talked about our pasts and my friend revealed to me a memory that he had never told anyone in his life, only his parents were aware of it. He was nearly crying but it was obviously years and years of aggression and frustration and insecurity pouring out. We told each other how incredibly grateful we were to have tripped with one another but more importantly, our gratitude to have one another as a friend.

When the time came to pay the bill, my visual hallucinations were fairly strong but not like I had heard them described by other people. These were merely vibrant colors and prominent, dramatic patterns on the wood grain of the table and the wall paper. I saw the creamer swirling around in the coffee as if a hundred times magnified. I could see every curl and slippery movement of each tendril of creamer. I was, for the first time, aware of the hundreds of little lines, all differently shaded, that make up a simple thing like coffee creamer in coffee. When we pulled out the money to pay the bill, it looked like nothing to us. My friend shrugged his shoulders and pulled all of the cash from his wallet and tossed it on the table carelessly. It was paper and the concept of it being used to get things seemed suddenly so ridiculous and unnatural and necessary. However, our reality instinct kicked in and prevented us from leaving all the money there.

As we left the diner, as throughout the entire day, time seemed nonexistent. It felt like we had been on acid forever and that we always would be. We were aware that the day was ending, that it was getting dark and turning to night but the impulse to inquire of the time, to feel restrained by it, to care about it in general, was not there. There were more important things to think about and it was merely something man made.

As we began coming down, we both wrote a little in a journal I had brought along. Here is a sample of some writings of my friend:

It is so good to have a little reality check once in awhile The mind is amazing. Music is the language of life to the fullest sense Questions. Ahh How nice. Simplify, simplify, simplify, simplify, simplify Why do we fight when we are all the same Life is not complicated its the people in it who complicate things.

Here is a little of what I wrote:

Why is there so much obsession over nothing? Its all nothing when you come down to it. Just thoughts flowing by and passing through, coming forward and revealing themselves. Dismiss them I wish I could do so many things, so many things. I wish I could live with all of this.

We finished off our night by listening to Pink Floyds The Dark Side of the Moon (of course) and reattempting Revolution 9 while looking at computer screen savers of objects flying towards the screen. The shape and angle of the objects (stars, for instance) was always changing and jumping from the screen in some cases. Sometimes I was looking up at rainstorm, other times down a wormhole, zipping across light-years. 

We both were exhausted around 3 am after watching Fight Club. Halfway through, the high pretty much faded away and the movie was like any other movie, great, but still just a movie. I headed home and went to bed, sleeping far into the next day. I still get chills when I think about that day though, I physically feel a rush of energy and fondness. It is definitely up there as one of the best days of my life thus far and marks a landmark, a destination change for me. I felt that a mystery or two of self-identity had been chipped away that day. It was uncanny. I was driving a car around, walking around public places, thinking more logically (but still less educated) than I had before and I loved it. Every single moment, even moments of panic were thrilling and amazing and interesting. I never once got bored or wished to be somewhere else or with any other person. I felt like we were brothers, like we had bonded for life. 

Many people say that the legitimacy of the feelings I experienced is questioned because I was on LSD. They think that because it is a drug that I am not myself, that feelings and emotions and thoughts are not real but all manifested by the drug itself. But that is impossible because the only way that a persons thoughts, feelings and emotions and can be perceived is by that person manifesting those things, by our own minds. The drug LSD is not random thoughts and weird emotions splattered on a Smartie or sugar cube or piece of paper. I have no shame in admitting that LSD played a large part in changing in my life, because it is absolutely true. Had I not nor ever done LSD or done it with a less familiar person, I would not be the exact person I am today, close, but not exact. It helped me greatly to come to terms with what I really wanted to value, achieve and learn about in life and the kind of person that I want to become. I believe that everyone should try LSD at least once with their closest friend or even just friends they are very comfortable talking to and being around and in a comfortable place, most preferably in nature. There is something about the man made world that is incredibly less appealing than the natural one and this is amplified ten times on acid. Stories and accounts of trips, including this one, cannot even come close to describing the actual experience, the feeling of it when its good and the numerous benefits one can derive from taking LSD. Its truthful and genuine description are out of the realm of language.

[dose: slight overdose, squirt where a drop was the idea]

We are significantly addled. That is good. How near the flame now! Verging on the edge of incineration, we see that the business of selfhood itself is in flux. 

There is a blob of light just outside of me, perhaps two feet in front of my eyes. The blob of light dances away as my vision moves toward it. I cannot place my gaze directly upon it. It exists only in the dreaded Zona Peripheralis. Upon the blob of light, or rather pouring from all directions into the blob's pulsing, white-hot center, is the nexus of reality. The color, shape and essence of all things in the room flow and dissolve into the center of the light blob. And because thusly the light blob becomes a phenomenon so fascinating and compelling that I wish to pour all of my five senses into its center, I find myself in the quite desperate situation of wanting to 'be' the light blob, yet frustrated by my inability to fix any of my senses upon it. 

As this occurs, I become aware that my senses ( and therefore 'me') are being drawn and dissolved into the blob of light. Now joining all the matter of the material world in this commingled mess, my selfhood begins to bleed away. The blob of light expands in front of me, becoming a portal through which I plummet for no distance and zero time. I emerge awash in a most terrifying place. My selfhood has joined everything which exists around me in a chaotic mixed ocean of reality, sensory information and consciousness. In this place, I become suddenly aware of the process which got me here. This knowledge does not come alive inside my brain 'privately'. But rather seems to 'happen' outside of me. And though this thing had begun to play itself as a memory, or as a thing to be known about some ill-remembered before, it displaces the present and becomes what is actually happening. Therefore, I find myself living the various steps which got me from normal perceptual consciousness to this place of madness, but now as if for the very first time. In other words, what began as a hazy memory of something that had already occurred (as if I were sitting in my car parked on the side of the road, trying to recall something of the trip to explain my present location) instead becomes a new experience which is happening to me for the very first time. 

This is how I got here: I become aware of 'sensory traffic' (i.e. the flow of sensory data between perceived object and sense organ) as something tangible. This 'stuff' of seeing, tasting, smelling, hearing and feeling begins to dissolve into itself. This sensory 'data stuff', which had existed in distinct categories appurtenant to each of the senses, begins to flow freely out of those categories and into a variegated morass. Thus the profoundly abstract and disturbing synaesthesia state becomes a reality. Colors speak to me and touch me. The air smells of red and green. I can taste my own excitement. This last observation does not register immediately as a portent of what is to come (what already came). But it should have. 

As I lean forward to place a kiss on Lauren's hip, the sight, smell and taste of her flesh rushes so rapidly into my brain that the aggregated sense phenomenon that was kissing her hip becomes an emotional event inside me. Or rather, the bundled sense data shifts instantaneously from being about Lauren to being of me. This bizarre transformation triggers the breakdown of the boundary between sensory traffic and internal self-awareness (i.e. the current inventory of thoughts on my 'desktop' which owe none of their essence to any externally originating stimuli.). This understanding lasts only for a moment, though. Because as soon as I hold it, it disintegrates - leaving (in the wake of a small, bright explosion) a pool of undifferentiated thought energy. This pool mixes reality's emanations, my reactions to those emanations and all the other ejecta of consciousness in a seething mass which glows brightly white for the most part, but pulses spasmodically with intense non-primary colors for tiny instances. 

My selfhood has broken down and has been lost into all which had previously existed outside of me. My jaw dissolves into Lauren's hip, tugging my brain behind it like a slab of cold liver pulled by a coat hanger. I flow with the jaw into a place of warm and agreeable darkness somewhere inside her body. I believe my flesh eyes are closed. But I can see the effects of a highly reticulated prismatic kaleidoscope at work before my vision. I become afraid. Nothing is real. The things generated by my imagination become indistinguishable from whatever really exists. I panic. I need desperately for the real to assert itself over the imagined. I get up from the bed, turn on the light and command Lauren (though she will remember it as a whimpering plea) to exist more forcefully. She complies. I stand there shuddering and try to describe to her what has just occurred, and how now all of that experience seems a pool of molten gold, still stretched across the bed, from which I have just emerged, and whose gold liquid still drips from my body as a lingering memory.

This report is easily the most intense experience of my life. I respected LSD before for its ability to change ones perception but I am now totally humbled by what it has the power to do in very high doses. I have taken LSD before about 20-30 times and considered myself experienced, having tripped on doses of 5-7 hits quite often but this experience totally changed my opinion of the drug. On a higher dose it may as well be a completely different experience. I have emitted a lot of the less important details for the sake of brevity.

There were 5 of us and we got out 5 sugar cubes and dropped 5 drops onto each. However when we got to the 5th cube we only got 2 drops out and the bottle was empty. The empty (yeah right!) bottle still had residue on the inside that you couldnt squeeze out. It was a tiny plastic bottle used for mint breath drops so I was offered to eat the bottle.  J had previously eaten another bottle and said there was a lot in there still so I cut the tiny bottle in half with a knife and chewed on it for about 10 minutes. Everyone else had there cube of 5 drops and I ate the bottle which I now guess to have easily 10 or more drops.

I soon realised that there was an insane amount still in the bottle when heavy visuals started happening in as little as 15 minutes. It felt like I was peaking after 30-40 minutes. Besides the usual melting walls and sliding floors I was getting quite intense colour shifts that were unlike anything I had seen before. Soon the ground was swirling with the most intense fractal geometrical patterns I had ever seen. The world was exploding in life. I was tripping harder than everyone else (who were off the planet regardless) and I suggested we go outside as the cramped inside of the house was getting too much for me. I walked outside and the frost covered ground was like silver. I remember looking at two friends and they looked like some kind of mole creatures, which was the first disturbing part of the trip. The others soon joined me outside and we decided we should climb a mountain that is just near our house. 

At this point (approx. T=2 hours) reality started to slip away totally. Normally on acid (highest doses prior to this was 5-7 drops) I have got amazingly changed perspective on the world but at the end of the day everything was still real and tangible. From this point on I was honestly not sure what part of my experience was real and tangible and which was just a construct of my mind. 

I remember climbing up an alleyway before the mountain which had stairs and rails and covered in trees and plants it seemed to go on forever and it seemed like I was climbing through it for hours (its probably only 15 metres) I cannot stress how much it actually felt like forever in its most pure definition. It was like I was stuck in a 2 second loop of time that kept repeating itself without stop. Eventually a friend came and got me and snapped me out of my infinite stairway dream and raced me to the top. We were at the base of the mountain and getting up was really a bit of a blur. I remember climbing again for what seemed like forever. The long grass underfoot was entangling me. The grass no longer looked anything like grass or any earthbound form of vegetation. It was actually bright neon pink in colour and seemed to be laid our in patterns one might make in one of those spirograph things. I had never seen any visuals to match this.  I kept climbing, but in hindsight the thing that seemed really strange was the fact that I wasnt put off by this pink grass which was more a part of my mind than reality but I just smoothly fell into a mindset of accepting this new reality as truth. By the time I was at the top of the mountain I was barely cognitive of any sense of self. I have experienced ego-loss before on LSD a humbling feeling of oneness with the world but I experienced total and utter ego-death while there. I was no longer myself. I just was. The others seemed like ghosts wisping past me and any conversation was totally lost on me as my mind was busy building a new reality in front of me. That is what it seemed like my mind was literally wiped clean and I started gathering information in order to create a new mindseta complete new way of thinking. You cannot adequately describe in words what this feels like because your entire mind works in a completely new and alien way that describing to someone who has not experienced it is futile because they are trying to comprehend it using the sober method of thought.

I honestly cant remember everyone else leaving but at some point I realised I (whatever I was) was alone. Apparently when the others left I told them I would stay for a while but I have no recollection of that which scares me a bit. I dont think they realised how distorted my reality was at this point. With no company to latch me to any lingering traces of the real world my mind went on a journey through forever. I remember being wrapped in a scarf that G must have given to me which felt like a warm vine entangling me. It was more a part of me than a piece of clothing. I remember looking out over the mountain at the city lights which my mind recognised more in terms of concept than as actual tangible objects. I turned around and more hills and a beautiful landscape scene greeted me. I kept looking from the lights to the hills back and forward in a looping cycle that seemed more like a dream than a real world event. The grass was still pink and seemed like nylon cord more than organic. The city lights seemed like ribbons of light, the concept of streetlights was lost on me. I kept looping through a pattern which is what I imagine insanity to be, I would look at the street lights, spin around, look at the hills, rub my neck and look at the groundI repeated this pattern for what seemed again to be nothing less than pure forever. It took the most intense amount of willpower to snap out of this cycle. While looking around at the alien scene in front of me my mind raced and thought about things in a way I have never experienced and find hard to verbalise. I went into deep thought and pondered life and death I pondered reality I even pondered the concept of a concept for a while. I was not thinking in a normal conscious sense, I was far beyond any cognition of the normal world which included my mind. Looping concepts ran through my head, not in chronological time but rather in the form of pure thought. Ideas and loops like:

Life  death  birth  mother  father - life  death  birth  mother  father etc. etc. 
Food  Warm  Air  Live - Food  Warm  Air  Live  etc etc.

While this was happening I was aware of little or no visual or physical stimulus whatsoever. I was in a dreamland of the mind and this is where I (whatever that might have been) seemed to exist. Eventually I broke out of this repetitive chain of loops. As I came out of this bizarre and alien state of mind tiny traces of the real world started to creep in. A friend called me concerned at why I was up here so long and said I should come down because they were making some special tea. I had no idea how long I had been up there. I was still half in this dream world but made a conscious decision to walk down the mountain back to the house. Making a conscious decision was quite a task considering I had just been trying to work out what the hell consciousness was. As I walked I really wasnt sure if all of this was even real I may as well have just been curled up dreaming it all. I walked down the steep hill a different way to the one we came and it seemed to go on forever like the way up even though it was just a short walk. I arrived at a barbed wire fence and considered jumping it but my sensibility which had only just started to find root again decided I would probably hurt myself. I carefully examined the fence and squeezed through two non barbed wires unscathed. Finally I got to the bottom of the hill and hit a road. It was so relieving after having seriously been considering that this walk might in fact go on forever. I realised where I was and started walking the road back home. The moon was in the sky and was insanely bright. The moon has been out during the day lately and it was like watching a moonrise. I was totally amazed with how bright it was even though it was now daylight. It was right at the end of the horizon I was walking towards and seemed to totally suck me towards it. The strange thing was that as I was walking and reality came flooding back it was the real world that started to seem alien.  

When on LSD (lower doses) I get a certain clarity in my vision that makes the real world seem crystal clear but my view of the world now almost seemed too clearthere was so much clarity and detail that it seemed like a dream, I was amazed at how beautiful the world is. I always appreciated the world and how amazing it could be but this new perception took it to a whole new level. I cannot emphasise how detailed the world seemed it was like the opposite of a dream visuallyit still seemed unreal but the level of detail far exceeded what I knew to be reality.  After a few minutes I turned down the street towards my house and saw the other guys sitting out in the park watching the sun and the clouds. They cheered as I walked toward them and I breathed a sigh of relief as confirmation of reality had been achieved. The moment I saw them was really my first realisation that I was actually not dreaming and this was in fact all induced by a drugI seemed to forget that while I was up there. We went inside and the house was warm. I sat down and just rested for a good while and tried to assemble the mess that was my mind back together. 

The events on the mountain really did seem to deconstruct my mind and, as I came to, I had to reconstruct it from scratch.  It is a totally overwhelming experience to say the least and not for the faint of heart or mind, but was totally amazing. I talked with the guys for a while about what exactly happened last night and they filled me in on some points that I really couldnt remember. I had a cup of coffee and walked outside again. I was still tripping very hard visually but I was cool with that, my mind had been exhausted and I was just glad that my mind had stopped racing. I decided I needed sleep, or at very least to lay down and rest. My body and mind were both just totally depleted of energy. 

I wrote down a few words in a book I keep summarising my experience and view of the world and reality:

There is a certain place where ones mind is free to float in an infinite sea of forever. Ones mind is as much a reality as the physical world that we cling to. The mind and the physical are not two separate entities on different planes of existence. There is an infinite fractal architecture linking the mind and the body woven into itself forever. The entity we know as consciousness is a combination of our minds taking stock of the real world and the real world creating tangible realisations of what the mind would perceive to be true. The idea of forever lends itself to an infinite void of conceptualisation that can only be countered by stopping to realise the moment that is now.

That night LSD really handed my mind to me on platter and let me see inside. It was an amazing experience to have total ego-death and to question ideas like self I and real with total conviction. But it is also an experience that gave me a huge appreciation and respect for the drug. High dose LSD is not for everyone but in the right conditions with right mind set it can be amazing. I wouldnt say this experience was good or bad I was in a world in which those concepts where non existentit was simply an experience and a reminder of how fragile reality actually is.

I am 16 and for a while now I have been terribly interested in psychodelic drugs. My first trip was nothing like I had expected. I can still remember looking across the dead parking lot on that cold Febuary nite, to see four trees bent in half at the trunk and expelling shadows that flashed beautiful psychddelic colours and spun around on an invisable axis. Ever since I witnessed the impossible, I have became aware of something intruiging: when I look in front of me, I once saw the empty space as nothing. Now I see something. Or at least I can feel it on some level. There is an energy flow that binds everything and makes everything function in the most ancient and perfect way. 

I have had many trips since that night, including one recent trip during the day. I had been frustrated with myself before we dosed that day. For awhile I had been thinking beautiful thoughts without the mind-enhancing substances. But I felt that I was on the verge of something extraordinary. Something that will come into play in the near future. It turned out to be how to save the world. But I hadn't encountered that just yet.

Anyway, we dosed at my friend's house and went to a local park. It was outside of town and extremely beautiful; the perfect place to exclude yourself from the awful townspeople. The acid was from a Rusted Root concert; my friend had brought it back. Pyramid blodder with the most intricate detailing I had ever seen on an LSD inpregnated piece of paper. It took about 30 minutes to take over my mind. I was soon seeing all kinds of imaginary vines coming out of the swirling patterns on the floor of the picnic shelter where we were sitting. Soon we were all tripping our balls off and decided to go to the 'trippin' tree'. The trippin' tree is a tree that I smoked weed at on 4/20 the previous year. I was tripping on liquid that day. Just by chance. 

It took us a long time to reach the tree that was relatively close. The forest was just too alive to ignore. Plants were living right in front of me, and it was the most amazing thing. Green forest dwelling plants were sprouting and growing all around me as the trees swayed in the humid mid-day air. When we got to the tree, I noticed right-away that it was crawling with all kinds of strange creatures (indescribable beyond their roach sized, black bodies). We were wandering under the canopy for awhile, lost in the great nothing, never wanting to return to what I knew before. This feeling was common between the three of us and then my friend muttered,'we aren't lost, man...we have just been found...'  

We then decided that we were all going to peak soon so we decided to find the sky. And it was so. Our war-cry bacame incoherent as we swiftly moved about the trees with a primal passion to witness things we always look at but never see. Suddenly we came to an old wooden dock that led to a small sandy beach next to a large river. The sun filled everything with a reassuring sense that things were coming together. The forest took a breath in with a huge wind and turned brilliant white, as I shouted, 'We found the sky! Look! We found it!'

I was feeling great at my accomplishment until I looked to my right and noticed a fisherman sitting on the bank of the river. Fear came quickly and left even faster as I realized that he couldn't ever harm me in any way even if he tried. I was untouchable. I didn't even think he could see me. 

I soon remembered my friends and ran a feet feet back to warn them in case they needed to yell something about acid. Then we all walked across to the other side of the beach and layed on the bank of the river; more than safe from the view of the fisherman. I'm not really sure if he could hear us or not though.  If he could, I'm sure he could probably tell that we were on drugs or something to that nature. Awful townspeople...

As we were staring at the sky, the nothing morphed into a huge beautiful cathedral. Pink walls and purple columns. It was mesmerizing to say the least. The peak was begining to go away so we looped around to the shelter where we had begun our adventure. Taking the back way of course. When we got back to our suprise, it was later in the day and people had showed up to enjoy themselves at the pretty park. They wern't enjoying it on the level that I was. They were there to abuse and I could smell it on them. 

I first saw a fat woman whose car had aparently broken down. I laughed at her from a distance. She saw me an I didn't stop or even care. It was beautiful. 'That's what she gets for bringing that huge hunk of metal out here. This is no place for an automobile.', is what I was thinking. We got back to the shelter and there were people with their arms around each other's shoulders sitting on the swing near the overlook of the river. This was funny, so I laughed as hard as I have ever laughed and stumbled around in extreme amusement. I then proceded to annoy them with music. It wasn't my intention, it just played out like it was. Techno was on the menu and I was definitely craving something phat. Hard trance at first. The people soon walked to their car and drove away. And with the fat woman long gone, we noticed we were alone again. No more worry about being freaks to these people. But of course they were a lot freakier to us. 

Without saying anything beforehand, we giggled, all stood up and began stacking picnic tables to get onto the roof of the shelter. The shelter roof was steep and hard to crawl up. We managed somehow and layed on our backs and looked at the sky again. This time it was dominated by a massive pattern-covered dragon. It wasn't moving much, just sort of wiggling its legs and body a lot. The only words said in the next half-hour were mostly 'Wow' and 'Oh my God' etc. And that was enough, for we had Jimi to fill the gap of silence. 

After this we said goodbye to the forest and went back to Squaresville. It was more awful than before in strange ways. I was laughing hysterically as we pulled up to the convience store near my house. We went inside and I just sort of stared at the different things happening. The expression read I was not Impressed by the glossy lies of the Squaresville.

We did eventually go back out the the woods when nite fell. It was nice. We lit off fire works to celebrate our wonderful day. The drugs had worn-off but the meaning was there all the same. 

We then began weaving ourselves back into the anti-flow very slowly. My first friend did it with his love of fire. Easy destruction. My second friend did it with playing mind games on himself and everyone else. And finally me. I went back because of my addiction to different drugs that the anti-flow has to offer. And most immediately that day it was the simple cigarette. When I took my first drag since I had separated myself from Squaresville, I was embraced once again with the empty promises and lies. But it was a good cigarette let me say that much.

Since that experience, I have yet to trip and wonder again. But I will sometime. And I will walk over to the other side and remain over there with the beauty and the peace and the love. It is sunnier on the other side. I just wish I would have opened up a long time ago.

Just another night of college. I was sitting upstairs in my room at my house reading some books for my Humanities class. I got the urge to just go ahead and take the acid that I had been saving for Thursday -- which was 6 sugar cubes, and probably about 2 hits of liquid that were the remains of the vial from my dealer. 

It only took about 10 or 15 minutes for the acid to start kicking in. I had taken 4 blotters of this same acid the week before but it didn't really start to give me much of an effect until 2-3 hours after taking the doses. I went downstairs and watched a movie with some of my roommates and it was OK, I was getting a nice body buzz and enjoying things. I knew that I might have taken an awful lot of the shit, and because it had already started to effect me so quickly that I might be in for a really crazy and insane trip in a while.

Probably about an hour or two into the trip I was downright fucked. A lot of this time I can't remember, I was so out of it. I started to feel a total disassociation from myself and from everything that seemed so real and comfortable. While I lied on a couch listening to the music I was having overwhelming visual hallucinations, but it was how my mind was wandering that scared me. As I listened to the music I heard a voice singing with it, a comforting female voice, talking about how I should never ever do this to myself again. I couldn't quite comprehend this, I couldn't put my finger on whether or not this was actually part of the music or a hallucination, but I do feel that it was hallucination. 

I started fading in and out of a series of sequences and very important charades. There were several people at my house, and as I talked with one person, or if I talked with two people, the whole situation was different. I would begin. Then from there I would start to analyze the situation. 

It was I, one of my best friends, my drug dealer, and a girl. A strange situation. My drug dealer reminded me of Satan. A total form of evil, manifested within a human. I felt that my good friend and I were going to make things happen mentally. We might really discover what everything in life was supposed to be. The girl's presence was quite interesting; she was like a seductress, another agent of evil. She was there to stop things from happening. Was her presence sent from God to try and distract my friend and I from coming up with answers? It reminded me of the Epic of Gilgamesh (a very old epic poem), as a woman was sent to distract Enkidu, a character in the poem. He was a total primate; he lived with the beasts in the woods. The gods sent a woman to him and it tamed him. Women are solely an agent of evil. They are there to do nothing but distract us from finding true reality. While at the same time, I love women, and theres nothing I can do about it, I realize that its my primal instincts that make me love women, and I felt like I should overcome this. It seemed like she was there, and so was my drug dealer, as a test of fate. Would good win over evil? 

Before I had taken these doses I often thought that there might not be any true evil. Things don't HAVE to be dualistic. We can have good without evil. I thought that how everyone was caught up in the constant struggle between good and evil, God and Satan, right and wrong, was just a charade that we had created for ourselves. I saw so much evil this past night. I think it was God trying to give me a taste of hell and scare me into living my life better. It was an awakening that there are forces out there, which I shouldn't try to fathom. My trip started to take a whole new turn now.

I was on God's turf. Everything I saw... the millions of eyes I kept seeing and couldn't get out of my head. Were they the eyes of the dead and every soul that is no longer a part of humanity? Those that are lost but still manifested in 'reality' on another plain. It was like looking upon thousands of disassociated souls. I think God might have decided to show me things that night. I wasn't ready for it. I took it upon myself and took all those doses and God said, 'here you go, here is a taste of what you've been craving.' Now that I took it upon myself -- with such ARROGANCE -- to invade into matters that I was not supposed to tune into, it was my time to pay. All the evil and 'scary' images that I saw, that was me toying with God's universe. I wasn't meant to be able to comprehend all this, thats why I can't come to these thoughts naturally -- without LSD. God allowed it to happen though. He saw my soul screaming for so long and then he decided that He thought it was OK for me to see some of his ballpark. It made me feel humble as a human being. I wasn't supposed to be here -- in the manifestation of my acid experience. It made me feel sorry for intruding on God's space, like I just took things in my own hands and I really wasn't supposed to. I wasn't even really sure how much I believed in God before this but it solidified things so greatly now. It was the spiritual moment of my life. 

I went downstairs and sat in front of our iguana cage and started staring into the eyes of my Iguana. I felt compassion for him. He was no better than I was, and I was no better than he was. I gathered the warm vibe of a life from him by staring into his eyes. It seemed like there might be one of us -- a soul -- trapped inside of his body. Then I thought about how I am a soul trapped inside my own body. We're all souls trapped inside of the walls of our own body. 

I could probably keep going on and on about what acid did to me, I had such a myriad of thoughts and experiences on this trip. It would be defeating for me to continue on that though. There is one solid thing I got of this. Humans can't comprehend all this stuff. Its just too much for us. That is where art, music, culture, cooking, everything comes from. Everything people strive for, its just us trying to get by as much as we can within the whole world sphere that we're part of. We can't figure out the logos, we can't get a finger on all the reasons. I think this taste I got of it last night was a lesson. It was a lesson to just live my life out and not get so enveloped in trying to get answers. Yes, faith is important and I feel humble towards God now, but I think the key is just not to dwell on this stuff. I think that God, or whatever good is out there, is taking care of us, and we're ignorant children that can't comprehend His divinity. I just need to get by. 

I don't think LSD really helped this problem, nor have any of the other drugs I've done in my life -- cannabis, alcohol, dxm, mdma, cocaine, shrooms, everything. They don't solve the problem, they just distort it. LSD gave me a rude awakening though, a lesson from God, more or less. But indeed, I did intrude on God's turf for a few hours. I just hope I can learn from this experience as much as possible, especially without having the need to use again, as I do not want to put myself through this again, and I don't think it was meant to be. 

As one final note, as far as time is concerned, my trip was intense for about a total of 14 hours. I can't put a grip on where exactly I peaked, as the whole experience was too gray for me to put a finger on how things were going up and down. 

Take care.

Jesse

Yesterday I decided to take 3 hits of acid with a wonderful girl that I had met at college. She is of a 'free spirited' nature and is very much into sex and drugs and is very open about it, which I admire. This is the type of person I have always wanted to be, but I always end up being uptight about a lot of things. 

I decided that taking acid with her would change me for the better: I took it with this girl I had been hooking up with....and we were admiring the colors rising up from the ground, and the day seemed so warm, and we lost track of time and sat in the middle of the campus and played in the dirt and talked about crazy philosophies and decided that nature was more beautiful than anything else and we were there for like 4 hours getting as dirty as we could. We had a stick in our hands that we were using to represent so many things, we felt the stick's colors and life and discussed why a stick had to be known as a stick and not just what it is, a ________. Why did there have to be a word for it?

Time became an enemy to us and we found that when we walked to the gas station to get cigarettes, we found no problem in stopping in the middle of our walk, sitting down on the sidewalk and discussing life. Why did we always feel like we had to be somewhere when we didn't. We decided this was something we needed to permanantly change about ourselves. We got back to the campus and lyed in the grass again and it started to get dark and cold, but that was OK.

Then this hippie dude came up to us and he seemed so warm and hairy, we felt connected to his colorful shirt. That, and his hair and his warm smile made us feel so good, and we dubbed him our mascot.....the purple man. So we went back to his dorm and me and Megan felt so connected because we had stared into each other's eyes and watched all the colors pour out of them and we knew what each other were thinking without saying it because we would say YEA at the same time to confirm the conversation we were having with our eyes.

But then we both started to feel very sensual, being in a warmer environment with a bed and warm colors, but she was so drawn to this dude's hair and sense of warmth he was portraying. She started rubbing his hair, which I thought was beautiful and felt no jealousy, and I did the same, with absolutely no anxiety of being gay or any other stupid shit. The dude didn't talk much and would simply give a hearty chuckle and assure us that we were good people. I loved this dude, and I loved Megan even more. The feeling of sensuality we were having.....but then she started to only want to have anything to do with this hippie because he had such warm colors and hair, and I was dressed sort of like a greaser at the time and she thought my short spikey hair, black pants and white T-shirt was abrasive and giving off a cold image. 

All the sensuality we had created was being released on this dude and she started licking his face, rubbing his legs, and doing some of the most sensual things I had ever seen anyone do. But there was nothing I could do but watch. I could only hope she would eventually come back to me, but this went on for an hour and at the end of the hour my strong sensuality and emotions for her were so strong, I couldn't stand that I couldn't have her at that time, so I left....which she took as being 'cold.' 

I got back to my dorm at 4:30a.m. and had so many horrible emotions now flowing through me, but everyone was asleep and there was nobody to talk to. The acid made it impossible to sleep, and no matter what I did, the emotions only got stronger. I tried not to think about it, but that only made it worse, so did cigarettes. I felt trapped. I couldn't sleep, there was nobody around, who knew how many wonderful sensual things Megan was now experiencing without me. There was nothing I could do. I stayed up until 11:00a.m when I had class, because I was unable to sleep. Those 6 and a half hours were the worst of my entire life.

When time is measured by a rapidly accelerating heartbeat, seconds start racing so fast they become a blur and it's so easy to reach out your eyes and touch it and it sounds so brass like somebody smashed their face against a cymbal, then suddenly you're a song. It's a pink song with faded green edges. You can press your hands against your belly until your stomach sucks them in and you can feel that pink song, soft and slimy like a fetus inside of you. You pull it out with a gasp that echoes in your nostrils and it pulses in your palm like the heartbeat in your thumb. There's nothing to do except swallow this song and listen to the way the pink feels, cottony and vibrating down your throat, through your spinal chord, chilling your back to your toes and resting somewhere in the vicinity of your liver, where it throbs to the tempo of time and your heart.  Every trip is one moment, perpetual and unified by three smiling faces, wavering in the rainbow-tracer air.  (Every moment is a trip.)  All the shadows become livid and pounce into patches of watery space that taste like laughter, echoing ceaslessly for five timeless hours.

'you know you talk so hip man
you're twistin' my melon man...'
Happy Mondays

It was a freezing cold Friday night in November. Me, The Wedge, and Captain T-Bag had just moved into the Kappa Cappuccino house. It had been decided that in order to baptize the house and consecrate our friendship, we would need to have an acid trip. No big party, no women. Just the 3 of us and our one-hundred year old home. 

The thing was, i wasn't really that into it. We were having our house warming party the following day, and R was getting some ecstasy from this legendary batch that was coming out of Texas (of all places). I had dropped acid before, but the following night was to be my first night on 'E'. I always kept my drug use under control; while i smoked pot nightly during that time in my life, anything 'harder' was a treated as a special occasion. Ritualistic, almost. I was a little tentative about the fact that i would be rolling for 2 nights in a row...

Our guy showed up with our treats. It wasn't M., this cute little thing working her way through college, who was our usual source... just some random cat that we allowed to waltz in off the street and sell us highly illegal substances. Could be spiked with Liquid Plumber, or the guy could be a cop, but Hey! how much money would you like for those illicit drugs? 

(i digress. It's just that recalling the way i ran my life is a trip in and of itself)

Anyway, he told us that he had just done the stuff the night before, and it was 'Really Visual'. That got me. I had done acid a couple of times before, and while i had had a great time, and had some nice communion with the right side of my brain, it wasn't the melting walls, Bruce Lee movie trails that everyone had led me to expect. 

So we dropped. And then there is that time that you wait, spending time waiting for the time that time will mean nothing. 

'Dude, do you feel anything?' 

'No.'

'How 'bout now?'

'Nope.'

'Dude, i'm totally starting to feel it...'

'Dude, shut up. Too soon.'

I was sitting on a recliner chair... waiting. Wedge and the Captain were popping chewable vitamin c like candy. I was anorexic, at the time. As we were having a big party the following night, one that members of the opposite sex would be present for, i was doing my standard 'No Food For 24 hours' thing. They were hovering around me, waiting, looking suspicious. Finally, they charged me. The bastards held me down, my arms to my sides and shoved the tablets into my mouth. In all my experience with acid, this is the one time that i ever remember the exact second that the trip began. As my teeth sunk into the dry, chalky tablet, i felt the sensation that  someone had detonated a highly unstable naval orange inside my mouth...

And so it began. The thing is, we had the most incredible house for drugs. It was the upper level of this old victorian, The upstairs and then the attic, which was our living room. The room was decorated with this ultra-loungy, deco style funiture that The Wedge's dead uncle had purchased using mass amounts of Camel Cash in the 1950's. The ceiling was all sharp angles, the inverse of the sloped roof outside, and it was covered with dozens of glow in the dark stars. 

I decided that i wanted to see what what the downstairs was like on acid. The Wedge and The Captain's bedrooms were side by side, and they had both left music on. From the Captain's, there was house music (Boom-chee, Boom-che, Boom-che...) and from The Wedge's was something or other New Order, with that trademark base line (Dun dun dun dun dun dun, DUN DUN DUN...) I stood between the two rooms, swaying ever so slightly, back and forth, back and forth, trying to find that Omega Point, that calm in the exact center of the storm where i could hear both strains of music clearly... but just as one burrowed against my chest, the other would fade into nothingness. I must have stood there for like, 30 minutes, trying. 

I freaked out, downstairs, all by myself. I decided to go see what the guys were up to in the attic. When i got there, most of the lights were off, save for the lone black light bulb that the glow in the dark stars were sucking all their juice from. So they were shining brilliantly, but not generating any real illumination on the room below. And the furniture...

They had rearranged the entire room. Now, maybe it doesn't READ like that's a big deal, but really think about the last time that you came home and your significant other had rearranged the furniture, that vague feeling of spatial disorientation that you walk through over the next day or so. Then imagine that feeling on acid, with a minty green glow hovering in the pitch blackness above your head.

'Nice.' (Subtle, understated, the monosyllabic word was the Kappa Cappuccino seal of approval. But i guess everybody says it now.) 
No response. The room appeared empty... did they leave while i was messing with my audio? Could they really have slipped out without me noticing?

Suddenly, they jumped out from behind the furniture and tackled me to the ground. We laughed for a moment, hilariously. Then i said, like a three year old 'Do it Again! Do it again!'

So, i ran back downstairs and paced around for a good long while, anticipating. Finally, they called me back. When i got upstairs i felt completely and uterly betrayed. The one thing i swore i would never do on acid was sit and watch a movie. And that is precisely what they were doing... they had put all of the furniture back in order, and were sitting, calmly watching 'An American Tail 2: Fivel Goes West' which The Wedge had gotten from a promotion that McDonalds was doing. 

'Dude, no! I am not going to waste this totally amazing, mind altering experience on some stupid movie. I want a vision quest... I want to trip the light fantastic... i want...'

There, before me, being played out right before my very eyes was the universe tale of tragedy... the plight of this family of mice, just trying to make a home for themselves in the New World. They were on some sort of raft, racing on this violent current of water through this endless, labyrithine series of pipes...

20 minutes later, Captian T-Bag told me to sit my ass on the couch, 'cause i was in his way. 

I curled up like a child on the couch as this brilliant epic of mythic proportions built to a crescendo. John Clese was a cat who was trying to lure all the mice into the west so he and his evil companions could have something to eat. Dom DeLuise was this cat with some sort of glandular problem that risked his standing in the feline community by supporting the Rodent cause. And the late Jimmy Stuart was a dog who taught young Fivel how to believe in himself. 

There's this one part, with Fivel's sister (I don't remember her name, but she has always dreamed of being a singer) and they're trapped in this Old West style saloon. All these drunken ruffian cats are holding Fivel and Dom Deluise cat and Jimmy Stuart dog hostage, and things look like they're going to get really violent, and how will are heroes escape...?

And Fivel's sister SCREAMS! 

And the room freezes, everyone stares at her... but she holds the scream...

and a beer bottle shatters into a million peices... but still she holds the pitch perfect scream...

and then she breaks it down into this totally amazing, absolutely incredible hoe-down style song...

'WHO'S THE GIRL YOU LEFT BEHIND?
SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING
WHO'S THE GIRL YOU LEFT BEHIND?
SOMETHING, SOMETHING...
SOME-THING!'

Oh, i don't remember all the words, but seriously, it was incredible. My heart was racing. It was like somebody gently, painlessly carved this huge hole and my chest and was fucking it desperately.

There was a big showdown at High Noon between Fivel, Dom Deluise cat, Jimmy Stuart dog, and John Clese cat, and a tearful reunion with Fivel's family, and then...

...out on the horizon, while the hero rode off into the sunset, there was this tiny, non-descript little speck floating in the sky, i strained my eyes to see what it was then SNAP! It ripped into the foreground -- nearly out of the screen altogether  -- the enormous, finalizing words

'THE END!'

(This 
is 
Where 
i 
Peaked...)

I was in the throws of the deepest, most profound extacy i had ever ever experienced. I wanted to rip off my clothes... my shirt, my jeans, my very skin, and run through the street, singing all the words of 'Who's the Girl You Left Behind' that i could remember at the top of my lungs. I lept from the couch and started running circles around the room -- Then i ran down stairs to the main hallway. I shot back and forth from one end to the other, over and over and over again. When i got to either end, i didn't slow down, i just let myself crash full force into the wall. Then i would compose myself, turn and face the other side of the house, and repeat. All this felt completely, blissfully rational to me, as if there was no other reaction one possibly could have to a work of such life affirming, celluloid brilliance. 

The Wedge and the Captain obviously did not agree, and were probably more than a little freaked out that i just might never come back from that distant edge that i was now out upon. As i made one last senseless sprint down the hall, The Wedge stepped into my path...

The Wedge is not a small man. His Nome de Plume comes from the fact that he has a HUGE member, shaped like one of those wooden things you use to keep a door open. His entire body is like that... Monolithic, imposing... crashing into The Wedge was more jarring to my system than than all my times running into the wall combined. I slammed up against The Wedge, and the sensation was that of collapsing... folding... melting. I was like an egg smashed up against a house, while the force of gravity pulled my gellatinous mass back down to the ground. 

The Captian navigated me back up into the attic while The Wedge brewed up a giant pot of coffee. It's a well known fact among my friends that coffee actually smooths my hyperactive nervous system... I guzzled it down like it was Kool Aid... cup after cup. I remember my nerves telegraphing 'HOT' to my into my brain, but the very concept got lost among the neurons... 'what is 'hot' anyway? Just a word, an abstraction.' 

At about this time, the caffine must have sunk in for The Captain... he lit 3 cigarettes in his mouth at once. He put one into my mouth as i sat like a puddle on our sectional couch. He took the others, one in each hand, stood on the armrest at the other side of the couch and danced, swinging his arms around in these wide arcs. The red-hot cherries at the end of the cigarates traced glowing lines in mid air. I remember thinking to myself, 'This acid IS Really Visual'...

It was like 'Laser Floyd' at the Planetarium, but with better music...

The Captain sang along to the Madchester, acid house stylings of Primal Scream, 'Come Trip Inside This House'

(I didn't know until I bought the album, just last year, that the title was 'Come SLIP Inside This House')

The Captain finally plopped down alongside me as i stared up at the sloped ceiling, as the glow in the dark stars waxed and waned, shimmering, back and forth like a reflection of the full moon on gently rolling waters. I stared at it for the longest time, waiting for the effect to stop, waiting for the drugs to wear off, but it just continued, on and on and on. I broke into soft laughter. This was REAL. I thought to myself that if i could look at the Captain, and NOT tell him what i was seeing, but could somehow get out of him that he was seeing the same thing as me... then that would mean that this wasn't some mere illusion, this would mean that we had actually moved into some quantum, alternate reality where matter periodically shifted into a liquid state. 

'Dude, you see it, don't you? YOU SEE IT...'

He flashed me that wide grin that moistened so many women's panties. He raised his hand into the air. My eyes followed his pointer finger as he indicated the opposite side of the couch...

Exhausted from the amazing vibe in the room, The Couch drew a deep, sharp breath, then sank back down with an orgasmic sigh...

The Captain and I splashed back against the sofa where we sitting, and continued to watch the stars. 

That, more or less was the pinnacle of the evening. 
Sure, i could go on... about how i found The Wedge downstairs an hour later, wearing nothing but a pair of boxers, clipping his toenails on the patio in 10 degree weather...
...or about how i discovered how well plungers stick to my bald head, and that while i was balancing a plunger from a single fingertip, i was able to keep it from falling,  was able to control the very inner workings of destiny just by saying the word 'IS'... 'IS, IS, IS, IS, IS, IS, IS, IS' Until it ceased to be a word, and became an incantation. 

...or i could tell you all about the following night, on E, when i walked into my pitch black room to go to bed, and i heard breathing from some stranger on the ches lounge chair across from me, and i asked, coyly, 'are you a boy or a girl?'... 'Girl' ... and she welcomed me to climb onto her and have the most wonderful 30 minute relationship with her mouth...

(okay, i just did tell you that. ANY excuse to tell that story...)
I could tell you about how so many other moments of my life since that night are seen through the perspective that i gained -- evolved that night... 

All because of this one moment, when i sat, coming down, ever so gently while The Stone Roses 'Second Coming' album played in the background

'Are we etched in stone, or just
scratched in the sand...
Waiting for the waves to come 
and retake the land...'

And right then i knew. I knew that EVERYTHING is an illusion. Fleeting, temporary... i knew that existentialism is the most beautiful philosophy in the history of the world, because its the only philosophy that captures how brief and fragile we are, and thusly expresses how truly unique our existence is. I understood in that instant that The Afterlife is an oxymoron, fools gold  the Universe is an eternitys worth of Now, that never-ending IS. I saw that our individual lives are an interpretive dance, expressing from our subjective perspective what G-d, the Universe and Everything is all about. I felt that the only way to truly have lived for that instant is to get up on stage and feel the music...
So thats it. And here I am now, 9 years later. 
Still dancing.

    I was an experienced LSD user by the time I tried some acid called 'Alice in Wonderland'. I had recently given up Christianity and thought myself to be on the way to enlightenment. I used LSD as recreation, but mostly I used it in the pursuit of spiritual truth.

My dealer came by with some acid he called 'weak'. He said he was currently tripping on six hits. He certainly seemed to be in control of himself, so I thought I might not even trip much on one hit. Thankfully, I only took one. It turns out that my dealer usually had to take 6 hits just to get to a threshold experience, because he liked to go 'way out there', frequently.

    My husband and I took a hit each, early in the evening, on an empty stomach. After the initial 45 minute wait, I already realized that this acid was different. My husband seemed to be doing fine all evening, but I was engaged in a personal struggle. I felt a cold emptiness spreading through my body. I felt that my body wasn't solid anymore, my body and the room it was in were just an illusion. There was no comfort to be had in touching objects, because everything was composed of energy, energy that existed in a void of emptiness. 

     I felt a cold panic as I gazed at my husband. A thought formed in my mind of how much my husband resembled me in every way. Suddenly I realized that he was me, there was no separation. We were pretending to be individuals, but in reality there was only one presence. Then I realized that I am god and I am the only being in existence, a being who is alone and will always be alone. Though I divided myself into billions of pieces, in reality I am the only being that exists. I felt then, the most horrible void... a cold, sharp feeling in the pit of my stomach, as if a black hole was centered there and the universe was being sucked into it. 

      I was so lonely, tears were pouring down my face. My husband tried to comfort me but I told him that he was an illusion, he was just a part of me and not the individual I had thought him to be. Suddenly my thoughts turned to the world at large. In my mind I saw a giant wheel, and all manner of beings were lined up on the wheel. The wheel kept turning, and the beings on the wheel experienced life and death over and over again. They kept coming back, after death, to experience the wheel again, there was no escape. This was life for all beings, a ceaseless turning of a giant wheel, with no way out. 

       I wished for some way to end my misery, but I knew that even death would not save me because I am eternal and I would just be wasting a perfectly good body. At this point, when I saw no way out, I decided that I wanted the illusion back. I realized that enlightenment was the last thing I wanted! I wanted to be unaware of who I am, because I wasn't ready to be god. I wanted more than anything to be an ignorant human! 

        The night passed slowly, and finally we came down. We had quite a hangover.We were dehydrated, with headaches and photosensitivity. I said I never wanted to do acid again. We walked down the street to eat at a pizza buffet so that the heavy food would help us to sleep. Of course I didn't stop doing acid. I did learn not to think about my existence too much while tripping, and if I did examine my existence then I would do it in a positive way.

In the past year I have experimented a number of times with acid, probably around ten times. I have taken anywhere from one to six liquid hits, and I have usually enjoyed myself quite thoroughly. My previous strongest trip before the one I am about to describe involved heavy visuals, mild euphoria, and a ceaseless attempt to describe my crazy thoughts to my friend- what I would consider a pretty solid trip, although I remained curious about higher dosages. 

Last weekend my friend John came down to pick me up. Since John was the same guy I had my previous best trip with, I suggested that we take some acid before we left. He got 2 hits, and I took three, at about 7:30 PM. I told him that this time we would try to keep our tripping under wraps and try to party without acting too crazy. The weekend before I had bought three hits from the same guy and I hardly tripped at all, so I thought this task would be no problem. Also I believe myself to be a pretty level headed guy, and I feel like I am strongly in tune with my self at least on a mental level. So we hurried out to the car and drove to his place. Of course driving is not the best idea, but his place was only fifteen minutes away and we were already on his street and smoking a joint I had rolled before we started to become impaired in any way. We stopped in to a convenience store so I could get some gum (for the jaw grind) and some gatorade for John. I was nervous being in the store and I was happy to leave. We drove down the street to his place and went inside. This is the point where things become shaky. I realized at this point that the acid was coming on extremely fast. I remember pointing at John's roommate and asking 'is this dude going to watch us to make sure we're ok?' Soon enough he got kind of freaked out and left because he didn't ever trip and we were probably becoming kind of scary. 

The visuals were very intense by 9:00. Heavy fractalization of every surface of the room was occurring, and the patterns were raising up to the extent that they seemed to press together in front of my eyes, like somebody attached an air compressor to the walls and the room swelled up around my face. I have never really been scared about visuals, but this visual experience was a little too close for comfort. The uncontrollably pulsating room had become inescapable to me now, and my closed eye visuals were almost identical to my open ones. I was losing sight of John and grabbed his hand to make sure he was still there. I don't know how I began my downward train of thought, perhaps it was the uneasiness caused by driving on acid, or simply the sheer power of the visuals. 

I eventually seemed to be losing all contact with the room. I began yelping John's name just to try and prove to myself that he was still there. I lay down on the couch and tried to calm myself down but the effects of the acid were overpowering. I couldn't see the room now, just a constantly swirling gray mass strewn with prism like color effects. 

Another thing that had begun happening was a rush of energy through my body. Other times that I had tripped I had experienced what I thought was stomach gas, but this time the pain rose up out of my stomach and flowed up over the back of my neck and forward across my brain to my eyes. This current of energy was extremely intense, and seemed to be trying to burst forth from my body with ununrelenting strength. Spikes of solid electricity seemed to be bursting from my fingertips, my arms were numb, with that pins and needles feeling, but multiplied many times, and it felt like a fish hook had been attached to every nerve ending on my skin and the strings were getting tugged. What seemed to be crackling waves of energy were flowing across my head (I can only relate this feeling to the image of those two wires with the electricity traveling upwards between them, with the addition of the sensation of 100 fuses overloading and burning out every second in my head). My eyes felt as if they were pulsating rapidly in and out, and I was certain that they might pop out of my head. These sensory stimuli were unpleasant to say the least. 

At the same time I began to become less aware of my biological functions. I did not know whether my heart was still beating (when I felt it, it was very rapid) and my mouth and windpipe seemed to become detached from my body and I didn't know if I was still breathing. I constantly held my hand to my mouth to make sure that there was airflow (which there was, but it was very scary to experience this slight dissociation from body for the first time). These uncomfortable physical sensations as well an explosive mental state propelled me into a frenzy of terror. I thought that I had finally made myself insane through this drug which I realized I knew less about than I had earlier liked to think. I was grabbing frantically at the couch by now, trying to keep hold of the real world. I hopefully asked if this was almost over, and John said to my great disappointment that it was only about 10:00. 

I at one point envisioned a slight opening in my visions, which I interpreted as a rapidly closing portal back into the world of sanity. I used all the will power at my disposal to keep this portal in sight by way of grabbing the couch, yelling out John's name, etc. I felt that if I gave up I would slip forever into this chaotic energy world and be insane. I reached a point where I simply could not fight any longer, and I feared that it was all over. I asked John to call my parents or his or even the police- anybody. I was scared out of my mind. Before this I would have never for a second considered contacting any of these people, something that would not be at all practical except for in an extremely no resort situation. 

Luckily John did not have long distance and was in no shape to even dial the phone, so I was safe. I finally thought that I had died or lost it, and I thought my parents could be at any minute be crying over my body that I had left far behind in reality. I feel like at that point, if I had more control over what I was doing, I might have actually harmed myself. Somehow, John called his ex girlfriend, who was a veteran tripper, and she came over. When she saw me she ran over and sat next to me. By then I was nearly screaming and crying quite a bit. (I feel almost like a coward now but at the time I simply had no control over what was happening). I kept crying and saying stuff like 'I am sooo fucked up' and 'I am frying my ass off', because by then the physical and sensory sensations were almost unbearable- it literally felt like I had dropped my brain into a crackling frying pan. She was very soothing and rubbed my tingling arms and told me to try and keep my eyes open and it would soon end. 

After a while I could finally distinguish the room again and was very, very glad, to feel some deceleration of the acid. I got a can of beer but I had to ask John's girlfriend to open it because the senses in my hands were still firing out of control. She left after a while, and I was soon able to calm down and describe to John some of the things that had been going on inside my head. It was almost twelve by then, but the trip was still in full swing with pronounced visuals. Basically for the rest of the time I listened to what John had to say about his views on life which I found quite interesting, and also I felt too burnt out already to do much talking. We sat around and talked for a few more hours, smoked another joint, and after watching half of a movie we went to sleep at about 6:30AM. 

The next morning I was pretty quiet, because I was still contemplating the experience. I was afraid that I might have damaged myself mentally, or that I might start having flashbacks. So far though I havent noticed any adverse effects. I took a shower and my parents came and picked me up that afternoon to take me to dinner. Before I left, though, John made me promise not to do any more acid until I had learned everything I could from the trip. When I got back to school, I talked to a guy I know who has the most drug experience of anyone I know, and he told me he tripped really hard off of only one hit. Although it was by far the single scariest, most uncomfortable and physically painful experience of my life, I am glad that I was able to keep hold of that portal to reality and survive the trip. I would say that it was the first experience of my life that gave me a greater appreciation for life itself. I have actually had a very upbeat week since the event. What surprised me most was how unprepared I was for the intensity of the acid. I had taken more hits than that before, with nowhere near those results. 

I will most probably not do acid for a long time, and when I do (or advice for others experimenting) I will be very careful about dosage. I had no idea that I could actually have an uncontrollably unpleasant time unless I swallowed a whole vial. Also, the lights were on in the room and there was no music, a situation that I think probably increased my chances of settling on a negative train of thought. And I found that it probably is best to have a sober sitter to reassure you, because with LSD you can never know what to expect.

This was my first trip.  I was with my good friend M, who has been sober his whole life and still is to this day. He's the 'bookish' type. He was a good choice to go with since he was gonna be clean, and is a close friend who I constantly rely on and above all, TRUST.

A little about me: I am currently in a bit of a situation with my family. They push me hard at school and have recently discovered that I smoke weed. I am subject to urine tests now. I am still trying to figure out who I really am as a person. It's hard. i'm not very popular, or very talented, or very motivated. I am probably not the best candidate for LSD. But my mindset that day was one of happiness and comfort. We were at the Furthur festival, headlined by Ziggy Marley and  The Other Ones (remainders of the Dead). I bought the hits in the lot. They were on a little tip portion of one of those garbage bag twist-ties. I promptly put it in my mouth and went in. For about half an hour, nothing happened. It was absolutely freezing and I was underdressed for the weather, and the onset blended in with my shivering. Marley was on and I really enjoyed his set, which ended with the sun perched beautifully in the western sky. I was definitely feeling effects.  Things began to take on a bit of a 'sheen', and I became increasingly talkative with M, who was talking about some boring thing, but i was feeling very entertained. As the sun set, The Other Ones came on and I got up to dance. Now I noticed that every time I tried to keep my legs in any position but locked-straight, They shook with a spasm. I think it was partially the cold. 

As night took hold, the blankets on the ground spun and patterned in the grass. We went to the bathroom and that's when I really felt it. My walking was messed up, it looked like I was marching. I got under control and watched in amusement as the tiled walls of the bathroom twisted and rolled around me. When we went back up, I smoked maybe 3 hits with the people behind me and things exploded. Colorful fractal patterns danced and spun and seemed to actually coat all surfaces. I saw many repeating wallpaperish patterns, like a wheel with ducks inside, rotating slowly, to name one. As I looked at the stage, it became a fractalesque shape and then took the form of a purple sound wave that coalesced to the music. Then things got eerie. I heard my dad's voice yelling at me. I looked over at M and out of the corner of my eye, he looked like a strung up fish (in body position and facial expression, not actually with fins & stuff) with his eyes rolled back. The band had started its Drums/Space segment, which was totally freaking me out with weird sounds. The visuals had become pure and opaque. I started to feel like people where watching me. I tried to shake off the feeling by dancing, but every time I started to dance, i would get that paranoia. I would look behind me and all around. i decided to just sit and enjoy the music. It was hard. I kept thinking about myself and the start of school, and how I had to become a harder worker and a better person and get in a band and get .... whew! My mind was going too fast. My personality was being picked apart and examined thoroughly. I am a very analytical person, and now I was delving into my own head. I realized my insecurities and weaknesses. There are so many!! 

Luckily, the band changed songs and this snapped me out of that particular bad spell. Wow, this stuff was SO reactive to my environment. I saw M sitting there, just like me, same position, and this really comforted me. I thought, 'why would anybody be staring at me at a festival like this, c'mon!'  This worked. I sat and soaked up the music. They ended with Sugar Magnolia and I was oh so happy, if not a little shook up. I also noticed that my jaw had been clenched all night. ouch. The paranoia, although very very slight, came back upon exiting the venue, but I was pretty much fine.

BUT WAIT!!!! 

My dad was driving us home. M said 'There's the car, let's go.' and I about pissed myself. I greeted my father, put on a tape, sat down, and prayed. He didn't talk much and when he did, I pretended to doze. The street lights and cars flew at me and the road twisted into bizarre forms. It felt like we were going 200 miles an hour. The tape I put in started to get very onimus sounding. I recognized it as a song, but it sounded like thunder and crashing. I took it out, felt better, and faked sleep all the way home. M left moments later, and it was just me, except...

When I got upstairs, my mom handed me a bag for my garbage can. Why the hell was she up so late? I stupidly fumbled with the can and couldn't get it on. She gave me a look and walked off. I sat freaked over this little doozy for a minute, but then noticed the posters on the wall. i have lots of magazine sized pictures of bands & guitar players, so the wall is sort of like a mosaic. The people in the pictures seemed to melt within the borders of each poster, fill the bottom of it up like a glass of water, and slowly dribble down onto my carpet in multicolored trails of ink. cool. Everything in my room swelled and expanded (breathing). For some odd reason I grabbed a personal day timer/calculator thingy and got myself into a diary section I had written. The entries were titled 'March 5... march 7' and so on, but i had messed up the text so 'Ma' was deleted and a whole row of 'ch5, ch6...' was left. I interpreted it as channels, like on a broadband radio. I thought the entries were people trying to talk to me through my day planner! I spent a good ten minutes peering at these messages from people unknown until I figured it out and broke into gales of laughter. I decided to lie down with some headphones and I put on (why??) Rolling Stones, Exile on Main Street. I was aurally transported to the basement in which that recording occured. I could feel each instrument like an emotion. In the dark, spiraling rainbow shapes whizzed by and I could only smile smile smile.

Lots of cool stuff happened that night. I saw a great concert, listened to great music afterward, and watched colorful hallucinations melt my room. The trip ended on a positive note, and I felt good the next day. But...
Lots of bad stuff happened too. I had to deal with some intense paranoia, and ride home with my dad. I also got a true feeling of who I was. It was unnerving, and I now realize that I DO have to improve myself personality wise. This can be a devestating revelation to have on LSD. Luckily the band switched tunes here, a testamant to how easily I can be swayed by external factors. I think I need to wait until I have a better grip on my world before doing this again. I am not 'unstable', but I am still not fully realized as an individual. Beautiful as they can be, mind altering chemicals should be kept to a minimum for me until I straighten myself out a bit. Also, tripping around parents is BAD. I cannot tell you the fear I felt in that car. I'm very lucky my old man wasn't tired and didn't ask me to drive. So I don't know. was this a good trip, or a bad trip. The answer: It was a trip. nuff said.

Set: VERY tired from the <5 hours of sleep I got the night before, but in a good mood generally.

Setting: A small rave at a bowling alley (my first rave).

We entered the rave at the very start, around 11:00pm.  All of my friends were going to be rolling, but I'd been tired of it lately and hoped that I could find something a bit more interesting somewhere at the rave.  My hopes were fulfilled.  I told the guy I wanted 3 hits, and he asked me to buy at least 20, but I didn't have the money.  He told me 3 would be fine, so I tore what appeared to be 3 hits off of what I thought was a 10 strip (it was unmarked) and took it.  About 15 mintues later, I realized that he had wanted me to buy 20, and the 10 strip looked a bit wide, and...you get the picture.

All times except start are estimated, because I was really not paying that much attention.

12:35am - Took the acid.

01:30am - Definitely going to be an interesting night.... I don't sweat that much normally.  The floor was breathing and fractals were appearing in the wood.  Time slowed extremely, was actually wishing there were lights on in the room so I could see my visuals better. :-)

02:45am - Sat down for a while.  As usual, my friends who were rolling were bitching about the music or something and blaming it for 'killing their roll.'  Perhaps the fact that ecstasy only peaks at around 3 hours or their negative attitude is what actually killed their roll, I'd say.  My arm was pulsating and there were little black worms crawling all over it into my skin.  This made me happy, because I'd been wanting to get a larger dose of acid at some point.

03:00am - Went to bathroom.  Mental note:  Don't go in that bathroom again while tripping.  Sinks overflowing, somebody shit on the floor in the stall, puke in water-filled sinks overflowing.  Didn't especially bother me, but the fact that it didn't bothered me more, because it normally would have.  

03:30am - Like I said, this was my first rave.  When I first arrived, I remember that the first thing I noticed was that nothing made a damn bit of sense.  It was completely silly to an extreme I had never seen before.  Suddenly though, I looked around, and it made absolute sense.  Not that any group of people there fit together, it was just that the whole thing made sense.  It wasn't about 'PLUR' like everyone says.  There were many people there being mean or rude, and many being very nice.  There were the same ratio of nice people to jackasses that there is everywhere else I go.  The way it made sense was the same way a crowd of people walking down the street makes sense.  It was just another thing people do.  As with many acid headed thoughts, it is impossible to describe in English.  One thing I distinctly remember was laughing my ass off at the thought of massive groups of people being incredibly impressed by somebody swinging around glowsticks on a string.

04:00am - Began watching the DJ.  I saw the passion he put into his music and realized one of the things I have been missing in my life for a long time.  Passion for what I do.  Vowed to change this, and have been so far.  At this point, glowsticks were leaving tracers that consisted of the color of the glowstick and bright neon purple writing in some asian language.  

04:15am - Could feel the bass with every single hair on my body, and felt electrified by it.  Dripping with sweat as well, even though I was just standing there.  I had several important realizations about my life that I won't really discuss here....

04:30am - Danced a while.  The floor seemed to be covered with water or something slippery that was keeping me from dancing properly.  Sat down and watched the lights, which immediately began burning, with long colored flames rising into the air.  Greeted a friendly police officer as he walked by.  Absolutely no paranoia.

05:00am - Watched the DJ some more, and felt my fingers melting together.  Hmm....  Wow, the guy who sold me the acid was getting the next record for the DJ.  What a small world. :-)

06:00am - Just spent the last hour watching some friends dance with lights. 

06:30am - #1 way to fuck with someone who took lots of acid:  Turn on all of the lights in the building suddenly, after it has been dark for the past 7.5 hours.  Wow.  Time to leave, so we went outside.  That was when I truly realized how much acid I had taken.  The sun had risen and everything was a beautiful ultra intense pastel color.  The clouds were rippling and shooting across the sky at extremely high speeds.  I was cold, so naturally the trees became covered with frost and icicles.  The condensation on the windows of the car turned to frost, too (it didn't, I verified it with my friends), and slowly melted as I warmed up.  On the drive home, houses in the distance were pulsating and sinking into the ground, and a radio tower duplicated itself about 99 times, filling the horizon with copies.  Thought a lot about my life on that ride, until about 10 minutes from home when I thought a lot about peeing. :-) Felt, smelled, tasted, and saw a smell at the same time.

08:00am - Back to the dorms, time to sleep.  I can sleep on basically any amount of anything if I feel like it, and since I had only slept about 5 hours the night before I definitely felt like it.  Still patterning on walls, and hearing and seeing techno with my eyes closed.

Slept till 1:00, and woke up feeling EXTREMELY happy about where my life is headed.

My first LSD trip was actually kind of an accident.  The guy I usually buy shit from had been talking about some shit he had, hash and opium, but by the time I got around to hooking up with him he was out of hash and the opium was 'bottom of the barrel,' if you will.  I ended up buying four hits of acid, each dropped on some sort of gummy candy.

The night I got them I popped one in my mouth, around 9:00 PM.  I have tried morning glory seeds before, to no great hallucinogenic effect (in LARGE quantities), so when I wasn't feeling much more than slight dizziness after about a half hour, I dropped another.

I was lying on my bed, blacklight on accompanying numerous blacklight-sensitive gadgets.  Jimi Hendrix's Woodstock '69 recording was playing, a sound-sensitive light toy on top.  I first noticed a significant increase in energy.  Soon I found myself smiling broadly, immersed in the music.  I began to notice the walls rippling slightly.  This proceeded for an indefinite amount of time (LSD was not good for my time perception).  Eventually, I left to go get an issue of HighTimes from the other room.  I took it to the bathroom, where the lighting was better (my room has no normal white lights).  For the next hour or two I scanned the magazine, not moving forward or backward in the pages, just around.  I didn't really read (I remember trying and not being capable of mustering the concentration to comprehend each individual word).  I smiled broadly and laughed.  I was in a state of complete bliss, every color swirling and melting, every word evading my gaze.  I would try to scan every picture and segment of text on a page without being evaded by any, and felt quite proud of myself when (I believed that) I did.

I eventually got up and left.  Everything was shifting and melting.  The patterns on the carpet, the blankets on the bed and the patterns on the pillow, even the dog's bed in the corner.  I peeked out the window over the water and was surprised to notice that it looked oddly normal.  I left the room and went to the computer.  The background at the time was a landscape with mountains in the distance and a sun in the sky that had been re-textured in a sort of tie-dye.  The colors bled and swirled.  I switched, with some effort, to a chat window I had left open and attempted briefly to decode what was being said.  I soon left out of boredom.

This is when my trip took a bad turn, around 12:30.  My dad was still awake, watching the olympics (in Sydney, where it was just morning).  I realized that I wouldn't be able to talk to him or explain why I was awake in my state, so I turned off the blacklight (the only light) and the stereo.  I became very tense and remained so until around 4:00 when I fell asleep.  I couldn't keep from clenching my fists and grinding my teeth, often biting my cheeks as hard as I could to prevent the feeling of teeth scraping against teeth.  I wandered the hallway after my Dad went to bed.  Everything was still melting, only now the colors weren't emphasized as they had been; hard lines solidified and the colors around them turned dull.  I attempted to listen to music to mellow me out, but everything I tried to listen to sounded harsh and grating, from reggae to Jimi Hendrix's blues to hardcore to comedy.  By 2:00 or so I just wanted it to be over.  I kept checking the time, as if searching for some anchor to reality.  I found myself become more and more paranoid that I had somehow permanently damaged myself, and often repeated my name, birth date, etc., to myself to prove to myself that my mind hadn't been destroyed.  Finally, I fell asleep around 4:00.

I woke up around 7:30, when I needed to leave for school, to my parents shouting at me for being so reluctant to get out of bed.  I quickly put on deodorant, brushed my teeth, and dressed, leaving with an english muffin in hand that I didn't feel like eating.  For the first half of the day I remained paranoid, my senses and mind somewhat dulled.  I felt like I had a fever, experiencing slight delirium and cold/hot sweats.  School was hell, but I was afraid to tell anyone because I thought they would find out that I had taken LSD.

By the afternoon most of the symptoms had passed.  Although the latter portion of the trip wasn't extremely pleasant, and it fucked up the next day, I would still try acid again simply for the bliss I felt during the beginning (although next time I may only drop one hit).  I have gotten some advice on ways to lessen the comedown, most of which involve knocking yourself out so you can sleep through it all.  Overall, I would grade this an expanding experience, if not thoroughly positive.

We had been planning a camping trip for a long time, and I had been saving the empty vials of some truly wonderful acid for months in anticipation.  Two hits had previously provided me with the hardest trip of my life. (!!!) I've used lsd dozens of times, but needless to say, I was somewhat apprehensive about ingesting an unknown quantity of the liquid.

T+0:00 - We slice open the Sweet Breath bottles with a razor blade and begin to suck.  My friend N eats all of his, and I sadly, save the cap and nozzle for later.  I'm nervous but excited as I taste all the liquid that's caked on the inside.  

T+0:10-0:15 - The acid doesn't take long to show itself.  My previous experience with this batch took about 30 minutes to get going, so I assume that this will be more powerful.  N is also feeling it as we settle down at the campsite to view the trees.

T+0:30 - Tripping. Oh yes, tripping.  N is VERY tripping.  I'm laying on the ground staring up at the trees as he sits down next to me and calmly informs me that he's lost his wallet in the woods.  Twinge of nervousness.  He's obviously very out of his head, so dealing with finding a small leather wallet in the forest might be a problem.  He takes a few minutes to collect himself, then expertly wanders into the trees and locates the billfold in minutes. What a professional. Back on track! Let's go to the damn beach already! No no, the others aren't ready.  Two other friends are on the same batch, but only 1 hit.

T+:45 - Beach! Beach! Ha! Little boys with toys.  We all pack into a giant car and trundle off to a cheesy little tourist beach on lake Michigan.  Someone throws what I would later discover to be Wagon Christ into the CD player. Amazing backwards noises and insane psychedelia. Quality album.  Both N and I are having crazy auditory hallucinations, but it's clear at this point that he got a lot more chemical than I did. Sigh. Should have eaten the whole thing. Still could... but, I'm tripping madly anyway. Save it for a rainy day.

T+1:00 - 3:00 - I will say only this: as far as toys go, lakes and sand have no equals. Gah.  At this point, and as the trip continued, I really wasn't able to determine how much I had taken.  The low visual level seemed to indicate less than 2 (as two drops had knocked my eyes out of their sockets...) but the intensity of the pure psychedlia was out of this world.  As I said before, insane auditory hallucinations.  Weird, dissonant backwards noises, children laughing, etc.  N had a great deal more of the same. Pretty cliche in some cases, but very powerful.  This wasn't the experience I expected, but with acid, it rarely is.  

T+3:00 - As we left the beach we had to wade back through the more populated area that we had left behind upon arrival.  Antsy parents yelling at children they perceived to be in imminent danger of having fun, middle-aged men with Birkenstocks frying wienies and wearing ray-bans, their wives laughing nervously after EVERY SINGLE SENTENCE... all of a sudden I was struck by the powerful urge to fornicate.  It felt, well, more honest. 

T+3:10 - We left a parking lot full of SUVs to go to the local market where we all purchased ludicrous amounts of snack food.  Three hours into a trip and we were all stuffing our faces and laughing like a bunch of stoners.  How ridiculous.  Good time though.

T+3:30 - Now the fun REALLY begins.  We're back at the campsite and wily enough to convince our token sober boy that we can drive.  FOOL! He hands N the keys and we tear off down the winding Michigan highways.  Oh yes.  Don't drive on acid kids, it's VERY dangerous, blah blah blah.  I've never been very good at listening to my own advice. SIGH. Still, we had determined that our ultimate goal for this adventure was Toast, and the nearest grocery store was 15 miles.  Everyone has to have a dogma, right? Why not elevate toast to the divine? IT'S GOOD! In any case, we arrive in a shitty little tourist trap and buy our 3 dollar loaf of bread.  My turn to drive!  What an amazing experience.  I LOVE driving on acid.  I understand most people are appalled at this practice, but really, it's my  favorite part of tripping.  My mind is flying at a mile-a-minute, examining my life, examining the world around me... yet another part of my brain is intensely concentrated on the road and driving.  What can I say. Everyone gets off somehow.  I've got a sick thing for putting egregious quantities of psychoactive chemicals in my body, then hurtling myself and 2 tons of steel down the road at 70 mph. As N says: Glorious.

T+5:30ish - We're now on top of a mammoth sand dune overlooking lake Michigan.  Everyone's here. Even the other tourists.  Snap. Flash. Click. Wind. Shut up Timmy.  Our entire group cracks wise about the 'scenic.'  There it is! The scenic! I'm gonna get some of it! Roll all over it!  Oh crap, I've got scenic in my shoe! We went! It seems that to many of these people, the actual experiencing of the experience isn't at all important. They're all caught up in what this vacation is supposed to be.  Doing so much that they never really see it. WE WENT!

A child exclaims, 'Look at the sun!' and everyone laughs.  God what a sight.  A lake spread out farther than we can even perceive... a red ball of fire diving into it... we have to turn our heads from side to side just to take everything in.  So large, so grand, so FUCKING AMAZING.  And someone behind me is chatting about what so and so did at the charity auction and wasn't that awful and oh my god she didn't!  Feh. Unfortunately, that's not a hallucination.

T+6:30 - The rest of the night is spent laughing, talking, brooding and eating around the camp fire.  We play guitars (the auditory is still fantastic) quite a bit. We play some Frisbee.  More toys for boys to play with.  I eventually sleep at about the 12 hour mark.

Overall, this wasn't a life-changing trip, but it was entertaining as hell.  I really can't say conclusively how much I got out of that empty vial, but N got a lot.  Based on his reaction I'd throw out an arbitrary guess of 3-6 hits.  Not bad for a freebie.  The bulk of this trip (for both of us) was examining the people around us.  It was pretty, well, sick.  But it provided (and always does provide) a fairly sobering view of one's self.  We laughed a lot at other people, but we laughed even more at ourselves and our own absurdity.  Ridiculous boys playing with ridiculous toys.  We nearly fell down laughing during our Frisbee game.  This was also the STRANGEST trip in terms of physical urges.  We had the MUNCHIES!  I can almost never eat on acid, especially while peaking.  Then the urge for sex.  Still, for both, I lay the blame on setting.  I believe that the people around me channeling their primal urges into silly social games triggered these responses in me.  Everyone else had similar effects though.  I wouldn't attribute it to the chemical, as earlier trips failed to produce munchies in anyone.

When one views his or her own human fallibility through the gross example of thousands of others, it should make you feel small and humble, right? Or not.  I generally find it pretty liberating and entertaining to admit my fellowship with the festering masses.  Just a silly boy.  Time to find some new toys I suppose.

I decided I wanted to try LSD for a lot of reasons. I had some hang-ups about being naked that frustrated me and my new husband John. He couldn't understand why I still had problems trusting him, and neither could I. I was so jealous of people who felt free enough and comfortable enough with themselves to be able to display their bodies without feeling terrified or even the least bit nervous. I also had this underlying self-hatred that just drove me crazy. I wanted to have the confidence in myself that everyone else appeared to have.

For a year I had been working on making it better. John was my largest motivation because I could see in him how frustrated he was with me. I got to a plateau where progress was no longer being made. My need for control had trapped me. I was in the position where I had to give up very precious comfort in order to go forward, and I just couldn't do it. I decided that LSD was the answer, like electroshock therapy was for the insane. 

John was getting more and more annoyed with me about my strong desires to use LSD. He has used it a few times in his life, and he knew what it was all about. Because of my terrible reactions to marijuana the thought of me on LSD terrified him. He told me I was obsessive, and I probably was. I was so very anxious to change, and I knew he would be so much happier with me once I did.

It was difficult to actually get my hands on the drug. My brother who uses drugs very liberally was no help at all, but was anxious to get his hands on whatever I was able to get. He offered to try it out first to determine how much I should take, and whether it was safe or not. My friend pulled through for me beyond my expectations and finally I had it in my hands.

Within a half-hour of telling my brother about it, my brother had it in his mouth. The next day he gave it his stamp of approval. What was left of the strip of paper was a little less than an inch and a half. My brother took about a half-inch square. He recommended that I cut up what was left of the paper into five pieces and then take one piece. I told John to cut up what was left into thirds because a fifth didn't seem like enough to me. 

Then out of the blue John asked me if I wanted to take it now. I couldn't believe he suggested it, especially after all the fights we had had about me doing it at all. I dropped one of the three papers under my tongue at 3:00 PM (Presidents Day) and we watched Big Top Pee Wee. An hour passed and I was feeling in a particularly good mood, but I wasn't seeing anything, and it seemed like nothing was happening. I told John I was feeling pretty disappointed, and that perhaps my brother was lying about the strength of the drug. After an hour and a half John amazingly suggested 'Still nothing? OK Take another and I'll take the last one.' The movie was hilarious and bizarre, and occasionally scary. At the end I remember laughing and laughing at the image of an elephant in overalls. John said 'Now that's just WRONG!'

At 5:00 PM I was feeling pretty stoned. I had noticeable shakes and the walls started breathing around me. I also felt like I was in the best mood of my life. We put in some music and it hit me like a ton of bricks. Time started crawling at an incredibly slow pace. I snuggled up to John and relaxed. My mind started to float away. I was enjoying this non-thought and the feeling of John's body next to me was the most wonderful feeling in the world. I tried to play the piano and the sound of it was strange and new. I was still able to play when I wasn't thinking, but when I concentrated the music just slowed to a halt. We had a hard time finding CDs to play because they either had skips or they just stopped in mid-song. Then I realized that I didn't quite know what I was, where I was, who I was, what we were doing. The only thing that I knew was that I was in a living room, assumed to be MY living room. As for the rest of the universe, it wasn't there. All there was was that room and the only other person who existed was John. My ability to communicate was shot, and everything we tried to say to each other echoed in my mind until it made no sense, while at the same time it made more sense than anything has ever made sense. Every attempt at conversation left me laughing. I was smiling so much my lips started to tremble from the effort. I watched the curtains in the living room flow like liquid into itself. Bright and neon green. The walls around me towered to a point where I felt like I was only a foot tall. 

We were smoking like crazy, because time had slowed so much it seemed like there was a smoke in my hand for hours at a time. He complained about how much I was smoking, but in between smokes it felt like there had been at least a half-hour of non-smoking. When I moved the cigarette around it had what I would call a 'chaser tracer'. I'd watch the cherry of the cigarette move, then a bright red spark would chase it wherever I moved it. I figured that one of my eyes was following the smoke a little slower than the other.

I had to make a trip to the bathroom due to waves of nausea. The walk through the hall was very long, and I thought I would be walking forever. The walls pulled away from me the more I walked.  In the bathroom I stared into the sink with the water splashing onto the drain. The water appeared to make the metal drain plug melt as if it was acid rain. I turned and looked at the bright yellow shower curtain and it breathed and flowed like the curtains in the living room, like liquid. I lost the feeling of having to throw up and I decided I was just making myself sick by thinking about sickness. I came back to the living room and hugged up to my husband again.

I tried to explain to him what it was like for me. How reality wasn't reality anymore, and how I didn't know what our purpose was or what we are supposed to do the next day or the day after. I so appreciated his ability to hear what I was saying, and to respond appropriately. Then it seemed like I was looking at myself from above, out of my body. I floated there for only a moment, blinked, and was back in my body.

I felt so much love for John then, that it swallowed me. No emotion I have felt was ever that strong. All I could say was that I loved him, that I trusted him, that I needed him. As confused as my words sounded to me as they came out, John seemed to understand me completely. I felt that he and I were connected through our minds. By the time I started to understand what an earth was, and that we were on it, I realized that my mind was being pieced back together after a complete loss of reality. I subconsciously decided that this was the best time to rewrite myself, to change myself to be what I always wanted to be. I didn't even remember what was wrong with me but I knew I had the ability at that very moment to change myself. I talked out loud to myself saying 'I am beautiful, I love myself' regardless if I thought I believed it or not, and regardless of how corny it was. Then I took off my clothes and said 'I'm not afraid to be naked, I like being naked'. This was in the full light that was always my enemy. John embraced me about the waist and told me I was the most beautiful woman in the world. I was able to wander around the house, in the light, completely nude, and even though I felt frightened I knew that nobody would hurt me, because remember the only other person in the world (the living room was the world) was John.

I wanted to lie down in the bedroom because the music was too intense and the light was bright. We lay down and talked for a long time, never quite making much sense. He started kissing me and his lips were wonderful and soft. Suddenly I realized that we were having sex, and I laughed my ass off at the thought of it. It seemed like such a ridiculously silly thing to do that I couldn't help but laugh. I never knew I was turned on in the least, but sure enough I was wet. Every one of his moans shot this intense pleasure through me as if everything I did to please him pleased me as well.  I thought about how primal it was, like we were animals, which we are. I thought about how wonderful it would feel to have a baby growing inside me, and he said 'I want to fill you up with babies' which was incredibly romantic in the moment. The bedroom had this strobe-light effect of flashing light. The light was as blinding as the darkness. 

I got dressed, and made the bed. I loved the softness of the blankets and I wanted to roll around in them for a while. I followed John into the living room and I was completely amazed that the CD player was still playing the CD that I put on earlier. How could this be?!? That seemed like 10 hours ago!! John insisted that he had pushed play on the CD again and that it had started over, but I thought 'You are so screwing with my head John!'

John decided he was going to go to the store to buy some cigarettes. I didn't like this idea at all. I didn't know how hard he was tripping, if he knew what he was doing at all, and if anyone would know he was on drugs. I sat and thought about this for what seemed like forever, and I just couldn't grasp the idea of John going to the store without me to buy smokes. I made a valiant effort of trust in him and said against all my of instincts 'OK John, go to the store and I'll wait here alone'. The thought of being all alone seemed frightening to me, as well as the thought of John out there all alone. I imagined him wandering off into the woods and getting lost, and at that moment I almost ran outside to try to find him. Another valiant effort kept me inside to wait for him, because I had to trust him. And sure enough he came back home safe and sound.

We lay down in bed together and watched the hallway. The ceiling looked like it reached down to the floor, and the door in the hall was morphing around in a neat kind of way. Then the light of the hallway compared tothe darkness of the bedroom that we were lying in really had a cool effect. The doorway looked like a pool of water vertical to the wall, and the images of the hallway were only a reflection in the water, bobbing and rippling. John said I should look at this light bulb because it was the coolest. I decided the light bulb was turning around in circles like a surveillance camera. It stretched out and I said 'It's a surveillance penis!'

Then I turned over and looked into the closet. It reminded me of being a child and how the clothes in the closet would morph into monsters. Sure enough there were monsters in that closet. There were little spiral bright rainbow dealies flying everywhere that were rather interesting as I peered into the closet.  I saw skulls and spiders in there, so I decided to roll over again away from that. John was trying to tell me a story about the history of mushrooms and acid, but all I could pay attention to was his face and how it expanded and contracted in a scary kind of way. Then his face morphed into the face of a woman which was pretty funny to me at that moment.

John's trip was ending while mine wasn't, and I couldn't sleep.  We attempted sex again which was fun but I couldn't come for the life of me. Then he lay down to sleep because he had to work the next morning and it was already 2:00 AM. I told him that I was so proud of myself for doing so well that day, and that my life would never be the same.

I tried to stay as still as I could while he started snoring away. I watched the images behind my eyelids that looked like stereotypical acid images like from Yellow Submarine. Happy flowers flowing into birds flowing into teddy bears, etc. I got up and went into the bathroom. There's a night light in there so I decided to leave the light off. The entire bathroom was very red. I stood there in front of the mirror and just stared at my nude body. I loved the way it looked with the red hue everywhere.  

I finally fell asleep at around 4:00 AM, only to wake up at 6:45 AM to drive John to work.

not long ago i was handed a couple of sugar cubes of dubious strength.  they were a little old, so anything could happen, really.  or nothing.  i like a good experiment, so my psychadelic partner and i gave it a shot.  and there wasn't much there, really.  so we smoked a good amount of pot and tried to get over the disappointment. and that's when it became a good experience.

i've been taking psychedelic drugs for ten years, and i feel like i have a pretty good relationship with them.  i got over a bad trip.  i've never lost control.  but i've always taken quite a lot.  at least a couple of hits.  this was different.  it was more like regular consciousness.  i made drawings and they were actually good.  i recorded some music and it was recognizable as such later on.  conversations made total sense.  but it was all psychedelic.  just not so perfectly removed from the regular everyday brain state.  it has enabled me, since then, to reconcile the two ways of thinking, and to adopt a more psychedelic aproach to life. 

and that's the point, really.  to change your life and the way you see reality.  to expand.  not just for one insane evening, but for the rest of your life.  so i would recommend giving it a shot.  try a couple of subtle trips.  meditate, if you're so inclined.  slowly it will seep into your daily life and you'll be capable of that kind of thought all the time.  good luck.

1995 was the year of acid for me, a doorway into places i am certain i dreamt about in my childhood, crystal dimensions, where i could taste colors and touch sounds and smells  with my hands from the very first trip on, i felt great amounts inhibitions and unresolved issues from my shitty  past leaving me,literally'enlightening' me. i was like a snake shedding skin and slithering into a newer safer place. i stopped being afraid of who i had become. in August i had my most important trip yet. a few weeks after my 18th birthday, my then-boyfriend, D, another friend, G, and Buddha Ben (D's brother) decided we would 'visit other galaxies'. it was Buddha Ben's first trip, so we were excited about the initiation, as we always had an amazing time on acid, even all by ourselves.

it was a breathtakingly perfect Wednesday night, and already the night was charged with a full moon under the cool jewelled Southern skies.we were set!! we popped a tab each in the evening,and proceeded to have dinner', perched in front of the tube, of course, a hilariously complex fiasco. i had forgotten how to handle cutlery. i stared to tingle a little,then the chicken on my plate was acting up!i had vivid impressions it would start tweaking on the plate and bleeding a la Lynch's 'Eraserhead'. I regarded this vision with much morbid curiousity. next to me, G was staring at D's mom who was eating away with extreme Fascination! i looked to see if anyone else's trip had kicked in and the look on their faces gave it away! I could've sworn G mouthed 'i'm on fire!' (later he claimed it was 'Good UK shit'.no connection whatsoever!!) Eyescheck?? they were glazed and ready to roll! we grinned at each other, a secret code. D's mom looked at us strangely,and sort of yelled that none of us had touched dinner. she became fuzzy,mouth open and shutting, volume fading --i had muted my boyfriend's mom at last, i thought triumphantly! suddenly,i pointed out that we were watching the ballet on TV; the male ballerinas started flying across the screen , lilac tights over monstrous bulges.we collapsed into uncontrollable laughter, which set me flying!! D's mom caught on finally. Sensing a vile nagging , we took off into the night, taking with us the usually  extremely-calm Buddha Ben(hence the name), who was starting to take on a maniacal look in his face, as he hummed the 'wizard of Oz' song. walking into the hills ,we suddenly stumbled upon a poster for a lost gala in the dirt road, which appealed to G and became G's 'quest' for the night. I started to have 'trails' now, and as D skipped around, he morphed into a human slinky before me. 

we walked aimlessly, searching for the Wizard of Oz and a lost gala (reward:200 dollars,we agreed would be spent on more acid, naturally). i settled into the moment with a sigh...the world became butter smooth.i began to sense the onset of my peak and within minute, i began detaching myself from my body. during the odd reality  i was amazed that we were even walking, it seemed surreal!!

The temperature dropped sharply and the night turned frosty, the fog trailing all around us in pastels. i stopped breathing for a while so i wouldn't shatter this moment of intense beauty. suddenly, my boyfriend and i mysteriously found ourselves alone! G and BB had stumbled off somewhere in my brief moment of reverence.

D and I walked to a huge oval field, surrounded by a dense forest of eucalyptus on one side i noticed was breathing softly..there was an electric stillness in the area. I could not register the cold in my body though mentally i KNEW it was freezing!! D and I looked at each other in frozen silence, reading each other's minds. BANG!from this point on, we felt our experience becoming one and the same!

It hit us at once. Naturally,we both had a quest too.I had lost my pregnancy two weeks ago, and today's purpose was to let go. we approached this seemingly dreary mission  with intense peace and love. Looking up, I saw an overpoweringly large dome of rainbow criss-crossing and enveloping us.. From  the middle of the field, a silver chord leading into the eternal nightsky. i fell in and out of sounds and sights,at some point i had a conversation with the child i had lost, voices whispered from beyond the sphere; it was so sad and elating at the same time. throughout this 'ceremony', D watched me, sitting on the wet grass, nodding occasionally each time a peaceful thought crossed my mind and spoke to me. at this point, time had distorted severely for us, seconds stretching into hours and hours of conversations with the Universe.

to date, this is the most intense encounter i have EVER had on acid!!!a real rush, not unlike large doses of speed..after i felt totally cleansed, we walked the streets and into a 24-hour gas station, where we met some old friends. I felt like 5 years old and noted i could see AURAS around everyone!!!I paid for a fizzy dizzy Coke and told the gas attendent, with a huge hug, things will be ok!! (i saw so much RED around him.) he looked at me all puzzled for a few seconds(??!) then  broke into a smile and said thanks.

we glided on  home, agreeing we were both coming down now. when we got there, BB and G were sitting on the caravan roof with beers,in hysterics and howling at the moon. As we sat down and smoked a fat joint, they told us they had gatecrashed some teenybopper party in the next suburb and had a brilliant time dancing and 'laughing their bloody arses off!!!', (even though they didn't get laid!, BB added). we sat there for an hour or so, coming down to Pink Floyd playing from the elderly neighbor's house(which was highly odd since that was a strictly Elvis zone!).

the cold finally hitting, D and I went into his room,and switched on the radio. some Balinese music was playing. The joint must've set us off because the woodchimes sent colours across the room back and forth. we launched into a lets-pretend-it's-the-doorbell game, sending us into hysterics through an hour long tune. under the covers, to celebrate our 'letting go', we had very emotional, yet detached 'can't feel my dick' sex. I never felt closer, yet never felt further apart from D. throughout sex, I smelt sandalwood all over the place, on our bodies, in the music.. Later,i lay awake for an hour with another joint,trying to join D in sleep. Instead, the sun started to set behind a black cat in a poster on the wall! i closed my eyes briefly, a pleasant shock as i thought the acid had worn off. Obviously not. I spiralled into a rapidly morphing, technicolor world, flowers exploding into colours exploding into spirals and cuboids..infinite images evolving and taking over.I allowed myself to fall into the endless impressions-SUUUUuuuuccCCK!-- eventually 'yen' sleep took over my exhausted mind, a delicious smile fixed on my face.

I had tripped before. Mushrooms a handful of times, and acid a couple. I had a good grip on how psychedelics affect me. At least, I thought I did. Even though LSD had blown my mind before, I was in no way prepared for the trip I was in no way prepared for the trip I am about to tell you about.

I was a freshman at a very liberal liberal arts college in a rural area. Three months into my first year, I had what I would definitely consider to be a best friend. We will call him N. His brother was two years ahead of us (we will call him P) and had gotten his hands on some very clean and very powerful acid. We decided earlier in the week that we would put aside any other plans for Saturday and use the day to enjoy a nice trip. P and his friends had tripped successfully off of 2/3 of a tab, so we decided that a single tab per person would suffice.

Saturday arrived, and although it was a chilly November day, the skies were pretty clear and the weather was agreeable. We arrived at P's house and promptly put the tabs under our tongues. We put on a TV show and just hung around the house waiting for the effects to come on. I started feeling sped up and anxious, and we decided that it was time to leave the house and explore. Even though N and I were the only ones tripping, another sitting friend, as well as P and his girlfriend came along with us for a long walk back to campus from their house. We stopped at a pizza joint to get a bite to eat, even though I was not at all hungry. Instead, I just purchased a small Sunny D, in a tiny bottle like the ones I drank during my childhood. The nostalgia was just as delicious as the citrusy juice itself. I remember how strange things felt in that pizza parlor. I looked at a very basic painting that depicted some people eating pizza in the shop, but the colors were so vivid that it did not matter how simple it was. I marveled at the strokes of paint that were put into making the painting what it was. It was truly beautiful.

We left the restaurant, and I cannot begin to tell you how great it felt to be outside in the open air. N and I were in such a good mood; we could not stop smiling. We embarked on the long walk back to school and we kept telling each other how great certain colors were looking. We were so full of energy that it did not even feel like we were actually walking. I told N that it felt like my feet were full of very tiny people that were carrying me along. With the guidance of P and sober friends, we entered the woods. The colors of the fallen leaves were unbelievable. We had such a new found appreciation for all of the colors we were seeing. The visual effects were becoming more and more intense. The ground started to look like it was an ocean, constantly rippling and moving with the wind. Even though the temperature was chilly and worthy of a jacket, I felt so warm that I took mine off. We got to this very large abandoned building in the woods that probably once served some sort of farming purpose. It was full of graffiti and we spent a good while appreciating all of it. Abandoned buildings have this feeling about them that cannot really be matched by anything else. I started thinking about all of the buildings history and how it had become a place for anyone to visit and spend time in. Our friend who was not tripping had his field recorder with him, since he had intended on recording sound bits from our trip. He wound up recording a very cool sound in that building, along with other bits of our speech, and he eventually turned them into a song that he dubbed the 'LSD Song'. Witty of him, I know.

We finally left the building, and N and I realized that our sense of time was so completely skewed. It felt like a whole day had passed since we dosed, even though only less than two hours had passed. As we continued onwards to school, we discussed hallucinations. N asked me what it really means to hallucinate, since we were experiencing severe visual distortions but we were aware that this was a result of the LSD. We decided that there are different types of hallucinations: ones you know are not real and ones you are convinced are real. LSD does not make the mind delirious enough to believe that the hallucinations being witnessed are real. In fact, it makes me so conscious of what I am seeing that I earn a new appreciation for how things normally look. As we continued talking along our walk, I felt my state of mind coming slightly disconnected from N's. I remember thinking that he was focusing too much on the novelty of our visuals, as he kept on saying how amazing everything looked. I, on the other hand, just wanted to appreciate them for what they were. I did not feel the need to talk about them. I told this to N and he seemed to understand, which made me feel very comfortable. It felt as though we were entering a new phase in our trip, where the visuals were becoming irrelevant and superficial. It felt as though we were entering a new phase in our trip, where the visuals were becoming irrelevant and superficial. What really mattered now was the complexity of what was going on inside of our minds on a much deeper level.

We got back to our dorm, and we decided that showers were definitely in order. I remember peeking into the individual bathrooms, thinking every time that someone was hiding behind the shower curtain. After being outside in the cold for so long, the warm water coming out of the shower head was unbelievably pleasant. Even still, being alone in a bathroom with no one but my naked body was nothing but weird. I looked at myself in the mirror, and then down at my body, and it I felt as though I did not even recognize it. I felt so primitive being naked. I even felt as though the in-and-out movement of my belly was not corresponding with my actual breath. When I got out of the shower, I ran into a good friend in the hallway and gave her a humongous hug. She had such warm and positive vibes. Needless to say, it was so great to see her. Being on acid felt so childlike in that I only wanted to be with people that made me feel 100% comfortable. If anything felt a little off, my intensified emotions forced me to move myself into another, more comfortable setting.

After taking a hit of a spliff with P and his girlfriend, they went off to go do some school work. N and I were suddenly put in an unfamiliar position; 'what do we do now?' This was when I forgot how interactions with people normally are. We ran into N's roommate, who is a great guy, but hanging out with him is always a little awkward. All of the sudden I felt so stupid for the relationship I had with him. Why do I say hello to people that I do not even really give a chance to get to really know? I started feeling like the life I had been living at college was somewhat fake. I like to present myself as a friendly person, so I say hi to people that live near me. I started wondering why I make no effort to deepen these relationships. 

Running into these sorts of people really made me look at my social life from a new perspective. Specifically, there is a group of people that N and I often hang out with even though we do not feel really close to them whatsoever. We ran into all of them, and coincidentally they were tripping acid as well. But for some reason, it did not seem like they were experiencing anything close to what N and I were experiencing. It felt impossible to communicate with them, and then I realized that it is normally this way regardless of what substance we are on. I started wondering why we even bother putting ourselves around them. I plopped myself in a beanbag chair in the midst of them, and just watched them. I tried to talk, but I was literally unable to utter a word. At that moment, my ego died. I thought I had experienced ego death before, but nothing could ever compare to this. I abandoned the personality that I put on around other people, and I became nothing but a simple and pure human being, fresh out of the womb. I realized all of the bullshit that is behind my social life. Because we are social beings, we often put ourselves in social situations just to be perceived in a certain way. Ever since this realization, I have been more focused on being with people that I genuinely care about, rather than being with people for superficial purposes. I accepted that it is better to be alone and happy than to be with people that make you unhappy. With my fairly outgoing personality, this was hard for me to accept, but I did.

N and I went outside again to meet up with a girl that I had recently become intimately involved with and her friend. She had not been crazy about the idea of me taking LSD, so being around her while tripping was not the easiest thing in the world. But for obvious reasons, I did not abandon her and the four of us took a walk to the art studio on campus. We visited a friend who was working on his paintings in his studio. His work is always great to look at, whether inebriated or sober, but observing his art on acid was phenomenal. It was not just the visual intricacies that blew me away, but also more powerfully the level of passion he had put into his paintings. Seeing someone care so much about something as beautiful as painting really affected me. He was such a happy person doing what he loved to do. It was pretty life changing to witness the pure happiness that comes with doing what feels natural.

The four of us let our friend continue with his painting, and we went to the school cafeteria since the girls were hungry. Being in any sort of institutionalized place is not exactly the best idea on acid. It is very hard to follow routine when on the drug. We swiped our cards, grabbed our plates, and explored the food choices. I really could not tell whether I wanted anything to eat, so N put some food on a plate that we would both share. Being around so many people who were not tripping made me paranoid, to say the very least. I thought for sure that people would notice that something strange was going on with me. But sure enough, no one said a thing. Sitting down in the crowded cafeteria certainly did not help ease my anxiety. Even worse, our female companions were not making us feel any more comfortable. My girl's friend was continuously asking us questions about what we were feeling and we felt like specimens under her microscope. We constantly felt like we were being judged by the two of them. After what felt like hours, the two of them sort of got the hint and went off on their own. As soon as they were gone, it felt as though an enormous weight had been lifted off of my shoulders. I felt as though I could finally relax and bond with N. For whatever reason, we did not leave the cafeteria and joined some close friends at another table. I tried all sorts of different foods, but only to experience their textures rather than their nutritional properties. Even though the drug was distorting our perception of time, we definitely spent at least an hour and a half in the hectic cafeteria.

Finally, we left and walked back to our dorm. N and I spent some quality time with the same friend I had hugged when I got out of the shower (we will call her Z). She put on such kind and soft music, like The Microphones and Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. I specifically remember how overjoyed I became when she put on 'Our House' by the latter band. She was so comforting in her ways; she felt like a mother to me. Some other friends joined us in the room, which was great, because they had very positive vibes in them. Even though approximately seven hours had passed since we dropped, I still felt like I was tripping heavily even though it was not as intense as before. I grabbed a piece of paper and a pen and I started to draw. I did not put one thought into my drawing; instead, I just let my hand carry the pen wherever it wanted to go. I drew this very abstract drawing of a face, connecting to a crescent shaped figure that looked like a moon with facial features. My friends said it looked like a fetus, which makes sense since the drug made me feel like I was back in the womb, if I could remember what that felt like. Obviously it is very hard to put into words what I drew, but it felt amazing to draw it felt amazing to draw, since I was communicating the complex thoughts inside my head that could not be transformed into words. Words and languages are so limiting. Although essential to inter-human communication, languages force groups of people to think and speak in similar ways, even though we are all so different from one another. That's why we have art, so we can speak in whatever way we choose.

We spent a great deal of time in Z's room discussing the problems surrounding our social lives at college. N, Z, and I talked about how we value each other because we can really see each other as genuine people, and not shallow figures in a sea of many. It felt so great to have such a grounded conversation with just the three of us. Even though I had already felt very close to these two people, they now felt like siblings to me. We got comfy in bed and turned on a movie. 'Get Him to the Greek' was the perfect flick for the time; it was humorous and lighthearted, and it involved several adorable relationships between the main characters. After a while, the effects of the drugs were becoming severely diminished. N and Z wanted to go out and listen to live music, but I was unsure as to what I wanted to do. It took me a while to realize that all I really wanted to do was spend time alone. So I went back to my dorm room and turned on some music and chatted with a few friends from back home online. I doodled for a while as I listened to the album Sung Tongs by Animal Collective. The song Winters Love moved me tremendously. It evoked such a warm and comfortable inside of me and made me remember how great life can be. Its pretty ridiculous how something like a song or a piece of art can do that to you; make you forget about the negative aspects of life and just focus on the good parts.

I definitely consider myself to be a big picture kind of guy. All day long, I had been slightly troubled because I felt as though I was unable to put all of my incredible psychedelic thoughts towards greater use. However, I came to realize that the way that acid had made me so present in the moment was a good reflection of what my general life should be like. I realized that the little things that bother me, like my interactions with people that I really cannot relate to, will not matter to me at all further along in life. Not only did this trip help me realize that I should live my life the way I want to, regardless of what other people might think, but it also made me realize the importance of looking at the big picture when things might be bothering me. As clichéd as it might seem, I realized that in the end, everything ends up working out the way it should. Instead of getting all worked up about the bullshit behind being a social being, I should just embrace it for what it is, and if I am not happy with the situation I am in, I always have the power to change it. I always have the ability to make myself comfortable. Life is great.

My goal for this trip today is to reset my mind and spirit to a more exploratory and positive world-view. I have gotten bogged down in downers to block out and escape my anxieties and insecurities, but ultimately they are a blockade to me actually progressing with my life. I hope this trip will put me on the right track and help break the negative cycle I have fallen into. I have also recently started studying anthropology so it would be interesting to contemplate some of the concepts that I have been studying this far a bit deeper - try to push towards the core. 

08.30 am (T+0.00): Drop two tabs of nice quality clean LSD (estimated 180  200 ug). The tabs was advertised as 140ug but as always I assume it to be lower than advertised, and through previous experience of said batch and tenuous cross-reference to other experiences I guestimate them to be 90  100 ug each - but hey, who really knows? 

T+0.30: The first tells are starting to come on, my head is starting to feel light, my stomach funny, and there is a subtle sheen emerging in my vision. It is a nice autumnal day with crisp clear breaks of sun through wispy cloud, a perfect day for a spiritual reset.

LSD unlocks the divine within oneself. The spark of divinity present in each individual manifestation of the One source.

T+1.00: I can feel gentle energy rolling subtly through my body in tandem with the music and I find myself moving in flowing sinuous movements. This seems to be a characteristic of most of my acid come-ups. Maybe its just my body getting comfortable with the newly emerging sense of energies usually beyond the realm of the senses. Dancing in symbiosis with the energy that is all around.

T+1.04: I decide to lie down and put on my eye mask to see if there is anything accessible behind closed eyelids.

T+1.35: As usual I am always slightly taken aback by the subtle gentle incline in the effects of nice LSD. It rises slowly, like a pure light from within, taking its time to start seeping out into the external environment. So far the major effects are somatic  a feeling of blissful energy and Being, although visuals definitely have started to present themselves a bit as everything takes on a glassy sheen.

I would normally smoke cannabis at this point or earlier to help usher in the visuals and effects but have decided to refrain this time for a more pure LSD experience, and maybe leave it for the reflective comedown portion of the trip. Although I love cannabis and it undoubtedly adds something special to any psychedelic experience I suspect it can add to the confusing and chaotic aspects to a trip so will keep it to a minimum and see if I can observe any noticeable differences in clarity of trip. Its worth noting that I am a regular cannabis smoker and dont think I have ever tripped without it so this is a novel experience for me.

T+1.50: It is important for living beings to try and holistically incorporate all aspects of being into the pool of the All. Learn to use your body, your mind, learn about how the world we find ourselves in now operates and maybe through this someday we will get an inkling of the general direction of things. Life as we know it existentially is like a game, its a mysterious field where we dont know all the rules, but the more we interact with the game and learn the rules the more fun and fulfilling our game experience will be.

T+2.00: I decide to do a little bit of Kundalini Yoga with the aid of an instructional video online to move some of the energy around my body. 

T+2.25: I feel a bit more centred and limber after the yoga but all in all I found the instructional video I was watching distracted me from anything deeper. I think it is best to meditate undistracted, so I decide to do just that.

T+2.50: I am approaching the peak and although it has been a pleasant experience so far, and certainly much more clear-headed, I am left a little underwhelmed and decide now is an appropriate time to roll a small joint. 

T+3.00: LSD is a gentle slope towards the peak, I think Im there until BAM, I reach the summit and witness the vistas bellow realising that NOW Im there. I decide to hold back on the joint for now and see where this takes me. Everything has become touched with beauty and detail. I found myself looking at a photo of the Bayon Temple in Angkor Wat, the still and smiling faces of Bodhisattva forever at stillness in the rock, there is a deep serenity to be found in just being. Humbleness, kindness, compassion and intent are the keys to happiness. 

T+3.35: I decided to smoke the joint and invoke the divine spirit of Shiva as a catalyst for inward exploration. I put on my eye-mask and some ambient drones and lie back in my bed.

I am a seam in the fabric of the whole

I need to allow the serene in nature - the wide silent spaces and open vistas of experience - into my life. And find tranquillity in the spirit of the individual through the tranquillity of the spirit of the whole.

I open my window and hear the guttural vocalisations of workers outside; are these the same crude mouth noises that we all rely on as the sole medium for the transmission of information? I start to think of forms of information transferral in other species - the hive mind - pheromones  chemically downloaded information that goes directly to the core of the organism

LSD loosens the psychological boundaries for imprinting. 

Bliss is to be found in the silence between.

T+4.45: After spending some time meditating I decided I needed a light snack. I went downstairs and helped myself to some snacks, and thought it could be interesting to turn on the TV and see what my perception of general life is like at the moment. I happened upon Masterchef US with Gordon Ramsey and it just seemed to me the most hilarious spectacle. An ultra-hyped-up Give the humans what they want, just throw it at em! entertainment. Full of Egos, motorbikes, machismo and sausage. Every human pitted against one another to try and get the ultimate prize of appraisal for their Italian sausage by an inflated caricature in a leather jacket flanked by a couple of B-movie mobsters. It all seemed very contrived and like the pinnacle of silliness and I couldnt help but laugh at it all. I couldnt watch for long though and turned it off at the commercial.

Thought and imagery associated with Buddhist philosophy has been at the forefront during this trip, which is not a philosophy that I would maintain in my daily life and certainly not one I have been upholding in practice. Although Im not a converted Buddhist, I think there certainly are elements of it that speak to me at the life-stage I find myself right now that merit listening to and integrating.   

T+4.30: My muscles are a little stiff so I decide to take a hot bath.

T+5.10: The bath did the job, it was nice, mellow, and thought provoking. I have been thinking a lot about the essential connectivity and unity of all life, we are individuals but we all share DNA-life at the kernel of our being driving us on towards something. I had the image of humanity likened to a giant plant, all connected through the same route system to the same life giving source. But we each flower individually and have our own distinct pollen to spread and add to the fray of the genus as a whole.

I think it could be interesting to have a little venture outside, so out I go

T+8.00: I spent roughly the last two hours outdoors, wandering around the local nature reserve and beach. The journey started interestingly when as I turned on to the path leading to the nature reserve I overheard two women walking by, one of them was asking the other something along the lines of Do you ever wonder what people say about you in other peoples stories? Like, if you are a part of someone elses narrative?. Now that is a fairly deep snippet of conversation to be overhearing with a head full of acid.  

I worked my way up the hill that is the nature reserve, which is ironically straddled by a backdrop of factories billowing out massive puffs of nature destroying smoke. I stopped and listened to the noise from the factories, which at one point along the trail drowned out all sound of nature. I closed my eyes and really focused in on the sounds, chugging and dissonant with no harmony  this is the soundtrack to life in the city, the backdrop to our psyche. Whereas the sounds of nature struck me as harmonious. I underwent deep psychological contemplations as I walked, again the theme of the unity of life being present, and also dealing with some of the roots of my own social anxieties. 

I reached the summit of the small hill and walked out onto the small plateau overlooking the sea and city beyond. I realised that all I strive for, and I believe anyone does, was the quiet and freedom to just be without judgement or anxiety. I think this ideal of the open free space is what anyone who gets drawn to nature strives for, subconsciously or consciously, and I felt a bond with the mainly pensioner crowd that made up my (unwitting) companions here on this voyage. It made me realise how much I am bound by and caught up in the social conventions and expectations that I so vehemently pay lip-service against. Yet I am also a slave, shackled by a net of internalised social structures, which like all human structures are arbitrary and fallible. My mind was then cast back to the commonalities of life that transcend social-structure and I continued my beatific journey down the backside of the hill and on to the beach.

Once I reached the beach the sound of the sea overpowered the dissonant drones of the factories. I joyed in the beauty of the world - a small flock of starlings flew past in graceful formation and each shell was magnificent in its artistry. I found myself a nice little sheltered spot against a sand dune, where I sat down and meditated to the lapping rhythm of the sea and revelled in just being - sitting there on the beach looking through shells and at the sea, like the crows that scarpered about me. As I sat there and watched the crows, the undeniable difference between life forms struck me. I reasoned at the time that although we all glow with the same life-force at the core, the physical receptacle places certain limits and infers certain directions for its expression whilst manifest in specific physical forms. 

On the way home I decided to go to the shops to pick up a couple of things I needed. All went well in the shop and I found it interesting watching all the people milling about the isles. There was a brief awkward moment though in the off-license while I was buying a few beers, I seem to have lost all control of my bodies heat-regulating mechanisms and went completely flushed and red whilst attempting small-talk with the girl behind the counter. Shes a kind girl but shes seen me in there far too many times before in various states of substance induced discombobulation and probably thinks Im a poor fool. Ah well, what can you do. So it goes 

It may be worth noting at this point that the trip itself hasnt been overly visual, although visuals are certainly present. I believe that the true force of the LSD trip is psychological in nature. Also abstaining from Cannabis apart from one small joint at the T+3.30 mark did remove a certain chaotic depth that I believe Cannabis adds, it was an altogether more coherent and clear trip which I found enjoyable and useful for the purpose of this trip. 

Today has been a real eye-opener of a trip and very valuable. It shed a lot of light on some addictions and bad habits I have fallen into and the fallacy and ultimate worthless destructiveness of them. Im not saying this one trip has cured me of all my ills, but I do believe it has been a stepping stone onto a better path.

LSD (2) : General (1), Alone (16)

For seven of the last nine months, I've experimented off and on with LSD. It was not my first psychedelic, nor do I think it should be anyone's based on its risk profile: I've heard stories of people who did a lot of acid and never came back, or read case reports of people who have had persistent visual effects or other unintended sequelae. (Rather, I think ketamine and MDMA are better first psychedelic experiences. Ketamine because its after-effects are the most uniformly positive; see its treatment of depression, PTSD, and chronic pain. And because its high is similar to alcohol's effects, and is short-lasting. And MDMA because its high is so warm and fuzzy, it's hard to imagine someone having a bad trip on it.) 

But, in spite of my trepidation, I've also looked forward to trying acid based on the literature on its uses in assisting psychotherapyincreasing empathy, trust, and expressivity like MDMAas well as creative and sexual processes. Ok, and it also sounds fun. So when the set and setting were finally right, I gave it a go. 

At the time I felt both happy and safe, and conflicted. I have a wonderful partnership and we had even recently gotten married. We have a beautiful home, a wonderful life, and want to stay together. But I've always wanted kids, and my partner is done. He's older. He had his kids in his first marriage, decades ago. He didn't enjoy the process of being a parent and doesn't want to do it again. I think it would be different this time around for lots of reasons, but have been unable to convince him. 

We were honest about this disconnect when we first got together. Falling in love was an accident. The happiest accident of my life. So I went on the pill for him, even though I wanted nothing more than to get pregnant on my wedding night when we met. Happy years have gone by, and I needed them. We needed them. But my need for a family only grows. So I have also felt increasingly conflicted about taking the pill. I don't feel in control of my life and body. I don't feel I'm being true to myself, and that hurts me in lots of ways. And yet I feel I have to do what my love needs first, to take care of him. And sometimes, although it's not his fault, I simply feel powerless to assert my own needs as well. We have a conflict and I put him first; that's a wound to my integrity of being. It's hard to find another way. 

The first time we tried acid, we planned to micro-dose and go to the park. It was a beautiful summer day, so our favorite park was going to be crowded with people playing music, children running around, couples walking I had read online  that you don't get hungry on acid and the high lasts 12 hours, so you must eat beforehand. I made myself eat four eggs even though I wasn't that hungry, they didn't taste very good, and two eggs would normally be a lot for me. (Obviously: Mistake.) Then, at the last minute, I was very excited about the adventure and wanted to try a full dose (around 120 mcg) instead of a tiny one (10 mcg is a commonly reported microdose where people report cognitive, emotional, and creative benefits). 

My then-brand new husband wisely curbed my enthusiasm. Instead, I tried 40 mcg and he tried 20. We slipped pieces of paper, cut to lessen the dosage, under our tongues and held them there for 10 minutes before swallowing. Then off we walked in the summer sunshine. 

After about 45 minutes, in the crowded park, I started to get nauseated. Then faces (which I already love looking at, like most people) got more beautiful and interesting. Noises, which can sometimes be difficult for me to deal with, and crowds, might have actually been easierlike on a glass of wine. And yet, there was also a growing edge to the faces. Some of them began to look twisted, strange, and frightening. My nausea also grew, and we headed home. 

On the walk home, the world was swimming. You could call it dizziness, but it wasn't quite that. It was, rather, a flowy, swirling, falling visual effect I recognize now in psychedelic movie scenes as a distinctive LSD visual effect. The feeling of falling in it was the most pronounced this first time, probably compounded by the newness of the experience, the edge of fear that goes along with that, and my nausea from force-feeding myself a big plate of eggs in advance. I was really afraid the world would slip out from under me and swirl aroundor at the very least that I would fall over and not be able to finish walking home. 

Walking together, me leaning on my steady man, we made it home without me throwing up or a stranger deciding that I was behaving too strangely to let pass. Even though I had only taken 1/3 of a normal dose, there was nothing micro about this experience. I also think that this was the strongest reaction I've ever had to acid in some ways; maybe my brain needed to get acquainted with it in some way. 

I love looking at myself on psychedelics, because I used to be dysmorphic and find that psychedelics fix this. I love looking at myself on psychedelics, because I used to be dysmorphic and find that psychedelics fix this. What used to look ugly, fat, too awful to go outside (and more specifically, as dysmorphia usually goes: the angles of the eyebrows far too harsh so as to make me look evil, small skin imperfections so huge I can't see anything else, small things too hideously big and big things too hideously small, and nothing special, graceful, right). The effect is not permanent, but can last weeks before I start to hate my body and feel I need to hide it again. 

Previously, on MDMA, I'd seen my whole face and body as they actually are, during and after. And on mushrooms, I'd seen even more how those perceived imperfections were horrible distortions. You might think it's sad to realize you've tortured yourself and lost a lot of life doing so, but I know what I saw. The dysmorphia was a problem in my brain, not something I chose. And the psychedelics fixed it. It's such a huge, unqualified relief and joy to be freer and feel beautiful. But I had hoped for that, having read case reports of such things in medical journals and online. I'm not the first person to notice psychedelics can treat dysmorphia, and I'm glad to think I won't be the last. 

When I looked in the bathroom mirror my first time on acid, however, I looked like a man. I found myself attractive; I looked fit, horny, and friendly. But there was no creative control in the hallucination, no reading into the image something that wasn't (to me at the time), there. I had become a man, and was happy to see it. I thought of Bill Hicks describing the walls bleeding on shrooms, not as a horrifying experience but rather as a hilarious and fascinating one. This was my feeling also about being a man, except I was also incredibly turned-on and felt very powerful. 

Then I went to bed with my husband. Although we had our normal sex as far as the mechanics go, it still seemed to me that this time, I was really the man. When we came, it was as if we were one, something I've experienced on other subsequent acid trips. Someone told me before I tried acid that being on MDMA is like a party where you're very one with your body and your friends, but being on acid is like a party where you're one with the universe. But I have found the experiences more similar, though distinct. It seems, though, that mileage varies greatly with drugs and sex, and I am a person who tends to have more sexualized reactions to a wide range of substances and experiences than others. 

Subsequent acid trips have deepened the intimacy in my marriage, helped us talk, been inspiring visually, been mind-blowing sexually, and not resulted in nausea. It was dumb to eat four eggs before trying acid, and I never did anything like that again. If I'm hungry before, I eat. If I'm not, I don't. Once I developed ravenous hunger on acid and ate the best Indian food of my life. Eating it literally felt like coming. In general, I guess relaxing and doing what your body needs at the time is a pretty good rule of thumb for self-care off and on special substances. 

I've tried micro-dosing and found around 20 mcg is great for plowing through demanding creative and intellectual work, especially when I am afraid or having a block, or a deadline. I've been diagnosed with ADHD by three doctors but don't really believe it exists, and the medications I've tried for it don't do good stuff to me in the days after. So this is my favorite ADHD medication, and I could see adapting Ayelet Waldman's (former, experimental) every three days protocol to deal with the dose tolerance issue. But I prefer to trust my brain and not do it all the time. 

I've still not tried a full dose, preferring instead to exercise a lot of caution around set and setting when it comes to acid. I still want to, someday. I find that a partial dose of 70 mcg or so, especially with a small amount of MDMA, helps me deal with crowdsloud noises, bright lights, and big groups can otherwise be too much for me, and alcohol is not my friend. This seems significantly healthier for my brain, and I'm angry that alcohol is widely available instead because used wisely, psychedelics seem so much healthier. But I have been lucky to have only really had good set and setting psychedelic experiences, because I have experimented with someone who loves and takes care of me. 

I've also experienced feeling whole and healed on MDMA combined with this larger mezzo-dose of acid. I'm surprised this isn't yet in the literature on PTSD, which I had read for many years before trying MDMA. There is so much great research and advocacy going on to get people better care for mental health problems, but ultimately I think demanding that people heal their most intimate wounds with strangers in a clinical setting is insane. So I hope psychedelics like MDMA and LSD, especially combined, will be available to people to try with intimates at home for self-exploration, communication, and even healing. There are people who shy away from the idea that you can self-treat serious mental health problems like PTSD and depression, but I have tried lots of therapies and found everything else incredibly painful and counter-productive. Some people just need love to heal. I did. And drugs enhanced my ability to communicate, trust, feel connected, empathize, and see things differently to take that healing process further. So it surprises me to realize that my healing experiences on acid have echoes in Stanislav Grof's work using LSD in psychotherapybut that the people doing research now on MDMA haven't tried incorporating LSD as well. Maybe that will come. I'm sorry I don't want to say more about this. It shouldn't be an aside like this, but I honestly think it's so intimate that it's wrong to pathologize and fully document things of this nature. Some things are actually sacred. Part of me wants to inspire researchers to push that envelope and part of me wants to tell them they're hubristic assholes for pretending that they can standardize caring for the soul. 

So I've worked, socialized, and healed on subsequent acid trips. But since that first time, I've never been a man again. When I was a man, though, it was very clear to me that I had a right to bear children. This is an insight that I've also had as a woman, but as a man it felt different. As a woman it felt less like I was in control, like I would have to bicycle through life and see what happened on the way, like a flower hoping for a bee. And as a man it felt like I could shoot my arrow and make life happen. I know it's cliched. But the gender-bend on that first, mezzo acid trip really helped me learn a feeling of control over my own life that I still remember and cherish today the gender-bend on that first, mezzo acid trip really helped me learn a feeling of control over my own life that I still remember and cherish today. Even though I don't see how to apply it necessarily. Nothing has changed; but I have. 

There was also another completely unintended side effect that makes sense in the context of the medical literature on LSD, but I haven't seen reported anywhere else yet. For many years I suffered from Raynaud's, a vasoconstrictive disorder where you lose circulation in your fingers, toes, ears, and nose in response to cold. They turn white and creepy, and it hurts like hell. If it gets worse, you can have finger ulcerations, and I've had cracking and bleeding from it before. I've had it confirmed on ultrasound after seeing a specialist about it. But since taking acid, my Raynaud's hasn't bothered me at all. 

I didn't even trigger it after a recent sprain left me holding frozen vegetables on the affected appendage. Normally handling frozen stuff has been the most fool-proof way to tick it off. It wasn't comfortable, but my fingers didn't go into painful vasospasms and turn different colors, requiring defrosting under lukewarm to warm water to recover, either. 

Raynaud's is a really painful and life-limiting medical problem that kept me from doing some things I love but hasn't bothered me since I tried acid, and this might make some sense as an effect.  

Regardless of whether my Raynauds comes back, my beloved husband comes around to having kids, or any other outcome down the line goes this way or that, I feel empowered by my acid experiences. After all, I'm the man. I have a life to live, arrows to shootand stronger, healthier, happier hands with which to shoot them.

I should preface this with a bit of background on myself. It might seem needlessly wordy, but it's kind of important to understand my own mindset and background to understand the significance of some parts of my experience I think. 

I've always found myself a bit different than others growing up. In hindsight, I've come to realize I probably have some degree of undiagnosed high-functioning Aspergers - something psychedelics have helped tremendously with in terms of its accompanying social anxiety, but that's a story for another time. INTJ personality. Generally pretty 'serious'. 

I grew up in a conservative Christian household, and while I do respect my parents for trying to provide me with what they felt was the best possible upbringing, I never really believed it. I always loved discussing and reading philosophy. In college, I got pretty enamored with Marxist Dialectical Materialism as a worldview, and I still maintain it today; despite the experiences I'm about to relay, I don't believe anything other than a chemical acting on receptors in my brain was responsible for the experience I had. Nevertheless, it was one of the most intriguing experiences of my life, and one I have and intend to repeat many more times. It's shown me that the brain is clearly capable of producing a much wider variety of states of consciousness than most people realize. And that's a true pity.

After university, I moved to China. It was something I'd always wanted to do really. I'd always been infatuated with the culture, and I felt in a number of ways my outlook on the world probably would make me feel less alienated here. For the most part, this has been the case. I was borderline depressed before coming here, and definitely have gotten a lot better, and still very much love the culture.

Prior to this experience, I'd had some experience with THC and MDMA. Both were interesting enough in their own way, but nothing on this level. For about a year, at this point, I'd been interesting in trying more 'serious' psychedelics, but never really knew where to acquire them. Then kind of out of the blue, my usual hookup for marijuana offered to sell me a sugar cube of LSD. I was kind of intimidated, but definitely intrigued. 

It was about a week or so before I actually took it. I wanted it to be the 'right' time. I'd done enough preliminary research to know the importance of 'set and setting'. The day I chose was in early autumn. The leaves were just starting to change, I think, but it was still decently warm out. My favorite time of year actually. 

I took the sugar cube out of its hiding place, and with admittedly little ceremony (and strangely little apprehension in the moment) put it in one of the insulated bottles for making tea that are so popular here in China and proceeded to mix it with a nice chai tea in hopes the soothing flavor would gently drift me into it. 

At first, of course, I felt nothing. A slight pang of anxiety, the realization that the LSD was now in my stomach and soon enough would start to enter my bloodstream and thereby exert its effect on my brain, and there was nothing really I could do now to prevent that. I tried my best to pass that away and look forward to it with excitement. I went into the shower and let the warm water fall over me - a ritual I still do most times when I dose to help deal with any potential anxiety. At the time, I had the song 'What a Wonderful World' playing on my phone. Not my normal taste in music, but I figured it had a positive message and calming vibe; should help to avoid any potential freakouts.

Maybe twenty or so minutes after dosing, I still didn't particularly feel too much of an effect, as was to be expected. I was kind of torn between staying inside (not knowing what to expect, this seemed more prudent) and going outside and seeing the full effects of how my perception of the world might be changed. I decided for a sort of safe middle ground: there was a pretty nice garden area in the apartment complex I lived in. I figured I could walk around it a bit and see how I felt, and if it got too bad, presumably I could retreat back to the safety of my apartment.

I walked around outside for maybe fifteen minutes or so - a bit past the 30 minute mark - when I began to feel the first effects coming on. It was subtle; no visual distortion really. I just got this sort of subtle, but strong, urge to sit down at a certain bench. Not really knowing how a psychedelic state was 'supposed' to feel, I tried to focus my mind on some problems I'd been having in a few social relationships at the time, thinking perhaps the substance would in some way 'talk back' to me and give me some sort of insight that my sober mind couldn't reach.

I did indeed start to receive 'thoughts' back, thoughts I wasn't consciously generating, or so it seemed. But rather than dealing with the problems, these thoughts seemed to basically say 'Now is not the time to worry about such things. If you stress out about them in this state, you'll end up in a very bad state.' After 'receiving' that thought several times, I decided to trust whatever it was that was sending me such an intuition and stop focusing on such matters. 

The comeup was actually quite quick from here. Before I realized it, my thoughts were going in 'loops'; mercifully something in my brain had had the foresight to warn me of this chemical's effects and the potential for freaking one's self out before I'd gotten that far. Not knowing how 'high' I would end up, and wanting to avoid any possibility of freaking out in public, I quickly made my way back to my apartment. 

Returning, I felt a lot more calm, but my mind was still going in all kinds of directions. There was an anxious energy to the chemical itself, but paradoxically a much stronger sense of calm. If anything, I felt a bit jittery, but not necessarily in a bad way.

The first visual effects started to kick in here. I like to collect historic Chinese posters; one of them I had on the wall was of Chairman Mao addressing a large crowd with an uplifted arm. While the borders of objects remained quite distinct, I could perceive his facial expressions changing. While the poster depicted him with a more-or-less stoic expression, I saw his face seem to be 'squished' a bit vertically (without the actual borders between objects seeming to be altered at all, oddly), this having the effect of him seeming to have a somewhat unnatural smile on his face. In turn, it would shift back to normal, then to the 'shrunken, smiling' form many many times. 

Outside the window there was a large billboard advertising toothpaste on an opposite building. A man was smiling with really white teeth. No real visual changes to his form, but ever time I looked at it, I also smiled and laughed kind of giddily. It was like looking at that picture gave me the expression of the man in it, but only superficially. I didn't feel the sort of extreme artificial happiness one tends to experience on say MDMA; just for whatever reason compelled to mimic that man's expression.

For a while I kind of chilled, listening to some music I liked and glancing back and forth between the Mao poster and the billboard outside. 

After a while I decided to go into the bathroom and stare at myself in the mirror to see if I could get a depersonalization effect. My pupils were a bit wider than normal; noticeable to me, but I doubt strangers would have thought anything of it. Nothing too extreme. I again had the same sort of urge to laugh kind of giddily, deliriously, and think I said something to the effect of 'Wow, you're really high now, you motherfucker'. It was kind of interesting, but not particularly more trippy than staring at one's self in the mirror while sober already is for me, so I got tired of it after a while.

At this point, more than 90 minutes had passed. I remembered reading that peak intensity of a trip is reached at about the 90 minute mark, from which point it's a very long, gradual, decrease in intensity (further trips have more or less confirm this to be the case for me at least). I figured since I didn't seem to be going outright insane or seeing things that absolutely weren't there - basically I could still functionally interact with reality even if my mind was still in 'loops' - it was probably 'safe' to go out again.

I called a taxi to a park I quite liked downtown. Parks in China are actually really big; to the point that even though you're physically in the middle of a city, you don't really notice; it's basically a world into itself. Lots of traditional style buildings, tea houses, a small lake in the middle. I figured it'd be a nice place to chill for a while. A part of me thought it was foolhardy to go out in public alone on a substance I was trying for the first time. Technically, that probably was a very valid point to have made. But in the state I was in, I decided to go for it.

I grabbed a few bottles of water and the philosophy book I was reading at the time and headed out. I sat in the back of the taxi, listening to my music. Normally I like to talk to taxi drivers to practice Chinese, but I was worried he would be able to tell I was in an off sort of state if I talked to him, so I just showed the location on my phone, and off we went. 

I remembering noticing how different the motion of other cars seemed to be. Again, they weren't physically in places they shouldn't be at any given point; they never took up more or less space than they should. Yet, the motion itself seemed far more fluid, more like the way that water moves than solid objects. It's an effect I've noticed again on subsequent trips.

At some point through the drive, we got stuck in bad traffic, and the driver turned around to talk to me. He seemed a good natured fellow; mid 40s probably. Quite friendly and seemed to assume I was a tourist. He suggested some other places I could visit in the city nearby. Unfortunately I was in such an odd mental state that there was something of a mental lag. I realized he'd spoken probably about 10 seconds after actually hearing him, meaning in effect I'd stared at him all that time without responding. He probably thought I was insane or something. I tried to play it off as simply not knowing Chinese. He smiled and told me to listen to my music. Don't think he suspected psychedelics, but probably thought I was a bit off. Oh well. At the time I didn't much care. 

It was only slightly later, on the way to the park, when it happened. The other voice  the one that had talked to me back outside my apartment  started speaking to me again. Only it wasn't in audible sound; it was in the form of a thought, but a thought I myself wasn't consciously generating. I felt a great sense of love  maternal love. And the thought repeated over and over in my mind This is the very beginning; you can always return to this state. 

I felt psychologically pure; like a child just born without all the ingrained prejudices and unfounded assumptions society forces into us. I felt psychologically pure; like a child just born without all the ingrained prejudices and unfounded assumptions society forces into us. Over and over again, softly, it  no She  it definitely had a feminine persona, despite being generated by my own brain told me You can always come back to this state. 

I felt a great happiness at this revelation. No matter what happened in life, no matter what troubles lie ahead, no matter what mistakes I might make, there was always a chance to return to that pure, innocent, childlike state. This was a feeling, a realization, that remained with me for the entire duration of the trip actually, and something that continues to give me solace to this day. 

On some level it took my thoughts to ideas I'd already contemplated. Nietzsche's idea of Infinite Return. Poincarre Recurrence. I might literally have that experience and every other an infinite amount of times, even in a purely material universe, and THAT itself was amazing.

Arriving at the park, I was almost at once struck by a sort of child-like curiosity. Everything was simply fascinating, especially natural things. Every flower seemed beautiful, and I wanted to study and learn and understand each. There was a dance going on with dancers in traditional Chinese clothing. I'd seen similar performances before, but in this state it seemed to be the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. Actually, anything remotely beautiful did for as long as it held my focus. 

I saw a mother holding her baby. She saw me, smiled then turned to her baby and talked to him in the sort of childish language that mothers naturally do to their children. In the mindset I was in, it seemed right to me as well. It was strange; my intellectual capacity was as normal. My memory more or less intact, my thoughts just fine. I felt at once an adult and a child; having all the capacity of the former, and all the wonder of the latter. I felt at once an adult and a child; having all the capacity of the former, and all the wonder of the latter. 

I walked around a bit. From time to time paranoia seemed to creep up, and I feared others might know I was out in public on drugs. To more or less satisfy my paranoia, I walked around constantly fake-texting on my phone, to give myself an excuse not to have to make eye contact with anyone. I wondered actually how much of the social phenomenon of people overusing cellphones was due to social anxiety. 

I finally made my way to the lake. It was early afternoon, and the sun was reflecting off it. The reflections were amazing. It's hard to explain. Physically it looked more or less the same. But I perceived it as more . shiny I suppose. As if the light was somehow brighter than it actually was, in a soft but sharp way. Brilliant, but without glare. 

I tried to read the philosophy book I'd brought with me. But it seemed that instead of being able to read it in a linear fashion, I would get stuck on each sentence or idea. As I read any particular such sentence, it seemed in that moment the most profound thing I'd ever read, but I'd be unable to connect it with anything else  even the very next sentence. After some time, I gave up on trying to read anything coherent.

Probably for the best. She returned then. She told me she was my mother; my true mother. She was the universe itself, causality that had led to my existence. Yet she had personality. She was full of love, but not weak. No, she was strong, brave. A heroic revolutionary, at every moment fighting and sacrificing herself for a better world for me, for all her children. She took the archetype of a particular revolutionary woman I quite admired.

My father, so she said, was the philosophical spirit I'd embraced, guiding me but respecting me enough to allow me to struggle to get there, for it was the struggle that made me stronger. He too took the archetype of a revolutionary man I admired, but never addressed me directly. No, I knew him well enough through the words he'd left behind for me. 

I was as a child then, full of curiosity and wonder in a perfect garden, under the watchful care of my loving, and yet, pure, proud and strong mother and father. They would always be with me, She said, watching over from afar. I asked Her many questions, about suffering in the world, what might be done to reduce it to its lowest possible value. She told me that was hard to answer  even for her. Society was a system of so many humans interacting together, all with their own goals and intentions and faults, and so even with the best of intentions, it was difficult to achieve such a thing.

Yet I would try, She told me. She was proud of me for that.

I then brought up a different question, one I feared, but needed to ask. What about those who start off with good intentions  or at least seem to as far as one's motivations can be determined by their actions  who risked much to advance the cause of liberation, but in the end pervert the cause to self-serving ends. I brought up a case of a person I felt had done just that.

She was saddened, I could tell, a bit at the mention, but obliged me. It is a dark world we live in with much unnecessary suffering. Many start with pure intentions to reduce this, but the struggle is not an easy one. It's so easy to lose one's way, compromise one's purity. She told me a story to illustrate:

There was another boy like me, raised by Her and Him. They raised him to love science, investigate and question everything; to strive to do everything in his ability to help the oppressed. And as he grew, he did just that. And yet in doing so, he gained fame  fame in association with his father's and mother's deeds which he feared he could never amount to. It was sad, She told me, because he might have done so much more than either of his parents if he had forged his own path without looking back, without comparing himself to them. This constant comparison to his parents in his own mind eventually drove him to all of the behaviors I saw as corrupt and evil. It was not so much that he desired to do harm from the start, as it was a compulsion deriving from his own internal feelings of fear, weakness, and inadequecy. Feelings I too had struggled with all my life.

But you have not done as he has done. She told me. Not so far, certainly.

She showed me parts of my life where I'd done things I have to admit were harmful to others in nature. As much as I strive for a certain ideal to change the world for the better, I don't always live up to it. But I'd yet to do anything so harmful to others to lose my purity. Merely those were inclinations I'd best try to conquer before moving forward in life.

I was a boy, in the garden, full of curiosity. Just like the fallen boy and so many others. Like all of them, I held potential to effect society in innumerable ways for better or worse. But again, She reminded me, I could always return to this state of innocence. So, too, She reminded me, could even have all of those I judged as having betrayed the cause. I was no better or worse than anyone else apart from the choices I made; but even then, even if I truly messed up and made a disaster of my life  something I dreaded  She would always welcome me back to this state if I was willing. I promised her I always would be.

I left the park and started walking. I felt the sudden desire to get a milk tea. I hadn't really eaten at that point, and while not particularly hungry, I figured it would be good to get some nutrients in the system. By now the feelings of love from Her were so intense, I could barely keep my composure. Using my status as a foreigner to my advantage, I just pointed at a milk tea on the menu to avoid having to talk to the cashier. In that sort of state I doubted I could have had anything resembling a conversation with anyone but Her.

The décor of the cafe itself was quite fitting. A cartoon of a young, scholarly looking man reading a book for the logo, but with very childish anime-esque aesthetics that the rest of the cafe seemed to match. I was on the verge of tears, but in a very good way. Tears of joy, of feeling acceptance by Her, the universe itself. Knowing that reality, causality itself accepted me, approved of my quest in life, offered Her moral support. It was wonderful.

I struggled my best to keep a normal composure outward. I drank the tea slowly and pretended to read the book  again, I couldn't focus on more than a sentence or two at a time. Mostly She had stopped talking, but the feeling of peace and innocence and love was stronger than ever. 

One thing I do remember Her telling me in that cafe though was something along the lines of:

Be good to the woman who has been your mother in this life. She's tried so hard to raise you well, and she's had such a hard life herself. 

I don't think I actually believe the metaphysical implications of the statement in a sober state  but at the time it seemed to make perfect sense. The fundamental level causality  Her  was of course my TRUE mother. The woman who physically gave birth to me was a much lower level of causality. That actually jived with materialism just fine. But she seemed to imply that both my physical mother and myself had had many experiences prior to our current lifespans. 

I'd generally scoff at anything so idealist, but this was coming from Her  taking the persona of one of the women I most respected in history (and a devoted Dialectical Materialist herself)  and in such an emotional state, it made perfect sense. Given that She told it to me, and gave me such good advice on so many other matters, I've tried to see if I can synthesize the statement with materialism in any way (the idea of Infinite Return comes to mind, admittedly). But I think it was a deeper meaning than just literal She was getting at:

I realized that even though my parents and I had our differences of opinions on politics and religion and other related things  differences that had definitely strained our relationships  they really did mean well. They really did love me. And while I'd never FELT that love in such a strong way as I did in that moment, their love for me as their son was just as strong; if anything, my parents struggling with their own issues and still having love for me despite our differences, were all the more commendable.

In the next few days after the trip, I decided to try to resolve some of the underlying issues between my parents and myself. It still isn't fully resolved; human experiences and relationships are rarely easy. But She gave me a new motivation to try.

She told me a few other things I think, but I've since forgotten some of them. 

At this point, I felt quite calm, and ready to move on. It was getting near sunset, so I decided to take a taxi to a bar that was opening for the first time that night, knowing a lot of my friends would be there. There were similar visual effects of other cars seeming to swim by us. Otherwise just a calm feeling; thoughts were still racing from all the new experiences and ideas, but by now it was more of me trying to analyze what had happened than talking to Her. Unfortunately Her voice was gone (and wouldn't return until several trips later), but She'd left me a lot to think about.

I arrived at the building the bar was at, and walked in pretty much on autopilot. In China, a lot of bars are on the top floors of apartment buildings, so I took the elevator to get up. Another foreigner got in with me, and started talking to me; he could clearly tell I was in a pretty out-of-it state and asked if I'd been smoking weed. I was pretty much just staring at things, probably looked like a psycho. I just nodded yes, still not really able to talk much. I figured it was easier than explaining it to a total stranger.

Turns out he ended up going to the same bar as I was. It had a pretty chill vibe. It was fully evening by the time I turned up, and there were lots of colorful lights out that looked really pretty. I took a seat on a beanbag chair outside and got a nice glass of cider. I still figured I wasn't in much of a state to talk to people, and just kind of chilled, staring at the lights and grinning kind of childishly. 

A friend of mine was working there, came up and gave me a hug. She too could tell I wasn't in a normal state. She's pretty psychedelic-friendly, so I think she figured what was up, so gave me some space.

After about an hour or so, I'd come down even more. By now, it started to resemble MDMA without the physical stimulant effect. Instead of being unable to talk to people, I became VERY talkative, and started wanting to talk to just about everyone. I properly introduced myself to the man I'd met on the elevator, explained what was up. He found it kind of funny; he was high on weed himself and said he didn't judge, but wouldn't touch LSD. I told him he was really missing out.

Beyond that, I had a lot of conversations with a lot of friends for about two hours. Felt great.

A friend and I went back to my home to watch a film together  Interstellar. I still felt vaguely trippy, but more or less normal, just a little happier and more curious than normal. The film seemed to fit perfectly with the revelations She had given me.

I went to sleep blissfully that night. I often lucid dream by keeping my mind awake while my body physically falls asleep, and tried to do that then. I had lots of very interesting visuals, but eventually ended up sleeping normally. I woke up the next morning feeling more refreshed than normal. I had to go to work, but there was a subtle good feeling to life all day. 

All in all, LSD has changed my life for the better I'd say. It's definitely a chemical that should be treated with the proper respect (or more so, as She told me in a later trip which I might publish later  it's not so much the chemical itself as one's own brain that one needs to be treating with the proper respect, as the seat of one's mind), and with the right set and setting in mind.

It's been a short few days since I've had this experience. I'd like to get it down now while it's fresh on my mind, and also now that I finally have the clarity to put it into words somewhat.

I've had a pretty deep fear of tripping for well over a year, up until this point. My other trip report outlines what I've gone through on my first psilocybin experience, but it definitely left its mark on me to keep it short. At the time, I was fundamentally lost, depressed, hopeless and generally on a very negative path in life.

Since I've had that experience (and, after a long period of confusion) I've managed to pick myself up from the gutter. I took up a profession I'm endlessly happy with and make good money with after only doing it for about 9 months, I've cured a lot of anxiety I had, my depression has almost completely left me. So many things have changed for me in the past year and everything has been abundantly positive. I won't get into too much detail, but my life then vs. now are like total opposites. I still do struggle with anxiety here and there, but it's gone down a ton. My leftover anxiety was one of the few reasons I had for this LSD trip.

After cutting contact with one of my most toxic friends, I made a decision to have another trip and re-test the waters. I had some LSD left in my fridge, given to me by my brother a while back. I had always been too scared to take a full hit, but I felt a strong calling to do it at this point. It seemed like a perfect substance to take in a perfect moment of stillness in my life (first weekend I'd had off in about 4-5 months) where I could ruminate on how things have been going. In the week after this decision I've dedicated my free time to researching and preparing as best as I could. The day before dropping, I made sure to completely clean my apartment, and I set up a little tripping zone in my bedroom which was completely safe and would have everything I could need. I was planning on doing it completely alone, away from any uncertain factors.

Boiling down my intentions, it was essentially about this: for one, I wished to conquer my fear of tripping. Both my medical history and my traumatic psilocybin experience have pushed me into a direction of fearing the altered state of mind/body that a tripping experience brings. Next, I wanted to have an honest conversation with myself about the anxiety I could still feel in myself about life. Things were going well but all the positive developments brought with them some situations and interactions I wasn't used to, and I wanted to see if I could figure out what the source of it was. And lastly, I wanted to take this weekend completely to myself and treat myself to something novel. And I wanted to sit down with myself and inquire about how my life has been going and how I feel about the direction I'm heading in. With these intentions in mind, I went into my trip.

(Sorry for the long intro, getting into it now)

Finally, the day had come. I woke up quite late as I had gone to bed a lot later than planned (I stayed up talking to a girl I was interested in at the time). My original plan was to wake up at 9AM, and to drop at noon at the very latest. However, I crawled out of bed no earlier than 10:30 AM and took a while to finalize my apartment for tripping. Around about 1PM I was finally ready to drop. I had agreed with a friend to voice chat after I dropped so I could ease my nerves, but she didn't seem to be coming online. After anxiously badgering her with no response for about an hour, I decided to go ahead and do it. I did two rounds of the Wim Hof method, which helped me clear my brain, and walked over to the fridge, grabbed a tab out of the little case, and put it under my tongue. My apprehension began to grow, but I felt determined to see it through. I felt so strongly that I had to have this experience no matter what would happen. I sat back down on my bed, and put some Chrome Sparks on my speaker to take my mind off the come-up. The day before dropping, I had gone to the local book store and got myself a notepad and a pen. I quickly jotted down some thoughts about my come-up and cast the paper aside.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
T+0:00
"Coming up now. feel a bit anxious, but otherwise okay. I hope to have a nice experience. I'm gonna take a nice long warm shower in a bit.

I wonder how the visuals will be"

After about 20 minutes I decided to hop in the shower, as was suggested to me by another tripper. I put some Brian Eno on my speakers, turned it up loud, and walked in. I'm usually the type of guy to jump in an ice-cold shower, but for this occasion I felt it was right to make an exception. The warm water hugged me and kept me comfortable through my journey upwards. I quickly became too nervous to stay standing up, and decided to sit down on the floor with the showerhead in my hands. By this point I definitely felt a change in my tactile sensation, although I wrote it off to nervousness at first. I got out of the shower after about 30 minutes of quiet introspection, and laid down in my bed.

Back in bed, I grabbed my notepad again and wrote down some more thoughts. My writing at this point looked very very cramped and a bit jittery, as the nerves were definitely seizing me. 

T+0:50
"How nice that i get to do this!
im a little tense still but i hope to loosen up soon
Writing is hard"

I noticed some slight stomach discomfort and decided to lay down on my side, grabbing my blanket and holding it close to me. I quickly got back up to change the music to Bonobo, as the slow piano music was somehow making me uncomfortable. The change in music twisted my experience almost upside down, and I started feeling really amazing. At this point the good feelings seemed to travel down into my crotch, to my surprise. I'll skip on detailing what happened next here, but let's say it was one of the most intense solo sessions I've had in my life. ;)

T+1:10
An ecstatic 20 minutes later, I grabbed my notepad once more. I felt very loosened up, and jabbed my pen at the paper, making a bunch of scribbles. Underneath it reads:

"W O W !
T 1:10 right now"

followed by another wavy scribble, starting small but expanding outward more and more.

I decided to change the music again, back to Brian Eno. The heavenly piano music was filling up my room while I did my best to surrender to the experience. I still have a very vivid image in my head of a beautiful blue sky with fluffy white clouds, and a notepad and pen. At this point that notepad along with the Brian Eno music was encompassing my entire universe. I found it almost impossible to even get up from bed. My thoughts were incredibly drawn out and tough to manage, and every time I looked up it seemed only a minute had passed when it felt more like 10. Now I knew: I'm in the middle of it. Surprisingly though, I did not feel any negativity this time around, which had been the case last time around this point. I kept my eyes closed for the most part and got some very faint visuals (I'd venture to say they were more like silhouettes of visuals, comparing them to all the fantastical descriptions I've read of other trippers' visuals).

T+2:00
By now I had nearly finished my upward journey, and pulled myself up to try and ruminate on some of the questions I wanted to answer in my newfound psychedelic state. My remaining anxiety was one of the biggest reasons for me to take this trip (both for psychedelics and for novel experiences in general in my life). I wrote down:

"Why do I get so anxious" "Why do I get so anxious" 

in the most loose writing in the notepad yet. I instantly felt myself come to the heart of the question, and my thoughts on it immediately boiled down into this - no good reason. I get afraid of new experiences because I don't trust my gut over my brain in most cases, but they seem to always turn out okay, hence, I should not give so much thought to these feelings. I wrote down

"no good reason!!!!!"

And that was pretty much it. That stupid little answer gave me so much relief. I gave little more thought to my mental issues for the rest of the trip, as I felt increasingly thankful for my new job and my upwards trajectory in life. The rest of the notepad is mainly filled with realizations of amazement, including a line that reads "im whelmed to say the least" which still makes me crack up reading it back now.

T+2:20
At this point I rose up from my bed, slowly turned down the music I had on, and felt myself filling up with gratitude. It was like finally reaching the peak of a big mountain (how poetic) and now I could stand here, admiring my progress and basking in it's positive effects on my life. I'd been so involved with working on improving myself that I'd hardly taken the time to really admire what I've done so far, but now I had the perfect state of mind to do it, and it felt absolutely liberating.

Slowly coming out of the confused state, I began to leave my bed and walk around a bit. I decided not to look in the mirror yet, as I'd been told by a few people that it can drastically sway a trip. I soon sat down on my bed again, in front of my computer, and chatted up a lot of friends who I wanted to call with. I first ended up calling the girl I had spoken with the night before, which ended up strangely awkward but it did not bother me one bit. It seemed like an inconvenient time however as she seemed to be cleaning her room and was quite unresponsive, so I hung up and called somebody else. Next up I decided to say 'fuck it' and call the girl I had broken up with prior to my mushroom experience. We had a really fun conversation and she seemed to not mind at all that I was tripping absolute balls. It was so hard to formulate sentences and I kept having laughter fits but it was an amazing conversation nonetheless. I made a really stupid sketch of a picture she sent me and it still makes me smile looking back at it.

Afterwards, I called a friend from England. He picked up the phone and I opened with 'I'm tripping balls dude' to which I got a response of 'Uhhh... Okay? Why would you do that?" and the shock in his voice made me burst out in laughter and fall back onto my bed. I had been a bit scared of other people messing with my trip but I had absolutely no shame for myself which was a very liberating feeling. I sat back down while saying 'Okay, let me explain.' I took about 5 seconds to think about it and then responded 'Why am I explaining myself?' and burst out in more laughter. Right after I calmed down I learned that he was at work, so I offered to call him back later and hung up.

I sat around for about 10 minutes after this just thinking to myself how absolutely amazing it felt to be alive. It hadn't ever hit me like this before where I felt this amount of gratitude for being able to experience life and all of it's rich ups and downs. Suddenly, I saw a message pop up. It was the girl I had agreed to call before dropping, and she seemed to be in a panicked haze worrying about what had happened while she was asleep. I quickly called her up and explained everything that happened. Again, very tough to formulate sentences, but she seemed quite happy it had turned out so positive for me. My memory after this bit is a bit foggy but I believe I had gone back to listening to music for the most part after this conversation.

T+4:00
By now, I sort of felt like I had 'outgrown' the altar I had set up for myself (my tripping space), so I began with moving all my stuff back to where it belonged. However, as I was still nicely tripping, I kept forgetting what I was doing, and mid-move started making coffee, planned to go out for a walk, and call some more people. All of these kept getting cut off by each other, so I barely accomplished anything for about an hour. One of my friends from Michigan came online and seemed to want to call, so I rang him up and explained my experience to him so far. He is a guy who has quite some knowledge of the solo LSD experience as well so it felt really great to be able to get up to speed with him about it, as he seemed to completely understand everything I'd experienced. Having that affirmation felt very good.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
T+4 is quite a short point to cut off an LSD trip report with, but not much happened afterwards. I basically just put my stuff back where it used to be (after dozens of random interjections) and ordered a big bunch of sushi. By this point I kind of regretted not doing the experience with somebody else, as I imagine it would be very nice to share this feeling with someone. I also wished I had made some plans for my night afterwards, as I was really in the mood to go dancing, but as I'm not really very into nightlife (and I also live in a moderately secluded town) I had no idea where to go, and no idea who to call up to get some suggestions. I spent most of my night afterwards chatting with friends and enjoying the positive impact it had on me, but I will definitely make sure that next time I have a plan for after the come up (either a club to go to or an area to walk around in and explore) and possibly a counterpart to do it with.

I think coming out of this trip a lot of stuff has changed, but on a very subtle level. I seem to now perceive my surroundings quite differently (people seemingly have changed their appearance, although I realise it's all perceptual) and I feel a lot more relaxed in social situations as well. Work is a lot more fun and exciting but it took me a while to really be able to focus on it again after I had the trip. Now that I can though, I feel like I'm a lot sharper than I used to be beforehand. I had a tendency to take Modafinil a bunch to really press on but I don't seem to need it anymore now.

I definitely feel a lot better about tripping and life as a whole. I think I finally closed off a depressive part of my life with this acid trip and really opened up a new chapter for myself which is completely open-ended. There's so many things I want to do and I'm gonna work really hard to make them happen. If you are thinking about having a solo LSD trip for similar reasons, please remember to take very good caution and care of yourself before, during and after. All the effort I put into cleaning my apartment, setting up my tripping space and doing all the mental work beforehand were huge factors in the positive result of this experience.

Thank you for reading my report, peace and love to you :)

It was a spur of the moment decision to take acid, which I realize now is not something that you should do with psychedelics.  There was an enormous jazz festival at my school and my fiance Delyriem and I thought it would be incredible to watch a jazz concert while tripping.  I had listened to jazz on mushrooms before and found it to be hilarious, and so I imagined that it would be a similar experience on acid.  What I didn't take into account was the insane amount of stress in my life at the time, and although I know it's a bad idea to take psychedelics when stressed, I didn't really think about it.  I had tripped on mushrooms a few times, and had attempted to take acid twice but both times it turned out to be DOB and I didn't trip hard at all because the dose had been too small. We decided to split 3 doses in case it was DOB again, so at least we'd trip a little if it wasn't real acid.

We weren't sure if we could get tickets, and didn't want to take the acid until we were sure we got seats, so we didn't take it until about half an hour into the concert.  20 minutes after we took it, it was intermission and I had a sinking feeling that we wouldn't come up until after the concert.  However, I did start having some intense visuals a few minutes into the second half of the show, and everything started being abnormally funny.  I felt like the musicians were all talking to each other with their instruments.  I could understand what the musicians were saying, but knew that it couldn't be put into words.  When one of the guest musicians started scatting, it got especially intense and confusing because he was using his voice without actually saying words and so it seemed like he was communicating with the instruments with his voice in a way that I realized no one else could understand except me and Delyriem because we were the only ones with the 'full experience' I thought.  I felt incredibly happy, everything was so silly.  As soon as the concert was over we stood up and realized we needed to get out of the auditorium immediately because I was in no state to run into people I knew and have to talk. I was just tripping madly. 

We went back to Delyriem's room, and laid in his loft bed, just laughing about everything.  We must have sat there laughing for about an hour, I honestly have no clue what we were talking about, but everything was hilarious.  I remember saying things about having two voices, laughing voice and normal voice, because our voices sounded very strange when we were laughing constantly.  I was getting some visuals but not as intense as I'd had on mushrooms. We watched the ceiling, the walls, and some optical illusions on his computer.  His roommate was in the room, and he knew we were tripping, but then our friend ML came in, who didn't know either of us had done drugs. We tried to act as normal as we could but I could not stop laughing.  ML was talking a lot about strange things that Delyriem and I found hilarious, and I had been staring at an optical illusion for a while so her body was swimming around and her face was twisting and melting and I had to pretend that everything was normal. She kept walking in and out of the room and every time she left we would crack up again, for no reason at all.  Then she'd come in and we'd try to act normal.  I was still having a lot of fun.  

Our friend Aj had called earlier and wanted to know if we wanted to watch Fear and Loathing in las Vegas.  We thought it was a good idea, so at this point we decided to meet her on campus and walk to town to another friend's house to watch the movie.  We met up with Aj who was with another friend of ours. They were both sober, but had tripped before so they knew kind of what was going on for us.  They said they had to stop at a few places first before going to watch the movie.  I didn't really feel comfortable going to any parties, and said I wanted to stay outside and we'd wait for them.  

As we walked through our small town, I felt like we owned the streets. Everything struck me so funny still, the way we walked through the town, kind of strutting down the sidewalk like we could do whatever we wanted.  Everything Aj and our other friend were saying was so funny to me and I kept laughing at everything.  I still have no recollection of what we talked about or why it was funny. It was inexplicably hilarious at the time though.  We were going to our friend B's house, but he was at the house where a bunch of theater kids lived, playing beer pong.  He invited us to come in and I said no, but he said everyone there would be cool with us tripping.  I agreed to come in when he said there was a hookah, I wanted to smoke.  We went inside and immediately I knew it wasn't the best situation.  I saw a bunch of people I knew who I didn't want to know I was doing drugs.  I tried to act as normal as I could and ignore that I was tripping. 

This is when it started to go bad.  I realized later that what set me off was trying to act in a normal way, because I couldn't figure out what normal was, and that got me freaked out.  The party was full of drunk people, some talking to me.  I tried to smile and laugh at the appropriate times, but I had to think really hard to decide when to nod or smile, etc.  There was some sort of a bong going around, and I took a hit off of it.  My lungs had never felt so strange, the flavor was not at all like what I imagined it would be and it was cold.  Startled, I began to cough, and I suddenly couldn't remember what was normal in any sense of the word. I didn't remember how to breathe normally, and continued to cough every few seconds.  My throat and lungs burned and every sensation was like I was feeling it for the first time.  My tongue in my mouth, the way it felt to swallow...it was all new to me, and I still couldn't remember how to breathe.  Delyriem asked if I needed water, and left to get me a glass.  The moment he left I got sucked into my head.  I was alone in a crowded room.  My thoughts were uncontrollable, I had no clue what was going on. I was alone in a crowded room.  My thoughts were uncontrollable, I had no clue what was going on.  My body felt strange, I was staring into space. I didn't have any visuals at this point so I didn't really remember that I was tripping, I just knew that I felt very strange.  

Suddenly I was outside, I don't remember getting up at all, just sitting on the porch outside.  The whole thing was like a dream, like nothing I'd ever experienced in trips before.  I was completely disoriented, lost in my mind, hearing people talking but not sure what was going on. I'd piece together things they'd say, but never was really aware of the conversation as a whole.  Someone said something about sneaking to a car and I become paranoid, thinking we were hiding from someone.  I heard the word 'acid' and suddenly remembered that I'd taken acid. A couple seconds later I forgot again, but remembered almost instantly.  The same thought ran through my head every few seconds, 'oh yeah, I took acid. Why was everything so strange? Oh yeah. I took acid. Why do I feel so funny? Oh yeah. I took acid.'  Then I realized that I was thinking the same thought and I became freaked out, stuck in a loop of perpetual realization.  

Everything was a blur, suddenly I was at B's apartment on the couch, watching Fear and Loathing.  The movie is hard to follow when I'm sober, but I had no clue what was going on.  It was like Johnny Depp was explaining to me what had happened, and every time I heard the word acid in the movie I'd remember again that I'd taken acid, but was never sure if I'd actually forgotten or not since the last time I remembered.  I never saw B leave the room, but he seemed to keep coming in the room over and over, sitting down on the couch.  He joked that he had a trap door by the couch, and I knew he was joking but I didn't understand how he could keep coming in without leaving unless there was a trap door.  Nothing made any sense.  I was with Delyriem the entire time but felt distant from him.  I was leaning on him while we watched the movie, but the entire time I was stuck in my head, not able to escape. I wanted to talk, and somehow get out of my head, but I didn't know what to talk about. I couldn't remember why I had taken acid. It was supposed to be fun to trip but this wasn't fun.  I couldn't remember what it meant to trip.  What was that feeling, was it a good one? Then I started getting visuals again and I remembered that visuals were a part of tripping. I felt a little bit of comfort once I started getting visuals because it helped me to feel like I was on a drug, instead of just a state of confusion. I still felt uneasy, and I kept trying to grasp onto the trip and make it fun like it had been in the beginning, just laughing. I would force myself to laugh at the movie, realizing that it was silly and didn't make sense. I knew the nonlinear fashion of the movie was messing with my head, but even though I knew the movie didn't make much sense anyway, I couldn't get out of my mind loop. I continued to feel uncomfortable but wasn't sure why I felt uncomfortable. I continued to feel uncomfortable but wasn't sure why I felt uncomfortable. 

I had to go to the bathroom, so I asked where the bathroom was, and B told me the second stall was the ladies' room, and something about the mens room having a dart board.  Because it was a pretty normal apartment I thought he was being figurative or something, it didn't make sense to have a ladies' room.  I wandered into the apartment, but couldn't figure out where to go. I walked into a few rooms, looking for a toilet. Finally I stumbled into a room that had two toilet stalls, like in a public bathroom.  I stared at them, trying to figure out if I was in a dream...it didn't make any sense to me.  I stood for a long time staring at the bathroom. Unsure of what to do next.  My body felt strange, I wasn't sure if I actually had to pee or not, or what it felt like to have to pee or not have to pee. My body felt strange, I wasn't sure if I actually had to pee or not, or what it felt like to have to pee or not have to pee. 

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

Eventually I went back to the room to watch the movie more but I couldn't handle being in my head so I told Delyriem I had to talk.  We went in the kitchen and I told him I was in a bad place in my head.  He tried to comfort me but somehow he still seemed far away. I didn't know what to talk about, I tried to explain how I was feeling but because my mind still didn't make any sense.  I don't remember much else about being there, but eventually B said he'd drive us back.  I remembered then that he was really drunk, and said that we could walk back.  A few minutes later though I was in the car, forgetting again that he was drunk.  We got back into Delyriems room, the first time since we left that I felt in a familiar place.  I knew where I was and it seemed a little more normal.  I thought it was about time that my trip was over, and I was hoping it would settle down soon.  I kept trying to explain what I had been feeling to Delyriem, but as I would explain I would get stuck in my head again and would become afraid.  I didn't know if it would ever be normal again. I was close to tears a few times, uneasy about everything that was going on.  I wanted to sleep, but my mind wouldn't calm down.  I tried to sleep a few times but would jolt back awake in terror after a few moments of restless sleep.  I was laying next to Delyriem and wanted to be cuddling with him but I felt exhausted and couldn't get enough energy to pull him close to me.  He was clearly worried about me and kept apologizing about me having a bad trip.  He tried to bring us back to a silly place like the beginning of our trip but it seemed clear that he was too worried about me to enjoy himself very much. 

I had to go to the bathroom again, and went upstairs.  I told myself that I couldn't look in the mirror, knowing I could get stuck looking at myself.  I washed my hands, avoiding myself in the mirror, but when I looked up to grab a paper towel I saw my cheeks move, kind of fluttering or twitching.  I stared, trying to figure out what I'd seen and so I smiled at myself, and watched in awe as my cheeks moved abnormally fast and kind of shuddered. I began to stare at myself, and watched myself become cartoon-like.  I was completely 2-dimensional for a while, then I suddenly realized that I was watching myself, and I was the mirror. I could see the real me through the mirror, but I was separated from myself.  I don't know how long I watched myself, before realizing that Delyriem was probably worried about me.  I walked back downstairs and Delyriem was at the door waiting for me, alarmed at how long I'd taken.  I told him I got stuck in the mirror, trying to explain what I'd seen.

After laying in bed for a while longer, he told me he couldn't sleep and asked if I would stay awake with him.  We got back out of bed and sat facing each other in chairs. I had intense visuals still, after about 7 hours of tripping hard.  He started to look like the visuals in Fear and Loathing, his face was bulging in and out, in squares and circles.  I couldn't see straight, and just wanted it all to end.  I was tired of the visuals, I just wanted Delyriem to look like he normally did instead of a stretched out strange version of him.  He kept looking cartoonish, and I could see all the colors in his hair instead of just brown, I saw green and purple strands that mixed to make what looked like brown.  I had never had such intense visuals so far into a trip. It was starting to hurt my eyes because the intensity of the colors, and being unable to focus. Eventually around 6 or 7 in the morning I drifted off to sleep after many more terrifying failed attempts.  I was afraid to sleep because I thought that because tripping was kind of like a dream, it meant that I would have to go through a few more hours of tripping before waking up to normalcy.  I had an entire night of nightmares, and even when I woke up at noon the next day I felt disoriented and out of place.  For a few hours after being awake I couldn't decide if my thoughts were normal again, couldn't figure out what it was like to be conscious.  I was afraid that I would never wake up from the trip, that I would never be the same or figure out how I thought normally.  I imagined becoming schizophrenic, kind of tripping for the rest of my life.  Delyriem and I talked continuously about the trip, trying to work it out in my head what had happened and why I felt the way I did.  Before going to sleep we had looked at a reputable harm reduction website's facts about LSD to assure me that I would be okay, and I kept trying to reassure myself.  I finally started to feel normal in the late afternoon, able to sort my thoughts out.  

I know now that I was way too stressed about life at the moment to have taken a psychedelic, and I realize that I should not take such powerful drugs so spur of the moment.  Delyriem and I decided that we need a break from psychedelics for at least a while, which was really sad to decide, but we knew it was for the best until we felt ready again.

LSD (2) : General (1), Difficult Experiences (5), Bad Trips (6), Music Discussion (22), Various (28)

BODY WEIGHT:
150 lb




At the time I took this, I was also taking 10mg of Prednisone and 35 mg of methotrexate bi-weekly for my psoriatic arthritis.

2:30 pm: I dropped 4 tabs of LSD. Went in with positive mind set. To help me not be hungry during, I had a fruit smoothie that was prepared for me by my friend A.

2:40pm: When it started there was a feeling of being very overwhelmed. Describing it simply as muscle fatigue would be inaccurate but it did seem like it, mixed with that restless leg feeling a person sometimes gets when they are very tired and haven't yet gone to bed. Instead of being in the legs however, it was in the back of my neck and shoulders. It made me tingle a little so I'd try to stretch and yawn, even take a few deep breaths to relieve it but nothing worked. I told my friend A I had this intense feeling that I needed relief from. He seemed to understand and said that the LSD was just making me feel pains that I usually ignored.

I wanted to take a walk outside because my first trip went bad, and I remembered that I felt a little boxed in the first time. This time I wanted a much different trip so my and A agreed that showing me his neighborhood would be perfect for allowing me to get out and go on a walk if I felt I needed a change. He showed me around and I remember feeling different and slowly noticing a difference in my perception. Also to note, throughout most of the trip but particularly at the beginning before the peak, I got this weird shuddering feeling and felt very shaky at times. Particularly in my jaw. 

When we got back in I noticed the color schemes. Everything was so beautiful. I noticed a rainbow centered around A's dining table. The way everything was set up it was like one corner was red and the plants took care of the blue and green on the opposite side. When I pointed it out A said he couldn't see it. I noticed it because I believed that these things (patterns and specific programed signs) were all around us all of the time but that our brains are designed not to notice them so that we don't realize we are in a simulation. I kept this incredibly hard-to-articulate thought to myself for obvious reasons. (My speech was turning into rubbish). I remember we returned outside briefly to relax while the sun was still out. This is when I first noticed actually visual distortions as some might call fractals. I made my hands into a triangle for some reason (think of Tien's Tri-beam cannon from Dragonball, if you're familiar with the series), and inside of the window I saw all kinds of different distortions and colors. It also made a bubble-like affect. Around my hands themselves the corners of this bubble were blue. I was so fascinated and I looked over at A to notice him being amused at my wonder. When I looked away from my hands the visual distortions had spread to everything else as well. My hands now left long trails behind them when I moved them, with my glowing fingertips highlighting the shadows left by my hands. I think it was the way my fingernails themselves were reflecting the sunlight.

There was an intense sensation of deja vu with this trip.  There was an intense sensation of deja vu with this trip. Not like the regular deja vu when I feel like I've been here before or are re-experiencing a memory. Rather it was like I have had a very similar trip before with the same after image affects and the same distortions and emotional intensity. But I have never done 4 tabs of LSD or any similarly strong substance before. I couldn't place it nor explain it. It seems like I've watched movies or shows with these same effects in them but the references escape me, except maybe the scene in the movie Wanted where he shoots the wings off of the flies. There was no describing the level of familiarity I felt, almost like a lost memory just below the surface.

Visual and touch sensations also became distorted. My hands felt as if they were growing and shrinking at the same time. A and I would take another walk and A would find a rock and pass it to me. I felt it in my hand and I felt as if my hands would shrink and grow at the same time. I said to A that the rock was one and everything. (Whatever that meant but sometimes I would talk just to fill the silence). It sounded profound to me and then I noticed that the rock really did have aspects of everything when it was in my hand. The heat from the sun, the cool from the shade underneath, the air I felt under it too, there was my flesh and the stone, but most importantly light and darkness. I felt as if this rock had a power to it and wanted to hold onto it so I did.

Unlike with my first trip my heart wasn't beating too fast, in fact according to my fitbit my heart rate was very normal and sometimes even calmer than usual. There were times I felt euphoric in this trip. Also, going back inside I noticed a lot of things had shells around them, not just lights. As if looking at them through a prism or a mirror angled at another mirror in a specific kind of way. This led me to the conclusion that all of reality was light reflected through glass. After images began to become so obvious that they trailed slowly behind my hands. (Reference Hunter X Hunter when the old man uses his nen to hit Pitou before they attack the Ant King. There were distinct afterimages but all of them were a part of the image). There were at least seven after images to everything (I'm re-iterating this, the trails become more obvious by this point). Birds left long, mostly black with a bit of bright color vibrating through, trails behind them as they flew. Cars also did the same but the colors would match the cars.

I got to a point where I felt sleepy. When I came back inside the second or third time, I forget which it was, I had brought the rock with me and A had taken it to put it away. I was feeling tired somehow, sleepy even, and decided to briefly lay down while A went to take care of his pets. As I lay there, I noticed symbols forming when my eyes were closed and when they were open too. I saw a person who looked like a mixture between a goddess and a man. In my mind this being was kind of like a guardian of some kind but I think it also had a bit of myself mixed in. This person/entity had many arms and gave off a very strong Hindi kind of look/vibe. I saw the symbols taking on Egyptian and Hindi qualities, although I cannot remember them clearly anymore. Some of them may have been alchemic symbols. They aligned themselves to three sides, one set on top, the other sets on the right and left. The ones on the right and left began to glow blue and red on opposite sides. (An entire side would be highlighted by only one color). The top never got to glow but I think it was about to when A came in. I was sure something awesome was going to happen because I think the symbols were going to combine together or do something like a spell. But I guess I'll never know. Upon being awoken from this I remember thinking I had seen many feathers around the room, but there weren't any when I actually looked. I thought they were like a male peacock's feathers but it must have been from the mental images I had seen of that one entity.

During this trip I saw many many symbols of which only some I can remember that stuck out to me. Of these symbols, all of which moved constantly, and some of which were filled with color, while others were transparent and had a glowing kind of iridescent outline. Some of them I could look at and see part of them, move my eyes and see another part, and move them back to see the original part. It was kind of like looking at eye floaters but way more complex and beautiful.

One of the symbols I saw resembled the Cube of Metatron which is also coincidentally my phone's lock screen. The largest symbol I saw, which was kind of faint to look at, was the Flower of Life, except it just kept going on and was everywhere. I'm not too familiar with their names, but when I saw them I realized I've seen these signs before and consulted Dr. Google. While watching television I noticed a lot of them and in the center was a six-armed swastika. I couldn't find anything quite like this, but it was thick and had rounded ends. One of the trippiest symbols I saw, however, was something like a triskele (a Gaelic triangle-looking thing). It was purple and had other colors too, was kind of transparent and moved.

A's head looked like it was vibrating intensely. This trip was getting really strong by now. Emotions felt more powerful so I knew I had to tread carefully here. This was around the time the symbols would be constantly there, kind of like how fractals are described. Fractals were there too. I decided that maybe I should go watch TV with A. A ended up falling asleep so I got out my headphones and started listening to music videos. My favorite one was Umbrella by Rihanna. Under the influence of LSD I realized this song was a masterpiece. I will also note that even though the songs seemed longer and there was obvious music euphoria, the drug-induced music pleasure wasn't quite up to par with what DXM could do to music. This is just my opinion though, other people may have the opposite affect with them.

I had gone to the restroom at some point and looked in the mirror. I noticed a wrinkle on my forehead and the white hairs on the side of my head that are mostly hidden. This bugged me because I haven't accomplished much in life and I'm already seeing the signs of senescence that aging causes us. When I went back to my music I closed my eyes again feeling tired but this time saw something horrifying. I saw a guy in a mirror, not necessarily me or the mirror I saw myself in, and I saw him get shriveled up into something even more shriveled than a mummy. His eyes and teeth all disappeared into black holes in his face, like a skeleton. His horrified face burned into my memory. I knew instinctively that he died lonely, accomplishing nothing and feeling so alone and unwanted. I knew the reason this happened too. There was a Great Evil in the world that drained all things of life, youth, health, and everything good. It was the orchestrator of Death, war, hatred, and deceit. The reason we all die and live horrible lives could be attributed to the fact that we all at one point or another have used its power. To lie, to hurt someone else, to feel envious, to try to empower ourselves... I knew then that the only way to avoid this kind of life where I would die just like that guy would be to try to be a better person. A better Christian. I'm not going to get too religious in this report though. I will say that there was a fear of death and that I feared in this death I would be in a place of extreme mental anguish and possibly physical pain as well. I visualized more eye guts and bodily gore than I actually want to describe. I thankfully managed to minimize this by not trying to visualize it so it never manifested into my mental imagery. But it was always there and made my teeth feel very weird. Tripping makes my teeth feel strange anyway though.

I afterward realized that the thing we all want the most in the world is the same kind of peace and comfort we got when we were small children being held by our mothers. It's a calm and peace you only got when you were very tiny though, and you lose it over time as you lose your innocence and everything else that makes you adored, special, and full of hope/potential. Once it's gone it's gone and you spend your entire life wishing you could get some of that back in some way. Not necessarily a mother/child bond, but more like a kind of fully loving, fully supportive reassurance that can stave off the bad thoughts, the anxiety, and the fear of the unknown. I would dwell on this thought quite a lot.

At one point, while I was listening to music on my phone with my headphones I began to hear all of the sounds of the world at once. It was incredible. I heard the fish tank, I heard crickets, birds outside, and an almost inaudible humming or buzzing sound that's always present but unheard. I referred to all of this noise as Hidden Chatter. I was thoroughly convinced that the Universe itself was trying to talk to me. It was both frightening and beautiful at the same time. After my first LSD trip I was always worried that I could easily fall into a bad trip, so I am now always cautious. I was the one that kinda convinced my friend A to try it with me. He loved it, but that first trip really messed me up with anxiety I never knew possible. So now I'm cautious with it. I've also noticed that tripping, particularly on acid, makes me more shy and afraid to share my feeling and opinions. I guess I feel more vulnerable in that state? tripping, particularly on acid, makes me more shy and afraid to share my feeling and opinions. I guess I feel more vulnerable in that state? While I was listening to my music earlier I had seen an image in my mind of a woman. A woman I was somehow familiar with but couldn't quite place. I've seen her in advertisements, tv shows, movies, and possibly in passing. I thought this person could be some type of spy or a regulator of the simulation that is Life. I'll do my best to describe her. At first I thought she kind of resembled my crush, but she definitely also resembled a mixture of Tatiana Maslaney and Betsy Beutler, to name a couple, with a very strong resemblance to Chelsey Reist). Sometimes she'd appear to have darker hair and brown irises but mostly she seemed to appear in my mind with the blond hair and lighter eyes. I had so many theories and speculations about this woman. One of which was that I was incapacitated and in a simulation of life and my body was being cared for by her, who was either a supervisor or a nurse. But then my mind started to think that she was me, and that I was remembering who I actually was. It sounds weird but I was briefly worried that I would wake up in her body. At the same time, I thought, if it's my body then I wanted to.

I decided at a certain point to go back outside and walk around the neighborhood while A was busy trying to get some sleep. I noticed that there were a lot more neighbors than I thought there'd be so I was kind of paranoid about that. I remember trying to keep calm and remain cool while I walked by some of them because I was a stranger here and didn't want to have to interact, especially with my speech and comprehension extremely compromised. During one of my laps around the neighborhood I noticed that there were children playing. I was walking and suddenly one boy shouts something indiscernible to his mother. She tells him No, get back inside etc, something, I'm guessing because she's never seen me before. The kid then starts shouting louder and louder, and I assume he's trying to follow me too. No! That's him! THAT'S HIM!!!! THAT'S THE GUY!!!!!! is what my hilariously drugged up mind thought he was saying, even though I couldn't actually hear what was being said. I don't know this neighborhood or anyone in it so I get worried and try to remain calm as I walk away. When I get back to A's house I make the executive decision to stay in his yard, away from any obnoxious brats.

I try to get relaxed but no matter what I do it seems the only place I can feel the breeze, which really helps the euphoria start in, is to be sitting in the middle of the grass. I obviously cannot walk around the neighborhood anymore, no matter how good the air feels. A couple jogs by, seeing me kneeling by my friend's car. I decide that it looks suspicious as hell so I move to the center of the yard and lay down in the grass. I am watching the sun setting and am enjoying the view of the clouds in the sky.

When I'm looking at them I see some of them changing shape, slowly. I see a big bird in the clouds, like a phoenix. I also see swords pointing straight down at me. Clouds can't do that unless it is a funnel cloud but that looks different. This more so resembled one of those checkpoints in a video game that shoots a thin pillar of light upwards. At this point the shapes take on more character-like movements. The clouds, whenever I wasn't thinking, began to move on their own and turned into armored warriors, some of them on horses. I saw so many horses up there. I've never seen clouds that look like horses before. I look away for a second and look back only to see that all of the warriors have been impaled by gigantic white arrows. All but one, who stands in the center of the rest of the fallen soldiers. I think the imagery is really cool. I'm a bit confused because I cannot tell if he is riding a horse or if he is a centaur. Either one is still pretty bad-ass.

The sun goes down slowly and I can feel my thoughts betraying me. I begin once again thinking about that shriveled up mummy-looking guy, the one that represented that evil force in the world that decays all things. Thoughts like no one will ever love you and you'll die alone, in agony, and then you'll rot in Hell casually glance by me. I gravitate towards them for brief atto seconds and then shake myself out of it, not wanting to experience that level of misery. I notice the street lights now have these shells around them.

(Keep in mind, it's been a few months since this happened, I'm just now finishing this trip report in September because of a lack of time and procrastination. Also, I took shrooms on the last day of July so for some reason that makes it harder to remember the timings of this one). (So I took the shrooms around 2:30 pm, and the sun goes down some time around 7:30 or 8 in the summer if I'm not mistaking. The peak was definitely between 6 pm and 7pm because I was watching music videos and noticed that some of the people became extremely distorted and everything took on much deeper meanings and became a lot more personal. Also that was sometime around the Hidden Chatter which felt kind of like my head was ringing. I think after the sun went down I was slowly but surely tapering off).

I remember I wanted to watch anime shows or movies but my friend didn't know what to put on, so he turns on Netflix and tells me to choose. But I'm super high right now so making choices seems an insurmountable task made even harder by my heightened insecurity about my own likes. He ends up turning to a bunch of stuff I don't even want to watch. Some of it was pretty graphic, which I still think even sober that it was intentional because he's talked about tripping and watching horror things before. But those are passing thoughts. He's a very good friend and one of the only people in the universe I trust to that degree. But while I was tripping I perceived a lot of what he said as dismissive, like how you'd talk to a child that had too much sugar for breakfast. A thought that came to mind was You're supposed to be a trip sitter, not a baby sitter. I did feel stupid trying to explain some things, mostly because my words didn't work. The thoughts were there but the words weren't so what came out of my mouth was incoherent babble.

Later in the night we decided to walk around the street. I notice that even now the street lights had the shells around them and they were beautifully multi-colored. Instead of the usual star-shape that bright lights have around them, they had an oblong yet octagonal shape, with pointed corners and multiple layers. It looked vastly different. Even car headlights looked insanely different, I'd say futuristic sometimes because they'd look like a merged line with the lights on the corners.

When we passed by one of the houses I perceived something that looked like a gigantic bacterium wrapping itself around a street lamp. It was like an anaconda, but segmented, see-through, and had this energy vibrating off of it. It glowed on the edges. I wasn't sure what the hell it was and I tried asking A but he was in his own little world and just told me to stay off of that neighbor's property and to stop pointing. I asked him later what it was and he said it was probably a security system. I asked What kind of security system looks like that? I've never seen that in my life. He said Probably because you were high. Yet for some reason he was unable to describe what it looked like to me when I was sober. I have theories about that for another time.

Anyway, we spent an inordinate amount of time walking just for the hell of it, at night time on the side of the road. We walked through a few neighborhoods, me making note of how beautiful they were. When we finally got back, and trust me I wanted to get back before the LSD wore off because I felt myself getting more sober by the minute, we turn the tv back onto Netflix. Some show that is an accumulation of bad movies with three characters that talk during the movie about how bad it is. It's pretty amusing, and I find it to be one of the more enjoyable parts of the trip involving tv. There's also this very dumb movie called Yoga Hosiers which we watched before that aforementioned movie night show. After A goes to sleep on the couch I start seeing that one person who looked like kind of like Chelsey Reist again. Actually, I never stopped seeing her in my mind. I kept thinking I was in a simulation and that she was the real me, which was disorientingly arousing in a weird way.

By morning the trip has pretty much worn off. I'm starting to feel negative feelings for some reason. Me and A go for another walk, and I feel extremely dirty. Weirdly enough I am getting depressed the more sober I get. When we get inside and I'm busy getting my things ready to leave I decide to have a couple of Not Your Father's root beers because I had heard that alcohol can help negate the affects of a trip. I feel as if the depression would be too much to handle. Honestly I can't say that it works because I think it could, but at the same time if depression is part of the come down alcohol won't help with that specific part.

By the time I go home I just want to be close to my parents. I can't explain it. I feel like there's something missing from my life and that feeling is really strong after acid, and persists long after it's out of my system, for months even. It's probably partly a lack of sleep, so when I get home, and shower I try to go to sleep. The only problem is that in the come down of acid it's hard to want to be alone because of the depression. But the depression is rough because of the tiredness. It's a Catch 22. I finally get to sleep because no one is home anyway, and eventually after that I am back to normal and actually feel a lot less depressed and sad than I've felt since my first LSD trip.

Nearing the end of a sunny late spring day in the Pacific Northwest, I decided 'now is the right time'. I had been doing research on LSD off an on for the past decade, determined to someday try it, but only when the time was right. While I have experience with a handful of drugs, I am by no means a stoner. I hardly even drink. I'm not against it I just prefer to do things in moderation and under relatively specific circumstances. I had acquired a couple tabs from a trusted friend 2 months earlier, and was just waiting for the opportune moment. This was it.

I had previously asked my friend D to tripsit me when the time came. He was available and down to hang out with me all night, so he came over. I was actually house sitting at the time, in a really nice, big house owned by a retired University professor. It was filled with many types of houseplants, exotic art, and also contained (when he felt like being inside) a very talkative and extremely large cat. I felt like it was just the perfect setting to trip.

I took my first tab as soon as D told me he was leaving his house (he lived about 10 minutes away) and started to keep a journal. I set a bunch of alarms on my phone, one every 30 minutes for 10 hours, to remind me to take note of what I was experiencing. I set a bunch of alarms on my phone, one every 30 minutes for 10 hours, to remind me to take note of what I was experiencing. This trip report will consist of my typed up journal entries, transcribed voice recordings that I made, and some things I wrote immediately after coming down, along with some further reflections and other details that may explain things, give context, or other wise be of interest.

T: 0hr

This tastes odd. It takes longer to dissolve than I had expected. I feel like an idiot for eating paper. I make a pitcher of pink lemonade, and repeatedly almost choke.

T: 0hr30m

I feel a little light. I'm probably imagining it. I'm drinking some lemonade. I should probably turn off the answering machine beeping before it drives me mad.

T: 0hr:44m

Not imagining it. Real. I like it.

T: 1hr

I failed to skip a line [in the notebook, as I have previously between entries], FUCK! It'll be okay. I feel soooooo good! Like happy! And tickled! I just want to flex all my muscles until they POP. Oh, my handwriting sucks. I hope I can effectively keep this journal [for the duration of the trip]. Pink lemonade was a risky choice. Ugh. Mucus. Oh, so we're in past tense now? Or were. I've always been shit at that.

T: 1hr15m

OK I just feel like saying something. I'm really enjoying silence right now. I'm a very visual person, and I'm not like, hallucinating or anything. I just feel like my visual input is really important. It's like 90% of what I care about.

T: 1hr30m

Oh, just kidding, I'm hallucinating as fuck. It's beautiful! I can't stop smiling. How bad is my writing? I'm under drops of water. I feel like its physically happening to my eyeball.

T: 2hr

I already hate the fact that I need to write and can't just instantly communicate. Focusing on writing intensifies visual hallucinations. So much vibrating and squirming but its so pleasant. I find it odd that it's pleasant as if I should be repulsed. I'm giggling at my writing. It's very poor.

T: 2hr30m

I have to focusintenselytowriteanditsveryunpleasantsoI'mgoingto stop I JUST 

FOCUS

VERY IMPORTANT the beautiful sunset more colors than I thought were possible I had never felt so HAPPY I'm going back.

T: 3hr

Just took the 2nd tab. I feel intensely compelled to document, but not in a medium I can understand. I'm sorry!! I'm worried I won't remember. How about 'yellow'?

At this point I was feeling quite loopy and wanted to lie down. I told D that I was going to go chill in bed with some blankets for a bit because I just needed to. In between writing my journal entries, my interactions with D were fairly limited. When he showed up he proclaimed 'I just took a shitload of shrooms before I left.' Since we had previously (on a different day) agreed that he would be sober while I tripped, I was disappointed in him and slightly concerned. Ultimately, we got really giggly about nothing in particular and each wandered around the house looking at things, and I mostly forgot about it.

He seemed content with hanging out in the living room so I went and snuggled into the bed. I probably laid down in the bed for about 2 hours, I was very relaxed and slightly overstimulated by all the visuals which were increasing in intensity every passing moment. I really did not want to move. I decided to continue my documentation of my trip via voice memos on my phone. I have transcribed them here. 

Important note: The AJ that I refer to is my boyfriend. I have to provide a little backstory here about why so much of this trip became centered around him. At the time of this trip, we had been seeing each other for about 5 months. He was in college in a different city a couple hours away, so we saw each other about every other weekend. Things had gotten really serious a couple months earlier when I casually mentioned that I was going up to [city] to buy LSD from a friend. This led to an all night conversation (via text) during which he expressed extreme distrust of the drug, and did not want me to use it. I tried to explain that it was very low risk and was important to me. I know that he had dated a drug addict before and was sensitive about these things. Ultimately the conversation led to me saying I would gladly delay my taking it if it made him uncomfortable, that I placed a greater importance on our relationship, and we told each other that it was love for the first time that night.

Eventually AJ said he had loosened up his feelings about it, that he trusted me much more than anyone else he knew in his life who he associated with drug use, and I took that as more or less a go ahead, but I certainly wasn't going to be in his face about it. It was ALWAYS meant to be a personal journey for me. I had decided on this occasion that I would tell him after I had done it, so that he wouldn't worry about me from afar, nor would I worry about him worrying about me.

Our relationship was (and is still) one of immense passion and I have always had very strong feelings about him. I did not want to lose him but I also very much wanted this for myself.

Well..on to the recordings. The headings above the recordings are the filenames as they were in my phone, some of them were changed.

Recording 1

Ive been making it a goal to document my experiences, on the half hour, every half hour, at the very least. I am free to do it more frequently should the urge arise. [sighing and giggling noises] Hang on.

Recording 2

Ok. I am having a hard time talking into this because I just want to laugh. The reason that Im making this recording is that i dont think Im going to be able to write. Every time I try to focus on writing, the visual hallucinations get really intense, and its really hard to.[giggling]I dont want to sound like a crazy person. 

Recording 3

Its fair to say that I am definitely going to sound a little bit like a crazy person. [sigh] Part of the issue is that Im trying to be kinda restrained. Id like to not feel that way, but Im not alone in the houseso I cant be free. Not truly.

Recording 4

I have decided, firmly, that: Fuck Cats.

Recording 5

[giggling] Jesus Christ, um, ok. [way more giggling] I am now on recording number 5. And I swear I am sticking to the original plan [uncontrollable laughter] of why I am fucking making this recording. Oh my god. [laughing] Nope! Not happening.

Recording 6

This is a very serious subject matter. Its greatly profound, and its of grave importance that I communicate this clearly, eloquently, and with proper levity.

Recording 7

Except I keep trying and giggling and stuff so yeah, clearly this is just the pinnacle of human existence.

Recording 8

AJ, I forgot to use your name in all the other recordings, causethe underlying feeling is Im not telepathic, and thats really frustrating. Like I feel like I should just be able to instantly impart emotion and sensation into somebody else, and that was what I wanted to do. Why I started making these recordings and then I started getting giggly cause its supposed to be serious. I just wanted you to know that I was having what I perceived to be a profound experience, and I was thinking about you, and like that experiencing it without you is kind of a deficit in my experience. But thats ok. It was just like the realization that you couldnt just feel what I felt, filled me with a real sadness. im just experiencing emotions like purely. [laughs] Its definitely extremely pleasant. Im actually just trying to stay really calm right now so that I can talk. Probably a lot of what Im saying sounds completely insane. I just realized that. I dont really know when Im speaking out loud versus when Im just thinking. This like line between consciousness.that part all makes sense. Its all very blurred. Like I get why thats always brought up. Its just like you feel like you should be able to know and feel everything at the same time, and you kind of do, and its really awesome. Hey this recording went like a full fucking ten times longer than all the other ones. Good job, go me, Im gonna stop it now.

The Most Important One (allegedly)

Holy fuck, okay. Hopefully I remember to rename this accordingly. Just, disregard all the other ones. This is whats important. I was having a profound experience, or what I thought was one, whatever, doesnt matter. And I missed you during it. Thats the sweetest thing that I can give you. Also Ive been talking about this for fully a half hour now, fuck.

((SIDE NOTE: The 'profound experience' I am referring to here was essentially me watching a particularly beautiful sunset. I'm sure that sober it would have been quite spectacular, one of those really dramatic sunsets with sweeping clouds and varying shades of purple, orange, and magenta. I was experiencing some distinct time dilation, as I know logically a sunset only lasts a matter of minutes, but it felt like hours that I was staring at the sky in pure awe. I have never seen Aurora Borealis in person, but the way the clouds shimmered and waved reminded me of it. The entire time I was watching this I felt utter joy, the likes of which I cannot remember experiencing before.))

Recording 9

Ok, Im letting myself off the hook for abandoning the document stuff every half hour thing. Mostly because I am documenting it, just in a different way. But I also just have to accept that if I want to enjoy myself I cant force myself to write. It justits.unpleasant. So, I do want to document whats happening, so that I can remember, and for I dunno, informational purposes I guess. I just have to do it in ways that feel natural, I guess.

Recording 10

What could be more natural than curled up in bed with an iPhone. I cant imagine anything. Its beautiful [laughs]

Self Awareness

This is cliche as fuck. I think Im gonna title this one self awareness andits not funny.

Recording 11

Oh I keep being super not scientific about this. Like the whole reason why I wanna document thingsI just keep ignoring the things that I would want to write down, like what the actual visual effects are, and what Im avoiding when Im not writing. All the colors. Just, every color. Especially the like, uh, the acid ones. [laughs] derp. You know the neon, whatever. All that. Is just happening. But when I focus really hard, like on writing for example, cause like right now Im just letting my eyes do whatever the fuck they want. Which isI dont even wanna knowwhat itll look like. Just, its all over the place. Ohhhh no.the creature is up. Its fine. He just goes..you knownature is callingI can assume [crashing noises] Fucking christ, some things never change. Ok. The colors. Thats what Im avoiding. It sounds really nice. Thats the thingall the physical sensations, all the visual sensations, are things that should not be pleasant but are. Thats the crazy thing. And the only thing thats unpleasant is resisting it. Let the vibrations happen and it just feels really good. But like you try to hold still so you can sense them, and everything starts to go all like, putrid, and the colors, instead of being this like harmonious rainbow fractal awesomeness is like bruises and sickness and like vomit. Its really gross and you want it to just not be happening anymore and its super easy to make it not be happening anymore. All you have to do is relax and stop resisting. Time is a little bit different, which is what I expected, which is why I set alarms for myself so that I could document properly. Im just a step ahead of myself the whole time. Anyways, feels like its been like 3 hours and its been 3 minutes and thats just the nature of this, I suppose. Ill stop.

Recording 12

This is a.mad props to myself for my restraint and not sending these.

((SIDE NOTE: I wanted very desperately to share with my boyfriend, as I was feeling a profound amount of love for him, but it was the middle of the night and he had class in the morning, and in the back of my mind I was worried he would become upset and not understand if I told him that I was tripping.))

Recording 13

Oh god! Not sending them until some time that I will send them, and that Ill just have arbitrarily decided is the OK time, so that I can continue to congratulate myself. Ohhhh I get it, this is fun, this is a fun game. Im really sad that youre not doing this game with me.

((This made complete sense to me at the time, and I do know what I was driving at. Basically I was becoming increasingly aware of myself, my attitudes towards myself, and the way I justify my behavior. Basically I was becoming increasingly aware of myself, my attitudes towards myself, and the way I justify my behavior. I was pleased with the objective level of insight I was feeling.))

Recording 14

This is me being sad again at my failure to commit to writing in the notebook. I wanted to have that artifact. And now Im not gonna have that artifact. Im just gonna have like, part of one. That annoys me.

Recording 15

This is also important. I feel like I am just completely objectively evaluating everything. Like IffIm just going off an anwhoooo, I dunno what thats gonna look like in the finished recording, but I just got like my.its 11 o clock alarm, in the middle of trying to say a sentence, and uh, yeah. I have no fucking idea what I was talking about. Probably something super important and you know about consciousness and all that bullshitooh spiders!

Recording 16

Yeah I keep thinking Im seeing spiders like really creepy big daddy long leg ones, and theyre trying to cuddle me, [laughs] and its great. I want them to cuddle me.

Recording 17

I still dont have fucking wifi on this phone right now. Im using.datain the middle of Im laying in bed. Comfortably, I could fall asleep at any time, just happily with my phone trying to internet, as kids do.just not on wifi. [laughing] why does this enrage me so much?

I went to excruciating effort to rename this

Ds in the living room, and I dont know who hes talking to, and I really really wanna know, but I also really dont wanna get up or care about anything other than how comfy I am.

Recording 18

I really like the liquid part. The part where I feel like Im justin liquid. That is very appealing. I just wish I was more warm. Im gonna complain about being cold constantly. And the way my glasses feel on my head. No, those things arent worth complaining about actually, those things are fine.

Recording 19

Im gonna take a break from making the recordings for a while. I realized that Im safe from having to display them, cause, Im in the other room of my laptop. And thats where I recorded the initial greeting, the introduction, so to speak. And uh, I just could not in good.good conscience, introduce something so poorly. There is already an introduction. I will leave it until I can comfortably access it. Soall of these recordings will follow that. Im gonna just try to get warm now. I feel like this sounds really way more sad than it is. It should not sound sad cause Im smiling and Ive been smiling the whole time.

((Right after taking the first tab I recorded a video, about a minute long, which I intended to send to AJ in the morning along with all my other data collected.))

Love

[sigh] Theres always like 2 degrees of separation from my intention and the finished product, so this is going to be, I guess the finished product. AJ. Hello. Im making it for you. I fucking love you. Thats all. Thats literally all. oh

Recording 20

I dont know if I made note of it earlier. I know that I remarked it aloud to myself, and the universe, and anyone who was listening[sigh] no. Uh[sigh] man, talking is justnot easy. Ok. [laughing] Oh my god. Im actually fucking full on deleting this one. This.this uh, this marks a milestone. No. I wont delete it, cause then Ill never know that I said I was gonna delete it. But know this: I felt at some point that it needed to be deleted. Ok. Im, Im finished.

Recording 21

What I meant to say is that its just literally impossible to have a bad time doing this. Whoever said you could have a bad trip is fucking retarded, and a liar, itsnot possible. Everything is fantastic.

((Famous last words anyone?))

Recording 22

With the exception of the fact that I am still really fucking cold and.justbe warmer!

Recording 23

I am going to enjoy listening to these later. This is a fact.

Recording 24

I was way more deeply affected by the jarring nature of the alarms than I thoughtoh my god its reallyI should not have made them. I have like.four more?!

Recording 25

All I wanted to say is that the physical effects are much stronger than anticipated.

And this....this was the final recording I made before shit got weird. The next section of this report is what I wrote up the following day after coming down and reflecting. I never finished the story intially because I grew frustrated with my inability to properly convey what I experienced. I do remember it relatively well, and will try to summarize it now, 6 months after the fact.

I have to say that my ultimate conclusion from the waking nightmare that was my trip was not surprising. Well, it was somewhat surprising in that I was incredibly impressed by the immense creative power of my brain. That is astonishing. What I mean is that if I was seeking an answer, the answer I got was that I understand myself and the things that are important to me.

The world around me became immensely beautiful. It filled me with such astounding joy. I wanted so badly to tell AJ that I love him, that I really love him from the deepest and truest part of me. I remember saying that I wanted him to be there, but I really didnt, not physically. I wanted us to be one, and I have no other way of explaining that. Perhaps the resistance to telling him, and the anxiety underlying the keeping of my secret was part of what led my happy dream to becoming a nightmare. I believe it was a combination of things, though.

Once physical sensation became something completely foreign and alien, I started to inspect my body. I remember resisting thinking negative thoughts about it, but I couldnt help it. I was advised to stay very hydrated (I understood why, later, because drinking water was fucking impossible) and my belly swelled painfully with the liquid inside it. I curled up under the covers because I was cold, and held myself. Because the nerve endings in my skin were not firing in a familiar manner, my body felt strange and different. When my fingertips ran over my buttocks and thighs, parts of my body that I know to be strong and lovely, the skin felt soft and melting, and my muscles fell away, atrophied and wilted.

I thought about looking at them to confirm that they were still there, but I was afraid of what Id find. I was afraid Id see myself for who I really am, ugly, withered, sagging. This thought became reality and I could see myself without looking and it was truly horrible. I knew that I was merely dreaming, and allowed even the bad thoughts to come, because I was curious. I fell into a black hole in the bed, my body parts swelling and swirling into a spiral/pretzel type object. I was inside and outside at the same time. I saw my skin stretched and puffy, just a mass of fatty limbs, a completely inhuman form. I relaxed and thought of course this is how you see yourself. Dont be afraid, you knew all along.

When I relaxed more my body became pure color, shards of black, white, green, and blue, continually breaking and reforming into extremely intricate patterns. It was sort of beautiful, but in a different way from the happy colors from earlier in the evening. These shards were painful, and menacing in their speed. They did not ebb and flow, like the happy colors. They whipped and swirled like a storm.

At this point I still was not truly scared. I was an observer. I knew what I was seeing and feeling was the pure representation of the negative feelings I have about my physical self. It was interesting. At some point the swirling storm settled, I returned to my bed, and I knew that I needed to get up. Mostly because I needed to pee, but also I felt that I should change my environment. I felt that I had been lying there for a few days.

I remember turning over in bed, feeling the blanket slide over my skin, the mattress give way beneath me. It all felt so strange and different. There were holes everywhere, and everything that moved fluttered and skittered about. I had to move very slowly because sudden movement was guaranteed sensory overload. Pulling the blankets back was a true exercise in bravery. The gaps in sensation on my skin meant that the feeling of fabric dragging over flesh felt like the stabbing legs of giant insects walking over me. The erratic manner in which the blankets appeared to move added to this illusion. I felt extremely uncomfortable, and though I didnt feel intensely bad, I felt that the time of happiness had ended.

I walked across the floor, my bare feet on the wood felt like they were made of a shifting sort of swiss cheese. It occasionally gave way and my foot fell into nothingness, like when you think youve descended the last step on a staircase, but there is really one more. Somehow I did not lose my balance because of this, but I was very hesitant to touch anything. My phone was still in my hand, and I felt it so firmly and heavily in my fingers, as if it were fused to me. I went into the living room to tell D, and my phone recordings, one final message before descending into hell. The physical effects are much stronger than anticipated.

I tried to record a new message. I wanted to say that I was starting to become afraid, that I was having a bad time, that I was unhappy. I couldnt speak. I said it wont let me say bad things about it. D asked what it was. In my head I answered my trip, but I couldnt say it aloud. I dropped my phone onto the red leather chair, it sunk deeply into it, impossibly deeply, and became immersed in the leather, which more resembled a very thick paint. I guess Ill leave that there, I thought to myself, somewhat amused.

When I turned my attention to the restroom, a terror so absolute gripped me, I was completely immobilized. At this point I realized that my trip had personified itself, and he did not want me to communicate anything negative. He also wanted me to do certain things, and did so by making anything else impossible. I stared at the door to the bathroom. Tears welled up in my eyes. D, I said, I need you to help me.

Help you with what?

I need to go to the bathroom.

Ok, you need me to walk you there?

I mean I need to pee, but not in there, it wont let me, I laughed at the absurdity of this statement. I tried to will myself to walk to the bathroom but my body just would not move. Forcing it caused immense feelings of fear and anxiety. I took a step in a different direction, which was fine. Fascinating, I thought to myself. At that point I knew what my trip wanted me to do, but I still denied it. I started to laugh hysterically. 

((SIDE NOTE: as a child I was extremely phobic of bathrooms because of some traumatic experiences at a very young age. Bathrooms and urination have been a strange fixation in many ways throughout my entire life for probably a whole host of weird psychological reasons that I wont get into here, just know that they exist and I am aware of them)).

I cant believe this, I said. I figured out the rules to this game a while ago. Lose yourself to the trip and everything is fine. Resist and face consequences. I started to shake and bounce a lot because I had to pee so badly. I didnt really want to do what I needed to do, but I couldnt wait any longer. I asked D to come with me, and he accompanied me as I very easily walked to the front door.

When I was outside, I knew that it was cold, but I couldnt really feel it. Everything was covered in ice. That frost isnt really there, right? I asked. D merely told me that it was, indeed, quite cold. I squatted on the front porch and pissed, hard, over the stairs. The relief was overwhelming. I felt mildly ridiculous but at the same time part of me knew why I needed to do that. It felt very meaningful.

When I returned to inside, I grabbed my phone from the liquid chair, and laid on the couch. My body felt better, and I felt better. My skin was still falling away in pieces, and it was very hard to move without a lot of discomfort. My arm against the back of the couch felt like it was made of hornets nest. Pieces of reality fell away, leaving a honeycomb type pattern. A fly buzzed around my head. I felt repulsed yet fascinated. What is my brain doing? I wondered to myself.

My nightmare only became truly scary when D decided to go to the store. I was already somewhat uncomfortable with his presence, but I also did not want to be alone. He said he would be right back. Once alone I remembered the rules. Give in to the trip and he will take you for a ride. Dont resist. I buried myself in blankets and closed my eyes to enter a world of Gigeresque horror. My world was a liquid gray and green, melting into black void. The black void took the shape of holes, which stretched the gray and green goo into thin lines between them. A vast network as far as my eyes could see, if it was my eyes that were seeing. 

This network zoomed away from me and I realized I was looking closely at the eyes of an enormous insect, the size of a universe. Its face was incredibly detailed, and slightly glowing, as if it were an image on an old computer screen. My skin was the insect, and the insect was me. Bright green lasers crisscrossed the void, forming patterns. I was so cold. I was under piles pf blankets but I could not feel them. How can I warm my flesh when my flesh is not real? I thought. I battled with succumbing to the feeling, the imagery, I wanted out. It had been years and D was still gone. Maybe he was not coming back. The silence of the house felt oppressive, rather than peaceful. I felt deep loneliness.

I turned and picked up my phone. It stretched and contorted in my hand. I struggled to read it, or even hold it. The lock screen displayed a notification. AJ replayed your snap. Suddenly struggling to swim back into reality, my mind raced for a memory. What had I sent? I dont remember talking to him. I opened the app, the snap was replayed 19 minutes ago. What have I done? Let me apologize, I pleaded with my trip. Let me make it okay. I dont want him to be scared, he cant know that I am scared. I am strong and I am fine.

I tapped his name but nothing happened. The letters were just pushed out of the way. No! I thought, why wont you let me? I fiddled with the other functions of my phone, which was now trapezoidal in shape and a foot long. The screen was all gray and would not display color. I returned to snapchat. It was frozen. My trip wont let me talk to AJ. But maybe I had? My eyes bored into the text that read 19m ago. Hadnt minutes passed? What was happening?

D returned. His presence in the house was overwhelming. I silently sat with my anxiety. He laid on the floor eating chocolate. I didnt want to look at him. I wanted him to leave, I wanted someone else there. Someone who was safer. I was not sure that the person who had come into the house was really D at all.

I checked my phone again. AJ replayed your snap 26m ago. So time was really passing, apparently. I tapped his name and nothing happened. I tapped another name and a chat window opened. I dont want to talk to T, I thought, I dont want to bother him. Returning to the home screen I tapped AJs name, and still nothing happened. His name swelled to a much larger size on the screen. I was frustrated. I knew I wasnt going to send him anything, I just wanted my phone to work. My phone working means things are real, this was not real, and I became extremely afraid.

I suddenly realized that D had been chewing on food for an incredibly long time. I could see him, hunched over, out of the corner of my eye. Just constantly eating, so fast, so viciously. I was disgusted.

I want M, I said. Help me call M.

Why would I help you? D asked accusingly. I looked at him, and his face was that of a demon. His eyes hollow holes of glowing white. Black ink flowed from the sockets. I looked away. Thats not real. Fuck that cant be real.

please, I cant make my phone work, call M for me.

He took my phone and said Is this person EXPECTING you to call them?. I felt very personally attacked and wracked with guilt after this question.

I hesitantly said yes, even though that was not exactly true. I found M's contact page and he helped me put it on speaker. I listened to it ring for an incredible time, and then it went to voicemail.

Call again, I pleaded, feeling panic.

Are you sure youre not bothering them? D asked, in a very mocking tone.

YesI thoughtI am bothering her.but I need something to be realand we called again. No answer.

I thought of who else I could call, but my phone was frozen on her contact info. My trip wants me to contact M, and no one else. But she was not there. I struggled to operate my phone. I got to my contacts list and scrolled through it. None of the names would work except for M's. Fuck.

I opened snapchat again. AJ replayed your snap 34m ago. Fuck.

I opened my contacts. Scrolling, scrolling, frozen, M. Open. Send text message. Fuck I cant type. Go back. Scrolling. M. Go back. Scrolling. Frozen. This went on for almost an hour. Finally something clicked and I remembered how to make technology work. Siri, tell M: I need you. Message sent.

Snapchat. AJ replayed your snap 34m ago. No...almost an hour has gone by. At least half an hour, but not even a minute has passed?

This is a nightmare, I told myself, and I will wake up. I just have to watch it play out. Yes.

And what a nightmare it was. Here is where I am picking up the retelling 6 months later. Eventually D asked if I wanted him to leave. Maybe he picked up on the fact that I was extremely distrusting of him. I told him that was fine, that I was just going to ride this out by myself, maybe I'd get a hold of someone else. I was honestly terrified of being alone, but I was MORE scared with him there. I probably looked relatively fine, I'd just been bundled up on the couch not doing much but messing with my phone and internally panicking for quite a while.

At this point D had not ever done acid before, so I don't think he really knew how to take care of me at all, not to mention he was tripping on shrooms as well. D had not ever done acid before, so I don't think he really knew how to take care of me at all, not to mention he was tripping on shrooms as well. When he left I felt a sense of relief but I also felt utterly incredibly alone and scared.

I knew that I was just on a drug, and that it would wear off and everything would be fine. I knew that everything I was thinking and feeling and fearing were my thoughts and maybe I had the power to turn it around. I came to the conclusion rather quickly that I lacked the fortitude to turn it around, and began to really feel pure dread.

I didn't want to talk to AJ. I don't even know what I was thinking about that. I kept trying to come up with some reason that he'd replayed a snapchat when I didn't think I'd sent him one for hours. I was very afraid that I had sent him something recently without remembering it, and that it would clue him in to the fact that I was tripping. Time was passing so slowly that even the idea of waiting out the trip seemed agonizing and impossible.

I wanted to cry. I ended up calling a lot of people, but no one answered, probably because it was 1am on a Tuesday. Finally I got a hold of someone, a fellow psychonaut, the friend who had sold me the drug. He was awake. He lived about an hour away, but I convinced him I was wigging out bad and needed company. 

He agreed to come but a deep paranoia had gripped me. Everything he said carried a similar mocking tone, the one I perceived D as speaking to me in earlier. I realized that I must be imagining it, but this led me to wonder what else I was imagining. Maybe I was imagining this phone call. I got up from the couch. Moving around was still difficult but I was desperate to get a grip on reality. Still on the phone with my friend, trying to make casual conversation and seem like my normal self again, I paced around the house. 

I insisted that my friend stay on the phone with me, consumed with the idea that if I hung up the phone, it would be revealed that it was all in my head, that I never called anyone, that I was alone and fucked up forever. I kept obsessively asking him where he was. Very familiar with the route between his town and mine, I checked his information against the time. I was suspicious that he was still at home, in his bed, just laughing at me.

He suggested that I drink some water. There was a glass sitting on the table that I had poured for myself hours ago. I sat down in front of it and stared at it the way a chess grandmaster stares at his chessboard, contemplating his next move. Drinking water seemed like a monumental and impossible task. For some reason the idea of drinking water frightened me. I reached out and touched the glass, but I never got farther than that, choosing to get up and walk away instead.

I still find it odd how I continued to be afraid of drinking the water. I kept going back and forth between determination to do 'normal' things, and exercising willpower, and wanting to just stop giving a fuck. But I was worried that I was brain damaged somehow, that I'd done something very wrong, that my relationship with AJ would be ruined and he would be devastated. A part of me was very aware that these were somewhat valid emotions and I couldn't help feeling them as intensely real because of the drug. After all, earlier in the evening I had experienced pure joy in a similar manner. This was of course, much less tolerable.

My friend had apparently gotten lost on the way, taken a wrong highway exit, and wanted to get off the phone so he could use his GPS. I was utterly convinced that this was some kind of trick. I still was not sure I hadn't dreamed up this entire phone conversation. I 'knew' that if I hung up I would wake up from some stupor having not called anyone at all, still alone, still psychotic. I begged with him, practically crying, to stay on the line.

Thankfully blessed with a very good sense of direction and knowledge of local geography, I was able to navigate him to the house. I had opened the front door at some point, to get some fresh air. The door opened to a semi closed off porch, so I couldn't really see the street from inside the house. He told me that he had arrived and was parking. I could hear the sound of an engine running outside, and then a car door opening and closing. A sense of relief like no other washed over me. The room seemed brighter, I was smiling.

'See you in a second,' I said, and hung up the phone.

Black.

Silent.

Grey clouds filled my vision, and everything looked like a typical haunted house. 'No! No! No!' I screamed inside my head. How could I be so stupid as to hang up the phone? But no, hanging up the phone did not suddenly cause him to blip out of existence. He was never there. My consciousness had given me hope, built up over the course of an hour (which felt like eternity on Acid Time), just to take it away. To punish me. I needed to be punished because I am a bad person who lies and and is lazy and hypocritical.

Some part of me still knew that everything that was happening was just being created by my own mind, and that I clearly had some fucking issues with self esteem I needed to sort out. I just needed to wait for the drug to wear off. This didn't really calm me much though, because minutes felt like hours, and I had, by my estimation, at least 4 more hours of this to endure completely alone.

I started to cry. And then...I heard something. Footsteps.

J had arrived after all. Only seconds had passed, my mind slowed them down to an eternity of agony. But there he was, his usual goofy self. We sat on the couch together and I tried to explain everything that had been happening. Quite poorly, I imagine. I still felt as if everything he said was dripping with sarcasm, derision, and disgust. This actually comforted me somewhat because I figured this was me projecting my insecurities in a very extreme way because of how the drug was making me feel emotions. I just kept telling myself he was talking normally and I was reading this tone into it.

What ended up saving me, because I was still paranoid that none of this was actually happening, but that I was making up my own personal hell because I felt like I deserved it, was watching a youtube video. J and I are both fans of this one movie review channel, where they do reviews that are about an hour long. One had just been released the day before and I watched it then. At least, I started watching it, but got distracted and did other things while it played in the background.

Seeing the familiar first 15 minutes of that video, followed by snippets of of the vaguely familiar and snippets of the unknown, was immensely reassuring to me. I felt that there was no way I could keep up hallucinating this entire video with such accuracy. It had to be real. J was really there, I was really fine, I wasn't eternally in my own personal hell. 

When the sun came up about an hour and a half later, J decided to go home, because he had other obligations. I was coming down, and watching the sunrise was like being fucking reborn. Alone in the house as it filled with light, I settled into a chair and felt extremely satisfied with myself, like I had just exorcised a demon from me. I took a selfie. My hair was disheveled and my pupils were dilated. I sent it to my best friend with the caption 'Dragon Slayer'.

And I really felt that way. I reflected on everything that I had felt and thought over the past several hours, and it all made profound sense to me. I vowed to love myself a little more, doubt myself a little less, and to appreciate the people I care about. None of the paranoia or bad feelings persisted. I vowed to love myself a little more, doubt myself a little less, and to appreciate the people I care about. None of the paranoia or bad feelings persisted. They were part of me that were always there, and I looked at them in a microscope for a while, and accepted them.

I ended up talking to my dad that morning. We have a very special bond, but we are not very affectionate. I went disc golfing with him, and it was honestly one of the most beautiful things ever. It was still early morning, everything was covered in dew. It being late spring there was maximum green and flowers everywhere. I was definitely still a little high at that point, feeling familiar feelings of contendedness and a strange good energy. After our game I told my dad I loved him for the first time in probably 20 years. I told him that he was a good father and I hoped he understood how much I appreciate him.

He seemed surprised but happy. I was too. It wasn't until around T+20h that I was confident all the effects of the drug had ended. I did continue to find myself in a somewhat different mindset for the next week or so, though. Very positive, reflective, and accepting.

((SIDE NOTE: When I told AJ about what I had done he FLIPPED HIS SHIT. We almost broke up over it. Apparently my anxieties were somewhat well-founded. He came around eventually and has since tripped himself, afterwards apologizing to me profusely for not trusting my judgement and for being so judgmental himself of a beautiful experience.))

((ADDITIONAL SIDE NOTE: I am assuming that my dosage was around 200ug, not exactly an advisable beginner dose, though not exactly a hero dose either. From my conversations with friends and reading various trip reports online I've found that by and large the level of visuals and dissociation I experienced were more on par with 350+ doses. Like I said in my opening, I don't use drugs of any sort very often. I was raised atheist but have always had a spiritual side to me from a very young age and would wander off into the woods by myself and meditate, often achieving a state of waking dream which I found very enjoyable. 

I also suffer from some moderate mental illness (Bi-Polar Disorder, Body Dysmorphic Disorder), as well as a type of migraine known as kaleidoscopic vision. A lot of the visuals I saw in my trip were actually things I have seen before, completely sober, since long before I ever touched or heard of psychedelics. 

It is my suspicion that because of the way my brain works, I was already very 'primed' for a psychedelic experience. 4 friends of mine have taken similar or higher doses from the same batch and got nowhere near the level I did.))

This is my first LSD experience at an age of 20. No psychedelic experience before. The trip lasted 19 hours. The experience was more of a fun time than inspiring so the report will mostly be about the observed effects. I had no tripsitter as I was worried that I would have to entertain that person during my trip but I also prefer to be alone. 

BACKGROUND: 
This year I decided to try some drugs which, I believed, should be experienced at least once in a lifetime. First one was MDMA which was rather disappointing. The idea of trying psychedelics was already there when I was 17. I decided that I should try salvia maybe if I ever get the chance. This chance never came. 

Only recently I came to the idea of trying LSD when I randomly landed at a video of someone describing his experience which seemed to be really intense. I believed LSD was a party drug (which it can be) and that it wouldn't be interesting but then I got curious and decided to try some. The main reason for taking it was curiosity and fun.

PREPARATION:
The preparation phase went for 1 - 2 weeks. It consisted of reading countless FAQs, information and experiences. I especially researched the potential negative effects. I ordered some L-theanine before the trip because of its promised calming effects against anxiety. I chose a day for the trip where I had no obligations for the following 2 days. I decided that I should take it in nature and had an idea for a location but didn't visit it before. I had a perfect sleep of 9 hours in the night before the trip. No food was eaten before taking the tab. 

MINDSET & SETTING: 
I had no big expectation from the trip. I didn't primarily seek enlightenment or life lessons. I am a really introspective person and tend to think alot about life in general. I was also heavily depressed during the last year and I believe I still am but not as bad as before. 

On the day of the trip I was in a neutral state. I decided not to think about the problems in life and simply enjoy the good weather and nature. I had mixed feelings of excitement but also a little anxiety because it was the first time. I arrived at an empty spot in a park at afternoon and couldn't stay there. I have a phobia of flying insects and there were alot of them. I spent an hour trying to find a new spot without people but also without many insects. I remembered a good spot at a lake in a forest which had no flowers at all meaning no bees or wasps. 

The lake had some swimmers but I managed to find a comfortable spot with no people and a beautiful view. I sat there for 20 minutes and took the 220ug tab around 1 PM. I held it under my tongue for 10 minutes and swallowed it. The tab tasted like nothing. 

THE COMEUP: 
I had some anxiety during the first 30 minutes. I was constantly asking myself what will happen now but then I just decided to think about nothing at all and listen to music. After 1 hour I started feeling strange, like my head was becoming really slow and heavy. 30 minutes later I started seeing some visuals. Everything looked like it had a wave effect and the colors started mildly changing every second. I felt great, more euphoric because it simply looked funny and beautiful at the same time. The music became even better. Not long after the visuals became very intense. I noticed my hands shaking intensely. I needed to stare 2 seconds at anything and it would get really strong black outlines. When I looked on my arm it would look like I had black veins because my hair would get strong outlines. What surprised me was that I had no strong hallucinations like seeing something that isn't there.

THE PEAK: 
The sad part about the peak is that I actively kept thinking about not going insane. I lost the sense of time and reality, I still saw the wavy, color changing visuals and my phone screen looked like it was melting. I felt like I am the tree which I was leaning against and my field of view widened. Time felt very slow.

I started to slightly panic because I still thought about the potential negative effects. I believed that my brain could trick me into thinking that I still sit at the same place but in reality I would already be doing something harmful. It felt like I was entering a fake dimension created by my mind. The trip still felt great but sometimes I would be scared when the music had repetitive parts which made me think that time would repeat itself over and over endlessly. I skipped such music parts to confirm that I wasn't going insane. I also did what I called reality checks where I would look left and right, touch a few objects and check if I was still leaning against a tree.    

After an hour I was surprised by some swimmers and people who passed by or just wanted to take a swim. I honestly didn't expect to see anyone because it was the worst place to take a swim. My trip became worse because I thought that these people would know I'm tripping but at the same time they were an indicator that everything is still real and happening. I realized that I was not a tree. I had some really weird stare moments and at one moment a person waved at me for no reason and I just waved back. At that point it became all too confusing and I decided to go home. 

GETTING BACK HOME AND THE REST OF THE TRIP: 
I felt like I was capable of going back home and I had to take public transport. I focused as much as possible on being careful but luckily there was no potentially dangerous traffic. It felt like the train would never arrive though. I didn't feel anxious around people and made it home safely. For 10 hours I would sit on my couch and listen to music. It was the best part of my trip. 

I felt happy and comfortable. The music was amazing. I liked to imagine some juicy fruits and splashing colors or fresh juice when I listened to a certain type of positive energetic music and I couldn't stop listening to that type. It felt amazing. At the same time the colors would change perfectly to my mood. Seriously I would've wanted to take a screenshot because the colors worked like a perfect photo filter. The wall had interesting patterns. Sometimes I would see cartoon figures, not really with my eye but with my mind. 

Eating was weird. I had ordered a pizza and only ate half of it. I felt bad afterwards and forced myself to eat it when it was cold already. I kept feeling sorry for my body. I saw the part of the brain responsible for survival instincts as an individual which had to struggle throughout the trip while my other part of the brain would be a childish individual trying to have fun and not knowing the consequences and I kept apologizing to the survival brain. 

Bathroom visits were also weird. When taking a piss I would see a mild hallucination of a big ocean wave and when looking into the mirror I would see myself as another person sometimes and judge accordingly. My face was slightly changing the shape and my pupils were pulsating. It all wasn't too bad though. 

I had a few moments during the trip where I would see a figure repetitively every few minutes or think about a word that doesn't exist. I believed that the figure had some kind of meaning and that I would find out later in the trip with a big life lesson. Sadly that wasn't the case. 

I had a repetitive thought, I kept asking myself: What if this all isn't real? What if I'm still sitting at that lake and it's already night time while my brain creates this illusion of me being in my safe place. It was a scary thought. I asked myself if I would wake up from my trip after death in the fake realm. I refused to believe it and found the thought way too crazy.

THE COMEDOWN: 
Around 2am I felt the effects getting weaker. I believed this was the time to go to sleep but I just couldn't. I decided to watch the 5th element movie which was funny as hell. I became heavily frustrated at 4am because I still couldn't sleep. So I just sat there for 4 hours, reading more experiences, trying to fall asleep a few more times, watching videos and thinking about the trip. It was the worst but probably most inspiring part of the trip. At 8am I tried to sleep and managed to fall asleep at 9am for 3 hours. It didn't feel like sleep but I also didn't feel tired after.

THE DAY AFTER: 
I felt wonderful, like I had found energy for life again. I relaxed a little bit. I was invited to a party for that day. We had some weed and I wasn't sure if I should take it. I decided to take a few hits and it felt much stronger to the point where I became anxious. I saw some light visuals again. I wasn't drunk at all, only had 2 beers. I left earlier because I was falling asleep at the party.

CONCLUSION: 
I must say, I probably had the best feeling of my life during the trip. Even if the comedown was unpleasant it will be an experience I will never forget. Sadly I haven't had many inspiring thoughts and I believe it was because I worried about having a bad trip too much during the peak. I believe that I may have to wait a few years before actually being able to think about life properly during a trip but I sure can't wait for it.

So some background. I've done most drugs, it's almost easier to name the once I haven't at least tried once, having had significant experience with marijuana, 'spice', LSD, DMT, oxycodone, heroin, and Adderall. At any rate I used to smoke weed and trip and things were fine, then at some point I transitioned into opiates, long story short, got arrested, went to jail.

I got out about a month ago, and have struggled since to stay on the 'right' path. I'm 23 years old, no degree, back at my parent's house, no job. I've drank on a few occasions, smoked a pot, and even shot dope a few times, feeling relatively hopeless in the process. 

An old friend from middle school ended up moving like five doors down from me. When I went over to hang out with him, the topic of tripping came up, as when he took out his weed there was a few hits of DMT and molly inside the jar. Asking him if he could connect me with somebody who had it, he gladly put me in contact with a person in Philly called J.

Now, my cousin T; we've always been close, like brothers. I turned him on to pot back in high school and got him drunk his first time. Altho he does not use drugs to the extent that I do, he does enjoy them. Being an intelligent person, I've always thought that he would benefit from and enjoy tripping. When the subject came up, it turns out that just as I always wanted to trip with him but never wanted to ask because I didn't want to push it on him, he always wanted me to ask because he wanted to try it.

Yesterday, he picks me up and we drive an hour into Philly to meet this J person. The commute was a hassle. J was very nice, altho talked foreeeever; with that said, I really do respect that she gave ' the talk' about tripping responsibly. I really do respect that she gave ' the talk' about tripping responsibly. Even tho I am a seasoned tripper, knowing that she cares is cool.

Anyway we get back to my place and T has to go to work, so I hold onto the tabs. Looking at them, I want to just microdose a bit...the logic behind this was to get a feel for the vibe of my current house, which I have never tripped in but did a lot of dope in. Thus I had some background fears that this would create a negative vibe. At a little before 6pm, I eat like 1/3 of a tab, followed by another little tear a few minutes later to total roughly half a hit. J said that these tabs were measured out at 130-140 ug. I've never gotten even an estimate on the potency of hits I've had. 

My mom came home from work at 6 as usual, typically she comes home only for a little bit and then goes to her boyfriend's house leaving me with the house to herself. This was not one of those nights. She made spaghetti as I started coming up. 

Within 30-40 minutes I began to feel a therapeutic expansiveness. With my issues of unemployment, parole, problems with my sister and dad, depression issues, I felt the need to explore these issues and began thinking out loud with my mom present. I have a very close relationship with my mom and do not have the most conventional mindframe to begin with, so this was not entirely unusual to have this level of conversation with her. Tho I struggled to find 'THE' solution to all of life's problems, I found myself able to tackle the smaller things, like how I should call my sister or apply for more jobs tomorrow. Seems mundane, but the way I arrived at it felt nothing short of profound.

After eating the spaghetti, as 7 oclock (t+1) approached, I decided I'd go for a walk. No matter how many times I trip I always get this sensation as I'm coming up that I can summarize as 'shit, what did I do?' The idea of suddenly tripping balls for the first time in 3  years in front of my mom did not sound very appetizing. Putting on some headphones, I set out on the trail around my neighborhood. And the trip really took off there...

Listening to the American Beauty album of the Grateful Dead, I set off on my journey and as soon as the song started, the flowers and the trees all began vibrating in that manner of animated psychedelia that I had missed for so long. Spotting a green bug on a tree, I stopped in my tracks to watch this weird creature crawl around. A characteristically goofy grin appeared on my face, one that would not part with more for another 5 hours or so. Passing other people on the trail gave me some anxiety as they approached, but deciding to say hi to them continually made me feel good because these people were not expecting me to say hi and it made me feel like a good neighbor. The geese were hilarious, just in the way they moved. 

Then, I started getting the tremors. One of the more annoying effects of LSD. I started getting the tremors. One of the more annoying effects of LSD. Knowing that they're just a part of the drug allowed me to circumvent focusing on this annoying feature, nonetheless it sparks a certain negativity which I confronted rather than avoided and felt better for facing it. In the past, when I sold a lot of drugs, passing cars always sparked paranoia that these were cops or something, and I did feel this a little bit initially as cars went by but then came to the realization that I'm just not that important to be under surveillance. Not in a a bad way tho. Humbling.

Trails started kicking in. Not just little afterimages but I mean like rainbowey trails. Things started to look like they were oozing colors. Cooking, frying, it's hard to describe but everything was doing it. The setting sun cast a beautiful color onto the atmosphere, everything glowed in eternal perfection.

As it started actually getting dark, I realized that I'd have to return home. Checking the clock I found it wasn't even 8pm (t+2) yet, meaning that time distortion had definitely set in. Feeling some anxiety about going home where I knew my mom was, I sat in my backyard for a bit before going. Interacted with her briefly, then took the laptop and a book of MC Escher drawings to my bedroom.

In my room, I listened to the Wish You Were Here album by Pink Floyd. Here I came to peace with my newish house, where I had done all of my heroin, and been a scumbag in general. It's not the cleanest house but this did not bother me. Rather I stared at the ceiling as fantastic images came to the fore. These types of visuals were not omnipresent, just beneath the surface instead. Rather as I zoned out immersed in music I'd begin to see these kaleidoscopic snakes and shapes appear on the white ceiling. Colors flashed from light to dark, vivid to dull, one end of the hue to another. They didn't shift completely but definitely tried to. The music felt so much deeper than before. When I put on the album I felt it almost cliche to listen to Pink Floyd on acid as I've done this a couple times before but it was soooo right. The MC Escher picture book too was amusing when I'd get tired of the ceiling. Mindblowing stuff.

When I went out to smoke a cigarette, about three hours had passed since ingestion. It was now dark outside. Barefoot was the best possible way to go about going outside as my toes felt so good in the cool grass, and the clear sky revealed stars that looked like fireworks frozen just before explosion.

 When I went back inside, I went to my sister's room where one of my cats refuses to leave. Sitting on her bed petting the cat I really started peaking. First, my sister left a few days ago for a friend's house partially citing 'my behavior' as the reason she can't live here. This kind of boggled my mind as the incident which set it off was because I slept on the couch and didn't clean up the food I ate the night before. But sitting on her bed I sank into her shoes, into her mind, my little sister, one room over, for three years watching me do heroin and go to rehab and go to jail...I cried, for a long time, realizing that this wasn't about me sleeping on the couch but a point on a continuum of upset and disappointment. I texted her, and was able to reestablish communication. The drive to improve my life for myself and for my family is still strong in me a day later.

Also, as I stared at the cat, I also lived its life. While I did not specifically think of it as this at the time, I say that I experienced her other eight lives. She was an empress at one point, and another a wise old woman whose wisdom rarely gets spoken anymore let alone passed on. At my old house this cat used to roam around the yard but now refuses to leave my sister's room and just stares out the window. I could practically read her thoughts from her eyes and saw all these perspectives that she used to have.

Altho acid is innately visual after a certain dose, at this point of the trip, at least to me, the visuals become irrelevant. When it first starts kicking in it's like cool, trails, patterns, etc, but after 3 or 4 hours at the peak, the visuals are old news. They're incredibly awesome, don't get me wrong, but they're there...it's the mental exploration that I'm in it for. Visualizing my problems as if translucent geometric shapes in space, I burst thru them all as I logically overcame a lot of issues. Dark Side of the Moon was awesome, then I ate an apple that was tiiiiight. Best apple ever. And perfect because I was hungry but didn't realize it, as tripping tends to do this. 

Mucus production increases dramatically at least for me during trips Mucus production increases dramatically at least for me during trips, so I started getting these globs in the back of my throat. My mom came to talk to me, mid-peak, but I was able to handle that nicely and calmly. She didn't suspect a thing. At this point, t+4 or t+5, the effects begin to dwindle slightly. I'm texting my cousin and a friend in San Diego, and at this point wish I dosed with someone else. Altho in all fairness, I had no idea I'd actually trip I assumed I'd just feel a buzz. The euphoria was something so strong, I had more than enough of it: I wanted to share it. With my friends. With my cousin. With everyone. I remember texting J and saying 'Get as much of this stuff as you can and stockpile it as if there's a nuclear war coming. Then when there is a nuclear war, dose all the survivors so that there's never a nuclear war again.' I get like that when and after tripping sometimes, where suddenly it seems to be the solution to all of the world's problems. Tho not as naive as I was in high school when I thought everyone everywhere should eat acid, I do still hold true the belief that it can change the world for the better when used positively.

Between the 5th and 6th hour the effects faded rapidly, mentally anyway, to where by hour six I felt essentially back to baseline mentally, with the periodic resurgences in intensity that acid does, in its wave-like manner. The visuals dulled down to between 1/3 to 2/3 of peak intensity at any given time for the rest of the night. Tho as I said, at this point the visuals just kind of happen. Brighter colors, shiftiness of objects, etc. I watched Family Guy until maybe 5am, t+11 hrs, wide awake until out of the blue I fell asleep.

This experience was overwhelmingly positive for me. I haven't had a spiritual checkup in ages, which is exactly what acid supplies for me. You may take it to get fucked up, and you will get fucked up. When used for the right purposes tho this is a beautiful chemical. I only wish that I was able to share the experience and euphoria with others, at least one other. But soon I will trip with my cousin and do just that. And oh boy, I can't wait to see what a whole tab does!!

Preface: I am normally a pretty grounded person and perhaps thats what caused me to hold back from letting the effects sink in. I wanted to trip because I really missed the nostalgia of the headspace and visuals I get when on a psychedelic. I went in with goals of feeling more in tune with my own families and psyche. I was with two friends, we will call them Ned and Arnold. Me and Arnold are friends since primary school so I decided to trip with him, as we had not yet done so together. We go to Neds place and play some PS3 until we decide to drop. 

The Drop: We take the tabs, mine was 155mcg with perforated edges, Arnolds was 100mcg with clean cut edges. My friend asked how we were on psychedelics, and I joking said I get a little psychotic- if only I had known. We play one more match on the ps3 and go downstairs. We go in this recreation room with this semi-finished puzzle on a table. 

The Come Up: Theres this giddiness that builds up as Im sitting in the rec room, and Arnold notes the same thing, I also notice this painting on the wall looks sort of popping out like a 3D screen. After we begin to feel more and more giddy we decide to go outside to the beach and walk around. At this point, the visuals are coming on stronger and it makes the sand look like the grains are dancing in a harmony along with the wind. We walk over to this storm drain, and mind that it was a cloudy dark day and as a matter a fact about to rain, so looking at the nasty polluted-looking storm drain kind of set me off in a bad headspace about where mother nature was headed. I definitely think the shitty weather and the fact that we were in a rather urban area of the beachside, had already set me off in a negative headspace. I definitely think the shitty weather and the fact that we were in a rather urban area of the beachside, had already set me off in a negative headspace. This was particularly frustrating because as any tripper knows, indoors is not a very comfortable environment to be in during a psychedelic experience. 

The Peak: We are still chilling at the storm drain, but at this point Ned and Arnold are conversing and I was finding it harder and harder to keep track of the conversation and stay coherent. I would start laughing about random thoughts flying through my head and I being a flat out stoner thought of a brilliant idea: to smoke some weed now that Im at the peak. In hindsight it was a good thing I mentioned that because we had to go back to my car to pick up the bud, and in the middle of the way back, huge gusts of wind were hitting us and we saw a heavy rainstorm approaching land from the sea shore, so we hightail it back to Neds and go back to smoke. 

We smoke in this dark ass room with a fan to blow smoke out of, and there was this other compartment at the edge of the room that was dark and everything there seemed to be moving, and same with the ground and the different patterns on the ground. I remember taking only one out of a one hitter, I mostly gave some to Ned as a favor for him trip sitting us. What scared the hell out of me was that I felt this presence and out of the corner of my eye, in that compartment in the corner of the room, I saw the figure of a person, very vague, but he had blue pants a red shirt and seemed to be like porcelain white. I didnt say anything about it and brushed it off. After a while we decide to go back upstairs and play some Fortnite. At this point I was going deep into introspect, I mean just lost in the sauce. And I was thinking jeez its so hard to think or even do anything for that matter. Then I dont know if they were really saying it coincidentally, or if I was going delusional at that point, but it felt like my friends were saying exactly what I was thinking. And it didnt help that Ned was on the phone with our friend Matt who was talking about someone else and saying how all they do was nothing with their lives and the least they could ever do was pick up the phone. For some reason I felt like Matt was talking about me and how all I could do was nothing but lay catatonically while Ned and Arnold play fortnite. 

The Freakout (Mid Trip): At this point, I dont know what happened fully, but I think I began to be scared that since they were saying exactly what I was thinking that life must just be some sort of illusion and for that reason none of my actions mattered. I began to be scared that since they were saying exactly what I was thinking that life must just be some sort of illusion and for that reason none of my actions mattered. I would have these thought loops that whats stopping me from doing nothing and everything at the same time, and just really paradoxical thinking. I was also really scared that life was just an illusion that concocted with its own history serving as an illusory backstory to keep me fooled and that my friends were my watchers and were like oh shit he knows  none of this is real, were gonna have to put him down. In reality they were like oh shit hes tripping hard and hes freaking out, and they tried to put some benzos in this bottled water so I can calm down. So when they gave me the water, I dont know what I was thinking, I was convinced my friends were just illusions that my mind created as a coping mechanism for being the only sentient thing in the universe. I mean really deep delusional shit. I grabbed the water bottle and let all of the water spill out, which my friends were hoping I wouldnt do because that water had 2mg of klonopin dissolved in it to calm me down. They kept telling me to take a benzo to calm me down. I was thinking since the illusion  is broken the damn benzos [don't] work on me anymore lol. In a way the whole illusion theory I had made me come to the conclusion that I was some sort of god, but I was scared of this and I rejected the idea, I felt like it would be a lonely principle to be a god. Because I would be the only one of my kind and would fear that my creations and companions would not have the same level of consciousness and sentience as myself. 

Also at this point I was scared because I felt like I was gonna be punished for breaking the illusion and felt like I was gonna be transported into another body, another life, another illusion I wouldnt be aware of. Apparently I kept saying what? No way! I think that was me reacting to these delusions telling me  that I was god, and what didnt help was Ned twitching his foot because it made me feel like I was going even crazier, like I felt like Ned twitching his foot was the illusion of reality glitching out due to me being aware it was all an illusion. I continued to go through this thought loop that I was god, and I was just so tired of it. I continued to go through this thought loop that I was god, and I was just so tired of it. By the time Arnold had convinced me to finally take a benzo, my other friend Andre arrived, and that helped calm me down too. By that point I was calmed down by the benzo but still convinced that I was god and I created everything and I was just talking about how impressed I was at how I got everything down to the particle. Apparently I went on a lot about fractals, Niel Degrasse Tyson and quantum particles. My friend Andre, just going along with it at that point joked around saying Im glad you got it down to the particle, and some would say youre a rocket scientist. And that really made it feel like they were also aware that reality was just my own concoction. So despite the benzos calming me down, I still had this Im god headspace about me for another hour. After a while I go upstairs and take another benzo and call my mom, because during that experience I was worried Id never see my family again.

The Comedown and After Thoughts: After an hour or so, the 4mg of klonopin really killed the psychedelic headspace and I asked my friend if he could do me the favor of driving me home. At that point I just wanted to be with my family and call it a day. By this point also I was back in tune with everything and was glad and humbled that I wasnt a god. Because that would be a hard and lonely job. I was glad that I wasnt just in a world that was a figment of my imagination because I learned that would also be lonely as fuck, and I think thats why during the trip I was grabbing at my friends hoping that their reactions were real and genuine. 

I am glad for one thought, and thats how much I care about my family. Because that experience made me really miss them a lot and want to reconnect with all of them, because I feared that I would never see them again. Im glad I went through this experience despite how challenging it was, because it both humbled me and renewed my appreciation for the ones I love. Perhaps it was the scariest trip Ive had, but it may also be the most enlightening.

Background: Prior to this experience I had been with Betty-Sue and known Joe and Sarah (another couple) several months. We had taken E a few times together and shrooms twice, but I never had a good (or strong) trip before this. I had read a lot on psychedelics in general, and was most impressed by Stanislav Grof's writings at the time. 

T-7:00/ 10:00 AM- Shortly after waking up, I find out from Joe we're taking acid today. How exciting! I'm nervous, so I read, my book at this time being Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon. Lots of interesting, trippy themes. 

T-0:00/ 5:00 PM- Out comes the acid, and we dose. We all (Joe and Sarah, Betty-Sue and I) get a sugar cube with a strong hit on it, and Joe and Sarah each take an additional tab of blotter. Joe and Sarah leave to get some marijuana, and Betty and 
I sit around reading with some music on. I feel antsy but manage to focus my attention on my reading and just about forget the strange, strange chemical I just ingested.

T+1:00 - I get up to go to the bathroom and by the time I get there I am feeling a little trippy. The night light in the bathroom is moving away from the wall and back. My reading back at the couch is a touch slower than normal, but my comprehension feels improved somehow. I feel serene.

T+1:30 - Joe and Sarah burst into the apartment in a wave of excitement, bearing nitrous oxide chargers and some fine quality marijuana. They love them some acid, and the feeling is contagious. I am definitely enjoying myself, and feel ++ after partaking in a bowl and a whipit. As I come down from the nitrous, I remark that I feel like Moses. Before long, my first negative thought creeps in- that we, as humans, experience only an infinitesimally small spectrum of the universe. I recognize the negativity building and with minimal effort steer myself to cheerier subjects, something I could never do on mushrooms. I recognize the negativity building and with minimal effort steer myself to cheerier subjects, something I could never do on mushrooms. The visuals are subtle and geometric- simple pattern seeking and tessellation on the walls, and everything breathes a little bit. I am not wearing my contacts and cannot see very far with any precision. I feel a definite sense of buddhist detachment, also unlike my previous experiences with mushrooms. I also happen to feel very close to Betty. Any timestamp after this point is my best guess.

T+2:30 - The apartment is beginning to get too intense, so we head out to the nearby park. My depth perception is off, and manhole covers seem to rise two feet out of the ground. The grass is made of spinning fractals, and I see the neighborhood we are walking through as a personality, though my head is remarkably clear. 

T+2:45 - As we cross the last street to the park, the acid shifts to the next higher gear. Walking anywhere seems to take an interminable amount of time as we circle the park, which seems to be bigger than normal, not to mention more beautiful. The water tower is painted with giant brown spots in such a way that it looks like it is pushing up out of the earth, its skin being stretched out from the ground. We all lay out under a tree in what I imagine is typical hippie fashion. Betty and I lay straight on the ground. There are burrs and ants, but I don't really mind. Visuals are beginning to overcome my sight, and the fractal branches of the tree above me are whirling. I have some closed eye visuals, but they seem to lack any real meaning or importance so I dismiss them.

T+3:00 - 'The question is one of identity.' And so it begins. I turn my attention inwards, through senses that stretch all the way through infinity and back. I let the tessellated spirals of tree above me, Betty's weight on me, and the various tactile sensations of the grass wash over me in a detached way. Utter calm and lysergic bliss. So this is what it is.

T+3:30 - The sun is setting, and the MEANING is starting to set in as well. Random words and sentence fragments from the sparse conversation are the capstones to immense and significant arcs of thought that I pursue one by one. Random words and sentence fragments from the sparse conversation are the capstones to immense and significant arcs of thought that I pursue one by one. Betty points out the setting sun. 'Can't you see it?' The sun is the genesis of truth and beauty, and I feel silly for not seeing it before. Betty has a golden glow over her skin, and her face is clear and perfect, though it is hard to see clearly. I think she has two mouths, and I say so, immediately realizing my double entendre (sexual overtones) as everyone laughs. At this point I begin to become aware of the infinite recursion of thoughts, feelings and emotions. Any thought can exist on its own, stretching off into an infinite meaning. Eyes Open and Eyes Closed are pretty much the same now. Around this time, I become the archetypical man, Betty the archetypical woman. In this Garden of Eden space or non-space we have, we exist in a perfect fullness of love. I hear Joe remark of my condition, 'It's like a child learning to run' or something similar. I had forgotten about our friends! They must be a part of this understanding too! My perception of this state widens a notch, as the concept undergoes another recursion. Human = Us = Love = I =???

Betty is now asking me the most important question: Am I (we) god? I cannot bear to hold the concept, and shy away from answering. Each time I stand on the threshold of the thought, I back away, and she asks if I love her. I do, and we merge in infinite bliss as we kiss. This happens a few times. I hear a gasp after some time, and it becomes a tremendous release from an emotional barrier. It was Sarah who gasped. 'I just did a WHIPIT' she exclaims. It had been ~2 hours since any of us had so much as seen a whipit. How odd! Shortly thereafter, we all find the ability to stand and move around. 

T+4:30 - Back at the apartment, Betty wants to discuss something heavy with me, but we are unable to get some time alone. In the bathroom she waits for me to finish so she can go, and I apologize for taking so long, and she accepts. Immediately after this exchange I realize that she vocalized the apology and I voiced the acceptance! How exceedingly peculiar! We take more whipits and smoke more cannabis, as I contemplate the Question. I cannot bear to let go of my 22 years. It cannot have been an illusion! The Question then becomes a plea to leave the apartment, and we decide to do so in the middle of a whipit. We burst out, laughing and screaming, wielding a bubble wand and hastily applying shoes, running down the stairs and slamming the door. We walk around the university campus, blowing bubbles and being a little confused. 

T+5:30 - The question of godhood is beginning to lose its meaning and grip over my ego. I drink a little of a pina colada from the corner store, and its taste is perfect communication of pure experience and a flashback to the peak. Communication binds us as one entity!

T+ 6:30 - We are coming down at the apartment. Lounging, smoking, eating very cheap tex-mex food. Remembering and remarking, wandering around aimlessly, trying to read.

T+12:00 - Finally, I drift off to sleep on our poor, deflating air mattress. 

Overall impressions: Acid is awesome. Love, peace, unity. I feel a greater experiential understanding of consciousness in the Buddhist sense.

I have had an EXTREME phobia of centipedes my entire life. I am completely fine with other bugs. And even, if theres a wasp or spider in my room, I will catch it and let it outside. When a centipede crawls across the wall, however, my heart skips, I get very nauseous, and every muscle in my body tightens. Where I live, there are many bugs, and including centipedes, so its common to see one. The phobia has been very negative. If I were to see a centipede in my room, and it would get away before I killed it, I could not sleep in my room, out of fear. I would close my rooms vents in the summer time, since thats where many centipedes come from, but I would be pouring sweat because of it. If I see a centipede, my moral value that its not right to kill an insect, completely ceases to exist, due to the crippling fear they give me. 

Last Saturday, May 17th, I had decided to take some LSD. I've taken LSD more than 50 times, and I am pretty familiar with it, I've never had a serious bad trip it either. There would be the occasional odd sensation that would make my heart skip, but nothing serious. I had bought 3 average strength hits a couple days before, and decided to take them on a day that felt right, and when I was in a good mood (something I usually doI could wait a couple days, or a couple weeks).

I took the three hits around 10:30 PM, in my room, by myself. I do not recommend taking LSD alone. My brother was in the house so I figured if I had a bad trip, I could go to him. Around 11:30 I went outside and smoked a joint, which I find, sort of sets off the trip.  At 11:40 I was walking in, and felt really high on the weed, and I could feel the acid starting. I walked in my room, flung my sandals off, and went to lie down on my couch. At this point I was VERY happy. For a couple hours it was like any trip, I was listening to Daevid Allens Stroking the Tail of the Bird, and far from this world. 

At around 2:00 AM, I was still listening to music staring across my room, when suddenly, a full grown centipede made its way up the wall. Even though I was high on pot, and tripping on acid, my reaction time was swift. I realized right away that it was a centipede, and a big one. At this point, I became really worried that it would trigger a bad trip; I knew I wasn't in any state to go get a vacuum, or smash it with a shoe. I thought about going to another room, but with my brother downstairs I decided to avoid an awkward confrontation. At this point my heart was pounding. I had all the usual symptoms, nausea, racing heart, and tense muscles, but greatly intensified. As I tried to ignore the effects of the LSD, so I could keep an eye on the centipede, they seemed to intensify. The effects of the LSD were like a blindfold, and being in the same room with my worst fear, while wearing a blindfold is very uncomfortable. I felt like I was on a roller coaster, and I wanted to get off. I was tightly gripping the couch cushions, and I felt like screaming. 

As I was staring at the centipede I felt I was being pulled to it, and it looked like it was getting closer. I also felt like I was merging with it, which made me jerk around, as if it was crawling up my leg. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore, and I sort of plopped over onto my side, with my head on the armrest of the couch. I was staring at the centipede still, it would move across the wall a little, and stop, sometimes disappearing behind a book shelf. I began to take deep breaths, and calm myself down. As I stared at it, I remember that there were translucent clouds of colors, originating from the centipede, and moving out like a ripple. I continued staring at the centipede, and all of the sudden a felt a calming wave. I began to see not the centipede, but its being. I had a feeling that the centipede and I, were in some other plane of existence. Not a human and a centipede, but two identical beings. I was completely focused on it, and I felt that it was completely focused on me. It was like we were telepathically connected. I immediately realized what was happening, and I was stunned. It brought me extreme joy, that I had the privilege to have something in my body that could strip away my most intense phobia. It brought me extreme joy, that I had the privilege to have something in my body that could strip away my most intense phobia. I began to deeply think about the centipede, and its life. I thought about all the centipedes I've smashed or vacuumed up. They come to my room, and see it as a warm, dry, paradise, only to be killed. I thought, in my whole life, a centipede has never attacked me, and would actually run away from me. By the time I started to focus in on my surroundings again, the centipede was gone. Knowing that there was a centipede somewhere in my room, out of view, didn't bother me one bit. Once again, I was amazed at the capabilities of LSD. The rest of the trip went well. I watched 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas', and 'Alice in Wonderland', and honestly didn't think on bit about the centipede.

I was up the whole night, and the next morning I went down to eat breakfast. I went outside with a cup of coffee and sat in my hammock. I had the usual post-LSD glowing, refreshing feeling. I thought about everything that had happened the previous night, and I was still shocked at what happened. A couple days later, I was watching TV late, around 2:30 AM, when I saw a small centipede crawl into view. At first, the movement had startled me, but when I saw it, I remembered everything from my trip. Amazingly I didn't feel nauseous, or stiff. I could ignore it, and go back to watching TV. I soon went to bed, and as I was falling asleep, I felt really good, and had the sort of feeling I would get from doing charitable work. The same exact thing happened last night too.

This experience has made me even more amazed with the power of LSD. I had always heard about how it can stop alcoholism, and help solve problems in peoples lives, but never have I heard of it instantly destroying a phobia. My idea is, the LSD forced me to face my fear of centipedes, except it, and then see the centipede in a totally different way, and that stayed with me.

My Most Noteworthy LSD Trip

This is the true story, of a most harrowing and roller coaster-like trip on LSD, taken by me and two friends back in 1993. There 
Was my white friend Drew, whose house we were at during the trip, and my black friend Brandon, who supplied the LSD. We dosed at about 9:00 PM.

Dosage: Now this part is interesting, and to this day I'm still not sure exactly how much LSD was taken by me, and here is the reason.. Brandon asked me if I wanted to 'dose', and I said excitedly, 'I sure do!'. So he took a sheet of white blotter LSD out of his pocket and then out of some cigarette cellophane. He wanted to have circle shaped tabs of acid, so he had taken a paper punch and punched out the circular pieces. What remained was a square piece of paper with a bunch of holes in it. The sheet of acid looked kind of like a 'paper snowflake' that you make by folding up some paper and cutting little pieces out of it, then unfolding the paper. Brandon basically took a huge piece of this 'holey' paper, (about 1/4 of the entire sheet) and told me, 'open your mouth and lift up your tongue' so I did, and in went the acid! It must have been between 500 to 1500 ug, assuming 100 micrograms is the standard for one dose. I am guessing the amount I took was fairly high, because at the time of this trip I was already an experienced user, having tripped about 7 other times before, but never reaching the kind of intense clarity and distortion that was about to unfold in my mind.

The trip begins: 
About 45 minutes after eating this rather Large 'wad' of white blotter paper, I started to feel something. It was an excited feeling, but anxious too, because I knew that I had just ate a lot of acid. Indeed I had, and about 1 hour into the trip I began realizing what I was in for. The room started spinning wildly, and so I sat down on the living room couch downstairs, by myself. I looked across the room at the wallpaper which was a simple diagonal mesh pattern with diamonds in between the lines. The wall seemed to be 'breathing' in and out, which I've heard is a common effect while on LSD, but the wall was moving pretty far in distance as it did this. I began to notice that the pattern of the wallpaper was making some kind of 'noise', and I didn't want to hear it anymore so closed my eyes.

I then stood up off the couch to see if I could walk, and that's when I felt the most terrible pain in my stomach. It hurt SO BADLY, that I couldn't even stand up straight. So I stood hunched over, my body basically forming a 90 degree angle, and I held my stomach in my hands and held on for dear life. I wondered how it was that I could be feeling a large butcher's knife stabbing at me, when there was nothing there! Oh the pain! Would it ever cease? All I wanted to do was stand up like a normal person! So, I kept fighting to right myself up, thinking that if I just kept stretching slowly, I could stand all the way up again. Whatever the case may have been, I would soon discover that this was VERY GOOD acid.

90 minutes into the trip: My friend Drew, whose house I was at, came downstairs crying. He was beginning to trip too, in fact all three of us were starting to trip pretty hard. He said that he had just gotten off the phone with his girlfriend and they had a huge fight. So, he was going to drive his car into the suburbs of Chicago, to her house, by himself (and tripping on acid!), a 45 
minute trip, one way! I wished him good luck, and off he went. [Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

With Drew gone, I thought that I would wander upstairs to his bedroom and see what Brandon was up to. He was playing video games and so I sat down on the couch behind him to watch. The game was Wipeout XL for the original Playstation One. Wipeout XL is a spaceship racing game that has amazing, colorful, tunnel like tracks, That the space ships speed down culminating in an incredible 3-D effect. It's a very trippy game, even when you're not on drugs. When I closed my eyes, I could still see the screen, as if my eyes were still open! Closing my eyes caused me to 'become' the Spaceship. I became very content to lay back in the couch with my eyes closed and 'see' myself speeding down this futuristic race track. The music of Wipeout XL was cutting edge electronica from major techno artists like The Prodigy, Chemical Brothers, and my all time favorite tripping song by CoLD SToRAGE called 'Canada'. The music was just so intense, and it complimented perfectly as I 
hovered down the race tracks in my mind, at blinding speeds! This was so much fun, and it went on for about an hour.

 2 hours 30 minutes in: Brandon finally noticed me, sitting on the couch behind him, and he got in my face. He was smiling wide and his teeth were so white compared to his skin, they seemed to be glowing. But all was not well, I believed that I had called him a 'n-word', and that must be why he was getting in my face and being so excited. Brandon was saying, 'You called me a n-word! What do you mean man? How could you call me that? Oh man you're in big trouble! How could you do it, oh... How could you!?'

I was so frightened that in my psychedelic haze, I had accidentally let it slip out and called my friend the n-word! This was disastrous! I felt all of these strangely amplified emotions slapping my body, as if I was walking through an automated car wash and being hit by the spinning cloth brushes. Then I opened my eyes, and Brandon was still sitting in the same place playing his video game. None of it had really happened! My eyes had been closed the entire time! I had never called him a 
name, and he had never gotten in my face! It was all just a dream! My mind was simply dealing with the complex emotions and issues of racism, and I had just had an LSD-induced waking dream with my eyes closed! I sat there stunned for the next 30 minutes, really not wanting to close my eyes anymore.

4 hours after dosing: I went downstairs to find that Drew had gotten home from his adventure. He was tripping real hard, and told me that the cops had pulled him over, but because he was crying so much they didn't notice he was tripping. He told me that it was almost impossible to drive, that all the street lights were creating these long trails and everything was so blurry. He said that dealing with his girlfriend was really hard, and that her emotions were very strange to him, while on acid. I congratulated him on surviving the police encounter and his girlfriend, then we went upstairs into his bedroom, and smoked some marijuana with Brandon.

Around this time, Brandon completely disappeared, and I never saw him again for the duration of the trip. I have no idea where he went, and he was nowhere to be found the next morning.

4 hours 30 minutes in: Drew began playing video games on the Playstation and I was becoming fascinated with his electronic Casio piano keyboard. We were both in his bedroom just doing our tripped out thing. As I played the Casio piano, I realized that I was a virtuoso. I knew entire symphonies and could play them with ease. The Casio sounded so much like a real piano, and I was in heaven, composing music for what seemed like an eternity.

After jamming on the piano for about 30 minutes, I noticed that something was amiss. Upon further inspection, I realized that there were no batteries in the keyboard! And then it hit me! I came to the realization that the LSD had unlocked a part of my mind that had powers to know the exact pitch of every key of the piano! As I pressed the keys, my mind would recreate the correct tone at a volume that was so loud it seemed to be coming from the Casio! I had been fooled for half an hour by this neat illusion. My friend Drew asked me what the hell I was doing. I shared the revelation with him and thought he would be excited too, but he just thought I was being loony, and continued playing his video games.

5 hours in: Peaking very hard still, I was exhausted from playing the piano, so I sat down on the couch in Drew's room and began smoking a cigarette. I closed my eyes. I saw nothing but darkness and yet there was some sort of pattern to the blackness, as if there were spider's threads running horizontally and vertically everywhere, but it was barely noticeable. I was floating in this gentle 'fabric' and I was in DEEP space. I mean I was doing some kind of HEAVY astral travelling. I was FAR, FAR away, from planet Earth, and I could feel God speaking to me. I was FAR, FAR away, from planet Earth, and I could feel God speaking to me. I didn't hear words, but rather felt them, and God told me that everything was LOVE. There was nothing else, just love and perfection. I felt loved by God and the universe, and He revealed all the secrets of the universe to me. All I had to do was float there and become wise and all knowing. All conflict that had ever existed in me or outside of me just melted away, and I was a super-being of pure consciousness, and my body disintegrated into the ether.

Then I awoke to find the room full of smoke. LOTS of smoke. I could barely see to the other side of the room. I could barely 
Breathe and my eyes were burning! In my deep, astral-travelling bliss, I had inadvertently dropped my cigarette into Drew's clothes hamper. It had been smoldering for quite some time. Drew was screaming at me telling me to wake up, there was a fire! I had started it! The house was on fire at 2:00 o'clock in the morning, we were tripping hard on acid, and it was ALL MY FAULT! As we were trying to figure out what to do next, and making a lot of noise, Drew's mother opened the door and walked in. She gave us both a funny look and said, 'Put the fire out and try not to make so much noise' and then she went back to bed.

Well I had quite a reaction to this fire, my eyes were open but I could see nothing in the room, instead a strange little movie was playing inside my head. All I could see was the planet Earth floating in the blackness, and there was one giant house sitting on top of the planet, it was Drew's house, and it was on fire. I was floating rapidly away from the Earth just looking at Drew's house burning there and it was the end of the world. And I was very sad.

But everything turned out OK in the end, and that was basically the end of the trip. We got some sleep after that and in the 
morning I went home. That was the last time I ever took LSD.

It was the end of winter, sometime in late February (not sure of actual day).  I had been on a fairly decent abstinence of psychedelics; almost 2 years, when I was invited to sample some 'green pyramids' to celebrate the birthday of someone near and dear.  I quickly accepted, looking for one last experience before jumping headlong into life (i.e. marriage, children, responsibility).

My set was great, attitude adjusted, I was ready to go.  We (good friend, one brother and me) had dropped 2 hits apiece around 6pm.  Within 1/2 an hour, all we had to do was look at each other to know it was time to get moving.  We bundled up (can't believe how heavy my coat is!) and went outside.  The air was so crisp and clear and clean that I could feel it, but not as an indication of cold.  Rather enlightening at the time.  We walked for about an hour(?) to a nearby park.  

I have been to this park a million times in my life...and it has never presented to me as being as VAST as it was tonight.  The area of expanse was overwhelming to me, I could not comprehend how vast a space this was.  I was compelled to discuss this with my companions, but they were totally enthralled with a stand of weeping willow trees that, on first glance seemed to have the appearance of a fountain, with the branches extending upward slightly, then spilling down to the ground.  At this point I'm thinking (saying?) 'this is gonna be fun tonight!'  We're about 3 hrs into it now.

We actually make a group decision (a miracle!) to cut through the park ad head to another friend's house where a small gathering of other friends was taking place.  The walk through the park was of an indeterminate time frame (remember...it is vast!) when we finally reached the house.  I'm rocking at this point, still climbing.  I go to knock on the basement door and watch my hand get engulfed by the wood fibers of the door, but it's soft!!??!!  I turn to my fellows and mention that 'I hope they can hear me knocking in there because this door is so damn soft it's eating my hand.'  As soon as I turn around, a friend of mine opens the door and extends us an offer to come in.  She was smiling at us...she knew, right away, of what was afoot.

This is where it really gets intense (in a good way).  Sophia, the friend that opened the door, runs a hair salon out of her basement.  There are lots of mirrors and haircutting apparutus filling this space...what a treat!!  I immediately became fascinated with the old-time 1950s hairdryers she had positioned above each chair (you know the kind...looks like a helmet), I sat in a chair and pulled on of these things down over my head and staring looking up into it, each hole in this thing was flowing with color, nothing tangible, just color, lots and lots of colors.  Hues of blue and red, purple and orange that I had never seen before.  Intense visuals!  I tried to explain to Sophia, she just looked at me, laughed and told me to enjoy all the sights, she would stay close. I continued to explore the combs, brushes, powders and sprays (smells good).  Too much fun...

I was offered a beer, it was ice cold and complemented the 'trip taste' I had in my mouth perfectly. I was offered a beer, it was ice cold and complemented the 'trip taste' I had in my mouth perfectly.  The group that was already at the house before we arrived started to watch Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' on video.  I settled in to watch with the others and was instantly transfixed by the music (they were piping it through speakers) and the images on the screen.  As the movie continued to play I found that I was feeling the music, physically feeling it.  This was overwhelming!!  I tried to explain to the others I had dropped with, but they were off on their own tangent.  

Time was warped in a big way at this point (+6:00).  I decided I needed to go to the bathroom, so I got up and drifted across the room (am I invisible?) without disrupting anybody.  As usual (for me anyway) the routine of evacuation of bodily fluids is always interesting.  I make my way back to my seat, Sophia comes over and asks me what took me so long.  I had no clue what she was talking about, I thought I was in and out of the bathroom in about 3 minutes.  She proceeded to tell me I was in there for 50 minutes!!  I couldn't even tell her what I was doing, I had no clue.  She took my hand, led me up to the kitchen and gave me another beer.  We spoke about what I was experiencing, the intensity, the visuals, the 'out-of bodiness' feeling.  I tried as best as I could to bring her there since she was experienced, but I was having difficulty communicating.  She led me to the couch to sit for a while, she was always so good to trip with or have around when tripping, and she just started touching me, not in a sexual way but in a gentle way.  The way it felt made my head swim in acceptance.  It was such a positive, friendly, thoughtful experience to sit with her at that moment in time.  

That moment is gone, has been for a long time, but it is one of the fondest memories I have in my life.  I do believe the total experience I had that night was worth the willingness to try one last time before committing to reality.  Peace.

Background: when I was 17, I hitched hiked around Australia and stayed at the infamous Hippie House in Darwin (top of Australia) which was the last outpost of the famous Hippie Trail and it became a temporary home to hundreds of freaks and heads from every part of the world.  Prior to this trip, I had only smoked a bit of cannabis. I will use the language of the time, as we spoke it.

I had only just settled into the Hippie House in McMinn Street and a young slick American head, reeking of patchouli turned up one night and asked me if I wanted to a buy a 4Way Acid microdot to be cut with a razor if I wanted to share. 

I had a great desire to use Acid because I had heard so much about it and felt like a virgin in a whorehouse, without any preparation or forethought I swallowed the tab with a swig of coca cola and thought  how bad can it be? I then went into the kitchen to play chess with my friend Jacque the Frenchman, he was stoned and I told him I had just swallowed a 4Way Trip and asked him what to expect. 

He asked me if I had tripped before, I said no, he looked at me as if to say youre fucked, but laughed it off and told me to relax and enjoy the ride. I started to feel a sense of intense anxiety in the pit of my stomach, so I went outside to get some air. 

When Father Spillane-my childhood parish priest- suddenly appeared in a sharp hallucinatory form, wagging his critical finger at me as I sat on the back steps, I knew I was in for a rough time. I needed to start walking to calm the rising panic that began to well up. I thought if I went to the local shop that would calm me down.

Everyone in the house appeared to be tripping or stoned, so off I set, as the trip gained intensity I began crossing a busy main road, it was around dusk and the world looked very, very strange, the anxiety in my gut and the feeling of an absolute impending doom, struck me half way across the road, I felt the heat of the car lights on my skin and I knew I was going to die.

I looked at the road culvert and planned to run for the safety of the roadside, but the concrete roadside gutter rose up in the air about 15 to 20 feet high as I began to move towards it. My own fear was perfectly projected onto reality, I froze solid in the middle of the road, I could not move, even though some part of me knew these were my own projections the fear was just too strong. 

The heat of the car lights, now car horns were upon me, in my knowledge and acceptance of my horrible but inevitable death, I suddenly remembered (or appeared to remember) how I had died in the distant past, by drowning;  the images of some people pulling my body out of the ocean were as clear as any normal  reality.

As I waited for the first car to slam into my paralyzed body an angel suddenly appeared, grabbing me by the arms and pulling me off the road. It was my friend Wolfgang the young German guy from Berlin. He spoke gently Are you alright? Its alright. Its alright. You freaked out on the road man, not cool, not cool! I suddenly dropped into near normal perception and thanked him for saving my life (which was exactly how it appeared to me).

There were a bunch of us now in various states of mind alteration walking,  ahead of me was  earth mother Sue I had only spoken to her a few times previously, but a strange phenomenon  started to happen, in the distance massive black clouds were building which was normal for the tropical wet season and lightning flashes would occur, after each flash I would feel a buzz of electricity enter my bare feet and tingle through the body.

I asked earth mother Sue if she felt this too,  she said yes,  and immediately we were bonded, each sentence she spoke seemed to hold great wisdom, great insight, in all my life I had never heard such profundity. She told me I was already high and was seeking to be grounded, that was my spirit quest, she however was too much grounded and wanted to get high, always higher, this was her frustration and spirit quest. Looking back she may have been talking complete crap but to me it was the ultimate insightful wisdom.

I started to relax as earth mother Sue talked me down in soothing tones, and suddenly everything was fine, ecstatic in fact. When we got back to the house, loud music was playing it could have been the Moody Blues Knights in White Satin or perhaps Jethro Tull singing Mother Goose from the album Aqualung; whatever it was, it was riveting, penetrating my nervous system with joyous powerful surges, strawberry incense was burning and as I smelt it, it was liquid love, taking me into deeper ecstasy until I couldn't see anything except brilliant white light and the world would come and go in it.

Later someone said that acid was a truth serum, I found that to be the case, because the longer the trip lasted the more I felt isolated and separate form all beings, I thought, this mental construct, summed it totally   The empty hallways of life. 

There was no meaning to be had anywhere, this insight stuck with me and was not depressing but rather in its obvious and irrevocable truth, it was liberating.

Postscript: I never took acid again, it was a once and only experience for me, too harsh and in my case awakened too much 'truth you may say, I like this quote, it stands the test of time: LSD without a doubt, without a shadow of a doubt, whatever else you will say about it, will change completely a persons world view, forever; it will never be the same again, whether the experience was positive or negative- Dr. Ralph Metzler

[Erowid Note: 
A substance(s) in this report might be identified incorrectly. Erowid reviewers question the author's identification of the drug described. Although the report is included in the collection, there are reasons to believe the substance might be something other than the author believed it to be.] 

Let me start off by saying this was for 2nd experience with LSD. I am extremely fond of the drug, and knew alot about most well known psychedelics, and many less well known ones. I had been very interested in LSD in perticular, and seeked it out for over a year before this experience(yes, I know whats your thinking,'You at least found it, and with only a year of search'). 

When I was able to obtain it, my only source was extremely reliable and I feel to be the only person that I have ever heard say that they know app. How much LSD they took. My source obtained blotters and other forms of acid directly from huge European suppliers, so all of my doses were lab tested in places where it is legal to do so. Most doses I had averaged at app 110mcg.

Also, please dont think about my age, age is no indication of maturity, and I had used pot heavily for app 1 year and a half before even learning about any psychedelics, which in itself had brought me into the path of enlightenment. I spent alot of freetime researching chemisty and psychology at the time, and later became more interested in philosophy too.

I bought 10 lsd tablets. 3 of which were Albert Hofmann 100th aniversery blotters(Also refered to as Bicycle Day blotters), 1 Ganesha blotter, 1 random liquid drop that happened to be dropped on thick paper but not blotter, and 5 liquid dropped sour patch kid candies. All contained +/- 110mcg, the one liquid drop or hofmanns being the strongest and the ganesha being the weakest. 

Now to get to the experience. It was New Years Eve. There wasn't much planning but this was when I first started to use psychedelics so I wasn't that mentally prepared for what it really was, and not just what I read about. I was to take 2 Hofmann blotters at app. 8 o clock p.m, Saturday, take a shower and masturbate, trip out all night in my room, and go to sleep in the morning for a few hours before I went to a family cook out.  

Its also important that my first time ever taking lsd was exactly 4 days before, on tuesday night. I had taken the one ganesha blotter and had an uplifting and euphoric experience, but not any sort of psychedelic experience really. More like just taking a stimulant with wierd body sensations and some slight visual and mental differences. I would presume that the blotter had app. 85mcg. In reality, it was just getting high on another substance.

T0.00- Sitting in my room in the dark (hoping to not damage the LSD), I take out my little drug box from the bottom drawer of my dresser, where I keep all drug related items. I set the box on my computer desk and open it to see a few little empty baggies, a small plastic case containing about a gram of 99.8% pure molly, and one bag containing a small piece of tin foil containing small paper squares. I take out the blotters from the bag and foil and set them on my desk. I pick one up and stare at it for a while, thinking about what to expect. I had very little expectations at all, for the entire week since the last experience I couldn't tell if I even had felt anything on tuesday night. I have to note that I had extreme fear at this time. I was seriously pushing myself to eat the blotters. I had much excitement to take them, but I was also very afraid of the outcome. I had no idea what to expect from taking twice the dose I had taken last time, and just under the dosage that was popular in the 60s. I put the blotters on my tounge and immediately notice a stronge bitter taste, which I was warned to avoid. I almost instantly spit out the now clump of wet paper due to panic that it might be ridiculously strong or contain some sort of other substance, but instead I take one of the blotters out of the clump and rip it in half. I watch the ripped piece of wet blotter sitting on my computer desk. I think about whether I am wasting the half of blotter or not by letting it sit in air while the LSD is dissolved in my saliva, and I throw it back in my mouth. I told myself at this point there is no going back, that blotter was already in the situation. After the blotters are officially being chewed and sucked on, I turn my light on and pop call of duty  Modern Warfare 2 in my xbox 360 to pass time while I wait for it to come on. The time is app. 8:30pm. I swallowed the papers about 15 minutes into chewing them. I spent the next hour paying little attention to the online matches I was playing and alot of attention on whether I would be ridiculously fucked up or not. I was really worried, being New Years Eve, that one of my family members, particulary my mother, would walk in on me laying on my bed staring at my ceiling and talking to myself with huge pupils. 

There was also an intense fear of a bad trip, since I had never actually fully tripped on the drug before, I had no idea what to expect, plus the night before had been terrible. I had gotten into a fight with my father which ended up with me and him in tears and me fearing he would commit suicide. I had gone home from his house and the last time I had talked to him was on the phone after he left, in which I told him I was worried about him and was appologizing. This hadn't come up in my mind again untill after I had taken the one drug rumored  to give a person who experienced something like that recently with no resolution the worst fear ever imagined. I have to say during my anticipation, I was extremely worried, and was no longer anticipating a good trip, which made it worse because I kept thinking about how I couldnt change anything that happens in the past.
(Let me note that this was the worst experience of the night, before the drug even took effect.)

T+0:55- I first notice alerts. I had no idea what was going to happen at first, but when it did I definetly noticed. My vision began to flash, like a stobe light. I turned and looked at my wall, which was doing it too. I leaned up from my laying on stomach gaming position and the mind effects suddenly hit me. Everything that I had been thinking about suddenly vanished, it was like the effects of the drug was the only thing that I was focusing on.  That in no way describes what I had experienced at the time. I sat down at my computer desk and looked around my room. Everything was colliding with each other in this strange kaliedoscopic swirling pattern. It was like there was a 360 degree rainbow in my vision, with different layers on everything. My mind was racing in all directions at this point, and I kept trying to almost decribe to myself what was going on. Its was like I was watching everything happen, then over and over and over would watch the same thing happen. It felt like deja vu, like I had this experience many times before and knew exactly was going on. I kept repeating to myself,' THIS is what its like, I understand now. I understand. I understand.' Everything seemed to be going in loops. When I moved it felt like I only had to use effort for the first movement and then it became a symmetrical and repeating process. I still felt entirely in control of myself. I felt like I was more in control than ever. I felt like I was more a human being than ever. I would sit there and stare at things for hours, look at my phone, and the minute hadnt even changed. Everything was happening so fast pace, yet everything was going so slow. I moved my arm to pick up something(at the time I cant remember what it was because I never ended up picking it up) and noticed trailing images following the movement of my arm. I stared with amaze. I suddenly remembered a report of a government test on an artist who was given a total of 110mcg of lsd. In the report it said for a while he layed down on his bed and seemed to become strangly fascinated with something above him, and was moving his arms around in the air. This brought back the thought of understanding. To understand how others feel, what they were thinking about, what others perceptions were at the moment that they were thinking and feeling. This had all been within about 20 minutes.

T+1:30- At this point I definetly felt like I could handle the drug easily and not act like an idiot, so I went up stairs to take a shower. I walked past my mom in our living room, luckily there was a huge christmas tree taking up most of her vision, but I felt as if everyone I had seen felt exactly how I felt at the moment, being able to see all, feel all, understand all. I perticularly felt like I was watching the world move and progress. I made it up stairs into the bathroom with a towel. I looked at myself in the mirror, at my pupils, and noticed they were HUGE. Because I was tripping I felt like they kept getting bigger and bigger like an outward progressing spiral. This made me laugh, I'm not entirely sure why. I turn the shower on and undress. I feel like I'm being watched from everywhere. This feeling is easy to bypass because it is obviously not true, and the universe doesnt care if I'm naked.

I step into the shower/bath combo. The water is very hot and steamy, but comfortable. It really got my trip going more, the walls of the shower were developing small app. Half inch size tiles which were then morphing into hexagons and swirling. I felt extremely euphoric, but also a little unnerving. I figured since I had the opportunity, I will masturbate to see what sex feel slike on acid. There was a wierd auditory effect which made it seem like every sound was at the same pitch, so people would be able to hear the slight tapping sound over the roaring over the water. This was more challenging to bypass, because the feeling kept following me all night, in which I purposely tried to keep my speaking and noise making to a minimun to reduce the chance of seeing someone and having to act sober around them. During the deed, I noticed touch almost felt like numbness, but not like dxm in which it actually was numbness, but like normal sense is replaced with this oversense of everything thats there. Like I could feel my skin, and my skin within my skin. Impossible to describe, but it was a very great feeling. Definetly made masturbation over the top amazing. During the 'peak experience'(not Leary's peak experience lmao) if felt like I lost reality. I fell to my knees in the shower because I was no longer in existence and didnt know how to control my body because everything was a big swirl for a single moment. I came out of it as quick as I went in but it felt like forever at the time. Imediately after my mind dwindled on whether people in my house would hear that and be like,'Wtf did this kid just slip or something?' During part of the shower I started thinking about my father. After feeling depressed for what seemed like a long time but was probably only a few minutes, I came to realize that what happened had only brought us closer. I can't explain it but everything bad that happened had changed us both for the better. This gave me the feeling that I had lifted a tremendous weight off my shoulders.

T+2:00- I finished taking the shower and am now back in my room. As I walked through the living room my mother told me that she was going to sleep because no one was around to have a party and watch the ball drop. This lifted another weight as now I had no worry about whether or not I was going to be with her for a decent amount of time. 

The time was now app 10:30, and I felt like I had been tripping for days already. This didn't bother me at all, and I liked very much the feeling of having an endless amount of time. I spent most of the next hour or so moving around my room in and out of comfortable positions. I felt like everything kept repeating itself. I felt like I would read a txt, and a minute later get a txt and think that I had already read it. I was focusing alot on my visual field. It seemed that purples and blues were almost dominating, and that hexagons kept forming, moving towards me, then smaller ones would form and do the same thing. It was just like one of those psychedelic moving pictures that you see people have as tags to their forum profiles, where you are entering a coloring and symmetrical tunnel, but instead of being like what I now know is basically tripping on dmt, it was like a clear image of that over what I normally see. From about this point on, most of the experience was combined with different types of music from my ipod, include the beatles, alot of random music that I dont remember(Ipod was stolen long ago) and this one rave song that my friend that does e alot showed me. I first listened to the rave song and it was like my body rejected it. When I turned it on I felt like my ears were exploding and everything that was going on was losing its grip. It seemed like there was so much violence coming from the music. I ripped the headphones out of my ear and changed the song to Strawberry Fields Forever by The Beatles. This song proved a good choice, as I felt like I knew exactly how John Lennon felt. Back to Understanding thought loops.

T+3:25-I keep moving around on my bed because everywhere that I sit or lay is uncomfortable. Its not like it was ridiculously unbearing, and it didnt change my trip at all, at least that I noticed. I would just lay down, and after a minute realize that I was breathing strangly and start manually breathing. Inhale, exhale, it just became another pattern. I can only assume to everyone else that I could have possible seen, I would look like I was breathing extremely fast, because I would be thinking and enjoying my CEVs; which aren't very much different from the OEVs; and because time is going slow I try to breath at a 'normal' rate but in reality its probably alot faster. My vision is made up of living things, which yes it obviously is, but at the time I never thought about it before. There were floating letters and eyes and pyramids. In the center of my vision is a hexagon that keeps changing sizes and producing more hexagons, and in my peripherals it was mainly intense color and swirling circles that almost looked like diamonds. All of a sudden me moving around induces another Understanding thought loop. I think about how people end up in bad trips. This doesn't bring me down or anything but I keep thinking that I can easily see someone who isn't prepared for this go downhill real fast when it kicks in. This makes me wonder about why I didnt experience a bad trip. I was almost in the perfect set for a bad trip, and it completely reversed on me. I sit and wonder about why people even look at this drug negatively at all, and then am imediatly sucked back into what I had just thought about with how people end up in bad trips. One crazy thought loop, and it really smacked me in the face with a laugh because I had completely forgotten the conclusion I came to not 2 hours ago(two hours in my head, probably not even a minute).

T+3:30-(Its the New Year. Yayy. This moment actually had nothing to do with the bullshit time schedual, but is about a girl. Yes.)
I recieve a txt from MK, a girl that I was interested in for a short amount of time mabye back in august or something, I can't remember. We went out once but she lived extremely far away and I had very few methods of transportation. The text says,' Happy New Years'. I imediately comprehend this as some sort of sign. I'm was at the peak of the greatest experience of my life, and out of nowhere this person txts me(I didn't think about the fact that people send out txts to everybody saying 'Happy New Years').

I send some sort of reply that I can't remember, and we begin to have a conversation. I was amazed. I kept thinking,'What are the odds of her texting me now? Now. NOW. Now?'. I felt like we were having an extremely deep conversation. I hadn't talked to her in probably a few months now. I'm telling her about how I had taken acid and feel like I'm connecting with everything so deeply, about how acid is like a straight up intellectual shot that snaps you right into the most drastic and understanding state of mind. I feel like I feel everything. EVERYTHING. When there is any sort of altered energy you can feel it. Everything exists. And everything that exists is happening now. And it always will be happening now. She didn't and some other people she was with didn't believe me, so I sent them a picture of my eye. After that there was no argument. We continue talking for awhile, and she sends me a text telling me about a kid that is bothering her through text messages. This leads into a downward spiral conversation with me trying to change the subject and ending with her asking me to tell them to stop. Crash, horrible moment. This girl apparently knows nothing about LSD. I felt like she was asking me to go pick a fight with a few 19 years olds. 

(I have been a passafist ever since I started smokin pot. Fighting is pointless and doesn't resolve anything but spontanious anger, and the pain you feel afterwards is alot worse than whatever the person did to make you fight them. I'm not talking about physical pain, thats easy to bypass, but the emotional distress that can't be suppressed. Smoking pot just makes me think about it more.)

I asked her what the issue is. Two kids that are 16 and 17 are texting this 13 year old girl asking for pictures of her naked. I laughed to myself, and following was my fear for what the world has become. I sent her a text back saying if she sends it to me ill tell them to stop(definetly was a joke, but also wasn't hoping for her to take it as one). Instantly I'm propelled into a theory creation. I see another simple pattern. Girl talks to boy, boy asks for naked picture, girl says no, boy bothers her more, girl seeks rescue only for the cycle to continue. Before she even replies I tell her my discovery in a text. When I recieve a text back it is replying to what I had first said, saying pretty much omg stopp thats exactly whats been happeniingggg. I send her a text saying Lol while I recieve the txt agreeing with my discovery. Now I'm thinking about how stupid this whole situation was to begin with. Everything thats going on now is. Soon after this I stop talking to Marykate because I couldnt feel the vibration of the phone over the vibration of the music I was listening to in the dark laying on my bed in my room. I feel like my chest is being sucked inward almost. The patterns in my vision or moving in kaliedoscopic rythmes to the music.

T+3:46-I decide now is a good time to go for a short walk to a park near my house. Since its 12:16 I don't have to worry about running into many people when I go out in public. I put my jacket on and place my ipod in the right hip pocket. I wait to put the headphones on untill I get outside so I can make sure I don't make alot of noise leaving. My mother doesn't care if I leave the house, but I don't want to wake anyone up in the middle of the night. Once I get outside I start to get really paranoid. Not 'OMG I'M IN THE DARK, A CREATURES GONNA EAT ME!', I just feel like I'm being watched from all angles. I walk as fast as I can because I feel like I'm moving extremely slow and everyone else will stare at me. I put the music on my ears as I walk up my driveway. Once I get to the top of my small hill, I hear something. I thought it was real at the time so it really freaked me out. I was into the music and lost in my mind and I'm suddenly snapped back to reality by this voice. I automatically whipped out the headphones and turned my head to see if anyone was around. Not a person in sight, no cars. I put my headphones back in. The song hadnt even progressed 2 lines. I was listening to some house music. Not quite as hardcore as the rave music, but it was extremely upbeat for just normal house instead of being like love and ecstasy. The video contained alot of strobe light images so it was definetly the music trippin me out into a much deeper state in which I started hearing things. 

(The entire night I felt like I had been hearing things, now that I bring it up. I kept thinking I was hearing like echos, and could hear people conversations perfectly from 20 feet away behind a closed door. And I would think alot and alot and then randomly realize I've been speaking my thoughts out loud, but then I'm not sure if I was actually speaking my thoughts or not. There were times when I definetly had said something. I would be thinking deeply and forget where I am and then randomly snap back because I just began to speak out my thoughts. They were forming abstract sentences when I actually speaked them out. I can't think of an example but it was usually when I was thinking about like the Earths natural beauty, or about how other people were feeling at the moment.)

The walk is about 1/4 mile total. Strange, I didn't remember it taking this long to walk that distance. I feel like cars kept passing me, yet it still seemed like there was a huge gap of time between when the cars would pass. I have to walk up the street, turn left, walk up the street and up a small hill, and cross the street somewhere along the way. I get the sound effect 2 more times before I decide to not put the headphones in again. Its definetly a voice, although I don't understand what its saying, the way it talks sounds almost like entering a tunnel, if that even makes an actual sound other than a placebo from feeling enclosed. It isn't speaking english, but unlike what I hear about the 'mushroom voice' I can't make out what its trying to tell me. I feel like I keep leaning to the side as I walk. I also feel like I'm falling forward and backwards at the same time. Its like a repeating cycle of spiraling patterns, you can feel it and see it. I feel like everyone is in their windows watching me. Even though its pitch black out, it seems ridiculously bright to me. Not like everything is like daytime, but I feel like I can see things that I wouldn't be able to see if I was high at night. I also have no loss in direction, I remember how to get places, where I am and how to get home. I kept hearing stories from this hippy guy I know where people couldn't find there way home on acid. It might have been metaphorical I suppose, but he just seemed like a guy that would go out and do drugs and get fucked up, not like an actual 'hippy'.  

After I take the turn I can see the park. It starts about halfway up the hill accross the street, but there is a grassy area accross the street all the way to the light, so I cross right away. I felt like I was gonna see a car coming towards me as I walked accross the street. I wasn't afraid of getting hit or anything, I just felt like I was in the road for so long that a car should have come. 

I am across the road and start walking fast again. I would have been doing it the whole time but I forgot that I was going to. I walk by this tree/bush combination that is about 20 feet long and is between the road and where I'm walking. I feel some sort of reassurance that I'm away from peoples eyes. 

As I'm walking up the hill, I look at the ground. It seems as if about 4 feet in front of me there is some sort of warped trench in the ground, and it moves forward as I move forward. Tripping outside and at night is truely amazing. Everything feels so calm and connecting. I am now walking across a soccer/Lacross field. The trench goes along with my feeling that I'm falling forward as I walk. I look up at the sky and see the most amazing scene I've ever experienced in my life. As I walked the sky created a multidimensional plain. It was filled with life and diamonds and gigantic pyramids. I couldn't help but get the feeling this is why pyramids popped up all over the world with no connection to each other.

I feel like its taking so long to get across this field. I'm only half way there so I'm gonna start running now. This area seems so open. Seems sketchy to me, as I feel like everyone can see me look like I'm falling forward. There is a snack shack and bathrooms up ahead. In the front of it they made a patio with a roof and a picnik table. There is an extremely bright light coming from the side of the building, but I feel like it reaches everywhere in the whole park. I feel people watching me. I run to the building and stand on a side with shade. I hardly feel comfortable, there is still plenty of light surrounding me. I think about what I would say if I ran into a cop, how it would be easy to lie my way out and walk home, but I wasn't sure if he would notice I was tripping. I know I look fine, but I feel like I don't. I move around the building and sit down at the table on the patio. I'm litterally standing in a bait spot. Its pitch black everywhere for miles and I'm sitting at a table under a light. I start getting extremely nervous. I can't escape the light no matter where I go. I get up and walk on to the parking lot, which is right in front of the patio. There is a large area to park to my left, and a small road leading to another area to park right in front of my. I keep walking in circles in the parking lot without realizing it. I keep walking to one side of the parking lot to see if it will be out of the light, and then I forget what I'm doing only a few feet ahead and stand in place. Then I turn around and walk towards the other side. I will look over at a darker area, and then jog to where it was.When I get there I panic because it is just as bright as before. I go over and sit on a guardrail next to the parking lot. It is just as bright as where I ran from. 

(This whole walk is hard to describe in detail because it was really just the same thing happening over and over. Well, the whole trip really was just the same thing happening over and over but either way. I don't make it seem like it would have been that long of a time, but it definetly did feel like hours and hours. I shall move on.)

I look up at the sky to escape the fear I'm experiencing. Its the most amazing thing I've ever seen. The most amazing thing anyone could ever see. I start to tear at the pure bliss I feel. My mind is running extremely wild, and for the first time since I've been out, I think about the temperature. I don't feel cold at all, but I can feel the piercing wind. I look at my hands which have turned bright red. This alarms me, so I reach into my pocket to check the clock on my phone. What the hell its 1:46? I can't help but think how strange it is, not that its been an hour and a half, but that its been exactly an hour and a half. I feel like its telling me to leave this place. I walk across the small road to the buildings side and start crossing the field. I'm moving quickly, fast walking, because this park is making me more and more nervous as time goes on. There is the same pattern on the ground. Its still very strange but it was very cool to look at. I couldn't take the smile off my face. 

I feel like its taking even longer to walk this field now. I check my phone again and its already been 7 minutes, the amount of time it takes me to walk a half mile normally. I'm extremely puzzled. I turn my head and look at the parking lot. I watch a police officer pull in to the parking lot of the park. Panicked, I lay in grass because I still feel like the light can reach me(even tho I'm 3/4s of a soccer field away and the light is facing the opposite direction). The car drives to the end of the parking lot, turns around, and exits. It drives up the road towards me, but I'm not near the road so it wasn't close enough to see me. I stand up and jog untill I get across the road. I cross earlier this time, so I'm on the other side of the street on the sidewalk as I walk past the bush/tree combo. 

I see the light from a car coming from behind me, and get nervous. I stop moving and pull out my phone, just in case I was walking crooked like I feel like I do, and to make it look like I had a reason to stand in place. All of a sudden I hear a voice. Not the same tunnel sounding voice I heard earlier, but a human, female voice. Its saying,'Hey.' I look next to me and am extremely startled to see a small car, mabye an older honda civic(I was really freaked out because no ones ever pulled over and asked me if I needed a ride before, and I'm on ACID, so I didn't have a chance to look at the car really. I appologize.), parked on the side of the road. A good looking girl of mabye age 19 is asking,' Do you need a ride?'. 
	'Ehh, No thanks I'm fine. I live right up hear.'I reply slow, I couldn't think of what to say. It felt like I was on the spot.
	'Ok,' She drives on. I resume movement towards my house, even more eager to get home. At this point there is a very, very heavy thought that I am going to die if I don't get home soon. I can't feel the temperature difference, so have no idea if I'm in mid hypothermia. I start fast walking again. 

I get around the corner and see my driveway. Just another few hundred feet. I put the headphones back in thinking that it will pass time quicker because I know I'll still be walking for a while. I start listening to a song, but am not enjoying it really, I take the headphones out and look down at my Ipod touch. I scroll through my songs to find one a want to listen to. My vision suddenly flashes red and blue, I look up to see a police car about 20 feet ahead driving towards me on the opposite side of the road with his lights flickering. He flicks them on, off, on, off within a second or so duration of time, and keeps driving forward. I feel frozen but can tell my legs are still moving. I keep walking forward and turn around to see if the cop went straight. There was no vehicle on the straight so he must have turned. I get probably one of the worst and scariest feelings I've ever felt(Very very funny and IRONIC that I get this feeling from our 'protectors'), and sprint full throttle towards my driveway. I run down my driveway and get to the stairs leading up to my door, when I hear a car coming. I look at the road and see the police car drive by going in the opposite direction. I sigh in relief and walk up to my door.

I walk through my living room and look at my christmas tree with lights. I stop and stare for moment, and then move towards my room. Once I get inside I turn my light on and crash onto my bed. I filled a void by making it back, but I still feel like I got hypothermia, My hands are not functioning well and are bright red. I run them under cold water in my bathroom for a few minutes. It took a little bit for me to reassure myself, but there is nothing wrong.

T+6:00- The next few hours after 2:30 were not very important to make many notes. I spent  most of the time listening to music, and continuously moving around my room in circles. I searched the song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds by the Beatles, and was blown away by how perfect of a description for LSD the song is. It may not have had the intent, but it is a vivid picture of a trip put into words. I had to have listened to it 10 times at the least.

T+8:40-I start to use my creative state to draw. I start to draw a few geometric images, forming strange structures resembling different crystal formations. It takes me about an hour to draw a larger hexagon shaped pattern, afterwards I am very proud of my image. I take a picture and send it to one of my friends, with a text saying,' Wait till you trip for the first time.'

T+11:00-I have significantly come down my this point. There is still a very strong sense of visual and physical differences, but its not anywhere near its full capacity. Everything has become dull, and I feel physically strained. I had been up for over 24 hours, and Was ready to pass out, but I was still having extreme difficulty falling asleep. I took out my one hitter and packed it. I took one pull, and imediately brought back some power to the trip, altho not anything spectacular. It gave the trip a less desirable effect, to say the least. I felt more out of control. When I closed my eyes I could see vivid images of what I was thinking of. Its not like I was actually seeing it, but more like my already strong visual sense of memory was heightened. I couldn't control my thoughts as much, and they were leading into a much more negative cycle. I saw abstract images of blood stained walls and felt the pain of everyone.  

T+14:40(10:10)-It took me a while but I managed to fall asleep. I still had slight visual alterations. I wasn't still tripping, but I felt like my mind was stretched behond exhaustion.

T+20:00- I am now at the party. Mental effects still linger, and I only got at the most 4 and a half hours of sleep, so I am ready for a full day of rest. I can't decide what to make of my experience. It was definetly a grand one, but I am very afraid to go back into that state of mind any time soon. I feel like I have no desire to take LSD again at all. 

(Less than a week later, I dosed about 165mcg in the car on my way to a resort in The Berkshires. After I had time to rest I was eager to make another leap of faith.)

I almost decided not to take the hit. I had not done it in so long I couldnt decide if I wanted to or not. That night, however, after going to see a local band at a peace bar with some friends I thought, what could be the worst to happen?

My world was changed forever. This was not even the first time I tried acid. Nothing has been the same for me since.

The night I took the hit, I met up with my friend and her boyfriend and after listening to the band, decided to go back to his apartment. I definitely did not want to be driving while tripping. After arriving to his house I realized it was the 25th anniversary of the Grateful Dead blotter. That relaxed me and made me giddy inside. I took one hit. One hit. Doubting hardly any strange feelings would arouse. I was wrong.

After about 45 minutes, I decided to watch Dazed and Confused. The other people were in another room playing guitar all sitting around together singing. I watched the entire movie confused about the meaning of it all. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. 

When the movie ended, I decided to go into the guitar room and jam with all my friends. The effect of the acid was really starting to mess with me. I played the guitar while the strings moved around me and danced while I was playing them. More people started to show up to my friends boyfriends apartment. I needed air. My friend and I walked outside and decided we wanted to get a Widespread Panic cd out of her boyfriends truck. After sitting outside in the cold laughing because we didnt know how to get in the truck, her boyfriend came out with the keys and unlocked it for us. We sat in his truck for about 30 minutes wondering how to get the cd player open. Everything seemed to take so long to do. I couldnt figure out why normal things I would attempt to do seemingly took an extra 30 minutes. It was hilarious. I loved this new way of life. I felt like I was literally in slow motion.

After discovering the Widespread Panic cd, my friend and I raced back inside, put the disc into the cd player and danced for what seemed a million years. Bare footed, long skirt, my beautiful Grateful Dead necklace tied tightly, I danced until I thought my lungs would burst. It was the most beautiful thing in the world. I loved my life. I danced until I thought my lungs would burst. It was the most beautiful thing in the world. I loved my life. And if I could just dance here, and not do anything for the rest of time, I would be fine.  Eventually we got tired, however, and decided to sit in front of the fan and cool off. Watching my skirt blow in front of the fan, I felt like I was at the beach. I imagined myself, drink in one hand, the other hand tracing lines in the sand. This feeling was overwhelming. 

It was getting hot. There were many people in his apartment now. My friend and I didnt know what to do. We both glanced into his bedroom and saw the window. The window. Our haven. That saved us that night. I will never forget the window and the wonderful memories and closeness it brought. We opened up the window and literally hung out of it, the bottom half of our bodies standing on the bed, while the top half dangling. We stared at the stars and I shot to the moon. I danced around in space for a while, laughing at all the other meaningless people in the other room. Didnt they know they could fly in space in this room? They were missing out. I was having the time of my life. My friend and I discussed how beautiful bricks were and how there was a Mexican mountain just right above the rooftop. What in the world had I done to myself? 

After coming back to reality and climbing safely back onto the bed, my friend and I began to dance again, swaying to the music. At one point, I touched the boom box ( I still call it that, forgive me.) and I knew right then and there I was at a Panic concert, front row, basking in the gloriousness of JB, Jimmy, Schools, Jojo, Todd, and Sunny. I was the luckiest girl in the world. Who would have known in just an hour, I would be sitting at yet another Panic show this year. I literally felt the musics vibration. I jolted at this orgasmic feeling. 

After dancing  once again, my friend and I decided to head back to the window. As we climbed out, we began laughing uncontrollably. I dont know to this day if it was because of how wonderful it felt to be on the outside world, or if it was because at 3 in the morning, we were climbing out a window staring up at the rooftops of houses. A light suddenly came on, we threw ourselves back on the bed. Who in the world was that? Had someone seen us? What would they have thought? This only made us laugh harder. How random. I love random events and awkward moments define my life, but this was a whole new chapter in the book. After about ten minutes and no one had pounded down the door, we relaxed and laid on the bed.

Look up at the ceiling, its insane! my friends always told me. Man, what a sight. Before even thinking about the ceiling, I glanced around the room and stared at the posters. The most intriguing poster was of The Doors Jim Morrisons face. The only difference than a normal picture was that the background colors were incredibly trippy. I stared at his face and I was happy that we were friends. I felt like I could confide in him and talk to him. My friend and I actually did talk to him. We explained how awkward we felt because the people in the other room were acting so shady! After talking to Jim I felt better. After looking at different posters around the room, my other favorite was the Phish poster to my right. It was the band all gathered around in black and white. It seemed as though they were just there practicing in the studio. I told my friend I felt like I was in the studio with them. I told the boys to turn up the mike a bit and my friend and I actually jammed with Phish for a while. 

After jamming with Phish, I looked back over at the poster of Jim and I realized he was mad at me. He was REALLY mad at me. He was glaring at me and his nostrils flared. I was scared. I was extremely scared. Even my friend noticed how mad he got! All I could mutter was, Jim, dont give me that look I just wanted him to be happy again. I couldnt bare it anymore, so my friend and I hung out of the window again. I enjoyed it so much. The bursts of air, the clear night sky, it was all so intriguing.

Finally, daylight was coming about. We had spent the entire night in her boyfriends room. We laid in his bed and opened the window and watched the sky as it turned into a dull gray. We also watched her boyfriend and all his friends come out into the living room and talk as if we were not there. It was as if my friend and I were watching a television show. We were invisible. It was all so strange. She put on a Dave Matthews CD (Some Devil) and we stared at a painting by Van Gogh. We realized that the painter doesnt even have a clue was he is about to do. It is just the miracle of the paint brush and every second it touches the canvas. 

What a night. I finally fell asleep listening to So Damn Lucky, and realized that I was ready to come down off of this feeling although it had helped me to bond closer to my friend. My life is just a series of incredible awkward moments. And I love it. With or without LSD. My life is just a series of incredible awkward moments. And I love it. With or without LSD.  I havent used it in a while and I might never drop again. But if I do, I know the random events that will happen will be life altering and mind changing for my world at least.

This was my first experience with this substance.  I was extremely depressed about perceptions of my career stalling and post-graduate identity diffusion and losing touch with people who had mattered to me-- this depression had been growing on me gradually for years but lately had worsened further in severity.  None of the medications worked; they seemed to be just masking the underlying structural or cognitive problems and made things worse in some respects.  I felt that I could no longer live up to my own expectations or those of society, that I was fundamentally flawed in my attempts to engage with people, and out of these motivations I had been planning my suicide for weeks.  In a fit of desperation I had ordered a variety of drugs from various sources to try to see whether anything might change my perspective, or at least to collect a few experiences before I left.  By the time this trip was over, apart from having indeed collected a vast array of experiences and far more than I had bargained for, I found that I wasn't even depressed anymore.  It was almost a sort of psychological surgery.  Though I had not expected this outcome, LSD may well have saved my life.

T=0:00: I took half a tab and waited 30 minutes.  Listened to the first half hour or so of Dark Side of the Moon.  As was proper, I thought.

T=0:25: Felt nothing so I took the other half.  Listened to the rest of the album.

T=0:50: I took a 2nd tab because I still felt nothing.  Supposedly some effects were supposed to begin by 30-60 minutes into it.  Waited another 45 minutes while listening to some music from the Matrix and doing email.

T=1:30: Still noticed nothing.  Had a snack.  Drank some juice.  Took a 3rd tab.

T=2:00: I finally noticed some intensification of perceived colors.  It was pleasant.  Pretty.  Seemed like this stuff was perhaps a bit weaker than advertised (classic novice mistake apparently...).  Took a 4th tab.

T=2:30: I finally started to see some weak visual trails.  Still no 'breathing walls' or anything I had been told to expect by friends or read about online.  Colors were still vibrant and beautiful though.  Grabbed a sodium acetate hot pack to look at because I figured the crystals that form in them would look interesting with these visual effects.  Took a 5th tab.  Got into bed since I wasn't sure if I would feel drunk/unsteady when the stuff finally kicked in.

T=2:45: I noticed that the fuzzy setting patterns and support marks in the concrete ceiling of my apartment had begun to intensify into something resembling densely composed Aztec writing or an angular Celtic braid pattern.  The grain of the wood of my door took on much sharper edges and more saturated colors.  It was gorgeous.  I spent a while looking around at various objects in the room.  I picked up an abstract bronze sculpture and twirled it around in my hands.  I wondered whether I would hallucinate it melting or merging with adjacent objects (this never did happen, oddly; I was always able to perceive it clearly).  I went to my computer and moved the mouse around and saw some visual trails of its path, but didn't it always do that?  (It did, though not so strongly.)  I got back in bed.  I wondered whether the 5th tab had been a mistake....  In retrospect I should have been wondering about the 4th and perhaps the 3rd as well. I wondered whether the 5th tab had been a mistake....  In retrospect I should have been wondering about the 4th and perhaps the 3rd as well. 

T=2:55: the intensified patterns in the concrete ceiling began to swirl and blend smoothly.  The support marks seemed to dance like rainbow-hued cartoon bones.  The saturation of the colors of the wood grain patterns of the door began to pulse.  Fascinating.  I activated the chemical hot pack and watched the trails of crystals grow.  The warmth was nice.  I felt rather cold for some reason.  I had read that temperature regulation could vary on LSD though-- so perhaps that was prudent.  The visual trails became more intense.  I saw jagged edges suspended in the air when I moved the hot pack.  The trails seemed to be more pronounced with sharper-edged objects.  I didn't see them around my hands for instance.  I put the hot pack under my shirt because I was cold, but then had a sudden desire to take my shirt off and pull on a comforter instead so I did.

T=3:05: I had a sudden flash of connection to ancient ancestors.  Perhaps it was taking the shirt off; I'm not sure.  I twirled the sculpture in my hands and thought about ancient Europeans in continental Europe hunting large mammals during the winter for food.  I thought about the structure of human societies and how historically women had stayed in the village and anchored the society/tribe while men went out in small bands to hunt.  How women often communicated better and had stronger personal networks while men often had stronger ambitions and tended to be better at spatial reasoning and strategy.  How modern society was being controlled and constrained and often broken and damaged by abstract representations of society on websites (Facebook, online dating, etc.).  How society and the economy were becoming more materialistic, more winner-take-all, more dependent on perceptions.  I envisioned hunting a wooly mammoth with a few lifelong tribesmen with spears, coming home to a wife in an age when divorce did not exist, when children were raised semi-communally and always had potential friends nearby (instead of going to school and being ripped away from their communities every time they graduated or their parents were forced to move by faceless corporate employers).

T=3:10: My hands began to glow yellow-orange in the light from my lamp.  I was still envisioning ancient ancestors and thinking about society.  Time seemed to be slowing down.  I tossed the sculpture back and forth between my hands but seemed to be barely noticing it visually or what it felt like.  I laughed.  This felt nice.  For now.

T=3:15: I tried to think about the software project I was working on but couldn't think past the first 2 or 3 stages of the pipeline I was building.  That was a bit concerning.  I can normally do that even when I am very drunk.  Oh well.  I assumed it would come back.  I had to struggle to remember my name.  The hairs on my arms were glowing in rainbows. I had to struggle to remember my name.  The hairs on my arms were glowing in rainbows.  Thought about names as anchors to society.  Names and numbers and abstractions over top of underlying biological-chemical-physical reality.  Assumed reality.  My view of reality was about to become a great deal more direct, however.

T=3:20: I began seeing psychedelic patterns when I closed my eyes.  Round paisley 4-way-symmetric patterns, fern-like patterns, 2-tone paper-cut-artwork patterns.  They seemed to have a recursive or fractal structure.  They zoomed inward and always resembled themselves.  Every 30 seconds or so they would 'reset'.  I opened my eyes and checked the time on my phone.  The visual trails were incredibly intense.  The home screen looked like something from a futuristic movie or video game, with trails sliding off the graphics like white angular fading vapors or sparks.  Beautiful.  I momentarily thought of messaging a few of my friends who had had extensive experience with psychedelics in the past but thought better of it.  I don't drunk-text so I certainly shouldn't trip-text.  I wasn't sure if I even remembered my password anyway.

T=3:30: I closed my eyes and suddenly envisioned being reincarnated as a caveman for about a minute.  Then a different caveman.  Then a woman.  Then an African tribesman.  Then a rainforest tribesman.  Then something genderless entirely, possibly from another planet, seemingly some imagined hypothetical species.  'All my best trips were on LSD' began to run through my mind like a mantra.  It was strange.  Time was very slow now.  I seemed to live out significant life experiences of other hypothetical people, other hypothetical creatures in general each over the span of about 30-60 seconds.  I kept re-checking my phone for time and I remember each of these episodes was barely a minute if even that.  The circular 4-way fractal patterns overlaid on the imagined reincarnations; the trip had taken on a sort of recursive character.  The mantra replaying in my mind, the imagined reincarnations, and the visual patterns each 'reset' every 30-60 seconds or so.

T=3:35: There had been a protest nearby earlier in the evening and now there were police sirens.  Uh-oh.  Suddenly my anxiety levels spiked and I felt nauseous.  Not because I thought they were coming for me -- just because of the change in background noise.  'Set and setting'.  I was worried the trip was about to take a turn for the worse.  I had money, no criminal record, had been careful all my life, was being quiet, was safe and undetectable in my apartment.  They were coming for people less careful on the streets.  I thought about how arbitrary the war on drugs was, how police were their own culture and the urban poor were their own culture and the technical professional classes were their own culture and only ever occasionally intersected.  I wasn't hurting anyone, and I would get away with this anyway; meanwhile people far poorer than me who sold things to pay their rent were risking jail time and destroyed lives and homelessness.  It all seemed so artificial.  Structures of social regulation and control.  Ten thousand years ago we had been cavemen and tribesmen; we had taken substances like this for mystical experiences and rites of passage.  There were no controlled substance laws back then -- so arbitrary, some grandstanding congressman trying to make his career on oppressing others who he had never met, had never conversed with, had never even genuinely tried to understand.  The sirens and the sounds of cars and trains blended together into a smooth background soundscape of modernity and anxiety.  I went to the bathroom to lay on the cold tile floor because I suddenly felt overheated and a bit nauseous.

T=3:40: I was abruptly reincarnated as something genderless and alien, prostrated in a ritual to Lovecraftian alien 'outer gods'.  My body seemed alien to me; I felt unfamiliar with its structure.  I could suddenly tangibly perceive the philosophical absurdism of Camus and live within it.  I had always believed it intellectually, and if I stared at e.g. my hand long enough I could begin to perceive how absurd and how arbitrary the structure of the human body was (compared to any given alternative evolutionary possibility), but here and now I was living it and perceiving it fully.  The fixtures and trash can in the bathroom appeared to be covered in vertical columns of alien writing made of thin lines and triangles that glowed and sparkled in pulsating pastel blue and orange and yellow.  Another few cycles of reincarnation across alien genders and species, still with this strange religious overtone, this ritual prostration.  (I was still on the floor or kneeling.)  The mantra repeated over and over in sync with the successive reincarnations.  It was fascinating.  I felt as though I had greatly advanced in my understanding of absurdism.

T=3:45: I suddenly felt more lucid, remembered what it was to be human.  No longer nauseous, I took a big drink of water (have to stay hydrated) and an anti-anxiety supplement that I keep handy.  I often do have anxiety.  (... in retrospect that should perhaps have concerned me.)  I went back to my bed and thought about the visualizations of alien reincarnations.  The patterns in the ceiling and door were still quite vibrant and beautiful, their colors varying gradually in saturation.

T=3:50: I was reincarnated as a captured spy or scientist, trapped in a delirium or virtual reality consisting of standing by my desk in this room (my apartment), with an overriding sense that foreign and perhaps entirely inhuman oppressors were trying to somehow break into my mind or cause me to admit to them some secret coordinates or cryptographic encryption keys.  They were trying to capture or break my collaborators, who I envisioned as some of my closest friends; some may have already been captured; I did not know.  I saw my passport on the desk, some foreign currency.  I envisioned the apartment as a hotel room in which I had been staying before being captured, that they had somehow trapped my mind in this place through drugs or virtual reality while probing it for information.  I felt a sense of great pressure and anxiety; 'you'll never break me; I would rather die than reveal the keys or lead you to my collaborators' I thought.  I had a sudden sense that the LSD had 'blasted shards of my consciousness into adjacent lives,' envisioning them as shards of dark green glass in brass fixtures embedded in limestone.  On reflection, this is true; what else is conversation?  We all embed shards of our consciousness into those others with whom we deeply interact, in showing them how we see the world.

T=3:52: I felt a sudden recollection of what it had been like to be delirious from a fever when I was a child, when I could not identify my parents and they seemed to me to be cloaked in trench coats asking me who they were.  I grabbed some paper and a pen and began writing what I could remember of my profession, that I had taken a large dose of LSD (for some reason I wrote 'face-melting dose of LSD' and underlined it, though whenever I looked in the mirror my face looked fine-- just a bit alien/arbitrary), 'why did I do this to myself?', then remembered it had been in part to try to overcome my mounting severe depression over my current path in life (at times I had barely left my bed in a week) and the seeming futility of continued post-graduation ambition in the modern industrial-technical system.  I suddenly had a flash of vision of being suspended as a white drop between two curved spines in a vast void and the thought of something like pure lived experience.  It somehow symbolized my life between beginning and end.  Between two oblivions: one before birth, one after death.  I had a monumental and overwhelming feeling that merely being able to have experiences at all was wonderful, that my former notions of suffering as economic subjugation and professional difficulties were entirely a matter of my own perception and that these things were in any event scale-free, that all the internal structure of my mind was merely how I happened to perceive the world and that far more of it was subjective and malleable than I had believed.  That I had taken so much for granted.  That my social anxiety was due to imagined assumptions on my part about what other people thought of me, that none of it was likely even real.  That we all view the world through our own internal mental structures and representations and that just because it looks a certain way to us at one point does not mean that it looks that way to everyone or even to us at different points in our lives.  That we spend so much of our time thinking about internal abstractions that we imagine accurately describe the outside world but are really just Nietzschean-perspectivist slices of perceived reality, or living in various imagined futures that for all we know may never even occur.  That the Buddhist notions of cultivating mindfulness and living in the present and gently acknowledging impermanence and not being upset about it were key to avoiding suffering in the world.  That so much suffering was subjective and caused by trying to fulfill brittle expectations instead of experiencing life.

T=3:55: I went to get more water.  I then felt a bit hot and nauseous again so I laid back down on the cool tile floor.  I began being mentally reincarnated as increasingly strange alien forms -- radially symmetric things, undersea things, liquid things, gaseous things, abstract things, mechanical things.  Always this mantra 'all my best trips were on LSD' and the sense of a recursive nature to the closed-eye visuals and the trip itself.

T=4:30: I went back to bed.  I suddenly saw myself as completely immaterial.  I felt that I was, most fundamentally, nothing but a neural network that could be connected to any arbitrary physical body/hardware/sensors, in any society or none, at any point in history in any place in the universe or an alternate universe.  I thought about how even driving a car or piloting an airplane or playing a video game causes people to feel themselves as 'being' the entity that they control, how wielding a weapon or using another type of tool causes them to see it almost as an extension of themselves.  How the network was almost agnostic to the underlying hardware.  Just pursuing hierarchical concept-structures and receptor activations associated with them that controlled my activity-- dopamine to motivate, serotonin to appreciate and love, oxytocin to bond, GABA to relax, etc.  Oversimplifications I know.  I thought about lower mammals and how they were motivated by similar receptors and drives but lacked the same level of complexity to model and represent the world in their cerebral cortices.  I thought about the AI research I had done.  I thought about strong AI and deep neural networks and deep reinforcement learning.  I thought about the future and the first artificial general intelligence, how it too might conceivably conceive of itself this way, but as the first known purely-abstract intelligence in the world.  I thought again of myself as fundamentally just a form of deep neural network and a collection of hedonic drives and emotional shades toward tendencies of behavior.

T=4:44: For the briefest moment I saw something small and bright and shimmering, outside the network or between the layers or somehow transcending it.  I have no idea what it was or what it was supposed to represent.  Perhaps it was some abstraction of pure existence or a notion of divinity or the totality of the universe as perceived.  I am not sure.  There is no reason to believe that it had any particular bearing in existence or possible experiences, but I can't shake the thought of it even now.  I was reflecting on the walls of Plato's cave as my own incoming sensory stimuli in the abstract, and then there was this outside thing.  Perhaps it represented the fundamentally unknowable (per the 'cogito') nature of true reality unlimited by our perceptions.  But I am not sure.

T=4:45: I envisioned my close friends and past lovers purely as neural networks and receptor activation profiles like me as well, each seeking their own satisfaction and fulfillment within their own realms of perceived experiences and internal assumptions.  'Is your blue my blue?'  To say nothing of whether your assumptions about social constraints match my own.  I had a sudden appreciation for the differences between people and their perspectives.  I had an overwhelming feeling that I wanted to focus over the next few years on getting closer to my friends and making more friends in general and seeking new lovers, having spent almost all of my time over the past several years focusing on my technical career.  I thought of the world in the Cartesian 'dream argument' sense, the notion that we really could be in a simulation or all brains in vats.  But that somehow other people, other beings were more important and more ontologically fundamental than perceptions about the rest of the outside world itself.  I had never had this thought before.  I had always assumed the notion of solipsism implied others would be inherently just as ontologically contingent as anything else within perceived reality, but suddenly I saw them as something different.  What I envisioned now was more like the setting of the Matrix, multiple individuals experiencing the same or a similar shared perceived reality, even if they were all really something or somewhere else.  Perhaps because of my inability to completely simulate them the way I could with other phenomena, perhaps they seemed in some information-theoretic sense to be undeniably outside of me.  Or at least outside of whatever parts of my mind I could consciously perceive.  And right now that seemed like all of them.  Certainly I felt a far more complete understanding of my own assumptions and sociocultural contingencies now than I ever had at once before.  I saw my friends and past lovers as immensely bright sparks of various individual colors flying through a space of possibilities with me, at varying distances and speeds, as though we were all engaged in some common struggle or journey together and should help each other in pursuing it.  Though we were all spread out over the country now, I momentarily flashed back to my earlier visions of living in primitive tribes.  Abstract modernity brings us closer than geography, at least, in part.  It was beautiful.

T=5:00: Things took a sharp turn for the worse again.  And this was a pattern on this trip.  I wouldn't even call it a 'bad trip', any more than I would call a tense movie a 'sad movie' simply for having sad or frightening parts in it.  There were overwhelmingly happy and illuminating parts as well.  But this was a frightening one.  I suddenly saw myself as this network.  And the sun began to rise.  As it rose the visual trails became more intense again and the visions stopped.  I tried to remember my work again to check where I was on the trip, but I couldn't seem to remember how to write code at all.  I forgot my name.  I looked at my arms and saw caveman arms.  I was momentarily horrified.  The sentences suddenly went through my mind 'You thought cocaine was something, didn't want to try it again?  That was nothing.  This stuff can mess you up in more ways and on more levels than you can even fathom.'  I thought of 'sheet eaters' who had taken too much LSD and gotten stuck in permanent recurring trips.  'Sometimes you just trip out for no reason; I tell myself that it was just a free trip and I should try to appreciate it.'  Absolute horror.  The temporal distortions made it somehow worse, the notion that I could be trapped here for years subjectively in the span of minutes, that I had somehow modified my own means of perceiving the world and that it was impossible to turn back time and undo any damage that might have resulted.  I had a sudden thought of my own internal neural network, with the LSD suddenly jostling layers out of alignment, like the sharp-edged misaligned visual trails and notion of displaced 'shards of consciousness' but at higher and more conceptual levels of my cortical networks.  I remembered an article about git that I had read that had alluded to a complex process called an interactive rebase, and something about 'so you misplaced these commits midway into a DMT trip; at least git will still track them for you'.  This was LSD and I had never taken DMT; a friend said it had been incredibly powerful and he wondered if it had somehow damaged him.  I wondered the same about myself now.  I wondered whether whenever I thought about my current software project I would spiral into an unprompted trip, whether I had somehow woven or welded some of my real-world experiences to this inner world of perceptual distortions and recursive insanity.  Had I really need to start this experience with 5 tabs?  Periodic spikes of anxiety about different aspects of my life came back as well.  I suddenly rushed to the bathroom and threw away all of my remaining supplies of various drugs.  I decided I was never doing this again and desperately hoped that I hadn't damaged myself in some enduring way.  And that regardless I was at least no longer depressed per se, ironically, and needed to live a healthier lifestyle.

T=5:10: The sudden phrase 'you have to integrate it' came to me like the voice of a psychotherapist.  I had somehow chosen to do solo psychological surgery on myself with no anesthetic, and that implied that I was responsible for putting the parts back and closing the incisions now.  Every time something felt like it might slip out of place, I grounded it.  I felt as though I were realigning the jostled layers that the LSD had rattled and perturbed and revealed and cleaned and swept the dust out from under, the misalignments I imagined at various levels of my cortical hierarchy being symbolized by the visual trails I experienced at the lowest levels.  Periodically I would slip back into being mentally reincarnated as additional strange forms, liquids and gel-like creatures, things with no skin painlessly living in a flesh-world, people of other races, people in the future, things made of yarn, things made of food products, multicolored aqueous chemical systems, the walls and building materials of the apartment itself, etc.  'All my best trips were on LSD' repeated every time it happened, this strange recursive mantra.  I thought of my parents and my name.  I thought of my friends.  I saw the other people in my life as stronger anchors to reality than my perceptions themselves were, and of myself pulling my way back to this particular evolved reality, this particular realized form of what was possible, by thinking of other people, other consciousnesses as my anchors.  Every spike of anxiety I worked through, I thought about its underpinnings, told myself that it stemmed from assumptions I made about the world rather than from the world itself.  Assumptions that in some cases the LSD itself had shown me I had, so much I had taken for granted that in reality was merely a product of my lived experiences, environment, culture, physical form, and neural structure.  In hindsight, LSD was perhaps the most effective cognitive-behavioral therapy I've ever had.

T=5:30: The sun had come up and I remembered how to write code again.  I remembered my identity, though it still felt completely arbitrary and absurd to me. I remembered my identity, though it still felt completely arbitrary and absurd to me.  I could have been anything.  I could have been a tentacled underwater alien in a minor moon of a gas giant in another galaxy and in some fundamental ontological sense it would not have mattered.  That this modern human western cultural existence was the particular form that my observed reality had taken was as acceptable to me as any other.  But the LSD had not fundamentally changed the structures in my cortex; my knowledge and skills were still there and waiting for me.  I felt so alive.

T=6:00: I cleaned up a bit, drank a lot more water.  Occasional visual trails but they were receding.  I could remember the passwords to my devices again.  (Perhaps those had been the 'cryptographic keys' I imagined during the virtual interrogation scene; I had noticed at the time that I was unable to log into my devices and perhaps had mentally recast it as being willfully refusing to do so.  I was reminded of 'bicycle day' and how Albert Hofmann had thought that he was going mad on LSD and perceived his neighbor as a malevolent and persecuting witch.)  Occasional imagined alternate experiences and realities but they felt more controlled.  Before, they had felt entirely involuntary, like my conscious perceptions being forcibly re-initialized in another body or another time.  Now they were more faded, felt more like my imagination.  It was like the difference between a lucid dream and a directed visualization-- less comprehensive and realistic-seeming, but also much more controlled.

T=6:30: I reflected a bit on the experience.  The visual trails were very weak now.  I felt clean and cold but rather unkempt, the way I feel when I am getting over being sick with a high fever or after throwing up repeatedly from a stomach virus.  Like I was about to be healthy again.  I reflected on the historical connection between LSD and ergot poisoning, on my own speculations about the relationship between past experiences of feverish delirium and this experience with LSD.  I was tired but I felt peaceful and satisfied.  I went to sleep for about 12 hours.  I had been up all night tripping, though I was on a late schedule anyway.

T=18:30: I got up, took a shower, washed everything very thoroughly.  I was still feeling a bit unsteady in my body and mind.  I reexamined some of the assumptions I had identified toward the later part of the trip, particularly about social anxiety, and resolved again to focus on staying close to the people I care about.

T=19:00: I went out to my kitchen, drank some vegetable juice.  Normally I hate vegetable juice.  For some reason, it seemed to me rather arbitrary now whether people should drink fruit juice or vegetable juice or something else entirely, so I finished most of it.  Then I decided that it still tasted a bit disagreeable and threw the last quarter away.  Perhaps I was settling back into myself again.  Into this particular possible reality.  I had some cold pizza.  I've always liked cold pizza.

T=19:30: my roommate came out and we talked about society and the economy and experience for 3 hours.  I was astonished at how much was arbitrary, how much was a mere mathematical or biological/evolutionary or social consequence of something else arbitrary that had occurred before it.  This permeated discussions of economics, politics, business, finance, career development, recent scientific discoveries e.g. about exoplanets, social dynamics and sociology, etc.  I felt able to reexamine the world from a broader and less parochial perspective.  I kept watching and wondering if I would relapse or start seeing visual trails again, like I had read that people sometimes could.  I felt a bit unsteady.  For some reason I was better at making eye contact than I usually am; I decided that there was no reason why I shouldn't, and that old habits and anxieties need not dictate the future.  I admit I was a bit worried about suddenly relapsing into incurable insanity like some government propaganda psychedelic horror story, but nothing whatsoever happened and I was fine.  By the end of the discussion I felt great that I had engaged with someone intellectually so broadly.  Over the past couple of months we had only rarely spoken at length with one another, and usually about narrower subjects.

T=22:30: I had another snack, caught up on email, sent some messages to friends I wanted to talk to (not even about this experience; no one but me knows about it; I just wanted to stay in touch and hear from them again).

T=25:00: went to bed again, slept for about 8 hours.  Woke up feeling completely normal, but not depressed or anxious or worried about the future or my career or society anymore.  Realized that much of society and one's own environment and assumptions are arbitrary and malleable.  Reflected on a comment by Steve Jobs about Bill Gates: 'He'd be a broader guy if he had dropped acid once or gone off to an ashram when he was younger.'  Saw billionaires as still just nodes in the network distribution like us, just in different places in society, having gotten there on their own respective paths and courses through life.  I've met a few.  If I made it, I decided, I would be a philanthropist; if I didn't, I was content to watch the world turn with my friends.  Resolved to live life more focused on other people and experiences and intellectual contributions, and less focused on the narrow game of accumulating ever more money and buying larger properties to show off, less focused on rigid notions of career success or failure.  Above a certain point it doesn't even matter anymore.  Shredded the suicide note I had printed on my desk a few days earlier when I thought I could no longer live up to my own expectations; I had been obsessed with the idea of fitting into a pattern of career development and progression and felt that I was stalling out, that I couldn't go on anymore.  I remembered that some of the wealthiest and most famous people I knew had been poor and obscure at 35, and that fundamentally life need not be focused on money or fame anyway.  That staying in touch with other interesting people was far more important.  And I had been so arrogant in so many ways.  But now that seemed like just one of many possible former lives.  I wasn't depressed anymore.  LSD helped me see that my perspective and assumptions were merely one of an uncountably infinite set of possibilities and that I needn't be bound to my former self.  That it was better to begin a new life than end one that seemed to be going off the rails laid out for it.  LSD may well have saved my life.

That said, I remain deeply humbled and grateful that no damage appears to have been done.  My actions were reckless; I took at least twice as much as I should have without realizing that it took so long to kick in for me, having assumed stupidly that it was just weaker or more dilute than advertised.  Reading further, this appears to be a common mistake, and apparently the time of onset simply varies widely between people.  I do not regret being solo, though -- some of the experiences that I had would have been weaker or less authentic or overpoweringly embarrassing and anxiety-provoking had someone else been there observing, and had I not had to make my own way through.  I cannot say this is right for most people; frankly it probably isn't.  But even in the depths of delirium and insanity I have always been safe with myself.

I did not expect to have full-blown loss of self and ego death and a thousand alien reincarnations and significant insights about perceived reality and historical changes in the structure of society and the resolution of longstanding psychological issues and an improved social attitude from my first trip.  I was expecting to maybe see the walls appear to breathe like I had heard that they would, and maybe feel a bit more peaceful.  Oddly, they never did, but I was ultimately very much at peace with the experience, and with experience more generally.

I may never touch this substance again.  Many ancient cultures had one-time initiation rituals into their tribal religions, often as a rite of passage.  To me, this has been similar, to say nothing of the risks of what could have been.  But if things ever get as bad for me psychologically as they had been before this trip and I am seriously contemplating suicide again, years or decades from now, then perhaps I may consider it.  I had gone into this with the attitude of 'what do I have to lose?' and come away with the conclusion that life is amazing and wonderful even in its absurdity, that most of my issues were internal and solvable, that suffering is fundamentally dictated by one's perspective on impermanence, and that society and culture themselves are incredibly subjective and malleable.  I understand why psychiatrists experimented with this substance in therapeutic settings in the past.  But as with everything, the outcomes can be rather unpredictable.  My life and perspective as they had existed needed a shot of chaos, a perturbation in the path of the optimizer before it converged to a singularity-- and I am back in pursuit of my course through life now.

It was the last few hours of December 31st, 2017. On that same day, I had unexpectedly received an 125mcg LSD blotter from a friend of mine. Now I was in a hotel room, alone with my boyfriend (let's call him Jacob), and eager to have my first LSD experience. 

At 11PM, he cut away a little less than one quarter of the blotter and took it. I took the remaining three quarters. I was feeling extremely happy and excited, without a trace of negative affect in my mind. Earlier that day I had been a little sick, but not then. 

The first different sensation I had was at 11:40, when I noticed Jacob's phone looked 'deep.' A few minutes later, I got up from my sitting position, and remember saying I was 'feeling shorter.' All those different sensations were hilarious to me, and I couldn't stop laughing. 

Not long afterwards, I was already feeling very different. My capacity for movement was severely impaired, and I and Jacob were lying on the bed. I felt 'less conscious.' I felt very far away from reality, as if I was fading away from life  falling asleep or dying. 

My gastrointestinal system was feeling wild, and taking over my perception of the world. I felt endless loops of nausea and hunger that didn't seem to go away, even when, after much effort, I got up from the bed to eat a tangerine. 

Near midnight, Jacob carried me to a hammock outside for us to see the fireworks. I was already experiencing some interesting visual effects  namely, seeing patterns everywhere, in the clouds, the walls, and Jacob's hair. Most of those were several colorful Star of David, although there was much more as well. 

Jacob seemed more entertained by visuals than I was. At that moment, I was still feeling less conscious, far away from reality. 

'I am definitely experiencing negative affect,' I told Jacob, at some point, in the hammock, after the fireworks stopped. 'I feel nauseated, in a Star of David-shaped way. And it's really annoying, because I can't vomit in a Star of David-shaped way. I also have eight dimensional hunger and I can't eat in eight dimensions. I am not feeling good.' 

'But,' I thought to myself, 'this is really interesting. I am glad to know I am normally happy enough that I can afford to consciously inflict myself discomfort sometimes for the interestingness of it.' I thought to myself, 'this is really interesting. I am glad to know I am normally happy enough that I can afford to consciously inflict myself discomfort sometimes for the interestingness of it.' 

Later, I returned to the hotel room, intending on trying to vomit, and Jacob went to the pool. Upon arriving inside the room, however, I fell on the bed, and just stayed there, barely able to move. My visual field was taken over by endless loops of what was ahead of me. Any movement I tried to make seemed 'infinite.' There were colorful, classically psychedelic patterns everywhere, especially if I closed my eyes. Somewhere near me, Jacob's music was playing psychedelic music. 

'It's okay for me to just stay here,' I thought to myself. 'They won't mind, since she put me on acid.' 

I was briefly confused by that thought for a while. Who were 'they'? There was only me and Jacob in the private hotel space, and no one could see or get near us. But my mind had a quick answer. 'They  the people inside my mind. There are hundreds of them.' 

At that moment, I felt my identity, my self, shredding into many little pieces. Suddenly, I wasn't Mary anymore. I was only one thin layer of her self, out of the other hundreds that were observing me, including her herself, who wasn't me  who was just the person who put me on acid, without whom I wouldn't have been born. The layer I became had no gender identity  or perhaps leaned a little masculine. It was purely analytical, concerned with experiencing and understanding that profound experience. 

The endless loops of nausea and general gastrointestinal discomfort were still there. Still lying down, I turned my head to face the bathroom door. 'There are hundreds of people inside my mind, about half of whom are Jewish. The Jewish ones won't let me vomit.' 

It took a long time, but eventually I was inside the bathroom, trying to vomit. It was impossible. The vomit was Star of David-shaped, it couldn't go through my throat. I sat down on the floor at some point, and got entertained by the tiling of the wall of the bathroom. It felt infinite, as if it extended into all dimensions. 

'Don't make yourself mad,' I thought to myself. 'You're just experiencing acute 5-HT2A receptor agonism. 5-HT2A receptor agonism, 5-HT2A receptor agonism, 5-HT2A receptor agonism.' I looked at the mirror, and experienced some gender dysphoria. The 'layer' of identity I was wasn't as feminine as the reflection I saw. I ended up returning to the bed, and just stayed there, unable to do much. 

Jacob came back from the pool. He was smiling at me. At that moment, he felt to me like a little child, who knew nothing about the profundity and importance and significance of what my mind was going through. That sensation just grew as the hours passed. 

He lay on the bed, and started touching me. But any time he tried to, I screamed 'Don't touch me! Don't touch me!,' what was rather confusing for me. Usually, I love being touched by him, and usually, I'm a very agreeable person. 'Sorry,' I said. 'When you touch me, it feels infinite, and that bothers me. You should touch me finitely and absolutely, not infinitely.' 

Jacob seemed entertained by sensorial experiences. We spent a while not talking much, just experiencing our trips. Anytime I did say something, however, during the entire trip, it was just as strange as what I said before. Jacob didn't seem to mind, but his experience was different enough that anything he said sounded extremely normal and sober. 

As time passed, I lost more and more of my Mary identity. 'I'm not who I thought I was,' I told Jacob. At some point, I nicknamed myself  or rather, who I was at the time  as 'The Acidmost Layer.' I could still feel all the other layers of my identity inside me  but they weren't being experienced, I wasn't being them at the time. They were hundreds of people, 'half of whom were Jewish, eighty-four of whom wanted infinite tangerines.' 

The Acidmost Layer wasn't female, and didn't love Jacob. Those few hours during which I was 'it' were the only period of time I didn't act or feel romantically around Jacob. I didn't feel anything for him, and I didn't want him to touch me. I saw him as an 'annoying soberperson' saying naive sober things, having annoying soberpenis needs, which I needed to attend to because Mary, who had put me on acid, loved him. Technically speaking, he was on around 30mcg of acid and having wild sensorial experiences, but as I vocalized at some point, 'anyone who doesn't have at least 300 people inside their minds is super extremely sober by my standards.' 

We stayed on the bed without saying much, each enraptured by their own experience. I had a strong feeling of significance, importance, and profundity, as if what I was going through was the most important and meaningful thing in the world and anyone who wasn't or hadn't experienced it was eternally naive and ignorant. That felt strange, since the feeling of significance didn't accompany any specific thoughts or insights. I seldom used words to think. Jacob attempted to have sex with me at some point, and I dodged him away, which is something unusual for me. 

After a while, and much effort, we went to the fancy hotel bathtub, and turned on the bubbles. 

He was enraptured by the bubbles, and I was still feeling analytical, serious, with my hand in my chin, as if I was contemplating the most important philosophical questions of the universe. 'There are so many questions,' I said at some point, although I didn't know what were those questions. 'Do you have the answers, soberperson?' 

But the things Jacob said almost all were very sober, normal, rational  relating to the real world and its events. That annoyed me somewhat, and strengthened my resolve to refer to him as 'soberperson.'

At some point, the shape of the bubbles reminded me of Mary, the woman who'd put me on acid, without whom I wouldn't have been born. 'She loves you,' I told Jacob. 'She loves you a lot. But she's not here. That is, she's not being experienced now. Mary exists in the future, and in the past.'

'I can feel her, right now, I can feel her inside my mind, remembering this moment, from the future, thousands of times. She's remembering this moment thousands of times. I can feel it. That's the only sense in which she exists at this moment, as someone in the future remembering this, and I can feel it very strongly.'

'How is Mary from the future?' Asked Jacob. 

'She's great. She's happy. She loves you, a lot. All the thousands of her's. But she doesn't exist right now.'

Several minutes of outward and inward silence passed, until I noticed, examining the bubbles, that my mind was less crowded with people. 

'They're pleased with me.' I said. 'The people inside my mind, I pleased them. They left me, as did the curse of the eternal Star of David nausea but they still won't let me sleep, I don't think. But let's get a spaceship and go to bed. I want to talk to the other ones.' 

With 'the other ones' I was referring to my internet friends, to whom I reported some of my experiences once we were back to the bed. I didn't call them 'them' because 'them' during my trip referred exclusively to the hundreds of people inside my mind. 

After a while, I and Jacob had sex. But I was completely apathetic, still, and silent  I was The Acidmost Layer, who didn't identity as female, didn't like Jacob, and was only doing it out of a sense of felt obligation towards the 'soberperson who is here because Mary loves him.' 

The Acidmost Layer didn't have love, positive affect, desire, kindness, or femininity. The Acidmost Layer was a purely analytical philosopher, and the aforementioned characteristics were things it strongly associated with Mary. 

'I have to enjoy the most out of this while the gates to the truth are still open' I said. 'They'll close soon, for a long time, and Mary will be back.' 

The gates closed sooner than I expected. At about 6AM, Mary started coming back. The several people inside my mind slowly merged into one, my happiness came back strongly, as did my love and kindness. I started kissing and touching Jacob again, and eventually, we had sex. 'This is amazing,' I thought. 'It's so much better to be me than The Acidmost Layer.'

Hello Friends.  After four years, and many other voyages into psychedelic wonder, I'm going to tell those to whom it may concern about my first experience with LSD. Here goes.  It was a dark and snowy night in my humble abode by the river.  After repeatedly mentioning my interest in LSD over a year or so, my druggist (I'll call him Sunny) came over with the goods.  Ten colorful hits of blotter in the cutest little 1/2' single hit ziplocks and some Blueberry Afghani Hash Plant. I tried to stay calm, but deep down I knew I hadn't the faintest Idea what to expect.  It was 9:30 PM by the time we ate our paper.  I started off with one hit and Sunny (I believe) had two.  No turning back... this excited me. You see, if anything fascinates me in this world, it's the unknown, and personal revelations that challenge what's socially accepted and/or lawful (as well as physically/mentally/spiritually possible).  I played the waiting game for 45 minutes before deciding maybe it was weak material, and I took another hit on Sunny's suggestion.  Not long after (10-15 min), I started feeling the 'rising vibes'.  Chills, shivers, and an unexplainable inner expansion.  Fiddling around with my iPhone, the icons began to bounce around and dance lightly as I stared in amazement.  Knowing that the effects I was feeling were only the onset of the first hit caused an excitement that still gives me chills.  What was I in for when the second dose took effect?  What would happen during the PEAK?  This was around the time my two roommates and another friend left the house, uncomfortable with the thought of spending hours on end with a couple of dosed dudes.  I don't blame them.  They don't experiment with substances that may affect the boundaries of what goes through their minds.  Their loss, though upon reflection, we may have been better off with a sober sitter or two. 

So, Sunny and I were now alone.  I had mixed feelings about this.  Sunny had buttloads of experience with LSD which calmed me, but he was also known to be quite immature, and a wild party animal, and I really didn't know what acid would do to two dudes cooped up alone.  These sorts of thoughts started running through my mind.  Considering all the infinite possibilities led to uncertainty, but the further along we were, the more I put my trust in Sunny to know what was good for me 'My first time on acid' (in quotations because this phrase was a repeated theme for us).  This trust would be challenged and twisted, and thoughts of betrayal caused the most unsettling times of the night.  Sunny suggested that it might not be a bad idea to relax and watch a movie.  I agreed, and started going through my collection. Nothing too complicated, sinister, or disgusting.  I could imagine with each title what I figured it would be like to watch each one.  Wild Boyz was a particularly off-putting possibility.  I knew there were certain triggers that could potentially cause a horrible experience, and just seeing Steve-O's face was probably one of those triggers.  I finally landed on 'Back to the Future' which Sunny somehow knew I wouldn't be able to handle.  Poppycock!  I put it in, started her up, and didn't make it through the first 20 minutes.  Doc's face began to bubble and warp and I thought for sure I was going to throw up or void-bowel in my pants if I had to watch the whole movie.  With a sense of urgency I took it out, and told Sunny surely he could pick the perfect movie for 'My first time on acid'.  

While he did that, I went to the bathroom when I felt like I may have to urinate.. It was a strange sensation, like I may already be peeing my pants, or could lose control of my bladder at any moment.  I had been queezified by the sight of a mutating bubbling human head with wispy white hair.  So I figured my best bet was to take my mind off it and take a break from my company.... and possibly vomit.  but walking through the house quickly brought me to a better state of mind.  Once inside the bathroom, my trip went all 'cats' on me.  Not the musical (thank God). But I was looking and peeing down into the toilet bowl and the shape of the hole in the bottom was transformed into the mouth of a cat lapping up my yellow stream.  This completely captivated and showed me that the normally unseen was on my side, ready to drink my urine should I require it to.  Hesitantly, I looked in the mirror above the sink and initially saw my face with every pore and detail. My face then grew whiskers and stripes and became a Tiger face.  Not realistic, but it looked like an asian style tiger face tattoo I've seen. It surprised me how level headed I was at this time and how enjoyable it was to be seeing all these things transformed to cats.  Being turned into a tiger was a pretty rad idea to me. I think I also enjoyed being alone, by this time I had probably been in the bathroom for 10 minutes just gazing in wonder as the world became a living thing with a vivid imagination. I think I also enjoyed being alone, by this time I had probably been in the bathroom for 10 minutes just gazing in wonder as the world became a living thing with a vivid imagination. 

I came back out of the bathroom and told Sunny-boy about the sights I'd been seeing.  He burst into intense laughter when he heard about the toilet quenching itself upon my bodily fluid like a happy feline.  (I've seen certain toilets with the same shape of hole in the bottom and always get reminded of that feeling).. I have never made anyone laugh that hard before or since, he was hysterical.  It was time to smoke a bowl.  And since my roommates were gone we allowed ourselves to smoke in the house, scream at the tops of our lungs, pace endlessly between the kitchen and living room, and fully let the Acid have its way....  After the bathroom, the bowl, and some quick conversation about how we were 'living like young kings' Sunny had picked out Grandma's Boy to watch... I had seen it once after some drinking games so I didn't remember it well.. why did I own it?..  My peak came and went during the movie, and I remember being quite out of it, and felt myself becoming involved in the emotions and circumstances of the characters.  I can recall some very vivid, fully lifelike visuals during the movie of smoke and mirrors and characters doing things that I knew didn't actually happen during the movie (interacting with me, bursting into group laughter, creeping around trying to trick me into something).  Eventually I came to the conclusion that I didn't like movies like that because they seem like a side-show of people willing to make fools of themselves in front of a camera for a cheap laugh and a bunch of money.  It makes me that much more appreciative of those artists who have the creativity and talent to blow your mind when they put in the time and effort..  oh and speaking of mind-blowing, once my mind was back to being unoccupied, I realized the extent of the effects in real life and knew I wouldn't be going to sleep any time soon.  

I started to feel uncomfortable and attributed it to my unclean house.. Dust on the window sill, possible mold and mildew, un-fresh air.. and a tripping partner with whom I wasn't all that familiar with.. Sweet Susie, what had I got myself into?  I recall standing and looking at Sunny for what seemed like quite a long time and thinking about how to go about getting rid of him should his presence become undesirable.  Little did I know my thoughts were becoming a threat to him, and before I knew it I was pondering the best place to go to dispose of his body (just in case), and was getting a look from Sunny like, 'OK man I can read your mind and you're really scaring me silly right now...'  He had an extremely uncomfortable/nervous grin on his face.  This was unacceptable, and I realized there would be no need to resort to violence.  We were in this together and would finish this together one way or another..  What to do in the meantime was now the issue at hand.  We sat on the couch and pondered the possibilities for 'my first time on acid'.  

As I looked out the window at the snow on the ground, I felt that I noticed detail in things that I would never see in a state of normalcy.  The window itself took on new meaning as I thought about the molecular structure, the density of it's matter, and the relative permanence of it's structure so long as nothing busted through it.  A tiny crack in the window was particularly interesting, and seemed to represent imperfection, and I began to wonder about the meaning of this revelation.  I have considered myself a Christian since my early teens, but have since begun to question the accuracy, intention, and understanding of the biblical authors.  The trip helped me to more fully understand the infinite nature of God, and though I may never know the full extent, this was a glimpse beyond my previous understanding.  I felt a personal connection to divine forces that some may never even dream of (why on earth is this even frowned upon?).  My personal view of God is that, yes it exists, and is everything, but may be in a process of purifying itself through humanity.  I could go on, but it may not be worth pondering such deep topics until next trip (or after life?).

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

And speaking of trips.. This is about the time when Sunny and I agreed we were coming down enough to go for a wintery ride in my trusty four wheel drive.  Everything remained at a higher intensity, yet the visuals had died down mostly.  But as we got out on the road, the car in front of us began to morph into a cat's face like the many other's I'd seen thus far.  It was a Honda CRX, and it seemed to have a happily menacing expression.  I'm reminded of the saying 'While the cat's away the mouse will play'.  And though I was in a potentially dangerous situation, I felt like I was in complete physical control, and felt at play.  Not being reckless, or even careless, I noticed I was nearly out of gas.  On top of that, I had no means of paying for gas on my person.  These facts caused a wave of fear and paranoia.  The thought of being pulled over terrified me, so we made a very short drive back home.  (I recommend not driving while on LSD, or any other intoxicant for that matter)

Upon returning home, I wanted nothing more than to lie down and rest.  Sunny tried talking me out of it, I suspect because he didn't want to be alone.  But I couldn't be persuaded.  I went to lie down in bed and watch The Big Lebowski (one of my all time favorites) on my laptop.   For a while I looked at the ceiling of my room in the dark and saw a detailed pattern of pac-man shaped figures, mouths perpetually chomping, filled in with the waving stars and stripes of the American flag.  This was accompanied with apprehension for the election of Barack Obama.  I felt like he was only elected to further the consumption agenda of the political elite who take advantage of the working class to the greatest extent possible.   Wherever there are people willing to work, there are those who will say and do anything to create a life of luxury for themselves on others' sweat and blood, while dismissing the notion of equality.  Money in this case is the means of exploitation.  May God have mercy on the poor souls who have no Idea of the corruption causing their misery and unfulfilled lives.  I pray the tables will turn and the lies will be transparent to the truthful, rendering the liars powerless. 

This is where I lose consciousness, and drift into sleep. I'm guessing the trip lasted 8-10 hours, and when I woke up, I was not at baseline, but felt an energy that shielded me from negative thought.  Sunny and I watched a live concert DVD of Led Zeppelin, and discussed drug use by bands of their hayday.  The legend of Jimi Hendrix onstage with a handfull of acid tabs under his sweaty headband.  The retreats made by Led Zeppelin to create the inspired music which I believe is empowering to the inquiring listener.  We sat and smoked the rest of the cannabis, and if there was a state of being that could be sustained indefinitely, I would choose this.  Calm, Peaceful, Bliss.

Thanks for taking the time to read.  May this life be a continual blessing to you and yours.

Before this incident I had never done LSD before but was by no means unexperienced with hallucinogens or just about everything short of highly addictive drugs(heroin, meth, crack).  I spent my last two years in highschool stoned and taking anything I could get my hands on (now a sophomore in college).  Near the end of senior year I quit drugs all together for a while.  Even stopped drinking coffee.  I would do this on and off for a couple months going back and forth from sober and being high on something from when I woke up until bed.  Each time going back to drugs I would just get worse and worse, (most regular substances- always had marijuana, addicted to diphenhydramine and would take pseudoephedrine and drink coffee to stay awake, and drank 5 days a week or so, smoked salvia almost daily for a while) just destroying my brain (my vision had been screwed up for a while now (hppd) and whatever other damage was done).  I must mention I suffered from severe depression for many years and drugs were my escape.  I knew I had a bad problem and kept trying to stop but  well, you know how it works. 

Anyway, I got out of college freshmen year and was high for about a month and a half before a friend got some acid and wanted to trip.  I always wanted to try it so I was excited and Im pretty sure we took it the night he got it.  I put one tab in my mouth at around 8 and the next at about 9:30 maybe.  My friend took them both at about 9. Before I took the second, I was tripping about as hard as I ever had, not expecting what was going to come.  Little did I know it was some ridiculously strong acid.  As the second one hit me, I started to tweak out, and couldnt sit still.  I was coming up too fast and I was with drunk people so I went outside with my friend.  It was then that it all hit me.  It must have been about 10:30 now.  I was experiencing a level of existence I never thought possible.  For measure, anything I felt remotely close to this was when I took about 4 grams of mushrooms, smoked a gram of sour diesel(strong weed) and took a couple hits of 20x salvia.  I usually worry about focusing on something negative around this time and getting depressed which has happened a couple times on mushrooms before.  That wasnt the case seeing as though I wasnt capable of creating a thought that made sense to me.   I would look up at the stars and be right next to them looking down at the earth from outer space.  Cars in the driveway were floating around and would move as I pushed them Id like to see what that looked like to a sober person.  I loved it to say the least.  My friend was running around with me having a similar experience. 

For those who know hallucinogens, this was just the chaotic onset.  When I peaked my ability to think came back to me and all I could think was WHAT THE FUCK DID I GET MYSELF INTO?  Why would I pay to feel like this?  The irony of it all is that I had spent the last couple years trying to numb my thoughts.  Trying to render myself unable to think about the problems in my life. Hiding from them.  Now is the part of tripping my friends and I like to call living hardcore but of course this time it was much more intense than ever before.  The physical me sat crouched in between two cars looking as depressed and confused as one could possibly look. Mentally the metaphysical me, the metaphysical human mind, all of life, all possibilities.  I was remembering that I am everything, I am god, I make everything happen, and I am every single person.  time is no more.  My body is no more. What senses one choses to feel no longer limits one. One is no longer on earth. One are no longer ones self.  One is no longer anything.  And then One make the most terrifying realization.  More terrifying than death.  One are completely alone.  Entirely the only thing thats real.  Alone  Hahaha, its maddening.  

And as I write this I bring myself back to this oh so uncomfortable place and fight the urge to realize the futility in trying to use the limited median of language to express something I already know, to myself. 

Oh Id been in this state before this day a couple times before, and I blocked it completely out of my mind.  This time I was going to accept it though.  I knew what I had to do something.  Anything at all.  It was like I had just been born again and everything was entirely new to me as I slowly rebuilt reality as I knew it. The next 12 or so hours I did everything I used to do as a kid and spent the entire time outside rediscovering all the joy from doing things I thought I was no longer interested in.  And over the next month I slowly grounded myself to where I felt like Id fully adjusted to my new mindset.  And here I am.  Though I cant say entirely how, I have been living life as a completely different person.  Previously afraid of being alone and separated lonely and depressed.  Now accepting the fact that if I love others and everything else, Im loving myself.  Be kind to ones self and feel the goodness in everything.  Happiness is subjective and its difficult to remember that.  I did go back to drugs but only for three days, and immediately felt them pull me back to my depressed state of mind.  Its been about three months since I last abused drugs, and four since this experience,  and Im more together and happier than Ive been in for as long as I can remember. 

And for the record, if you met me, I wouldnt seem crazy.

I'm riding shotgun next to my friend Chris. Connor and Ted are in the back. This will be their first night meeting my long time friend, Lucy.

We arrive and head straight to the basement, it's about 9:30. Ted airs his anxieties about tripping tonight, we talk him into it. The basement is spacious with a large tv and some black-lighted sublime posters on the wall, we are so ready. I put a tab under my tongue and we go for a walk. The others choose to wait. It is a temperate night in the fall and mostly dark. We walk around the neighborhood, Chris has a pipe and some weed. They smoke up behind some building in a small patch of woods and we head back to the street. I did not participate as I have given up weed. Rings and halos are appearing around houselights, most people are still awake.

30 minutes after leaving the house we are back. Ted and Connor pop a tab in their mouth and Chris contemplates putting it in water and re-dosing throughout the night. He ends up drinking it all. We turn on adventure time, pupils massive, bodies full of anticipation, we watch.

I am standing by the wall, flailing my arms claiming these jumping jacks will get me jacked. Chris seems very in control, I inwardly doubt that he is tripping while Ted and Connor giggle on the couch. By this time everything is green and red. I'm on the phone with a friend, asking him to come and hangout with us. Connor and Ted seem to be having the same experience as me, Chris still appears sober. 

We are melting into the couch and each other, discussing what we had read online about LSD. I repetitively state, possibly in my mind, that I feel like a puddle in the middle of the ocean.  Suddenly 'Chris, come up here' - we are all terrified. However, he returns, a champion, holding a large bowl of popcorn and bearing the news that his parents are going to bed. We rejoice and revel at the fact that Chris talked to his parents on LSD. I continue to doubt he is tripping. 

I assume it is now hour and a half after I dropped and an hour after my friends did. We have now talked to many friends over the phone asking for food and company but receive neither. We feel content and blissful and Chris now shows signs of tripping. We begin to venture off the couch and around the room resulting in wondrous discoveries such as the floor being completely covered in Connor's flowing mullet, later identified as the carpet. 

The idea of recording our experience in a series of quotes is born. While walking past an artificial plant Connor lifts it from the ground and spins in a circle, enthusiastically stating that he could 'dance one million plants'. I am in the bathroom peeing, it is beautiful, a stark white with a small green plant on the toilet bowl and a recessed light shining down on it. Ted approaches me from behind and requests a 'non-gay size comparison'. I turn him down and go about my business. Prior to this I had experience with LSD and others having bad trips but was not well versed and researched. We noticed Ted staring into the mirror, unaware of the danger this posed, we let it happen. 

After watching the toilet flush multiple times we return to the couch and all seemed well. Ted sets up his phone on the tv stand to record us, we later find out it was facing the wrong way. Chris begins to show us scientific drawings and shit that he has because he's a smart guy. At the time they seemed fantastic, Ted takes his own shot at a breakthrough and writes 'pInk' on a piece of paper in pink marker. Later, Ted goes to the bathroom and returns claiming to have no idea who he is and requests to be called plant, reacting very negatively to the name Ted. He showed signs of ego loss such as speculating what his life had been up until this point and what he should do with it now. 

I request taking a walk but at this point Ted is anxious and seemingly overwhelmed. After accepting that he was truly Ted he began to act strangely. He curled up on the floor when we suggested going outside. When I asked if we could turn the lights on he said he would scream, which he actually followed through on. Not taking the situation seriously I did not handle this as I should have. Standing by the door we contemplated moving the blinds, we were to varying degrees convinced that outside this door was outer space.

We then chose to watch trippy videos we had seen before. They took on a new layer of hilarious as we were catapulted into another peak by the psychedelic, whirling images. A plate of spaghetti flashes across the screen and about 30 seconds later Ted yells for us to check out this spaghetti, he operated on somewhat of a delay for a short period of time. 

Going outside was a bittersweet decision. The night was beautiful and the grass lush and damp. Ted sat in dog poop. The others then smoked another bowl in the front yard. Ted decided to run down the street and we found that terrifying experience enough incentive to return inside. At one point Ted grabbed my phone without us noticing and called a girl I was talking to at the time explaining 'don't tell Alex but I never took any acid, he'll be angry with me' he told her he believed we were conspiring against him. Shortly after coaxing him into unlocking the bathroom I saw him staring into the mirror. The facial expression he was making did not match the reflection. I will never forget the horror of thinking I had caused one of my best friends to go insane.

After leaving the bathroom he called my father, the time was 3 in the morning. He left desperate video messages to himself describing a key to life, trying to make the trip something it wasn't going to be. This lasted a fair amount of time.

We were at a lull near the end of the peak or starting to come down when we ventured outside again. I then noticed Connor had become anxious when thinking about his duties tomorrow and worried that this may never end. I wished it wouldn't. I vainly attempting to explain that we don't have to worry, this is chemically induced and that until it wears off and our city wakes up we have the world to ourselves. Connor obsessively stared at the LSD time chart on a reputable website. Chris later brought to my attention that he believed Connor to be anxious for much of the night and that could've been possibly what negatively impacted Ted.

I decided I would take some responsibility as an experienced tripper and take them on walks to ease their worries as we came down. The soundness of my decision-making is debatable as I split up the group. I worried that Ted would run away and not only would I be at fault for supplying and pressuring him into acid but also being the one watching him when he got lost. 

Walk 1: Ted and I ventured onto the street which was illuminated an ample amount by lights outside houses. I spoke with him about the beauty of nature. I told him that this is the pinnacle of our lives right now, spending the night with our friends tripping. I desperately felt the need to convince him that he had to enjoy this because we would remember this moment forever, which I believe I will. While admiring the beauty and getting farther from the house Chris and Connor resided in I began to fear Ted believed we were out to get him and would try to kill me. Obviously this suspicion was greatly increases by the acid. We returned to find Chris on his laptop and Connor staring at the time chart, worried he would be this way forever. I believe Ted was significantly calmed down from our one on one time.

Walk 2: I took Chris for a walk and had a similar experience as I did with Ted. Describing natures beauty and the wonder of what God had created. He expressed to me that he felt very in control throughout the trip. He acted as if he had a significant amount of experience. We spoke about the potential for this chemical and what we could do with it. We were both eager to repeat this experience.

Walk 3: I convinced Connor to go on a walk with me. He was my closest friend and the one I had been friends with the longest. I desperately did not want this walk to end. We spoke about how this would end and that we would be fine to do what we had to the next day. He was much calmer after this. A slight rain had started and being fans of Chance the Rapper we sang a few bars of acid rain. I was in awe of the beauty of God's world. I gave him my sweatshirt and walked around the mist, my cold feet on the road and chilly torso meant nothing as me and my best friend walked around the most peaceful neighborhood on earth, in a light rain during our comedown. 

Upon returning everyone was in high spirits, we layed around a Bluetooth and listened to Chance the Rapper, discussing what had happened. Ted apologized for ruining it for us. He blamed himself while none of us did. I blame myself to this day for his and Connor's bad experiences. We returned to the couches, while they tried to sleep, I desperately did not want my trip to end. A bottle of Gatorade filled with water sat on the floor and Connor drank it, it didn't taste right. I tried a small sip and could not place the flavor. Ted tried it and loved it, gulping down half the bottle. Connor panicked thinking it was the water Chris had put his tab in. After Ted had drank a considerable amount of the water we concluded it to be water from a swimming pool.

We parted ways around 8:30-9 am, time had somehow seemed to be dragged on forever while simultaneously flying by. Connor and I had a field trip that morning. Returning home I still felt a glowing body high and had minor visual distortions. I parachuted two Vicodin to attempt to keep the trip alive. I believe this is what caused my visual distortions and body high to persist until 3 pm.

As a consequence to this trip Connor is no longer interested in psychedelics. Ted is on the fence about another excursion into the world of LSD. Chris and I have used the fear that resulted from Ted almost losing his identity as motivation. We are now incredibly well versed on all drugs, especially those we plan on doing. Chris is very interested in tripping in the future and my insatiable thirst for psychedelics and transcendence are stronger than they previously were.

I always work at 8 oclock on Saturday mornings at Chuck E. Cheeses. The job has always been fun because I work in the kitchen with a lot of my friends and the managers there are amazing. I have been working there for a while and the job is basically second nature, so I thought Id try to have a little bit of fun. One Friday night a friend of mine told me he had some LSD but didnt want to take it anymore, so he sold it to me so I could see if I could successfully have an acid trip during work the next day. Now I am by no means a drug addict, or anything like that, but I do like to experiment with different types of drugs, especially psychedelics to explore my mind and learn more about myself and my environment. 

I woke up the next morning at 6:45, just like every other Saturday morning to prepare for work. I took a shower, made breakfast, and got in my car almost forgetting the two magical pieces of paper wrapped in aluminum foil in my wallet. I put the LSD on my tongue on the way to work, knowing it wouldnt kick in for about another half hour or so. Luckily there was another guy opening in the kitchen with me so it wouldnt be too ridiculously busy. I took care of a few things that needed to be done before anything, like sweeping the parking lot and stocking up on all of the toppings for the day. Then came time to roll out dough. This is usually an easy task, but this was not a usual morning. The LSD had started to take effect. 

The uneasiness of realizing how intense acid really is is a feeling you dont soon forget. Its like climbing to the top of the biggest slide at the playground, and then looking down nervously to see how high the slide actually is. I walked to the bathroom to try and cope with what was happening to my body and mind. I had to get over this feeling so I could get to work. I sat down on the sink to try and catch my breath when I started to hallucinate. The tiles on the bathroom floor danced in a very peculiar way. They moved right on beat with the thoughts racing a mile a minute in my head. Seeing this ballroom of waltzing tiles calmed me down enough to go back into the kitchen and try to get back to work.

By the time I took control of what was going on customers and more employees had started to arrive. The first order of the morning came up, and I took some pizzas off the dough rack to sauce and cheese. The color and texture of the sauce was very strange. As I looked down the line of toppings, they all seemed to turn animated, like a poor cartoon drawing. I started to laugh to myself at the sight of it all, and the more I laughed the funnier everything became. As the smell of fresh baked pizzas filled the kitchen I realized why I was feeling so uneasy; I hadnt eaten all day. So I threw some breadsticks in the oven to have something to snack on. Just then one of my good friends who also works at Chuck E. Cheeses came in, coincidentally she is also the girl I have been secretly in love with for about a year. We always flirt at work so I ran up to her and threw my arms around her. It felt like my arms had stretched out to wrap around her tiny body two or three times and I squeezed her tight. As I let go of her she looked at me and smiled the prettiest smile I had ever seen. She seemed to have a sort of extra glow about her today, I couldnt put my finger on it. Whatever it was, I really liked it. The weariness of the acid had almost immediately vanished and I was comfortable again.

Then I went to the sink to wash my hands and saw a glorious light show. The water splashing about on the stainless steel sink made a rainbow of colors only seen in space. I had never seen anything so beautiful and vibrant. I had always been a sucker for pretty colors, but this rendered me utterly speechless. I ate my breadsticks with a huge grin on my face, replaying the beautiful colors along with my friends gorgeous smile in my head and felt a satisfaction like I had never felt before. It felt like there had been something missing, an empty part of myself that had been filled by these images and the warm breadsticks. I was extremely thirsty and decided I would go out into the dining room to get a drink and take a look around at all the kids and families laughing and playing.

The instant I opened the swinging kitchen door and saw the mess of screaming children and the personified rodent robots playing goofy songs about pizza and games I couldnt control my laughter. It was such an embarrassing laugh that I had to immediately run back in the kitchen so nobody else would hear. When I came back into the kitchen however, the laughter immediately stopped. It seemed I had entered a different place completely. There was a mixed tape of 90s hip-hop and great dance hits from the past decade blaring from the speakers in every corner of the kitchen. It looked like twice as many people in the kitchen then there really were, and Im sure the music was nowhere near as loud as I remember it. But it no longer looked like the standard kitchen scene at Chuck E. Cheeses, but rather a giant house party. Everyone was dancing around and singing, having the time of their lives.

Time was flying by, and before I knew it about four hours had passed since I had gotten to work. I was reaching the climax of the LSD experience soon, I could tell. The dishes needed to be washed and I didnt want to have the responsibility of making or cutting pizzas at this point, so I quickly volunteered to take care of that. The stack of large pizza trays was taller than I was, so I knew I was going to be stuck at the sink for a while. I didnt look at the clock before I started washing the dishes but Im guessing it took me a good two hours to finish. Cleaning the sinks was the best part about doing dishes that day. I used a small squeegee to get all of the water off the sides of the sinks and again saw the beautiful display of colors only seen before by the Hubble telescope. The colors intrigued me so much I spent close to another thirty or forty minutes throwing soap and water on the sides of the sink and making invisible light patterns with a dirty rag. Im sure everyone at work thought I was mentally insane that day, but thankfully nobody said anything.

I finally finished the dishes and realized I still hadnt gotten a drink. I got all of my laughs out before going out in the dining room this time, and seriously prepared to witness the mayhem of Chuck E. Cheeses on LSD. Grabbing my cup, I stumbled out in the madness. The atmosphere was more painful than I remembered. About five times as many screaming kids had arrived, each with two arguing parents. The music playing on the PA was loud and painful; I couldnt wait to get back into the kitchen. I walked to the soda fountain staring at my feet the entire way hoping no ex-acid head from the 60s would sense what sort of influence I was under. I quickly scurried back into the kitchen after saying hello to the girl who had been in my head all morning. 

I did it! I had survived the most chaotic scene I had ever witnessed in my life. I was not prepared, however for the change of scenery in the kitchen. The music had been turned off and everyone was diligently working. Everyone was assisting everyone do everything. I had never seen so much order and perfect work structure before. It was too strange so I closed my eyes and shook my head, hoping to erase the scene like an Etch-A-Sketch. Sure enough it worked. The scene now was kind of familiar. I knew I had been a part of it before, but it was still new. Then I figured it out, I had seen this in a dream before! Not only had I dreamt it before but it was a recurring dream. And not only was it a recurring dream but it was the subconscious vision I would picture every time somebody said the word pizza. It was the typical pizza place. Everybody seemed to be on roller skates. Im not sure if its because of how they were walking or because of the queer scenery I was imagining.

Before I knew, it was time to leave. I couldnt leave without saying goodbye to my friend, so I searched all over for her. Finally I found her and told her all of the strange things I had witnessed throughout the day. She still had that beautiful glow about her, and I couldnt take it anymore, she was too beautiful. I said goodbye and turned around to leave, when I felt her expression change and saw her glow change from a gorgeous red to a soft blue. I wasnt sure what that glow meant, much less the change in color of the glow, but I knew I had to change it back. I turned back around and looked her in eyes and kissed her on her lips like something you would see in a Cary Grant flick, very classy. As I walked out of Chuck E. Cheeses that day I felt a warm sense in the air, and everything around had a tiny hint of the bright shade of red that radiated from my loves lips.

My brother was supposed to leave me alone, but at the last moment he said he had to stay home as he didn't have anywhere to go. I didn't want this to ruin my plans, so decided to still take the trip (although it did have a major influence on my experience). I also noticed the effect of many other external factors as well, like people I hang out with, things Im reading, my feelings, and of course the music, although unconsciously there must've been many more. 

First I wanted to meditate for a while, but was quite excited so couldn't really get to it. I put the new Furious cd (Supremacy) and took the trip at around 10PM. Immediately after taking the blotter I started feeling cold and shivering and my heart started to race. I usually experience that when coming up, but here it was so immediate that it had to be a placebo effect, mostly due to excitement and a bit of anxiety because of my brother's presence. A bit later I started to feel the substance going through my body, through each vein, which goes along with the change of focus from the body to the mind. Those feelings are pretty usual for me, but in order to describe the whole trip as accurately as possible I feel it should be mentioned If only for the sake of people reading who have possibly never taken acid. After the substance is integrated, those effects disappear and the focus shifts to the mind and/or spirit. 

I've tried to write some important points down, but found it quite hard and felt it was more important to stay focused on the music, so most of those things I've written are my impressions from after the trip. 

After the Furious cd, I put the new Osom cd on (Midnight's shared blossom) and it started to play just at the moment where my experience was the most intense, here there was a duality as the trip became more intense due to the intensity of the music, whilst the musics intensity increased due to the trip.

First I started exploring with the lights for a while. Initially tuned on the UV black light and lay on my bed looking at quite a scary poster with my head facing up. I felt so comfortable in that position that I found it quite hard to move, but knew it would be less beneficial to my trip, so I made myself. The mere UV light (even without tripping) let's us discover many things on the psychedelic posters that aren't easily noticeable otherwise (like the Theologist by Alex Grey where the line of energy coming from the third eye and the bulb of energy surrounding him becomes much clearer). However, the backdrops that were the brightest and most fluorescent were the ones that have the least to show (which can be compared to full on music and which precisely came from the period when I listened to it), These pictures, of mushrooms, Krishna and one of the ॐ sign, werent something I wished to be distracted by so I turned the light off. There was one poster, the Celestial tree by Venosa which I did intend to explore, but I felt it could wait till another time.

Afterwards I went to the toilet and had to turn the light on. On the ground I noticed many little beings, some insects, but also some beings we usually don't notice, I thought I was seeing even the tiniest bacteria and particles. When I returned into my room and turned the light on, I noticed the same thing on the floor and on the bed. Is our vision really so sharpened under the influence of LSD or are they just an expression of my fears? On the one side, they were frightening, I wanted to clean before lying down again, but on the other side they were an expression of such a rich invisible world, living side by side with ourselves and I thought they shouldn't bother me, I should let them live and accept them as a necessary part of our universe. However, those little animals also show something else, something about myself. Whether it is that I'm trying too hard to get rid of things I find impure in my life, that it isn't the right time yet and maybe I should be accepting them, or alternatively that there are things I find impure that I should precisely get rid of or it could also be both, depending on what it is about. 

I didn't want to get distracted by the particles again and wanted to concentrate on the music mostly, so I turned the light off, this time for good. That's where the chaos and internal, but very real visions started. First of all I noticed how every little beat and every little second in the music is important (there are many subtleties we hardly even notice, but the track would loose it's meaning if it weren't for them) and how it's the same in life, every little movement we make makes a change. That's why we should always be careful with the decisions we make, although it isn't so clear how to decide. I think it depends on our level of consciousness. People who are more conscious can rely on their intuition in order to make decisions, but people who aren't there yet should mostly base their decisions on the reason, since they're very likely to confuse intuition with instinct. 

In the music there were also things (I don't really know how I perceived them) that were telling me that I was trying to go too deep, that I was accessing forbidden information, but it wasn't like the government or society trying to hide those things from us, it was pointing more towards the definite changes it could cause, like in the track 'Only wish to warn you' where the word 'only' is really ironic! It was like reaching a point of no return, since excessive use could take me to such a level of advancement/awareness, that nobody would understand me anymore and they'd take me for crazy. But does it matter? Yes, because they may deem it necessary to treat me with pharmaceuticals to make me become 'normal' which is the opposite of enlightened. Although it was a warning, I know Im not quite there yet, there's still a lot to work on from the outside. Passage from Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield that I read the day after, that perfectly relates to that feeling : 'Once we try to talk to someone who is operating in normal consciousness, or try to live in a world where conflict is still happening, we get knocked out of this advanced state and fall back to the level of our old selves.' 

I was also experiencing that all the bases, all the roots I was hanging on to were falling apart. I saw myself flying, trying to hang on to something, anything, but it didn't work. There was nothing I could relate to that could save me from it. That's about attachment, how we always feel the need to find security and someone to reassure us, to protect us, by making links in the material world that give us the impression of that security, but in the end of the day we can't really rely on them and they're nothing but an illusion. In the end we're abandoned to ourselves and our spirit. When I wanted to get out of my room, being scared to be seen by my brother, I felt that I was trying to hide between my four walls, but that it was useless, since my spirit was far beyond those walls, actually it knows no bounds if I'm able to set it free, which I should, but don't know how. Or it isn't the right time yet...

I was also seeing some scenes of war and fights, but can't remember much about them. 

Another thing I remember while listening to the Osom cd was that at each thought that I created in my mind, there were little men who had quite scary, big, green faces and evil laughs, that were making fun of me, defying my thoughts, making me question myself much further about each one and take nothing for granted. 

I was thinking that I was going too far, receiving too much information which I won't be able to integrate afterwards I was thinking that I was going too far, receiving too much information which I won't be able to integrate afterwards, so I wanted to stop, calm my spirit down, but I knew the experience would've been incomplete if I didn't finish the Osom cd, so I listened to it till the end, then put the Magnum Opus track 'Only wish to warn you' afterwards. I had a hard time finding the cd, (as its writing is so unnoticeable), which was really disturbing, such a powerful music with such a discreet cover. I listened to it once and then I was afraid that my brother would wake up and come to tell me to turn off the music, so I put my headphones on. I found that that track was so complex that I should listen to it on repeat for a while in order to reach a deeper understanding of it. While listening to it I had some similar visions as before and also some family and everyday scenes, where the little men were laughing again and pointing out how everything those people do was wrong, how they were fooling themselves, living a lie. People need to be afraid in order to understand those things. However, while listening to that track, I was also reassured due to the sample 'sending you my love, straight from my heart, sending you all the love I have for you'. I'm not sure if that's the right purpose of it or if it's being ironic again because its an emotion we shouldnt really hang on to, but since it's such a short part, it also shows that that moment when somebody's there to comfort us is as impermanent as everything else and thus an illusion (Buddhist influence). I feel the sample is also relating to universal love and not just a love towards one person we should hang on to, that's also an explanation. 

All of those things I've discovered where things I already knew, but it had to make a deeper impact for me to integrate them, although I'm not really sure how to go about it. I hope I'll figure that out or be able to follow my intuition in order to discover it. I'm sure it'll already help me understand music much better which is already very important.

Theres something fascinating about doing normal things on psychedelics. From movie theaters to airplanes, I have incorporated low doses of LSD into daily life (though far from on a daily basis) for over a year now, however physical activity was something I had never tried while tripping, micro-dose or otherwise. The idea came to me one night - late - as I was cleaning my apartment on a +-50ug dose (all doses are estimated by dividing up 150ug tabs and as always should be considered merely as approximations). For several hours I cleaned and organized while my significant other slept slept peacefully in the bedroom of our converted warehouse loft.

I was in a fantastic mood - full of that magical, never-ending energy you only have on those really rare, perfect days - and I remember thinking to myself I feel as though I could run a marathon right now. From that moment on, running a 5K on LSD was on my mind and I would only have to wait 3 months for my opportunity. The following is what I wrote up the evening after the race.

I wake up feeling flawless. An enjoyable night spent in deep conversation with a good friend the evening before had ensured a restful night of sleep, despite the absence of my partner - out of town on business - something that usually throws both of our sleep patterns. I had prepared everything I needed the night before - a third of a (claimed) 150ug tab of LSD, a Xanax in case of sincerely needing to abort (though I feared little chance of that happening at this dosage), and finally a Dramamine to counter the initial nausea I sometimes experience taking Lucy.

I shower, dress and begin my drive to the zoo at which the 5K was to be held. As I pull into the parking lot and turn the engine off, I take a few moments to ask myself if this is still something I still want to do. Beyond the experience of taking LSD and running with 1,500 other people I had a burning desire to see what effect on my performance the drug might have if any I had a burning desire to see what effect on my performance the drug might have if any, but there was also still a minor yet lingering concern about the combination of the physical strain of running a race and the mental strain of a significant, albeit low dose of LSD. Experimentation with smoking a sativa strain of cannabis before running my daily jogs had led me to believe that it resulted in greater endurance (not speed), dulling any pains or stitches and allowing me to zone out, focusing only on the music in my ears and the motion of running itself. But Lucy - well, shes an entirely different mistress. I wondered if she would be so kind.

T:00:00
With one and a half hours to race start - standing at the entrance to the zoo - I swallow the cut-out rectangle of blotter.

I had arrived significantly early on purpose to allow for it to kick in properly while racing. I didnt want to be peaking (as far as one peaks on a lower dose such as this) during the hardest slog between mile two and three but I also didnt want to finish the 5K before the acid had kicked in either. Half an hour later the first of my coworkers arrives - Im wearing shades but its June and sunny as hell. He was around in the early 70s and would probably get great satisfaction out of knowing I rolled in with his old pal Lucy but he is, after all, my coworker - I hold my tongue. We people watch for a while, Im still feeling baseline but in an excellent mood. Another friend/coworker arrives - shes slightly younger than me but generally aware of my extra-curricular activities. Despite not knowing about todays enhancements, I still feel better knowing theres a fellow psychonaut around - just in case. 

T:00:40
As we move further into the zoo, I begin to feel the creeping but not unpleasant feeling at the nape of my neck that I always get with psychedelics. I feel little pangs of excitement in my stomach and chest, and I know that my timing had been spot on. I would be running in less than an hour, during the exciting and often energetic come up of the first wave of the trip. Out of the ten of us that came, only myself and one other person were to run that day. We take our well wishes with a smile and a wave, and I motion for her to lead the way through the crowd, away from the pavilion we had been standing under and on towards the inflatable arch that marked the beginning of our trail.

T:01:00
Im standing ten feet back from the starting line. Although no open-eyed visuals are occurring, I am more-than-usually pleased by the bright colors worn by the runners around me and beginning to feel the first little body shivers that Lucy sometimes gives me. I cant wait for the race to start. Already the voice on the loudspeaker seems muffled, an indistinct garble of directions and reminders. Wishing my companion luck, I put in my headphones and start up the playlist I had spent hours creating for this event. It began with a few of those tunes, those fucking tunes that just take you to a happy place, you know? Everyone has them and theyre fucking magic. So there I am - basking in the June sun with my favorite records playing and not a goddamn care in the world, surrounded by the positive energy of a charity race with hundreds of smiling faces around me and Lucy is there now smiling with them - the girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

T:01:15
I can barely contain myself.

Im antsy, but not in a bad way. The effects of the psychedelic I had ingested just over an hour prior are now unmistakable. Despite a relatively-low dose at 50ug, I now note a distinct increase in textures, colors and patterns, and the music coming through my headphones periodically dips and dives ever-so-slightly like when a record players needle drags over a warp on the vinyl. I make out the call for five minutes to race start and a pang of excitement once again hits my stomach. Not having run 5km in over two years (my daily run for the past three months being only 3.5km, with no running at all for more than a year prior to that), I begin to talk myself through what lay ahead of me. What had seemed daunting the night before, now seemed easily within reach. I would never call myself a confident runner but as I stood there I felt powerful - determined to cross the finish line with a time I could be proud of on my own merit, not in relation to anyone elses, better or worse.

T:01:20
Im ready when the airhorn blows. A sea of people move forward, a mass of singular individuals each with their own hopes and dreams and loves and heartaches but now each of one mind and one purpose - onward. Life, the world, bills, a job I hated - all is left behind as we begin to run. A strong desire to sprint comes over me, enthralled and exhilarated as I am feeling, but I hasten to temper my boyish enthusiasm - how often in life have I charged ahead with good intentions only to lose steam or interest before reaching the finish line? I set myself a steady pace and begin to take in the myriad of sensations I am being bombarded with. Similar to MDMA, as I run I begin to feel the most delightful body tingles, exercise-induced shivers of pleasure running from my calves all the way to my scalp and continuing for a couple of minutes. There is an electricity to my mood, and I feel an extraordinary sense of camaraderie running alongside so many other people. As runners pass me I cheer for them inwardly and as I advance on others I wordlessly wish them luck - the level of empathy I feel is immense. the level of empathy I feel is immense. 

 T:01:28
As I round out the first mile a large hill looms ahead. I had walked up this same hill many times as a zoo guest and had been slightly dreading it, whether running while flying or straight. I press onwards, determined to put my best efforts forth. I make it three quarters of the way up, but have to stop to catch my breath and for the first time I understand how strenuous activity may not be an ideal psychedelic pastime for some. Had I been on a higher dose I could easily see myself allowing my labored breathing to become a matter of concern, however at approximately 30-50ug (depending on how much you trust underground markets) I have enough presence of mind to check my pulse and find it to be well within an acceptable range for how arduous the climb had been. Encouraged by this thought and after only 30 seconds or so, I begin to run again.

T:01:32
I am well into the second mile. The zoo passes by me - a blur of watchful eyes from cages, strange and wonderful noises reaching me through the headphones over my ears. I feel guilty, flaunting my freedom around in front of them like some punk kid cruising by a dusty back-roads minimum-security prison in a convertible during yard time just to get a kick. I tuck the thought away for later, not having the energy to spare on such contemplation. Despite my body screaming for me to stop, the good version of myself - the one that lives inside and tells me to be kind and be strong and to fight for noble causes and keep promises - that version of me tells me to keep going, to not stop. You are, in fact, strong enough. LSD often brings that version of me out of his shell. Its all about what version of yourself you present to the world you see - you and I, we have a choice. Today, I choose the good me... maybe I will again tomorrow. My feet continue to pound the pavement. 

T:01:37
I think I may be at the three mile marker now, but without any signs posted I have no idea. Could it have been two miles already? Time has for the most part become meaningless. I am nothing more than a pair of legs, hitting the pavement. If I am any more than that, if I admit any more than that, then all of the breathlessness and the fatigue and the pain in my upper body will become unbearable. I sink into my music, focusing on moving one leg, then the next. I have reached the runner's Zen Garden.

My breathing feels almost circular - as if I am not quite getting enough breath but never quite breathless enough to justify stopping. Sometimes I can be harsh on myself, often not harsh enough. This is a time that calls for the latter, and I dont give myself an inch. I know Im not setting any records with my time, but Im going to cross that damn line as fast as I possibly can. I was obese only two years ago and couldnt run sustained for more than 2 minutes - this is fucking huge for me and Im not going to allow the other me - the lazy, underachieving, Netflix binge-watching me to dictate shit now.

 T:01:40
As I reach the last 3/4 of a mile or so, my vision starts to tunnel. I am barely aware of the other runners or the volunteers cheering at the sidelines. I dont see the overpriced ice-cream carts or the animal exhibits, tiny fists slamming against glass while parents stand idly by. Maybe the zoo isnt the best place for such an empathetic drug - another thought for later. Now, all I see are my bright blue shoes slapping the pavement, psychedelic tracers constantly providing ghostly reminders of the past as they appear, disappear and then reform. If I had not been exerting more effort than I thought physically possible I would have been delighted, tracers being one of my favorite visuals, but I think of nothing but keeping those legs moving. As I make a turn I realize that there are no further turns on this pathway - it leads directly back to the main entry and finish line - and I start to sprint as fast as I can, perhaps too late to make a significant difference on my time but early enough for every muscle in my body to groan and protest against me and yet somehow, almost magically, I dont stop or slow down.

T:01:45
Coming in at just over 25 minutes, my heart almost stops for delight at both my time and from the exertion of finishing a 5K race while under the influence of LSD. My coworker finds me, and brings me water - after checking to make sure Im doing okay she congratulates me on finishing the race. It takes several minutes before I am able to drink, for the first time I am uncomfortably aware of the rest of my body. My breath comes in ragged gasps and the feeling of adrenaline mixed with the Lysergamide - now certainly in full effect - is nearly overwhelming.

T:02:00
It takes 15 minutes for me to come back from riding the edge of physical discomfort; overload. I sit, and as the adrenaline and uneasiness recede they are replaced by an overwhelming feeling of happiness. I had not only completed the race successfully, but I had done it in a time that a year ago would have been unimaginable. In the past three years I have not only lost 75lbs. (a third of my body weight) but I have also shaved 12 minutes off of my 5K time. Thank god I said good bye to cigarettes, frequent drinking and the desk job. My elation increases as my coworkers come over to congratulate me - the other running member of our party follows shortly, and as our group is complete I feel nothing but contentedness. Sitting there basking in the June sun with not a goddamn care in the world, surrounded by the positive energy of a charity race with hundreds of smiling faces around me and Lucy is there now smiling with them once again - the girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

There is, of course more to the story for that day and some of the themes from the 5K would come back around, however that is for another time. Would I repeat the experience? I have to err on the side of yes. Running a 5K on LSD was certainly unique, but I couldnt quite call it unpleasant. It felt incredible to be moving at speed while tripping thats for damn sure, and having headphones with a pre-selected playlist made all the difference.

Whether it gave me any performance enhancement, I could not say. Perhaps not physical, however I must be honest and say that the drug allowed me to access that special place of focus, concentration, and self-confidence that Ive sorely lacked in recent years. the drug allowed me to access that special place of focus, concentration, and self-confidence that Ive sorely lacked in recent years. I definitely felt strong, but in a holistic sense. I would of course caution any readers to mix psychedelics and strenuous physical activity very carefully. At approximately 30-50ug I was at a relatively low level. It is certainly something I may explore further in the micro-dose range for my personal runs, but if the occasion presents itself I may just step back into that place of focus - the runners zen garden - yet again.

I had been going through an extended difficult period, and had gotten into a very dark place psychologically. I was reading 'The Globalisation of Addiction' by Bruce Alexander, and felt that I had adopted some addictive behaviours (mostly around computer use, and romance seeking). I felt like nearly everything around me had collapsed, and was terrified that I was close to reaching the end of my rope and collapsing too.

A friend of mine was preparing to pack up his life and go become a modern monastic at a meditative community in Vermont. Naturally this called for a going away party. A short while before the going away party, he realized that his community would be webcasting a meditation retreat on the day of the party, so the party was restructured to allow people to come early (by about 6 hours) and participate in the retreat. While discussing this with him, and whether the shift in timings would change my choice of drug for the rest of the party (which was to involve watching some psychedelic anime, and then going to a rave), he made it clear to me that I was welcome to participate in the retreat on psychedelics.

Having that permission, and knowing that I was in a dark place that only seemed to be getting darker, I became hopeful that a day of meditation under the influence of a dose of LSD on the strong end of moderate, would be a perfect opportunity to perform something of a reboot on my brain. I've heard that people have a bad habit of driving cars into trees, lampposts, etc. when they begin to lose traction in a large part because we tend to drive towards what we're looking at, and we also tend to look at what frightens us. In many ways, I felt like I was staring at my impending ruin, while skidding towards it, and I wanted to direct my gaze as forcefully as possible, back towards the road that I'd been sliding off of.

The retreat was to begin at noon. At around 11:30, I placed 2 tabs of respectably strong blotter (I'd estimate their strength at around 100-125ug per hit) under my tongue, and then got on my bicycle to ride to the party.

By the time I arrived, I could feel my first report coming on, and was introduced to several of my friends' coworkers who were either there for the party, or were hosting it. We got ourselves onto cushions on the floor (except for one guest, who'd brought a meditation seat), got the webcast going, straightened up, and settled in.

The first exercise began with a cultivation practice. An early instruction was to consider how fortunate we were to have the time, the energy, the safety, and the intention to engage in the practice. Because of the dark place I was in, I felt like I lacked the energy and safety being referenced. I sought to convince myself that I must have the time and safety because I was there, when the instruction came that we may be feeling happy, grateful, or relieved. I clung to relief as a positive emotion that I was capable of feeling at the time, the practice then switched to observation, then inquiry, and then doing-nothing, to complete the overview of the techniques we'd practice in more depth throughout the day.

There was some discussion, and a dedicated sit for each practice. One event of note was that I opted to do the cultivation practice lying on my back on the couch, and that around the time we were instructed to add the feeling of a little love into the breathing feedback loop we'd established, the host's cat wandered on to my chest. In the state that I was in, I felt this was an excellent vehicle for the cultivation of love, and took to petting the cat for the remainder of the meditation. She also seemed quite happy becoming the object of cultivation of love, and remained on my chest and in my arms for the balance of the practice (which was somewhere in the neighbourhood of half an hour).

I don't remember anything particularly notable from the observation practice, so will skip along to the inquiry practice, in which I had my most intense experience. The general idea of the inquiry practice was to remain in the state of not knowing by asking a question. Every time our mind would produce an answer, we were advised to immediately respond by asking ourselves 'what's that'. At some point in this practice, I found myself confronted with a slight chuckle coming out of me, and with the question 'what's so funny?'. Having already taken the cat laying on my chest as a vehicle to cultivate love, it seemed entirely natural for me to take 'what's so funny' as a line of inquiry. Answers kept coming at me: I'm making a disruption and it's wrong, this is some sort of strange meta-joke, it's become a running gag, it's completely absurd; and each time I asked myself what's so funny about that, I laughed harder and harder, until I fell over laughing. And I kept asking 'what's so funny about that?': it's hard to tell whether it's a laugh or a sob at times, it's got a spasmodic quality like a cough, something's coming out in this laugh, it's an eruption like a zit being popped, it's still unbelievably funny, I can't not be making a scene with all this, this is certainly the longest I've held focus on a single thing, surely the most intensely too, what an astonishing joke, and somehow it isn't even a joke.

The instructor rang his bell. I let go of the question and gradually regained my composure. The instructor rang his bell. I let go of the question and gradually regained my composure. I apologized to the group for having been so noisy, explaining that I'd somehow latched on to 'what's so funny' as a line of inquiry, and that it seemed to be working as something I could hang on to. My monastic friend (who I should probably mention had already done a lengthy temporary residence in the community in question, and led the occasional workshop himself) mentioned to the group that it's not uncommon for people to break out in laughter or sobs during a sit, and we chatted a bit about it. He made a remark in the psychedelics-as-shortcut vein and how he looks forward to having enough practice behind him some number of years down to road, to be able to have a sit like that without the need for drugs.

While we were having this conversation, and as the day progressed (and then night, as we went to the rave), I realized that I was thinking and acting with a levity and joy that I hadn't remembered feeling in quite a while. There wasn't any impending doom coming to my mind any more. That sensation I had while laughing, that something unwanted and unhealthy was erupting from me--there really had been something there. The darkness I'd been living with was gone, burst out of my soul in a fit of laughter while I asked myself 'what's so funny'. I had become my real self once again.

The pharmacological effects of the LSD are long past, but the darkness is still gone, and I'm continuing to feel the joy and levity that I was missing for so long.

This was not quite my first LSD experience but it's one of my favorite ones to date. It was my 12th trip on LSD and the first report Im translating to English on purpose because it's one of the few experienced Id like to share with more then just the Dutch. It was mostly a very interesting experience visually. I found the visuals of this experience to be extremely typical for a medium to high dose of LSD which is why I assume it might be interesting to read especially for those less experienced and maybe recognisable for the more experienced psychonauts.

I was mainly looking for a visual experience in a party setting prior to the trip. My trip before this one had been a very mild dose and not overly interesting due to the location. It ended up more of a social relaxing night spiced up by some nice visuals. Mainly because of that I was looking for a full blown psychedelic experience once again. We decided on the perfect location; a squatted hippie village where they have monthly psy trance parties. The main dance floor is in a squatted church which with the natural church acoustics leads to possibly the most impressive sound system ever, although it's an acquired taste, people tend to love it or be annoyed by it. One more background fact might be that I had been in that village often as a child because my mother was friends with a few hippies there and they shared a field nearby where they kept horses and Id often come along. This place isnt just a good location for a party but also something connected to my entire youth and childhood, making the experiences there always feel a little deeper than the ones outside of Ruigoord.

So for the experience itself:
Once we arrived at the party we sat down at the church first. We decided to take the LSD at exactly 11 pm, because that would make it easier to know the duration of the trip once wed be in it. We walked down a little street next to the church that goes to a large body of water held back by a dike. We always take that dike as point of rest in any trip so we decided itd be a nice and calm place to take the drug. I took 2/3rd of a hit I had left, the amount I took would be an estimated 100 ug as hits of this sheet had been tested in a lab and were found to contain 175 ug on average, which even here is considered a high dose for one hit. My friend Maria took half a hit but at the time shed always take a bit less then I would. 

We quickly headed back to the party and sat down at the exact same place we had been before. After about fifteen minutes the well-known feeling in the back of my head started showing up but visually the trip had me waiting a few minutes longer. We decided to head outside again and check the official chill out, which is a small gnome house where they serve chai tea. When we were in there the trip started showing up visually, with mostly fractal like patterns on the floor. At that time we had no idea what visual madness would be waiting for us that night.

For some reason we decided to leave the rather comfortable home, possibly because I got the feeling my face was being boiled on one side by the heater in there. Im not sure what we did up to that point but by now it was around midnight and the visuals were slowly but steadily building up. We decided to go for a little walk to the dike again. This time we found a cat that decided to follow us there. Maria found the cat a little annoying but I found it good company. When arriving on the dike we came to the conclusion it was very, very dark and we couldnt even see where we were walking. I was feeling quite up for the walk even though we couldnt see where we were going but Maria was a bit anxious about the darkness and the fact she couldnt see where shed put her feet. We decided to walk a bit further but once we got to a point where there's a row of trees Maria decided she didnt want to go on walking the round. I then suggested using glowsticks as torches but that was a very stupid idea, mostly due to the fact they were far too bright and blinding us, leading to the fact we saw even less of where we were heading.

We walked on for a bit holding the overly bright glowsticks behind our back. I told Maria if wed just walk on in a straight line it would be easy enough to just get there but she really didnt want to. During the walk on the dike the visuals were slowly building up to the peak. I mostly noticed when we turned aroud to walk back. The middle of my vision was a line and both halves were mirror images of each other, and I literally saw no path at all, just water. On good faith I walked back, using my feet to feel if I was walking or ground or on water, I wouldnt have been able to tell visually. With some luck we did not fall into the water and managed to make it back safely. We walked back to the gnome house but unfortunately it had  completely filled up with people. When looking at the church door we could see it was pretty obvious that was not a place for us to be either. We decided to sit on one of the blocks they had put there for people to sit on. There was a tree right in the middle of my vision which I didnt quite enjoy but we decided to stay there and smoke one joint anyway. After complaining about the tree blocking my vision for a while we decided to sit somewhere else. 

For unknown reasons we decided that wasnt the place to be either but we left the glowsticks. We walked around for a bit feeling a bit out of place with no good place to just sit and stare at the visuals so after a while we decided to sit at the block with the tree once again. By lack of anything better to do I decided to look at the gravel and wow!! The gravel was completely made up of faces, with hands on them and a sort of skeleton like trees, and all of them moved and pulsated in the rhythm of the ever changing patterns. The patterns would constantly shift as well from completely abstract and beautiful multi-coloured fractals, and if Id look closer theyd change back to faces and hands. I asked Maria what she saw in the gravel, she said it looked like little houses. At the moment I had asked that the faces became half face and half house, which obviously looked a little odd. While I was speaking out loud what I saw I looked on. Some of them were so odd I couldnt find words at the time for them. One of the most insane ones were backwards praying plaque suffering christians in massive circles that kept letting themselves fall back and the moment theyd hit the ground they were bones and then dust. One moment later it was a giant field of cats that kept all rhythmically moving their heads, and all of their eyes together were another multi-coloured pattern that moved on itself.

The trees in the distance were growing in and out and all the branches grew out more branches and they all kept moving just this tiny bit further then I expected they would, the tree looked like it had more then one dimension at the same time and some parts would slide down, some up and each time itd move I felt this wave of amazement. I had some interesting thoughts at this point but they mostly consisted of a feeling of wonder at what the LSD was doing to my vision and are extremely difficult to describe. Every tree Id look at would move in this odd way, and if Id look back to the gravel it started morphing straight away. Also the church was part of the visual madness, it would grow, collapse, shift to the side, the other side, into itself and up again, like it was dancing to the music that was coming from it. We decided to take one look into the gnome house as it was quite cold outside but unfortunately it was still filled completely with people.

We sat down again on some blocks a little closer to the gnome house and ended up in conversation with some of the people that were also sitting there. They were looking for LSD but we had brought leftovers for ourselves to take so we had nothing to share with them. One of them gave us the advice to walk to the dike but we laughed at that saying we knew exactly what that dike was like. After I rolled two joints there and we had talked some more to the friendly strangers we walked back to the dike. The cat followed us once again, Maria still didnt like it. I was in a very cat-inspired mood so I enjoyed the fact our companion for the moment was a cat. While walking down the path I kept seeing people. They were two dimensional and black and not very detailed. Theyd constantly appear in the middle of the path and then fall sidewards and the moment they hit the side of the path theyd turn into trees. The visual was almost a pattern in itself, very odd to look at it. In the end it turned out there were real people as well besides the tree people and we found ourself in no state to communicate with even more strangers so we quickly headed back.

Unfortunately it was a cold night, it was almost freezing and especially Maria was annoyed by this, as I personally can tolerate cold quite a bit better then she can, especially when on LSD. As time passed the cold got so annoying we decided to warm up for a bit in the church, which was the dance floor. This was overly, overly full and we got the feeling we didnt even fit in there. The faces of the people were morphing and it looked surreal, but mostly very crowded, not very pleasant so we left very quickly. We decided to go for another and third walk around the dike, we tend to walk around a lot while tripping. I found it to be a good way to release some of the energy it gives making the experience mentally much more mellow. The clouds at the dike were as impressive and the gravel had been earlier that evening. Everything turned into this beautiful mass of dancing patterns and the trees were beautiful moving black silhouettes on the sky line.

We were sort of still looking for a nice place to find some rest but apparently this party didnt have a permit for a camp fire so there wasnt any place that wasnt either over crowded or very cold. While walking around I heard bird sounds that were equally fractalised as my entire surrounding. The world was a psychedelic painting that went through all my senses. The world was a psychedelic painting that went through all my senses. A few strangers attempted a fire anyway but it only lasted for about 15 minutes as people came to put it out even quicker then it took the people to make the fire in the first place. Here another visual peak of the trip came. I realised at some point just staring into the space that each time Id blink the world would be sort of reset, and the visuals would start again from the real world. I decided to not blink for a while and see what it would do. My theory proved to be true as while I kept my eyes open the trees would move further apart and become much more fractalised. From time to time everything got really blurry, then moved extremely fast and became extremely sharp. New patterns started shaping in between the trees and then I kind of had to blink because my eyes got a little dry so I went for a second try.

This second attempt, two trees in the distance started rising up in a sort of bow. They got arms and started dancing around and moving as if they were people, it was extremely realistic. There was a tiny trunk in the middle and they made movements with their arms as if they were caring for it. I was stumbling in amazement and couldnt even tell Maria the impressive thing I just saw. We finally found some space in the gnome house (at 5 am) and quickly rolled a joint in there. It was still a little uncomfortable being with so many people in such a small space so we decided to walk around around the field once more. Maria was finally convinced it was light enough to walk the full round so finally we went ahead. The walk was comparable to the previous two times. Around the water the clouds and trees still reminded a lot of fast shifting fractal art, I moved my hand across my vision and the tracers merged in with the other patterns already there. On the way to the trees I couldnt see the path, it again looked as if there was water in front of me but I could see a few meters before my feet, so I knew I was walking on (heavily patterned) ground. 

Even though it was still very dark we managed to make the end of the round safely and we sat down in front of the gnome house. I had been carrying a french bread in my bag all that time and decided to eat a bit of it. For some reason that really warmed us up so the cold was eliminated from that point. I must mention it was also getting light a bit. We socialised quite a bit with the people around us at this time, I listened to a conversation for a while some other people had and was surprised how such a normal conversation was held at a party like that.

From the church we could see the first people going home so we had a chance of being able to dance without being squeezed together in a too tiny room now. As we saw that we decided to go into the church to attempt to dance. It was still very crowded but there was some space to move around so we decided to dance for a bit. The music wasnt quite perfect though, we couldnt get into the rhythm properly so we went back out. This was the first time we fit comfortably in the gnome house so we decided to sit there for a while.

The few people who were sitting there as well turned out to have been in the same school I was in a few years earlier and two of them turned out to be members of a Dutch drug-related forum where I am the moderator. That led to good conversations and we smoked joint after joint there, finally having the time to do the relaxing we had been waiting for all night. Outside the sun had come up and it was quite a lovely morning. Not as cold anymore and somewhat sunny. One of the people we ran into had taken a lot of MDMA and his eyes kept rolling away but it didnt disturb me at all. The patterns by now were moving a bit less heavily but the trip hadnt come down that much yet. While talking there I could hear some good fast and psychedelic beats coming from the church so we decided it was time to dance psychedelic.

While dancing I lost all track of time. Everything around me seemed faded and I kept thinking strange sentences while the music seemed to move me instead of me moving to the music. One of the sentences I thought was, I want to put the now into the everything. I had been thinking about the concept of time a lot I had been thinking about the concept of time a lot as it was slowed down and the present seemed to be a much wider concept then it usually is. After dancing for more then an hour we were finally hot instead of cold so we decided to go outside and cool down. Sitting down on the block near the gravel again I saw the same complicated colourful patterns as easily as in the night even though now the sun was shining. The visuals were only just starting to get a little less strong, this was one lengthy heavy trip. We decided, after we had cooled down, it was the perfect moment to dance so we went back into the church which was now even getting quite empty. This time dancing seemed even more amazing then the previous time we had done it. I decided for that moment LSD can be quite a party drug if you know how to party. I thought much and nothing at all in the same time. There werent many words but many visions in my mind, words didnt fit onto my thoughts at that point. 

In a strange way it seemed like I had infinite energy, it was around 7.30 in the morning, possibly even later and I was dancing like I couldnt do anything else in the world. It wasnt even me who was dancing, the music was dancing me and had become a part of me. I couldnt refuse the music. Maria did not have the endless energy I had so we decided to go check for the bus times. Together. That would still be another hour away and seeing as we had to wait anyway I convinced her to stay a little longer. Until the end we sat on the block, danced briefly for one more time and around 10 am we finally left the party to go home. At home I still had visuals and thus unavoidable LSD insomnia so it took till far past noon before I finally slept. 

It was a very fulfilling trip. Even though the report doesnt show it, it was quite social, while both Maria and I were socially quite shy at this time of our lives, it seemed like a bit of a breakthrough on that point. Also the visuals, as described as best as I can above, were well impressive and added a lot to a beautiful experience.

In preparation of an event in the Nevada desert I had traded a tiny bottle of liquid LSD with a good friend. It was to be enough for 25 to 30 hits my friend said and after some research I decided to dispense what turned out to be 26 drops onto nicely colored sweet tarts, since this candy seemed to soak up the liquid reasonably well. Giddy I looked upon my pretty babies and decided to bring no more than 12 to this gathering because I did not want to have in my possession any more than I could use or give away.

We arrived at the gathering at early morning Monday and was happy to be awake and decided to set up camp prior to the hot Nevada sun became too overwhelming. My friends had a geodesic dome made out of metal conduit and it was a bit of a chore to get the structure together. Geodesic domes are basically built out of three different lengths of pipes all neatly arranged into stars and pentagons following a intricate pattern downloaded from the internet. After finishing the top three layers we decided to call it morning and sleep for a bit. The next morning we made some food, rested and tried to stay in the shade that we had created from the 3/5ths partially finished dome. As the day turned evening we once again set out to finish our shelter for the week.

Happy to finally be at this place I had prior only heard about I decided to bring out the sweet tarts and offer some to my dome building friends. We thought that this was a great idea and ate one per person with a wink and a nod. After about half an hour some of us started having a hard time concentrating and started to laugh as they tried to make sense out of the now fairly faint printout. The dome poles we had where painted red and black and also blue, to distinguish them from each other but the printout had it all different. Blue was black, red was red but represented a different length and our black was yellow on the print. There was also some mystical numbers representing the order of how it was all to be put together. To make things even more confusing I had had the plan folded in my back pocket the entire day witch had made the ink bleed through onto the opposite quarter of the page, mirrored. (I dont know how it happened). Finally all participants except me fell out of the dome construction game and I was on my own thinking to myself that this should not be that complicated. After about another half an hour I finally had to give up and found that I could see only two places where I could not find matching poles to be attached.

At this point we all where pretty buzzed and we took some time to look at our surroundings. It seemed to us that the dome was indeed very large and kind of slowly rocking back and forth. A light breeze lifted the canvas we had on top of the dome in the most peculiar way and we felt a funny melancholy and we told each other that we had ruined our cozy low to the ground dome and turned it into a ball skeleton with a funny looking cap, a fragment of our secure shelter from the previous day. Giggling we told each other that we have to do something about that the next day realizing that there was no turning back at this point. We had brought bicycles to the event but decided to be safe as people where rolling in and looking for friend and campsites and it seemed a bit unsafe to bike around right at that time.

Instead me and my wife decided to take a look around on foot since we where new to the place and had pretty much stayed resting around camp the whole day. As it turned out the area we now entered had bright signs and lots of people with multicolored glowing glowsitcks and blinking light emitting diodes witch led to a visionary bubble bath of  colors and confusion. I went into the registration tent where I saw  the familiar glow of computer screens but when I walked up to one of them I found that I was unable to decipher the text nor was able to comprehend how to operate the machine. After some hilarious moments I retuned out to my wife without registering.

We met some friends from our hometown who was dressed in rather unusual vests with animal fur on the cuffs. They where friendly and took us for a magnificent ride on the backs of their modified bicycles. This time it was like moving into a unknown universe altogether with blinking lights and streams of colored matter all around us. The way we went was smooth and easy for the bikes to move fast from one place to the other. Our friends seemed to take no notice of our (me and my wifes) obvious intoxication. At this point I do not think I was able to communicate with anyone else than my wife. Our friends rode us home (I guess they thought that was a good idea). We insisted however to stop at the bathrooms just a little bit away from our campsite. The bathroom felt very uncomfortable and all made out of my least favorite material, plastic. I felt thoroughly discussed and the fact that I could not distinguish my own pants from toilet paper made the whole thing even more peculiar. Up and down also seemed more like abstract phrases and I had difficulty recalling where the floor ended and my own body started. Went out to my friends and the sky was star filled and beautiful. My wife was clearly more sure of our exact location and was able to get home before me and I was alone with my friends. After what seemed an eternity I recalled how to walk across the road to our kitty-corner camp and we all stepped into the little area where our dome was. I was now in good spirit but felt a strong urge to cleanse myself since I still felt the aftereffects of the portapotty lingering in my mind.

At our camp people from the former dome-erecting crew was doing tricks in costumes on the soccer field right next to our camp (the soccer field was the brain fart from someone named Canadian Beacon, she chased people away but thats a whole different story altogether) I was used to camping and had no problems to washing myself naked in the nature. This was indeed nature (but it more resembled the moon with RVs planted on it) so I set out to get myself a shower. The shower itself turned out a bit of a disappointment but I ended up naked and almost clean on a soccer field on this other planet. After some encouraging conversation also I thought it was a good idea to try to localize some new clothes. It was easier said than done because it seemed to me that some weird lady and not myself had packed the bag with my clothes, and I had a hard time finding anything that would feel like proper clothing to wear.

I ended up grabbing a wool bike shirt from back in the day and some denim pants. I found some socks and shoes also For some reason I wanted to avoid anything plastic and wanted only natural materials. Now it was time for some more explorations and me and my wife set out on bikes to see the lunar eclipse further out where all the blinking people where. However we hid ourselves away from the visual noise and sat down on a blanket close to a colossal green neon man sculpture standing on top of a green circus tent.. There we sat for about half an hour reflecting back on our previous hours while the moon in the sky turned brown and deep red. It seemed fairly still and gentle for a little while. Nearby some people are standing on a platform on top of a golf cart and we decided to go over and see what the locals where doing there. They where actually from Detroit or somewhere and seemed to just be hanging out watching the scenery and we just did the same with them.

Then something happens. A flicker of light rolls down the side if the circus tent and a small grey cloud is emerging from the right leg of the green giant statue. It was intriguing enough to make us stop our train of thought and pay a little attention. Now people around us seem to slowly and almost comical notice how the statue was on fire and no one seemed really sure of what to do. The statue also known as The Man was now clearly on fire and it spread up his leg. People from all over started to pour in and it looked as we where the epicenter of a highway of blue and red neon lights. My newfound friend from Detroit or wherever offers a drink of hard alcohol with seemed really a nice thing to have a taste of right then.

Fire pumps have suddenly appeared and people are yelling at them to stop their seemingly hopeless attempts of stopping the fire. From our raised platform we could se how the spouts from the engines could hardly even reach the base of the statue and it was quite the spectacle to watch the crowd getting wild down below. Eventually the hard work of the fire crew paid off and it was time to bike home to the nutty dome . It seemed like we where biking for a long time through streets thick with brown  RVs covered with lunar dust and ash. Finally we arrive at our tent by the dome and just feel like sitting down for a while.

At this point my vision is in hiccup mode and everything I see seems to flash pictures three or four at a time. Its now getting very bright and it was time to call it a day. I had no problem sleeping and I believe we held each others hand, me and my wife.

We did not eat any more sweet tarts that week.

OK this is something that I wrote right after my trip. I didn't write it as a trip report, I just wanted to sum up the experience very briefly for myself to remember later. As you'll see, there isn't any mention of any specific activity or event - I am trying to analyze the internal effect of the drug.

Therefore, I will give you some important background information:
Set: This was about my 6th time taking acid. I'm starting to feel more comfortable with the drug each time, although there's always a lot of fear and madness during the strong trips, I see it as part of the experience, and I think I'm handling it well enough. I didn't sleep enough before tripping, and dropped at around 4:30AM, with an empty stomach and a bit tired to begin with. It's also worth noting that I've been reading Tim Leary's 'The Psychedelic Experience' and believe there's a lot of truth in it.

Setting: An outdoor rave (in Israel, where I'm from) with a couple of good friends I usually drop with. A lot of strangers, a lot of mess, a lot of noise. But we have some experience with these events and we put up a good tent, places to sit, cold drinks, etc. We dropped right before sunrise and after a couple of hours it got pretty hot.
Dosage: We used a very reliable blotter that's been running around in Europe for a few years, called 'Dalai Lama'. I used it a few times before, and it was always about the same potency - Strong. I gathered from a few sources that it should be around 200-250 mics, and I'm really confident it's pretty accurate, even though I'm no expert. This is my 2nd time dropping a whole 'Dalai Lama' at once. [Erowid Note: 
Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be done casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements were derived, it is reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.] 

Timing: I originally didn't write a timeline, because I didn't focus on it during the trip and it wasn't of great importance to me. However, as I'm turning this into a report, I will try to estimate because it might be important for some readers. but note that ALL TIME ESTIMATES ARE VERY ROUGH AND MIGHT BE COMPLETELY OFF!

So, there it is, the stages of my latest LSD experience:

1. [+0:30] I think I might be seeing some colours different than usual, but not sure. Perhaps thoughts start to feel a bit different, too?

2. [+1:00] OK this is getting a bit more interesting. A faint vibration climbing in waves from the stomach upwards, and some visual movement trails.

3. [+1:30] The vibrations get stronger. They start opening the gates of pure amazement, at times nervous psychosis. I feel the tension building up - something extremely important and dramatic is about to explode on reality. Everything I fix my eyes on would start breathing or shivering.

4. [+2:00] Reality is ripping at the seams. Disintegrating. I can recognize what I'm seeing around me, but as I jitter with madness, it just FEELS like everything I've learned about the laws of reality, how things are defined, how they work, is no longer relevant. Nothing is as I thought it was, from the very basics. Time almost stops and each moment seems like the big bang in its importance and magnitude. Then restlessness. How do I deal with this?? Just keep breathing deeply and smile... Communication is, sometimes, almost impossible. Every single word has infinite meanings, and it's hard to put up a sentence that will be comprehensible to others. I start trying, but then forget basic words, and eventually can't follow my own speech. Or I do it right, but my friends completely misinterpret it.

5. [+2:30] A long period of enlightenment or paranoia, immersion with experience or being completely confused by it... The present keeps trying to push its own urgency in my face. Jitter, jitter, jitter. Losing myself in my own crazy mind loops. A need to move or wander around. Keep receiving new data, new places, new new new... I don't get very strong visuals as expected. I always imagined things would change shape, distort, etc... But I get no significant visuals unless I fix my eyes on something static for a few seconds, and then I kinda zoom into the tiny details and my mind drifts into this pixelated fractal vision.

6. [+5:30] At some point I know it is starting to loosen up. Everything still feels new, but not as intense, and more controllable. Then sometimes it gives me a slap in the face with brief sharp rises. But it's nice being able to grasp SOME part of reality in a calm way. Opens up doors for exploration... I can now transmit and receive so much through language. One word can be enough to convey the essence of a whole idea.

7. [+8:00] Slowly, slowly, slowly, normal perception is restored. Music is still being heard differently. Bass is so important! Certain strong colours can still welcome me.

8. [+12:00] Afterglow. I can now do everything I normally can, pretty much. Calm, loving, and thankful. Go to sleep (at around +22:00).

9. [+36:00] Why the fuck was I so weird yesterday? How can everything be so extremely normal again?

My friend and I ingested two tabs of acid each while waiting for the bus. The bus came about 5 minutes later. About 10 minutes into our trip, everything started to seem strange and my teeth began feeling like they didnt belong in my mouth. 15 minutes into our trip, still on the bus, peoples faces maintained their shapes and colors but I was much less afraid to look at people and began to try to figure them out based solely on their actions, dress, and posture. 

At this point, about 20 minutes in, the world was taking on another dimension. I was far more aware of peoples actions and motives than Id ever been. I noticed every look, every gesture. Many faces seemed distracted. I felt more able than ever to detect emotion. Fear was prevalent. The urban atmosphere took on an ugly, gas stained look. The sidewalk seemed dirtier than ever. 

One man passed me. He had yellow, sallow skin with strange blue eyes and fanged teeth. His bizarre appearance almost made me wonder if he was a vampire but I quickly dismissed the idea and kept walking. 

My friend and I finally went into an art museum that wed planned to visit for some time. We went inside, paid our money and wandered into a gallery. At this point, it was as if I had entered an alternate dimension. Every surface moved and shifted and as I walked into the gallery it was as if I was walking into a liquid room. 

First, we stood in front of some 300-400 year old Italian drawings done in an intricate crosshatching pattern. They came alive on paper and suddenly shapes hidden within the crosshatching were apparent. The arms of the figures moved as did the heads. It was bizarre and striking. The intensity and passion of the drawings were much more easily felt. I suddenly realized that the intricate style of crosshatching displayed was, sadly, a lost art. 

We walked over to a series of woodcuts done by a Japanese artist who captured the oceans waves almost perfectly. It was hard to tell for a while that the woodcuts were not pictures. Interestingly, these waves did not move or undulate as the Italian paintings did. 

Next up were psychedelic stripes and patterns drawn in a large scale on the walls of a particular gallery. I was entranced and mesmerized by the lines, which took on a three-dimensional quality and lured me almost face first into the wall.

By the time we had seen all of that, we found that the museum security was watching us and had even sent an undercover officer to spy on us. Im sure that we seemed strange. My friends nose has a tendency to sweat while hes on acid, and both of our pupils were dilated. 

We left quickly and went back out into the streets to take a bus to the beach. More than ever before, the city seemed like a large cage with nowhere to go without people. People and their presence was restricting and maddening.

The next four hours or so were spent having conversations on a long beachfront walk. I found out many things- that the universe makes no sense. That life is meaningless. That trees and people and animals and everything follow a unique fractal pattern. That peoples personalities and facades are empty. That life revolves entirely around the sun. That humans follow a much more basic primordial clock than wed like to admit. That math is an expression of innate characteristics of the universe. That the physical universe is the only universe. That our entire thought processes, actions, and lives are governed by physical properties. 

I saw gorgeous intricate fractal patterns in almost every tree and when I looked at any smooth surface several winding and weaving fractal patterns appeared. It was spectacular. The sunset, rich with purples, pinks, and blues, looked almost like a cotton candy sculpture.

It took a while to come down from our highs, but the come down was still visually rich and I continued seeing patterns and shape shifting until about 9 hours after ingestion. LSD stimulates frontal lobe activity very much so I found sleep difficult until about 4:00 in the morning, when I finally realized that I hadnt eaten or drank all day and was probably still awake because my body was searching for food and water.

All in all, a great trip.

It's been a long night.

My last submission to erowid was at the age of 17. At that time I was determined, through the use of psychedelics, to unlock secrets of the universe, and while I have had my share of transcendental experience and startling revelation, I am now, seven years later, content with brushing up against the common grace of the human soul.

I hadn't had a good strong trip with lsd in many years, due to the consistently poor quality and low dosage of what was available to me. I recently moved back to the Seattle area from Portland, where, during my last few weeks it seemed there a was a large amount of synchronicity leading up to this experience, as I've always found the case when coming close to an intense encounter with psychedelics. 

This particular evening, after spending the day sharing drinks with an old friend I hadn't seen in over a year, I had caught the bus to the closest place to my current home as possible and had just embarked on a seven mile walk to get home when I ran into my somewhat recently ex-girlfriend, with whom I had spent five years and we had a pleasant conversation during which she informed me she had eight hits of good acid with her that she'd be willing to sell me at a bargain. I bought all eight and intended to save them for later in the week, but a few miles into my walk I decided that, as I had no obligations for the next few days and would have the house to myself for the night, I should sample it. 

I had been told that one was enough for a strong trip, but I've been the recipient of a lot of dubious dosage information, and so I ate two with plans to take a third if I didn't feel much within an hour. I ate the initial two around midnight, and the third around 1 am. Within a half hour I was beginning to feel it, and ended up getting a little lost on my way home. 

Eventually I found my way, and being hungry, I ate a bagel, after which I proceeded to the back deck to sit and think about my life, my friends and the woman that til recently I had thought was the love of my life.

I am the product of a decidedly tumultuous adolescence and young adulthood, but from what better cloth are writers cut? I've recently become more confident and sure of myself than perhaps at any time in my life, and I came to the conclusion that in the different phases I had passed through, I had been attempting to define particular aspects of myself and then attempting to define myself as that aspect alone. It has only been recently, and especially after this experience, that I've been able to see the whole picture and truly come to terms with who I ultimately am. 

I listened to the albums of The Books on my ipod all night, and decided that the path I was embarking on, to get a certification as an audio technician and take music classes in college is by far the best that I could have chosen for myself, and was amazed at the amount of work and passion that these two men had put into making such beautiful music with sounds most others would consider the noise of a normal day.

I came to the conclusion that the real importance of a life is whom one chooses to spend their life with and with what dynamic they interact. I am exceedingly grateful to have been able to share almost a quarter of my life (and certainly the majority of my adulthood) with someone so strong, caring and graceful as my ex, and while I miss her I know what would happen if we gave it another shot. I cried for the loss (albeit due to my own decision and action) of someone who was so important to me, but ultimately am glad that we may be able to still be good friends and hopefully spend some time together now and then. 

I felt immense gratitude for the two other friends in my life who had played such important roles, and resolved to tell them and my ex how much they mean to me and to thank them for having been there for me when my own life wasn't going particularly well. 

I'll be the first to admit that I have my share of vices. I've been known to occasionally drink and smoke to excess, and I am guilty of occasional lust, but tonight I've taken the first steps toward tempering those. I decided that, as I've recently been smoking far less marijuana than I had in several years, due primarily to lack of money and a quality supply, and had been grateful for the clear-headedness that relative sobriety provides, it seemed pointless to be drinking as much alcohol as I had been over the last year, and that if I wasn't driven to smoke something that has positive effects, then I should make an effort to smoke fewer cigarettes, which only provide a fleeting satisfaction, as well. 

Regarding lust, which was large factor in the ending of my most recent relationship, I realized that there is nothing wrong with sex, as one is only sharing oneself with another person in a way that borders on boundary dissolving, but that due to the intimacy of the act, it's unwise to be frivolous with it, and ultimately was glad that, though the opportunity had been available, I hadn't made love to anyone since my ex. I thought about my unfortunate preoccupation with pornography and, while I understand this preoccupation and can define its origins, it is no longer of any use to me, and ultimately is only detrimental to the possibility of having another romantic relationship.

As all this was going on it came to be about 4:30 in the morning, and having finished off a pack of cigarettes in an effort to satisfy an oral fixation and alleviate my unconscious tendency to clench my jaw, I decided to go for a walk to find another pack. I reached the nearest gas station at about 5, but they weren't open yet, so decided to try the nearby Safeway. They didn't open until 6 am, so I wandered around the complex, appreciating the fading visuals and being moved by the sight of the rising sun and the sounds of The Books.

When the safeway opened I went in to buy my cigarettes, but after a lengthy and particularly awkward conversation, found out they were charging over $7 for a pack and so decided to walk further down the road to the next gas station. 

After a half hour of walking, I realized just how far I would have to go to get to the next gas station (being on the sammamish plateau), and after appreciating the view of seattle from in front of the city hall, decided to head back and try the first gas station again. 

I should mention, having read the books of carlos castaneda, that I was surprised to find that in the early light of the morning, and with the mild visuals that remained, I took note that the crows in the area, while flying, appeared white. I wasn't even sure they were crows at first, until I saw them land and heard them caw. 

Eventually, around 6-6:30 am, I got back to the first gas station, bought a pack of smokes and walked back to the house, where, as my visuals had quickly been receding and my state of consciousness returning to a more and more grounded place, I smoked another cigarette (wishing I instead had a bowl) and laid on the couch to watch tv in hopes that I might be able to fall asleep. 

It is now 6:30 pm, and even though I've come down to pretty much baseline, it's been 18 and a half hours since I took the first two hits and, while I felt particularly tired about 7 hours ago, having spent quite a bit of time lying on the couch seems to have been plenty restful, as I could easily stay up til much later this evening with no trouble. My body, however is quite fatigued and so I'm going to go lay down and see if I can't catch some shut eye.

Hopefully this was helpful for someone. I know a large number of the trip reports on here are focused on serious psychonautical exploration, but as I've grown older I've found my trips taking on much more of a grounded character that serves to reaffirm my beliefs and passions and help to solidify my goals and the path I've chosen to take to reach them.

Thank you for your time and your attention,
-Symptom6

I consider myself fairly experienced with psychedelics and for the most part prefer solo trips. Up to this point Ive taken mushrooms, 2cb, 2cc nbome, 2ci nbome, 4-aco-dmt, dmt, cannabis, salvia, and lsd, my favorites being 4-aco-dmt and lsd as both have propelled me into an intensively transformative and useful headspace. My inspiration stems mainly from Terence Mckenna, Rupert Sheldrake, Ram Dass, Alan Watts, Timothy Leary, Amit Goswami and a number of interesting individuals in my personal life. Most of my trips are accompanied by music and are prepared for with study, meditation and an empty stomach.  

Setting: The previous weekend had been a fairly traumatic one yet it seems the positivity that Id been able to muster throughout seemed to open up an awareness that I was eager to test.

To ensure I have enough material to ponder during my trip, I fill my chalkboard with some ideas Im currently mulling over, including interaction through quantum entanglement, rebirth, multiple realities, the lapis philosophorum, fractal leveling, and what cause our act of perceiving might have on holding our reality in place. I've found that my mind tends towards trips without a valuable lesson for my sober self, ie: pondering the psychedelic soup, dancing and singing to music, so I hope using this as a baseboard will catalyze a creative breakthrough that will have some sort of lasting importance in my life.

Next I pick out the music I will play during the trip and set it up on the laptop which I hook into the sound system I have stationed at the front of the living room. Lastly, I prepare some food to eat later on: a stalk of celery with peanut butter and one without, a stack of crackers, two with peanut butter, a bag of unsalted almonds, an apple, a yogurt cup, and some grapes. Im finally ready to begin.

3:45PM: I place the two blotter tabs on my upper gums in the same way that one might take 2cc nbome. I believe this makes the drug reach the blood and therein the brain more quickly. The blotter tabs were advertised as 200ug each, though I had not tested this to verify. Ive taken these before though and it seems an accurate estimate. [Erowid Note: Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be done casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements were derived, it is reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.] 

I clean up my room during the initial come-up and afterwards rest in the living room, listening to relaxing chakra meditational music and thinking about how quantum entanglement might be observable in psychedelic space. A thought comes to mind from a lecture I had a few days ago, where the teacher was talking about full duplex communication in networking, and I relate the two concepts, where only an entangled mind could both speak and listen at the same time, and that such a mind is one that I need to work more on.

4:40: My awareness has noticeably expanded, it seems in the same way that I feel my glasses press down on my nose, the glassy black entertainment center which stands in the front of my living room too presses against the floor, both of which I can feel as extensions of my physical body. When I close my eyes and reach out I can feel the life force in the trees which surround my house and I catch a memory of a past 2cc trip where I had done this same thing. I write in my journal that the music Im listening to reflects my soul from every physical point it touches.  I become aware of the energy my heart is generating, my stomachs energy, my feet and legs feel full of energy, and a sexual energy is also vibrantly making itself known. These could be experienced as a body load and uncomfortable, but I figured it is what it is and was able to read it without getting caught up in it. I walk into my room which has incense burning and I become elated with how good it smells. I exclaim that it must be the best smell I have ever smelled in the history of my lifetime. Its wondrous influence makes me extremely happy.

4:45: I attempt to introduce a playful variable: a glow in the dark ball which I had used on my past trips. I throw it around, juggle it, squeeze it, drop it and hurriedly pick it back up, and have a thought, which prompts me to leave my toy. Psychics are people aware of the wave-mechanically transmitted data that the firing of neurological pathways produce. I am also caught up in a darker thought of contemplating the nature of a delusion. How can someone be deluded if it exists outright for them? Is it possible consensus reality is a collective delusion? These thoughts unsettle me, perhaps luckily, the trip ends this transmission and my body begins vibrating more furiously.

5:04: I write Its becoming hard to do anything physically, clammy hands, legs, etc. The energy is becoming overwhelming, though the energy is not emotionally connected to anything, so it is somewhat enjoyable. The dominant thing here is the physical sensation. I change the music to a youtube video called Zen: Music for Balance and Relaxation (Full Album.) The music has a consistently critical yet soothing undertone. It seems to provoke my mind just enough to constantly explore, peace appears to be earned in this music through acknowledgment of pervasive suffering and simple solutions.

5:15: The physical sensation begins to take a negative turn and I write Blissful awareness is turning into fitful imagination. Nothing too vivid is happening here, but I begin to see images seep from my subconscious as what I would now call a body load reaches its height. This is the transition it seems where the imagination takes an active role in perceiving reality, it felt like crossing a liquid radio channel.

5:17: Two minutes later I find that the music and my thoughts are being evoked almost visually, I say almost because it seemed archetypal, like the vector equation was there, but it hadnt been processed into explicit imagery yet. I write Music is beautifully complementing my thoughts like a fractal realization growing more pervasive in the membrane of imagination. It would seem the body load has lessened and the trip is again quite enjoyable.

5:22: I write RAM DASSY pov. I recognize the music as being very Alan Watts like (Zen-like) and the awareness I felt as being very Ram Dass like (God-like). I feel an intense connection with everything around me. The simple awareness that I had experienced before has evolved into waves of information coming from both my surroundings and non-locally from inside my mind. An LSD-awareness begins to emerge. I feel I am beginning to recognize patterns that I simply did not have the ability to otherwise. Note that the body load has been recognized somehow to be information and is now much less a factor.

5:53: I spend ~30 minutes getting accustomed to the newfound headspace and it seems Ive reached a peak. The information data stream is taking many different forms, I see flowing rivers of geometry, shifting into a stream of 0/1 bits, and back again when I close my eyes. The data stream grows stronger and stronger and I decide to change up the music. I find Kundalini-First Chakra on youtube. The music progresses and me with it until it reaches climax.

Now focus on your pineal gland. Lounnnnngggggg. Lounnnngggggg. Lounnnnggggg 
*thunder sounds*
Kundalini Huh du Heinem 

I realize that this is the moment when my being will be utterly exposed to the incoming energy that I now feel coursing around me. My abdomen seems to open up and my body integrates into the data stream and I feel the core of my being open up. I feel that there is no hiding any more, I must let go of what is restricting my integration and understanding. I let go, but it seems there was not enough energy to complete it, I feel I may have missed my chance to open up whole-heartily, though I still feel refreshed, enlightened, and awakened. I write First peak passed felt outside merging with inside.

Beyond this I have no more time stamps and for the next couple of hours time itself becomes a slippery concept and description becomes more difficult. I write My being is seeking integration into the family soul collective, and I may be realizing its existence for the first time. I have before experienced what I consider to be my familys subconscious valley on a fairly large 4-aco-dmt dose, and it seems that now Im being confronted with the possibility of revisiting this place. 

It would seem in retrospect that my integration into the collective was characterized by the metaphor of a microscope which moved from a wide view to a refined, smaller view. I begin to feel what seems to be a peripheral schema which I have developed from. Surrounding all sides of the fractal which I now associate to my conscious thoughts, I become aware that I have grown from a huge history of both conscious subconscious habit, I feel past lives and beings feeding perfectly into the being that I am, past times and future times all seem tangible and able to be manipulated from where I now stand.

A thought arrives. I decide now is a good time to eat the snacks I have prepared. I take the sweet tea out of the fridge and take a sip. It is wonderfully sweet and affects my entire being. I now feel the collective consciousness that I am now a part of all reacting to this sweet tea and it evokes responses which identify the different entities that I am a part of. I also identify a metallic taste and cant tell what it might be from. I wander around the house feeling different entities slip in out of my being which at this point feels more like a server rack than a self-contained unit. I make my way back to the fridge and pull out the rest of the goodies. A stalk of celery with peanut butter and one without, a stack of crackers, two with peanut butter, a bag of unsalted almonds, an apple, a cup of yogurt, and some grapes.

As the trip progresses, the beings move from 19th or 20th century plantation owners (which the sweet creamy peanut butter provoked, peanut plantation?) down to my immediate family. I feel a sort of primacy moving through the layers of history, like Im connected by the physical sensation that the food provided. When I arrive at the current time stream I am infused with the immediate presence of my family members, none of whom are actually here. I feel the amalgamated mood of this collective conscious weigh down on my perception and I catch glimpses of a persons eyes flashing towards me, sparked by the look of a lampshade, or by the positioning of the couch. The description may sound vague, however the identity of each individual was quite pronounced and I could identify by name each presence. The mind space implied to me that I was in direct contact with these people, on a very deep level, and that though they may not be aware of the connection, it did appear to be genuine.

~8:40: The connection with this tremendous conscious awareness seemed to catalyze the development of my personality and I was quickly transformed by this connection. Though difficult to describe, it seemed that my pushy intellectual thoughts became raveled up with a level of compassion and love that felt irresistibly genuine and gravitational. I was the emotional center and my being felt reflected, just as it was in the music, except this time through the interconnection of the presence I was entangled in, and in doing so, I became so much more than I could have been on my own. I was laughing a lot and reveled in the thought of being a monkey in his family stomping grounds. I write Im a monkey, my monkey nature. Every action pushed through the family schema became magnified and the fractal boundary of my being seemed to deepen and concresce with joy. Many other people seemed to be present as well, including a few friends, all of whom I sent extremely positive and loving signals to. I expect when I see them next I will be ever more open and loving of them.

~11:00: The trip now begins to wane out and it would seem my being rests with that of my uncles. I look down at my hands and they too seem integrated just as my mind is integrated, I see reflected in them the presence of them; large, fumbly, compassionate, humorous, primordial/natural, and very loving. I lie down in my bed for the night and play some guitar, yet find it hard to find any proficiency playing even the most rigorously memorized songs. In retrospect, none of my uncles play the guitar, so it is possible that the morphogenetic resonances related with the guitar were weakly engrained, or maybe it was the clammy hands :P. It takes a long time to get to sleep and for the rest of the week I am left with a sense of peace, well being, compassion, understanding, and openness.

In closing, it is difficult to relate the nature of really any sort of psychedelic trip and Ive left a lot out that I knew Id never be able to describe. I hope anyone looking to do psychedelics does so for creative inspiration and makes use out of the unexpected results that often come from trips. It is now a week after the trip and I still feel the expanded mind that I had felt in the first hour. My dreams have become more vivid, I feel connected to the people around me in a way I didnt think was possible, and I am planning on moving out of my fathers house as Ive realized what I need. Its the love on that deep felt level that counts, and when that goes missing, ego controls motivations and life becomes a dreary place indeed.

Well I guess thats all I have to say for now, thanks for those who read through the whole thing, Im still working on my writing skills and descriptive faculties, and I will hopefully be writing more of these.

(blotter / tab)





BODY WEIGHT:
150 lb





After months of meditating for the first time in my life (about 5 months), I ingested three hits of potent LSD rated at about 300 micrograms. [Erowid Note: 
Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be done casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements were derived, it is reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.]   After dosing, I allowed about thirty minutes to pass to come up a bit and then I sat for a meditation session. I saw many visions that were infinitely complex in structure of goddesses, cities, and pyramids. It all built up to me seeing direct visions of what I perceived as Buddha in meditation posture.

It was only about an hour into the trip and I hadn't even peaked. At the peak of the trip, I experienced full blown ego death. What resulted were ultimate feelings of rising up into a state of pure bliss. I felt connected to the infinite now. This exceeded and went deeper than any of my previous LSD experiences. Further amusing by the fact that I wasn't even on a heroic dose of the substance.

Everything seemed to be great until I realized I wasn't coming down from the trip after about five to six days. I continued to meditate to alleviate the immense energy that I felt, but this didn't stop me for experiencing visuals and other characteristics of the substance at times, and I couldn't meditate as extensively as I could before. 

I at many points had nearly made direct contact with entities, only to catch myself becoming delusional.

I ended up nearly destroying my TV and guitars as I shouted, I don't need these things! and pranced around my house naked, terrifying my mother, who managed to remain strong and calm through this episode.

After this I fell back to some state of stability, with a new found since of peace and ecstasy. My mom felt relieved, comforted by this and I was the happiest I had ever been, ready to take on my life and move on from the experience. This happened on about the fourth day.

It didn't last as feelings of paranoia and fear about darkness began to creep up the next day after. As time wore on with the substance in my system, I began to weaken with controlling my mental state again. When I looked in the mirror, I looked as if I was on the verge of death. Sleep was not a possibility for the week that I felt the effects of the substance, which might explain the immense fatigue that I wore on my presence.

After being unable to control myself again. I began to think that I was telepathically communicating with two friends of mine. I thought, without having communicated with them in person, that they were on their way to my house to pick me up and show me around the new world. That's right, the new world.

During the entire experience I thought that everyone of my peers, people around my age, were also coming to some state of spiritual awakening. I at many times hallucinated  as I looked at websites like reddit and such, that other people were on my wavelength, including the friends I thought to be picking me up. I also assumed that the world just managed to change drastically, to the point to where we were already on the verge of utopia. As my mom feared that I was getting ready to leave the house, on my own, in the middle of the night, she decided to cleverly convince me she would take me to see my friends. Instead, she brought me to the hospital, quite possibly saving my life.

There they put me on anti-psychotics and I was sent home after a few days of being in a psych ward for one day and a detox center for drug addicts the other few days. There visuals were still present at first, often being outlines of Buddha or some other figure meditating. After about a day or two in the detox center, the visuals began to subside and I calmed down, yet I felt some level of inner peace and calm I had never felt before, although nowhere near the level that I felt on day four, more than I had felt in many years.

A few weeks after being on the medications, the anxiety rose again to the point to where I couldn't successfully meditate and the inner peace and calm left me. I withdrew from the medications, but the anxiety worsened.

On one fateful night, it got so bad, I felt like I was on the verge of suicide, but I held on and went through it. The next day the peace, calm, and a light level of bliss come rushing back to me with a successful meditation session. I had found god and with it, tears flowed. 

I am now happy AND stable; it's only getting better with each day and each meditation session.

I posted this for the psyhonauts that might have experienced similar and are attempting to reintegrate something of this nature. Honestly, I shouldn't have dropped acid. It was foolish and had it not been for my mother, great harm could have happened to me. I also think that I would have lost it completely and forever had I been genetically predisposed to schizophrenia and other similar illnesses. The only thing I've been predisposed to on a genetic level is depression and ADHD, both of which are continually lifting from me drastically after this experience.

This experience has gotten me to the point of renouncing all drug usage. I'll be reprocessing this experience for a lifetime and I also would like to see more research on LSD and meditation, because this only raises many questions about the substance, spiritual experiences, and psychological illnesses.

According to what I've read and seen on chakras, what I experienced is similar to what some describe as a pre-mature opening of the crown chakra, which often sends someone insane if their lower chakras like the root are not strong, open, and stabilized.

Disclaimer: This is not a how-to guide. I do not feel that I have found enlightenment. I feel like I had a spiritual awakening, but I am young and many challenges await me. What I experienced is possible for everyone if they are willing to work for it, but only the individual can determine the path they need to take for spiritual growth, which includes whatever it is to be done to get to the here, there, and everywhere. For some it may take months to get to this point, for other years. I hope that this can inspire others to take a much safer and stable path to arrive at that constant state of becoming.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

11:50pm: Lights have become, in my state of mind, liquids. Everything is no longer normal. My normal mindset is gone. I want this to stop, but I know in my mind it's not going to. Just with MDMA and LSD, once it is ingested, there is nothing you can do but ride it out. My room is completely dark other than my clock which poses the time in a green font. My ceiling has now become a white light panel. The entire ceiling is lit up as it is a giant light. Yet when I look to my side, it fades and I'm still in a black room. 

12am to 2am: The trip has finally hit with full fledged force. Lights are waterfalls, dripping onto the ground around me like glow fluid. The ceiling fan is moving clockwise, but stops and shifts counterclockwise. My covers no longer feel like they are on my body. I feel the warm sensation of being curled up in my bed but it almost feels as if I am levitating in a warm magnetic field. Sounds are extremely distinguishable. I can no longer just hear sounds, but I can distinguish frequencies and wavelengths of different tones. The sounds have a reverb that echoes multiple times for about a minute after they happen. My walls are starting to become transparent. My mind knows my house so well that it is projecting what is on the other side of the walls, making it basically see through. Behind the wall that by bed faces; on the other side is my shower. The wall no longer exists and I can see straight to my shower. Shadows are playing tag. The clock is projecting dim light making shadows of the bedside lights and other objects such as drawers. They are all shifting around and moving from wall to wall. Light tracers have become more than tracers. If I stare at my clock for a few seconds, I can look in a dark corner and still see the time, as bright as if I were staring directly at the clock again. My laptop light has a dim light (MacBook) that fades on and off as an indicator that it still has battery. It's no longer fading. The light is a constant white. If I take my phone screen, I can move it side to side and up and down and paint my entire vision white. It slowly fades away from where I first started to where I stopped, almost like a domino pattern. My perception of time is completely gone. My body and mind both feel like they are stretching in between multiple dimensions. I feel completely drugged (probably due to the large dose of anxiety medicine). I can feel the air. Not like when you are on a beach and feel a breeze, but I can cup my hand and feel a presence of gas. I'm no longer in a normal world. 

3am: Dimensions and time are shifting. I have no recollection of where I am or what is going on. I feel like I'm in a spacial void and I have no idea what to think. My mind is absolutely confused at this point to where I couldn't complete my thoughts. I had been texting my friends at this point explaining my trip, and them texting me to keep me some sort of comfort. I can no longer text them anymore at this point. When I open the ''New Message'' option, the screens features are shifting at rapid rates and speeds. Every time I click on one of the letters, it floats off the screen into the air in my room and fades once it hits the walls. After stumbling and pressing every number and letter possible, my home screen is just a white page with no text, options, or buttons of any sort. Time is shifting. The numbers on the face of the clock are changing rapidly, they are all going through the course of 0-9 like a slot machine. I no longer have a sense of the time because I cant even understand my clock. I'm shifting around the room and the ceiling. My bed isn't against the same wall, I'm facing a complete opposite direction each minute. My bed also has gone from being on the floor to the ceiling and now the carpet is the ceiling and the fan is beneath my feat. It is thundering and lightning outside and I can feel the soundwaves and vibrations all over my body to the core of my bones. The reverb of the thunder last several minutes and the light of lightning isn't a quick flash anymore, when it happens the brightness stays, and slowly fades minutes after.

My heart rate has come down to a significant stable level, as I have accepted my trip and now I'm slightly more or less enjoying it. Patterns are all over the place and I can vividly see textures surrounding me. Lights are spinning just like fans and giving off pulses. I can see waves of lights in every direction I look. Keep in mind I am in a totally black room but it feels like all of my walls are LED panels and my room is rapidly changing colors. Every time I verbally speak, I do not hear the words until my sentence is finished, as if someone was repeating what I was saying after I was done. I can't understand anything. I no longer know where I exist, what I am, or who I am. I'm very educated in the field of science and astronomy so the intelligence is projecting spacial images and stars and such everywhere. I feel like I'm floating throughout the realm of space and time. 

4am: The trip is slowly starting to decrease. My mind is coming back to my body, as I am piecing together myself in my room and I can now figure out who I am. I'm collecting all my thoughts as if all my years of learning are being crammed into my mind in a 30 minute period. I am relearning everything as if I was just reborn. I'm completely drugged, I've had enough depressants and sleep medicine to tranquilize a horse, but I'm still awake, yet I can feel the depressant in it's entirety. I get up to go to the bathroom because I haven't peed in several hours. I avoid looking into the mirror because I know that I will get lost in it. As I turn around after I'm done peeing, I catch a glimpse of the mirror. I try as hard as I can not too, but I end up staring at it. I don't know what its called, but I'm seeing one of those infinity type images. I can see myself hundreds of times like I'm looking through a tunnel and I can see the frame of the mirror multiple times as well. This is a complete mind trip so I stop staring a return to my bed. Every time I touch my sheets, instead of feeling a fabric my fingertips can feel each and every single thread. I can distinguishable feel the texture of the thread. 

5-7am: My body and mind have returned. The sense of time and awareness of where I am has also returned. I know where I am, who I am, and I can finally realize that I'm just in my dark room, inside of my house. This trip was the most intense I have ever experienced, even more so than my previous trip on half a strip of acid in the past. Patterns are still shifting, but its not intense enough to not realize that this is just a chemical shifting my vision. Lights are still quite watery, and I can still hear lights and see sounds. Yes, hear lights and see sounds. I'm okay at this point, I've fully accepted my trip and I'm no longer scared of what is present. Patterns are crazy and I'm playing some new funk/electronic music that is very pleasing. I've never heard music in such a vivid form as this. I'm relaxed and laying in my bed enjoying the comfort and security of my covers.

7:40am: I finally pass out. The depressants and sedatives have beaten the trip. 

10am: I wake up describing my trip to my friends as best as I could. I can type this experience up but there's no words to describe it. This is one trip that is a life changer and I will never forget this.

Many of you have heard the announcements in the Woodstock movie warning about the brown acid. The truth is that the only problem with the brown acid is that it was so pure that it wasnt accompanied by the usual body rushes caused by speed and other adulterants in use at the time. As a result multiple doses of acid that was very strong to begin with were sometimes taken, and some trips got way out of hand.  I knowbecause I gave away a bunch of it.

I was 20, and thanks to my father I was asked to work at Woodstock, delivering and setting up machines that sort and roll up coins. The vendors there expected tons of change to be flowing in and wanted a way to manage it. If my father had known that I was already an acid head it never would have happened.

So, as unprepared as one could possibly be, I loaded three very heavy (80+ lbs each) machines on top of a blanket in the back seat of a Pontiac Tempest. The blanket  and a battery operated light (the kind that are white in front, red in back) were the extent of my camping equipment, and I had $200 to last for what I thought would be 5 or 6 days.

As soon as I drove through the gates it was a cornucopia of drugs. I was only interested in one, though, acid. Kids would jump onto the hood and trunk of the car for a ride, and it was very slow going. I saw a painted VW van advertising acid, and I gave one of the kids a $50 bill and asked him to run over and score me a few tabs. Traffic sped up a little, and I lost sight of him and the van, and kissed my $50 goodbye. Then out of the rear view mirror I see him running up to the car behind me.  They dont have change of a $50do you have anything smaller, they are $5 each. I thanked him and told him, f**k it, just get me 10. Sure enough, he comes back with 10 brown tabs, and the guy's phone number. He expected I might want to get in touch with him in the future!

I finally got the car parked, it was getting dark, and there was no way I was going to find the people I was supposed to deliver the machines to that night. There was nothing else to do, since the music wouldnt be for 2 more days, so I did the only logical thingdropped a tab. And man was I pissednothing after 20 minutes (when the body rushes usually started for me), nothing after 40 minutes, nothing after about an hour. $50 down the drain.

It was getting cold, and I needed to get the blanket out from under the machines. I couldnt summon up the strength to take even one of them out, so I tugged on the blanket, ripping it in a few places, but finally got it out. I put it over my shoulders like a shamans shawl, grabbed the light, and started to walk in search of some real acid. All of a sudden I get a rush..totally electricand it stops. A few seconds later, another rushand it stops. I walk past a couple coming the opposite away and they comment on someone they see Wow, he is f**kd up. Another rushand it stops. I finally realized that 1) they were talking about me and 2) the rushes were coming and stopping whenever the red light on the back of the lantern flashed on and off. Without knowing it I had gotten deep into a trip.

It was an extremely pleasant buzz, lots of colors, lots of visual distortion and auditory effectseasily the best acid I had ever had (and I was VERY experienced).

Two other experiences from that night stand out. I met a pregnant girl, a Hog Farmer, and we sat on a rock and talked for what seemed like hours, sharing my blanket. She was the proto-typical hippie girl I had always fantasized about meeting. I dont know if I even kissed her, but after we talked and she needed to get back I gave her $100 of my remaining $150.

Then I came across a kind of natural amphitheater where people were camped out for the night, and I settled in. There was some brief acoustic guitar from the stage that was the bottom of the amphitheater. Someone told me the next day that it was Jorma K, but I never found out if it indeed was. So Im settled in, drifting in and out of some trippy thoughts, when someone yells I need a shovel, with some faint echoes bouncing off the trees (or my somewhat handicapped ears!).  A few minutes later I need a shovel, and  then I need a f**ing shovel, someone get me a shovel. Im not sure how long his pleas went on, but finally someone yelled What do you need the shovel for?, and the first guy giggles Uhhhh.I forgetand everyone in the amphitheater laughed in unison.

I wound up trading half the remaining tabs for food and wine, although  most people would share freely without the barter. I gave fair warning not to take more than half a tab, and not to think that it wasnt coming on and take more. Others might not have gotten or heeded that warning, hence the announcements and need for some talking down.

I did call the guys who originally sold it to methey were from Chicago as I recall, and had thousands of tabs. There was no way I was going to drive from NJ to Chicago unless I could  score enough to resell, and I just didnt have the cash for that. A great disappointment, because I never found any as pure or strong after that. 

I probably did acid over 200 times in a space of about 3 years, at one point 3-4 times a week.  I dropped out of college twicein my 8th semester. Its impossible to say how much acid contributed to or was a result of other psychological problems/pressures. The spectre of VietNam, a break up with a girl that I took very hard and hanging out with a very Rock and Roll crowd didnt help Im sure! I wouldnt blame any of it on acid really, never having a bad trip and having a couple of other very memorable experiences (fraternity hazing and the release of Abbey Road come to mind!)

About me:

I'm a 21 year old musician, chess player, and psychonaut.  I'd say I have an intermediate experience with hallucinogens having done mushrooms more times than I can count and acid a dozen times.  I have no family or personal history of mental illness, I smoke marijuana daily, and I generally have my life together.

This particular event took place when my main band decided to ingest acid together for the first time with some new liquid we had aquired.  I had broken up with my girlfriend the night before but I felt that I was in a peaceful enough mindset to be okay with the planned trip.

The Trip:

T+0:00: The guitarist and I have taken acid together since the beginning, the drummer a few times, and it was the first time for our singer.  'Guitar', 'Drums', and I took 2 hits each, and 'Singer' took 1 to test the waters.  We decided to listen to some music while we waited to feel the effects.

T+1:00: An hour later Drums and Singer were starting to feel the effects while we were listening to The Doors.  Guitar and I were not impressed with the new acid and passed it off as weak.  We each took another hit.

T+1:05: The first two hits started to take hold for me and I looked at Guitar.  He was looking back at me with the same, 'Oh my god, what have we done?' look on his face.  We laughed and decided to get ready for an awesome trip.

T+1:30:  We were listening to Portugal The Man's new album and I was watching the ceiling warp and change while the lyrics took me to a faraway place in my mind.  (This CD would set the tone for my battle to come.  If you have heard the album then you already understand.) I was having the time of my life and I believe I can safely say the same for Guitar and Singer.  Drums was slowly spiraling downward into his own introspection and wasn't liking what he was seeing.  We could feel the bad trip across the room.

T+2:00:  Everyone was full blown tripping at this point.  We had planned out most of the trip and it was time to listen to our new release to get inspiration for new music.

As we listened to our CD I closed my eyes and let my mind wander.  I imagined a woman dressed in a cloak from the future placing an object on a pillar.  I couldn't see what it was because the item was bright like the sun.  She placed it on the pillar and the light grew until it was brighter than the sun and in an instant it was gone.  Teleported back in time where it would be safe.

To me, that object was our music and we had somehow found it.  I knew it as a powerful weapon that could be used to destroy the world or bring it to glory.  It was all ours.  I suddenly knew myself as a guardian of an ancient relic, my band mates were my fellow warriors.

The CD ended and I opened my eyes.  I was feeling the third hit and the world was entirely new.  Our house had become an ancient land.  The music room was a treasure room where we kept our precious weapon.  The rest of the house was an itracate series of tunnels in a cave designed to confuse those who would come to steal it.

I looked at Guitar, the silent assassin.  He was smart, calculating, and precise.  Singer was a noble knight, a bit loud and arrogant, his intentions to change the world were righteous.  He was our leader.  I am the biggest and strongest of the group and I felt like the muscle.  My bass was a weapon of power, I had to be careful where I put the notes because I could change the edge of our weapon altogether if I wasn't careful.  Then I looked at Drums.

Drums was having a terrible trip.  I looked into his eyes and saw for a brief moment something I've never seen before.  A demon...I knew then that a demon had possessed Drums in order to get close to the weapon.  He wanted to get close to us so he could use the weapon to destroy the world.

To make matters worse he kept saying Demon-like things. 'We're going to become great and take over the world!'  I 'knew' that my fellow warriors would not be fooled by such trickery but I couldn't call him out on being possessed or we could be killed.  Now was the time for calm moves.

T+3:00: After listening to our release and taking a quick break, we piled into our music room and hooked up our equipment.  My bass felt new.  For the first time I appreciated the smooth edges, the way the strings felt in my hands, the weight of the bass on my shoulders.  I was one with this weapon and I wondered briefly if somebody would find this ancient relic and use it's power someday for good.

Drums asked in a demonic fashion, 'If you could play one last song before you died, what would it be?'  So this was how it was going to end.  The demon was going to kill us after he learned the secret of the weapon.

We started playing one of our old songs.  I felt that the three of us were battling with the demon through music.  It was like a video game, every well played note seemed to hit the demon and every misplayed note made the demon stronger.

Drums was terrible.  The drum parts were inconsistant, the tempos kept changing, and I figured it was because demons didn't understand how to use the weapon correctly.  I couldn't let this get to me, we had to destroy this demon.

After the intro was over and the song really picked up I closed my eyes as if being forced by an unknown entity.  No matter how I tried I could not bring myself to open them.  I played my parts on instinct and feeling.

Suddenly, I felt our souls being transported into Hell.  The music was distorted and alien.  All of the evil in the entire universe had surrounded us.

At the moment it was clear, we weren't fighting for just our souls.  We were fighting for the souls of the entire world.  This was the time to fight back.  The fate of the world and its inhabitants depended on us.

T+3:04:  I have never played the song so well and with so much passion.  Could the souls of 3 men defeat the entire army of evil?  Does love really conquer all?  I wasn't sure, but I would be damned if I didn't try.

The song was nearing the finish.  I felt like we were losing, it was just too hard to play against the drums that were consistantly wrong.  I started to lose faith.  This could be it, the world would be destroyed because we toyed with a weapon far too powerful for mere mortals.

It was only a matter of time, the song was almost over.  Evil was winning.  I perceived the temperature in the room rising by potentially thousands of degrees.  My skin felt like it was melting off of my bones.  I had to try, I had to fight, what else could I do?  I loved the world!  I couldn't let it be destroyed.

The outro began, the part where I do back up vocals.  As I shouted my back up lyrics I felt a strange sensation.  Love was coming out of my chest and filling the room.  It wasn't just from me, I could feel the love coming out of Guitar and Singer's chests as well.  I could even feel it from Drums.  The weapon wasn't sent from the future, it wasn't kept in the music room, and it couldn't be stolen by evil.

The weapon was love and we each had a piece of it in our hearts.  I heard the demons start to scream. I could feel them clawing at the walls and trying to escape.  We were killing them off!  We could actually beat this!

The song ended and my eyes opened.  The room felt cool, calm, and peaceful.  Drums looked up and said, 'I feel like I just woke up.'

'Welcome back.' I said with a smile.  We turned off our instruments and separated into our own rooms.

T+3:05 onward:  I spent the next several hours in my room playing online chess while still tripping.  I felt sober compared to the events that happened in our music room and in truth I won most of my games before falling asleep for several hours.

I stopped feeling the effects of the acid completely around T+10:00

While the trip was intense and intricate, the lesson I learned that day was very simple and I believe it to this day:  Fight for what you love.  If you go down in the name of love at least you tried.

Cheers.

Im standing in a room the size of a warehouse, dark and crowded with bodies shimmering with energy that will soon turn to sweat and cheers.  I feel waves of excitement through my body  is it from the chemicals inside of me or the tension of a crowd of people nursing cheap beers and trying not to stare expectantly at the empty stage?  The room goes black, a collective yell comes from our throats, both primal and civilized at the same time.  And then our noise is eclipsed by drums, guitars, synths, and a voice like liquid meets velvet, like wine.  My body shakes, my toes tap, my head nods, my energy radiates outward and mingles with that of the people around me.  I can feel an involuntary grin spread across my face  the music, the energy, the acid surging through my veins, it all brings me closer to bliss.  I turn to J to see if he feels it and can see it in his smile, in the ways his eyes glow a bit brighter, in the movements of his body.

Before long I desire some distance from the sweaty energy of the alcohol saturated crowd, and I also want to actually SEE the show, enjoy the colors and appreciate the artistry of the band, which my mere 51 stature wont allow.  So we zig and zag through a maze from the floor to the side balcony and find a secret vantage point where we can watch the mass below without being consumed by it.  As I allow the band to transfix me with music and lights, I surrender to the retreat into my own mind.  Sensorily, Im here, watching and hearing and feeling a Wolfmother concert at the T Theater.  But psychologically Im in my own reality  and it occurs to me that we all are, from the girl who must be crushing her poor boyfriend by perching atop his shoulders, to the crowd surfer pumping her fists as hand after hand grazes her body, to the middle-aged woman bopping cheerfully in the aisle beside me, to my dreadlocked tripper buddies nodding their appreciation of the entire spectacle.  I flow with it.  

The music explodes in my ears, the brightly-colored lights are both beautiful and confronting.  They almost crash into my eyes but I dont want to look away, instead I smile and relinquish control to the sensory overload.  I feel the power coming from the stage, watch the rest of the crowd equally transfixed in their own way.  And yet Im relieved when the song mellows, when more subtle, fluid noises warble from the synth and gently vibrate my ear drums.  I am aware of my brain again.  It is sharp and smart, I can see everything clearly.  I can see my weaknesses and I can see the truths that make them bearable.  I want to tell my sober self so she can have some peace, I only wish that she will someday understand.

The journey continues.  I dont know for how long, is there any time on an acid trip?  And then its over.  The music climaxes, the crowd surges, the energy peaks.  Wolfmother have gone and the lights come on and we have to deal with reality.  Get out of the concert hall, try not to grin too much at strangers, find my friends, make our way home.  We attempt to collect ourselves and start to walk in the direction of the city, looking for a taxi.  My legs are weightless and I cant feel the cold, I want to walk until dawn.  But the speed and the headlights of the zooming cars are jarring, and finally we climb into one and ride to the embrace of home.  With trance cranking on the stereo, a book of Alex Gray paintings to transfix me, and my friends beside me on the couch, I can drift calmly through my altered reality.

I am a male 18 years old of average body weight. I have always been interested in mind altering substances. To this day I have only experimented with alcohol, marijuana and now LSD. Nowadays I no longer use marijuana however I still drink alcohol fairly often. Up until recently I never had or knew of a way to purchase something like LSD, I suppose it always seemed to me as one of the hard drugs. 

Recently a friend of mine, who I do not see that often anymore, announced that he could get LSD. Of recent times he has been right into experimenting with many new drugs other than alcohol and marijuana, due to this he had acquired a lot of new contacts and now knew of someone who could get him LSD. Naturally when I heard this news I was very keen to get some, as I have always been particularly interested in the psychedelic side of drugs. Anyway I purchased one blotter tab of him for $20AU, to me this seemed fairly expensive. But never having purchased it before I didnt really know what to expect and it wasnt much money to try something new that I had been wanting to try. 

I was amazed by the size of one dose, it really is tiny. It was a little piece of coloured paper wrapped in foil. I had also heard that it was important to keep LSD in the freezer to preserve it so this was also done. On the day I decided take the dose Id had a fairly late night the night before and was slightly hungover from drinking. I am sure this had a negative effect on the experience. I arrived home in the morning at about 10:00am and took the tab at about 10:30am along with a few toasted sandwiches and juice. I have recently heard that juice can make LSD more potent but was not aware of this at the time. This may be a rumor Im not sure, it doesnt seem to make much sense. 

Anyway after taking the dose and eating breakfast I headed up stairs, I started watching TV to fill in time as I knew I would have to wait a while for it to set in. After about 30mins I began to feel a slight change in thinking patterns but just assumed it to be my imagination at this stage. About 5 or 10mins after that, I began to notice little things changing, if I really started at my curtains I they would ripple slightly but nothing special at all. Throughout this time my stomach seemed very gassy and often made gurgling sounds so I could tell that it was being absorbed. Realising that it was just beginning to come on I turned off the lights, lay on my bed and put on interesting melodic music.

After another 10mins I began to find myself staring at my curtains and could now see clearly that they were moving. They were moving as a whole thing, almost as if they were attached to a board and this board was being rocked forwards and backwards. I then began to notice my sheets and if I let my vision run they began to resemble some sort of skin. When I saw this I new that the LSD was starting to take more of an effect, so got up and sat at my computer and became fascinated with my desktop background. It is a 3D computer generated picture that starts out bright in the middle then darkens off on the outsides and allover it there is sort of like a network of wormlike structures with brighter parts to them. Normally it is an interesting looking picture but now the wormlike structures were beginning to squirm about the screen, particularly at the brighter spots.

Suddenly I noticed one of my walls, this wall is brown and the lower part of it is fairly dirty from peoples hands touching it. The finger marks appear a whitish sort of colour against the brown wall. When I looked at these marks they spread right up my wall and onto the ceiling but they were no longer just marks they resembled a sort of Asian script. But if I put my ear against the wall and looked at them side on, they appeared to be raised off the wall but now it was just a foggy looking haze that now flowed down off the wall at a very fast pace. It was like watching fog get blown into a valley if you have ever seen this happen.

All of a sudden what was happening sunk in, it was amazing, everything in my house was incredible to look at, to touch! I then couldnt stop smiling as I ran around the house like an idiot feeling and looking at different things, each one just as amazing as the next. Soon I found myself looking at all our pictures on the walls. One painting in particular, well two they are meant to be put together and were sold as a set. The sides that face each other are a rich yellow with blots of red and the outer sides indiscernible people shaped patterns each a different colour. Staring at these paintings was amazing as the once stationary red blots were now jumping between the pictures with amazing trails. I could not stop it happening, relaxing or concentrating my eyes did nothing, it was just how I saw it.

Other less stimulating pictures would appear far away only to race up towards my eyes and become what appeared to be about 5 times larger than they were when I first looked at them. The other amazing thing was when I found the mirror in my bathroom, it was me but then again it wasnt. Imagine a thousand photographs of your face are taken from the front but each one at a slightly different angle, left, right, up, down. Then play all the shots back to yourself at about five every second and that is how I saw myself in a mirror. It was interesting but a tad unnerving at the same time.

My sense of touch was as heightened as my sense of sight, it felt as though my I could keep pulling off my skin as I pinched myself. I amazingly could pinch myself as hard as I possibly could and would not feel any pain. It was as though I was encased in a layer of dough. As well as my own skin, my dogs fur felt pretty amazing in-between seeing him turn into a wolfish looking creature and then appear as himself. The colour of his fur would change colour uniformly as if adjusting the hue of a picture on a computer screen, by now it had been about 2 hours since it took the LSD. I was feeling very different but it still knew where I was and what was going on and I still had a good 4 or so hours until anybody would come home. I figured that it wouldnt come on anymore and I would be fine by about 3:00pm.

But while walking around the house I felt a sudden kind of jolt or something in my head, like my consciousness had periodically been jerked out of my head, all of a sudden I didnt really know where I was and no longer felt with it. All my hearing had become muffled and strange so I sat down and felt a bit better. Then it happened again but stronger this time, it was then I realised what Id got myself into. I turned the heating off and went to my room, closed my curtains and got into bed. Strangely enough I felt far more sane with my eyes closed. I spent the next hour in this position freaking out, I was panicking as my mum would be home in about 2 hours and I didnt know how long I would be like this for. I certainly wouldnt have been able to hold down a conversation and not let on that I was fucked.

I drifted in and out of what felt like consciousness, gibberish persistently echoed around my head in this scratchy old sounding English accent??! My heart was racing and I nothing was as it seems, the walls of my room were convulsing and pulsating, periodically the whole room would appear to tilt on a 45 degree angle. Still realising that this is was in fact just the LSD and that it would eventually go away, I just put up with it and shut my eyes. It may not have been an all that unpleasant experience if no one was going to be home in a few hours. I would probably have had loosened up a bit and not been in such a state. But at the time I kept thinking why have it taken this? Will I ever be normal again? I missed normality. But thats were I was and I had to deal with it, it did get quite terrifying at times and I shuddered to think that this was only one tabs work and couldnt imagine what taking five or something tabs would be like. Not getting any better I figured Id put on the TV again, this did wonders as I would have a few seconds at a time where I knew what was going on. Then just a quickly as Id recover my consciousness would be ripped from the side of my head again.

At about 2pm two friends came round to see me, this turned out to be very fortunate as one of them had used LSD before and had experienced all this. She was able to reassure me that it would wear off eventually and just to relax. While her boyfriend kept me entertained (and conscious) with stupid comments, as he likes to do. The three of us sat in my room watching TV and Id have snippets of conversation with them in my more sober moments. This was great as I had people to re assure me and some company, I began to feel better again. Despite this I was still tripping incredibly and my room was still bending and bowing uncontrollably, which I still found it fairly disconcerting as my mum was going to be home within the hour.

My mum did come home within that hour and came straight to see me and who I had over, I just said I was very hungover and she went away and didnt bother us anymore. I was lucky she didnt ask too many questions as I would be unable to provide much of a coherent answer. Another hour went by and the three of us just continued to chill out as we had been doing afternoon. Then almost as quickly as I had realised that I was tripping, I felt extremely spacy but sober and like my brain had just run a marathon. Suddenly I was capable of conversing without my consciousness deserting me. I could walk straight and the room stopped rotating. The drug was far from gone but it never returned as it did earlier that day. Surfaces still swam when stared at and the Asian script was still in full view but the high was just fun now, not too intense.

Soon after this happened my friends when home and I was extremely thankful that they came along. Then a good 2 hours after that I went out for a walk in the cool evening, the sky was clear and the fresh air was fantastic. Looking up at the stars still provided me with flashes of colour and the lights in the valley looked brighter and their colours were much more intense. I basically was myself again but was just feeling very spacey and mellow, not a bad feeling really. I pondered the days experience very deeply on the walk, I felt extremely mentally drained but very relaxed. It was a truly incredible experience but wasnt something to be taken lightly, not like have a few tokes or a couple of beers to relax, it was something pretty heavy. It was like the classic drug scene from movies, the hallucinations were unbelievable. I cant say I was having debates with posters on my walls or flying gracefully down the stairs of my house on the back of a unicorn but you catch my drift.

The experience opened my eyes amazingly to what the mind could do if provided with the right ingredients. I would definitely do LSD again and definitely in the company of others I trust. I think I will be waiting a while to do so though, I can tell that something like that is not good for my brain and it should be allowed a fair bit of time to recover.

This wasn't the first time I'd taken LSD - I'm also confident it won't be the last time - but it did open my eyes to the enormous power of psychoactive drugs.  I'm 26 years old and no stranger to the joys of chemical experimentation - pot, mushrooms, acid, E, meth, bzp, opium, I have indulged in and enjoyed all of the above and more over the past decade.  One of the reasons I have always enjoyed the likes of LSD and psilocybin is their ability to completely transport me to a new reality.  Generally this has been a pleasurable experience - opening my mind to different ways of thinking, finding pleasure and beauty in the most unexpected of places.  This time was different.

The day started with a road trip to see the Rolling Stones.  Personally I can't imagine a better way to start a day!  During a stop for road works at around 6.00pm I decided to drop.  The trip commenced after around 20 minutes - the usual stuff, feelings of anticipation, finding amusement in the most mundane things and slight perceptual disturbances.  Nothing untoward really.  The group I was with decided that they would each take half a trip and hold off until around 8.30.  Perhaps that would have been a wiser choice.

Upon arriving in Wellington we booked into our accommodation.  Explaining myself had already become somewhat of a challenge - though I managed to cope.  During the taxi ride to the stadium I felt the waves of the trip building inside my head and body - by this point I was looking forward to what promised to be an absolutely stellar evening.  We found our seats with a minimum of fuss and settled in for what promised to be the show (and the trip) of a lifetime!

When the band arrived on stage and launched into the first few songs I remember thinking that whoever had made this batch of acid had done so with this very concert in mind.  The music, the lights and the crowd seemed to gel into one unseperable and ever changing entity.  I was entirely overwhelmed (in a good way) by the whole experience!  The concert seemed to go on for ever, encore after beautiful encore.  By the end of the show I was almost in a trance, standing almost completely still among a crowd of 40,000 feeling the music, the lights and the acid wash over, through and around me.  A strong trip - yes.  But certainly a good one!!

After the show finished I remember trying to take stock of my situation.  Where was I?  Where did I need to go?  Who was I with?  Was I behaving in an appropriate fashion?  I was suddenly transported into a very hostile and confusing world.  Leaving the stadium was difficult - I became paranoid and confused by the crowds of people around me.  There seemed to be a residue of the light show from the concert following me around, wherever I looked I was greeted by brightly flashing lights and gross visual disturbances.  I can honestly say that at this point I was completely unable to seperate the effects of the drug and the reality of what was happening around me.  I heard voices instructing me to do various things, which I thankfully managed to ignore, I felt eyes upon me, at one point I found myself wandering around in a completely different city.  At least that was what my brain was telling me!  I knew I was in Wellington, yet my brain persisted in telling me that I was back in my home town of Dunedin wandering familiar city streets.  I had also become prone to incoherent outbursts and was distrustful of everyone around me.

I decided at this point I should probably make my way to somewhere a little less public so returned to the backpackers we were staying at.  Upon arriving in my room I removed a shoe and launched it out the window.  It was closely followed by my other shoe and a packet of cigarettes.  At this point I had a moment of clarity.  It was like the real me had returned.  I was still tripping, as evidenced by the incessant shifting of the walls and floors around me, but I was coherent again.  One of the crew I was with summed it up nicely when they said 'Fuck!!  Where have you been for the last two hours?'  I'm still not sure.  Having come, at least partially, to my senses we went for a bit more of a wander around the inner city, exploring, walking, talking shit.  I was still having a storming trip, but at last I was able to function!!  We ate kebabs, we ate curry, we drank, and I wished I hadn't thrown away my shoes.  Gradually we all returned to earth and made our way back to our room for a fitful sleep.  The trip was over and I had been somewhere I had never been before.

I firmly believe that I ended up in some kind of drug induced psychosis during the night.  What triggered it?  Who knows.  I have taken higher doses before without the same effects.  This was the first time that I had had my ass handed to me on a plate by drugs.  I was left with a sense of falibility - no one can ever claim to have total control over a drug experience and this wasn't an insight I'd had until now.  I had a newfound respect for hallucinogens and what they could do to a man.  This trip was the best I've ever had and the worst.  The concert experience was nothing short of magnificent - the after show was very close to hell on earth.  World War Three inside my head!

This illustrated to me the importance of respecting (and never underestimating) the power of drugs.  We all take them to have fun - but there's always the potential for the unexpected to occur.  Everyone should have at least one experience like this.  Especially those who claim to be able to go harder than everyone else.  That was me.  Now I know I'm not chemically invincible and it took me just one tab to teach me that.

I awoke early on this Saturday morning. Tired yet very excited towards the coming adventure. We reached our destination around 9.30am, and instantly divided the tabs. My friend D*** and I were taking one and a half, and the others just one. We have had LSD before but only in small doses, and we never experienced it to its full potential. But we both knew after today that would change. We had an abandon house with a large block of land to trip at. Around 25 minutes after dropping the tabs, I was walking with my friend B** to retrieve some insect repellent as our trip spot was quite infected with mosquitos. While in the supermarket, I noticed overwhelming feeling of butterflies in my stomach, and anxious feeling. Once we had bought the repellent we then walked back to our trip spot.

I noticed while approaching the abandoned house, it seemed to stretch very far away then normal, and kept stretching the more I walked towards it. Half an hour since dropping, back with my friends now, all feeling the same anxious butterflies in us, I slowly begin to feel the effects. My mind starts racing, I feel energy building up in me, my stomach begins to tense up and also my jaw clenches in a strange matter, very different to MDMA. My friends heads are warping slightly, nothing drastic. I don't remember the full effects creeping up on me so quickly, but around 1 hour into the trip, after lying down for a bit I open my eyes, the trees around me are no longer trees, but a collage of of amazing colours collapsing into each other. The effects are quite intense, I feel a discomfort of some sort, nasuea? I couldn't tell, my body had left reality, and now for some reason I could not identify what nausea felt like. I take deep breaths, I look up. Now wait a minute, I've never seen a tree turn that colour before. I start to feel more comfortable, calming my self down, taking more deep breaths. 'Ok I've taken some acid. I WILL be ok. I've done it before, even if something bad happens I will still be ok.'

Slowly my mind falls deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. Soon I cannot even remember what reality is or was. I sit up feeling an energy burst, Mars Volta is beeming from my friends speakers, the music appears in a Vein like formation on the ground weaving in and out of the leaves, truly amazing. I see my friend flick a insect off him. I stare at this insect, my mind starts its amazing power. I think about the insect's mind. What thoughts does it receive from its brain? Does it have emotions? WHAT CREATES A THOUGHT? My brain is now a masterpiece of thoughts, of life, the brain evolution. It is around 2 hours after dropping, I finally get to my feet, my friends heads are extremely oversized, caricature like. One of them for some reason resembles Richard D. James, from Aphex Twin exactly! 'HOW DID YOU DO THAT!?' I yell. My friends obviously are aware now of my altered state. 

I take a walk around the abandoned house, looking on the graffiti covered ground, the graffiti slowly starts to swirl around the ground with a smoke like texture. I slash some water onto it with my water bottle, the water stain expands rapidly to about 50 times its normals size, morphing into amazing shapes, disappearing and reappearing. I am astonished, I run back to show a friend, noticing back on the way the scenery slowly turning black and white and then back to its full coloured self, the leaves with a flurescent like texture. I take my friend B** to the spot where I saw the amazing event. I splash the water onto the ground, I see the exact same thing, so does B**, I then begin to realise that his mind and the rest of my friends are all now sharing the exact same wave length. We then begin to share our thoughts and discoveries, all being able to relate to each other, some amazing conversations, this is around 4 hours after dropping.

We decide to take another walk, up a long pathway. So many different sceneries that I interpret as other worlds I witness on this walk. I say to my friends 'Welcome to the treadmill of numerous realities.' They burst out laughing, what a trippy thing to say I think to myself. The extreme hallucinations start to wear of now, I am left now with a racing mind, and small warping effects, this is after around 5 hours. I notice that the comedown in slightly similar to MDMA, very worn out feeling, loss of social mood, no depression just not a very talkative mood. What an amazing day. I will remember this day as my first mind expansion, a great day with friends, and much self discovery.

This is my recollection of my first acid trip. It was done with my girlfriend who had never done it either. My experience with drugs consists of chemicals such as MDMA, MDA, MDE, Methamphetamine (glass), Ketamine, Dipenhydramine (Dramamine), Adderall, Vikadin and plants such as marijuana and mushrooms.

Setting: My friend's apartment with no one home except my girlfriend and I, very trippy one floor apartment with weird pictures on the walls and interesting color schemes. Outside the weather is awful, raining/snowing/sleeting and cold. The night before, well about 1 that morning we took about 250 mg of Ketamine each at a rave and sniffed Rush, so that might have been a factor in the upcoming trip. At around 12:30 pm we dropped 3 tabs each and waited.

T+1 hour: Starting to feel odd, just straight out weird. A bit anxious, I can feel it in my stomach and it's really annoying, we're giggling about everything mocking the cats in the house, I don't even know why, it was just funny. We start seeing some visuals, things turning and spiraling and patterns emerging and such, nothing brilliant but hey it was entertaining. The nausia is subsiding a bit. All of a sudden my friend whose house I was at comes into the house crying, and I think 'Oh shit, tell me this isn't just a perfectly cliche event to lead us onto a bad trip.' So I go into the other room and that's when the fear starts coming, because we just started coming up fairly strong when my friend came in and I'm like damnet, so I started thinking of like all these terrible things associated with evil and death and it was just scary, and I was on the verge of freeking out when my girlfriend came in and comforted me, saying how she was okay and my friend had made her hot chocolate. So I calmed down a bit, my friend left and it was us 2 again in the house.

T+2 hours: I'm starting to get really paranoid of my friend's mom coming home, even though I knew for a fact she would not be home till about 6:30 and it was about 2 or 2:30. I kept trying to comprehend what was happening as nothing was real anymore, patterns emerged from every crevice of the room, the music was incredable but I just felt SO weird I couldn't take it. I was in a continual thought loop trying to figure out what was going on. I kept getting real scared and I just wanted it to end. My girlfriend calmed me down a bit, it took a while but she did. Making out is real weird, I got bizarre mental visions. I kept envisioning weird colors in my mind.

T+2.5 hours: Now the ceiling is raining rainbows though the ceiling is actualy white, and occasionally I see bursts of butterflys or it would start raining roses down on us. I was getting antsy again as I didn't know what to do with myself we were literally stuck in the house because we couldn't go outside. The reason we couldn't go outside is when we looked out the window the trees turned alive and multiplied their branches and were just terrifying. Staring at the water on the ground from the second story window, the water turned into multitudes of letters and formed words. I was looking at black crows go by and right after they went by, a good 100+ more crows flew by in different areas of the sky, obviously hallucinations. So overall outside was too scary, but we didn't know what to do. I couldn't escape my mind which was on sensory overload. If there was no music I would hear sounds possibly miles away as if they were right next to me, and what was worse was they echoed - LOUD. And then there were more and more and more noises to the point where I couldn't be in the room.

T+3 hours: The acid was getting too me, I kept thinking that this wouldn't end and I'd be in a world that wasn't real forever, nothing was real anymore, the fan was alive, the walls were alive, the blankets were alive, the floor was alive. Patterns melted into each other, and then formed new ones, from those patterns came new ones. The tracers were unbelievable, I'd be able to swing my hands around and I could move the color/pattern scheme of one object right onto another object. If the wall was striped I could bring the stripes onto the floor. As I walked into each room I began turning every light on in the apartment to make everything glow it's own individual color. And it did, as I walked into the kitchen everything was green, we decided we were hungry but couldn't cook anything so I took out clementimes. The problem was they were green, so we thought they were bad. We forgot that when oranges are green it just means there not totally ripe. Somehow we thought that it was like bread, that turns green (mold) when it's bad, so it took us a while to figure that out.

T+4 hours: I am crazy. I am so far gone that I actually gave up, when my girlfriend was wondering the apartment, I decided to sit in this little tiny back room next to the refridgerator and wait it out. My girlfriend, being the persistant little girl she is came in and sat with me and basically talked me through it somehow. The irony is that I'm about 1000x more experianced than her but she managed to talk me into being happy. 

At one point I saw a train go by the window and my girlfriend saw a little girl standing in the middle of the room pointing towards a chandelier. There was a chandalier in the room but not where she saw it. At this point the music started getting overwhelming, my music selection was shitty as I kind of just figured pink floyd would be amazing, but in fact it was so bizarre it was actually scaring me, so we vigorously searched through my friends selection and found Good Charlotte. Yes - good Charlotte, we put it in and it was so corny that it made me happy! So were tripping out on the floor in her living room as my girlfriend is peeling/feeding me oranges and listening to Good Charlotte.

T+5 hours: At this point the mental part of the trip is diminishing, I have almost complete control of my mind which is wonderful because I'm totally not paranoid anymore and overall I'm just happy. But the great thing was the visuals were still increasing in intensity. The most beautiful patterns I've ever seen are appearing everywhere, everywhere I looked things were alive, it was magnificent. On top of that, I was starting to melt from time to time. I would actually feel my fingers extending or growing or getting fat/thin and I'd see it as well. In fact I even showed my girlfriend how my fingers were stretching and she saw it as I saw it and as I felt it. I was also, as well, able to control the movement of certain things with certain body parts, for example as my hand grew and shrank and moved I could move the door in that same fashion.

As with looking at ourselves and each other, when I looked at my girlfriend her head would grow and shrink, and her eyes (which she has nice big eyes as is) would grow huge, as well as her feet, but the rest of her body shrunk. It was if we were in Sonic the Hedgehog or Mario - actually she looked like a hedgehog, or tails from Sonic. At one point I saw my girlfriend was doin something weird with her arm, she was like trying to grab something in the sleeve of her sweatshirt with her hand. I asked her what she was doing and she said that her hand was lonely and wanted to meet another body part. At one point we were standing in the kitchen and I was saying how I was hungry and could go for a snickers bar. All of a sudden she's like yeah!... Jesse.... and that was it. I knew the rest of what she was going to say as one time Jesse gave us a snickers bar when we came home rolling and needed food bad, I knew the rest of what she was going to say because her memory actually transfered to me visually, I saw it happen in front of my eyes at that moment.

T+6 hours: At this point the visuals are receding, but just barely, the thought process was still really weird/fun. We took up some recreational time by drawing, I drew on her as she drew on a piece of paper.

T+8 hours: Sexual activity is fun, and were just having fun, things are still visually interesting, many things still breathing and swirling and very fun too look at, many patterns are still manifesting the house. We're laughing about a lot of things again and my girlfriend was sticking her tongue out at some poster cos she thought he was mean. Haha.

T+9 hours: We were still seeing visuals but my dad came and picked us up and brought my girlfriend home. When I came home I ate food (which was kinda icky) and talked to my girlfriend on the phone till 3 am - visuals were still here, I have some trippy shit in my room, lava lamps, electricity balls, etc. And they were making butterflys all over my ceiling.

The next morning I felt fairly fine, a bit brain dead, wasn't too enthused to go to work for 6 hours, but managed to go and didn't do to bad. Currently it's the next day at 7:30 pm I feel almost completely back to normal.

I had a desire to try acid for almost two years before I actually tried it. I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I felt that my experience would help me to deal with it.

Myself and a small group of friends had gathered at someone's house to try out some acid. We had each separately tried it but in very low doses. The evening started with a few joints to pass the time, we wanted to wait until there was no chance of bumping into any of his family members as they were still at the house. It was about 10pm when we decided to drop our first tabs. I had originally decided to go very slowly. On my first acid experience I had been tripping for 7 hours on just one tab and a bottle of cough medicine. It was an hour later when I thought that maybe one tab wouldn't be enough so I chewed down another. Over the following hour I started to feel a mild sense of euphoria and a desperate desire to eat my last tabs. By midnight I had munched down 4 tabs of half decent acid, as had one of my friends. Another (the guy whose house we were at) had taken 7 as he was a big guy and liked to get as high as possible whenever he chose to take any drugs. The other two people there took somewhere between 1 and 2 each.

We were at the end of watching some stoner film when I began to notice that something was different. Something felt out of place or strange but I didn't know what. Then, as I stared at the computer screen that had been playing the film, I noticed that everything had started to melt. At first I thought it was a screen saver so I asked the others what they saw, it seemed that they're tabs hadn't taken affect yet. I then looked back at the screen and noticed that all the walls were pulsating colour that seemed to trickle down the walls. I felt very comfortable with this, it made me feel warm, which was good because it was freezing outside as it was about a week or two before Christmas.

I stood up and looked at the others. They seemed stoned, uncommunicative, lethargic, as if something terrible had or was about to happen. I remember walking around the living room and kitchen when my mood began to shift. No longer was I happy and energetic. Now I was feeling ill. I felt like I might suddenly explode as the pressure on my stomach and brain built. This worried me at first, then I managed to focus and realise what had to be done. I told that others that we should go for a walk. It didn't take long to convince them as I could start to see them coming up, the drug had reached their brains. Now they were as excited as I was at the prospect of wandering the streets for many hours.

We had left the house before 1am (any real concept of time was lost for the next few hours). The five of us decided to head for the nearest park to make full use of the children's playground. Thankfully it was only about two minutes walk from his front door. We were delayed by the sounds of cats fighting. The noise was incredibly loud and seem to come from all around us. I remember standing in the middle of the road spinning round in a circle trying to pinpoint the source of the sound. My hands began to wave around in front of my face even though I hadn't told them too. The combination of this noise and the silhouettes of my hands became too much. I stopped just in time to stop myself from going crazy.

We reached the playground and utilised the swings. Even in the darkness I could see the amazingly bright colours that covered the playground's equipment. This was when I realised that the drug was beginning to engulf me. I could feel the psychedelic colours swarm around my head as though everything had become effected by my hallucinations. Normally when tripping I find that I only see things differently when I look directly at them, even then they appear to remain reasonably normal. Now even my peripheral vision was effected by the hallucinations. Everyone and everything was covered by a blanket of multi-coloured shifting patterns and shapes. This was fantastic as for the first time ever I felt truly at one with a drug. I was able to lose sense of what reality is really like in a safe environment.

Still in the playground, some of my companions had decided to eat some tangerines that they had brought with them. There was a massive fruit bowl in the living room of the house that had been emptied very quickly. The bananas went first, the texture and consistency of these once chewed was disgust so I binned it. They, however, loved the sensation of eating whilst tripping. They had carried as many tangerines and oranges as they could out to the playground and spent a few minutes savagely tearing the skin off. This was quite a manic scene that had made me think they had all become far too intrigued by this action, that they would be there for some time. Thankfully they stopped and we played on the adventure playground.

Bored of this we chose to carry on walking around discussing what was happening. Most of this is a complete blur to. What I do remember is trying not to focus on the hallucinations as, after a short while, they became too dominating. We eventually ended up at the house. I felt like the drug had left me and I grew tired. However, when I stopped to look at the small table in front of me and saw that it was stretched and out of proportion with itself (i.e. some legs were different sizes to the others but the table top remained level). I realised that the acid was still there. It was laying dormant whilst I was cold and my blood was running slowly. Now I was warm again, increased heart rate, the LSD was waking up.

The five of us had gathered in the living room, the door was shut and we had circled a coffee table/stool and began talking again whilst rolling up a few spliffs. This was a difficult task as concentrating on anything for more than a moment or two was almost impossible. We would occasionally break into fits of laughter and we each had huge grins on our faces for the duration of the evening. It was not long before we got a call from a few friends who wanted to pay us a visit. I remembered that a few hours earlier they had called to say that they were on their way. At the time it sounded like a good idea but I was no longer sure. It was late and I was perfectly happy with the people that already surrounded me. The pair had arrived and were waiting for us nearby. We had no choice now but to meet them and hope for a quick resolution (i.e. that they would decide to go home, allowing us to do the same).

Before leaving we went into the back garden to pay the dog a visit. Thankfully he was a placid dog, content to just stand there silently whilst we gathered around him. I couldn't understand how obsessed the others were by him. They seemed to be worshipping the dog. I wondered if they had gone mad but when I saw the dog's eyes I realised what had happened. It did have some kind of power over them, I knew this because his eyes' were both glowing bright green and I became convinced that he was trying to place thoughts in my mind by looking at me. This was not frightening, it just made me feel a little bit uneasy.

We left to meet the other two just around the corner from the house. I new one of the guys and could tell by his expression that he wanted to go home, he seemed to have been dragged here by his companion who was looking for a good night spliff. Thankfully we had left almost the entire stash back at the house, this made it a lot easier to get rid of him as lying about how much we had wouldn't be a problem. I let the others take care of the situation, I couldn't handle all the noise. If I did speak to them I think I would have told the to 'fuck off', that would have led to a very painful conclusion to the evening.

We eventually got away and back to the house. The atmosphere had been destroyed. It had put a real downer on a fine evening. Upon re-entering the house we all seemed to go into auto-pilot. Without saying a word we all managed to get back to where we were before we left on that little mission. It was fantastic. What made this even better was the fact that in our absence the lava lamp had heated up and was now flowing rather nicely. With all the lights off this made a nice centre piece.

The process of rolling up a nice spliff had started again but it was not easy as concentration levels were very low. I remember how we would have conversations about rolling up then someone would eventually decide to take it upon themselves to complete this task. However, it would not take long for them to get side tracked and we'd end up talking about it again. This went on for some time, I was sure we were stuck in some kind of a loop.

Eventually the task was completed. We stopped for a moment to stare at little fragments of weed that were still on the table. They had turned into red insects, maybe red ants (or tiny red caterpillars), and were crawling around. After studying them for five or ten minutes we began to smoke. At this point we were beginning to feel very drowsy and irritable. Our bodies and minds were tired but our brains were still wired awake. The friend whose house it was desperately needed sleep as he had to be at work by 9am that morning. It was between 5 and 6am when we finally decided to crash. As my brain was still wide awake I had entire operas and music videos playing in my head when I shut my eyes. The sub-conscious part of my brain tended to make up the words, the music was made by Goldfrapp I think.

I woke up at 7am and lay there on the floor. We left his house at about 8.30am and headed into the city to go our separate ways. I spent the rest of the day filling unadjusted and very out of place. Something was wrong and would continue to feel like this for about a day. After an hour or two at home feeling depressed I decided to take a nap. I woke up at 7pm just to eat some curry. I went back to sleep till the afternoon the following day. When talking to my friend who had to work that day he told me that he was still tripping whilst at work. Thankfully his boss was sympathetic to this.

Over the last few years I've indulged in excessive drug consumption, mainly ecstacy and coke, but on occasion LSD, mushrooms, base and whatever else comes along. I'm in my early twenties and my drug use is always contained to my social peer group. I hold a well paid job, and continue to function well in society. E is my drug of choice, for sure. Each weekend, I can safely say I'll be eating a handful of pills at least one evening. However, towards the end of last year I became interested in LSD. With a couple of willing friends I tripped a few seperate times, always having an absolute ball. The first time I tripped, myself and my friend munched a blotter each and went on the rampage at our local rock music venue/pub. We ended up laying on the grass in his mum's garden looking at the stars and laughing our arses off before going 'garden running' through his entire street's neighbours' back gardens. A great night was had, and LSD was something I wanted to do more often.

Having done a little 'buying and selling' of various substances in the past, I had the required contacts to source up some acid pretty quickly, and in next to no time was the proud owner of a small vial containing about 12-14 drops of a dark coloured liquid which was, according to the chap I purchased it from, some good and strong LSD. I sat on this for about a fortnight or so until I felt it was the right night for me and my fellow tripper to indulge ourselves. The two of us headed off to a nice and quiet pub in the town centre, which was run by a kindly old dear who was very tolerant of us all whenever we got drunk/high in there and started acting like clowns, and headed straight to the toilet where we liberally applied three drops via a pippette to the back of our hands, which we licked off. We were in an upbeat mood, very relaxed, laughing and joking around with my girlfriend who had met us in the pub and all in all having a whale of a time whilst necking a few beers. We noticed that a birthday party was happening in a seperate part of the bar, and all of the students were dressed as pirates and we were duly invited to join them. 

Now, by this point, the effects of the drug were beginning to manifest themselves. Several times, myself and my trip companion had been talking only for conversation to dissolve into giggles and I was also beginning to notice the lights brightening somewhat and dimensions becoming mildly distorted. At this point I suggested we finish off the vial, and thus we did. We manouvered into the gents toilets and in a fit of hilarity deposited 3 more drops on each of our hands. Things almost came unstuck at this point as midway through doing this someone came into the toilets and saw us squirting brown liquid onto our hands from a small bottle whilst laughing and falling around the place. Fortunately, the poor guy looked absolutely terrified, God alone knows what he must have thought. It reminded me of that scene from 'Fear And Loathing' somewhat. Anyway, suitably dosed up we went back to our drinks and carried on the night.

Within another half hour or so, we were both completely fucked. A bunch of our friends turned up and everything was great. The walls were shaking, the floor bucking, tables were dancing around the place, I was on fine form cracking jokes and having the time of my life and looking forward so much to the rest of the evening. The vial and the remainder of the contents were dumped in my drink so as to wash out any residue, and a beer fight started with the pippette. This caught the attention of the land lady who came and gave us a bollocking (we're all well known to her, and as I said, she is pretty tolerant of us) and confiscated the pippette and the now empty vial. A group decision was made, as it was approaching closing time (11pm over here in England :/) we would hotfoot it to our local rock club which was licensed till 2am. As a group, a couple of acid freaks, a few pillheads and plenty of drunks, we rolled out of the pub and into the night.

Now, let me just say, up till this point the trip wasn't especially strong. Sure, we were fucked, high as kites, in a terrible state, but neither of us were tripping out yet, things were just a little crazy. That changed as soon as we hit the fresh air. My memory is a little flaky of the journey between pubs (maybe a ten minute walk). I can remember cars screaming past at an astounding speed and volume, my legs kept stretching and shrinking as I walked, my friend's faces took on dark and menacing overtones. I became a little paranoid, a little wigged out. This wasn't helped by the other guy on acid climbing on cars and bus shelters, removing his clothes, screaming his face off and at one point dry humping a church. Yup, he humped a church. He's going straight to hell. Nonetheless, I was holding it together fine and kept it in my mind that I would soon be sitting in my favourite drinking establishment, nursing a beer.

This pub is huge. It's gargantuan, in fact. It's permanently packed to the rafters with rock kids and goths, the music is always full volume and the lights are always bright. I'm well known in there and as I staggered through the door, an unbelievable wave of terror washed across me. I mean, absolute ball shrinking terror. I had tunnel vision and I could just make out a group of friends at the bar who were calling me over, so over I went. This meant negotiating the bouncers and bar manager, who had recently given me a telling off for necking pills in the place, and I couldn't deal with it. The paranoia was too much. 'They're onto me,' my internal monologue said 'Run!'

I managed to bite down on the urge to run and made it to the bar and my friends. By this point though, reality stopped having any meaning. I can't describe things at this point. There was just colours, and noise, and faces, and eyes and I bolted. I was out of the pub like a jack rabbit, on my own. Days later, a girl who I was at the bar with said this was hilarious, that I was standing there stock still save my eyes, which were darting this way and that before I lurched into a sprint through the front door. I can see the funny side, now.

Once outside, I was dead set on getting home and laying in bed. I had the fear, badly. I practically ran to my house, which was only a few minutes away, avoiding eye contact with the terrible monsters that I saw on my way home. When I got my key out of my pocket, I was flabbergasted to find it was six feet long. 'How the fuck did I get THAT in my pocket?' I wondered, before trying to knock down the door with it. Once inside, I began to relax, I was out of danger. I sat down on the sofa and took a breath, before noticing something move out of the corner of my eyes. Some people were having sex on the floor! 'What the FUCK!!!' I leaped up and noticed that not only were there two people on the floor over there fucking like rabbits, the sofa had morphed into people going at it too!!! In a matter of seconds the room was filled with people writhing around on each other. I ran upstairs to my room, but there were people copulating in there too, so I wrapped my duvet around my head. Unfortunately I could still see the people. I have never felt a terror like this, before or since. I didn't know who I was, where I was, what was happening or if it was ever going to stop. Amazingly, I managed to phone a close friend who was sober, and she came and rescued me.

And then the terror stopped, it was as if the last half hour hadn't happened. Once my friend was there, all was right with the world and we went for a drive to her sisters house, which was a fantastic journey. I had watched Apocalypse Now a few days prior and as we were driving through the rain I had a full on 'Veet-nam' trip going on :) Once at her sisters I was able to sit down, relax and enjoy the frankly awe inspiring play of lights and colours around the room. I also had an excellent conversation with her dog, chatting to this intelligent creature like a long lost friend, although I'm told the dog was trying to savage me rather than discuss the pros and cons of Radiohead.

I was up all night, watching TV, chatting with my friend and frankly just enjoying thr trip. Little people were climbing out of photographs and dancing, her computer melted before my eyes before zooming back into existence and, for some reason, my thumb kept falling off, which amused me no end. At about 8am, I was coming down and starting to feel a little angsty so made my way home and walked across town. Still feeling odd, I showered as soon as I got home and hallucinated that the jet of water was stripping my skin off, which was unpleasent, but by this point I was coherent enough to realize it was just the acid and that I was alright. Still, quite a strange experience washing myself when my skin and muscle is being stripped from the bone.

I felt tired and uncomfortable for the rest of the day, unable to sleep, but unwilling to get up and try and do anything. I've had worse comedowns off of ecstacy where I'm in physical pain, but I did feel terrible, bodily and mentally. Luckily, the girl I was seeing came round to visit and pampered her 'poor little acidhead' all day.

All in all, a breathtaking experience. Demonstrated an awful lot to me. First of all, set and setting is as important as Leary always said it was. I doubt I'll ever do acid in such a social environment again, there's just too much stimulae and room for too much to go wrong. As soon as I was rescued, the fear went and the following 6 or 7 hours were the most enjoyable of my life. Lastly, doing as much as I did is probably inadvisable. I had tripped only a couple of times before the above events took place, I don't think I was ready for such a large dose. I've tripped a bunch of times since and generally only take a couple of drops at most and still have a great time. I also felt fucking horrible for days afterwards. I didn't stop having visuals until about 24 hours after dosing, and the comedown lasted days.

Oh, and the other guy on acid who I'd left in the pub? Apparently, he had a great time in there. He's well known as a complete loony around our town and his odd behaviour didn't raise any eyebrows!!! Not even when he got down on all fours and rubbed his head on the floorboards because he 'wanted to comb his hair'... :/ ;)

BODY WEIGHT:

Before Thursday, I had done LSD 4 times. 2 tabs the first two times, and 1 tab the next couple of times. The tabs around my town are very potent, if you get them from the right places so all you really need is one. After those 4 times, our hook for acid didn't want to deal with it anymore so I couldn't get it. Recently, my friend found a hook for it in the college we go to who had the same type of tabs we were getting before. So I decided I wanted to buy about 20 hits and start selling most of them and figured I could take a couple trips out of it too. 

The first night I get it, which was Thursday, me and my buddy we'll call D decided to ingest it fresh off the sheet. I took two, he took three. We went to a community park and smoked hookah and a bunch of marijuana. This trip was almost pure fun. Never had one like that we're I was just chilling the whole time. We ended up smoking a delicious 3 gram blunt of magical marijuana while overlooking this waterfall. Never done anything so fun with crazy hallucinations. The trip didn't have that big of a mental effect on me because it was just pure fun the whole time. 

After that, I planned on giving myself a few days at least to recover before taking another trip. Unfortunately, 2 nights later I was feeling like a million bucks and my friend (we'll call him M) called and said he was in the mood to trip. I felt like I was so ready for another trip but little did I know. M comes over to my house and it's midnight at this point and I have work at 7 AM. I took it anyway. We both took a tab and a half. M is one of my best friends but he has done a lot of acid, meth, coke, and pretty much everything in his life so he has a lot of psychological problems. After dropping, we bought a sack of marijuana just to lighten up the mood.

An hour into the trip, I'm already regretting it. Just wondering why I decided to do this again on a completely random night where I had work in the morning. To top that off, M had done meth earlier in the night so while he was tripping, he wouldn't shut the fuck up. We'd keep talking to each other and trying to figure things out but he would start blabbering off about something else that didn't have anything to do with what we were talking about at the time. This started to get really annoying while we were tripping in my house so we decided to take a walk outside to trip. This is where it got really weird and the same things were happening. We kept doing the same thing over and over, arguing in constant repetition about the same things over and over and never figuring anything out. We were mad at each other for a while, which was awful. We were having a bad trip, but we started coming back to normal and figuring things out in our minds. We were finally connecting again like we used to and started having a fun fun comedown.

I went to work feeling amazing and still had the acid in me. I was able to see into people much more when I was working. I was actually preaching to my employees about how awful the management is at my work and how the place was falling apart. Everybody understood what I was saying and completely agreed. After that, I was still tripped out throughout the day. I went home, did my homework, got a good grade on a quiz, and life was going great. I went to school the next morning and took a lot of notes and did great on a test. When I got home from school, I looked outside and it was such a beautiful day. I always had dreamed of tripping on acid during the day in the nature listening to the Beatles on my iPod just in heaven. I decided to do this indeed. 

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

When I got home from school, I dropped two more tabs at the same time, grabbed my iPod, and drove to Blue Sky trail, which is a nice nature spot in my area. I chilled there for a while listening to music just waiting to start feeling the acid. After a couple hours, I start listening to the Beatles out in the open forest just in heaven. I had never actually felt that good in my life before. It was everything I could possibly dream of.

A few hours later, I had already had my fun with the forest so I decided to switch settings. I called my friend who we'll call T and she said I could come over to her house and chill if I wanted. I'd never been there before and when I got there, it was like heaven. She had a truly hippied out room with Jimi Hendrix posters, Woodstock and peace symbols everywhere, a cool stereo with Pink Floyd playing and all these bright colors and crazy patterns in her bed that I could've stared at for hours, and I did. At this point, I could really feel the acid and it was only going stronger. We started smoking a lot of weed and I'd never felt so high before. Every time I ripped a bowl, I would hallucinate more and more.

I could feel the mindfuck coming again. I didn't know how strong it was going to be and really underestimated it. T went to do some homework while I was tripping and let me hang out in her room for a while. During this time, there were too many thoughts going on in my head at once. I was trying to make sense of what was going on around me and kept telling myself 'It's just because you're on acid' but it wasn't working. Over and over, I'd get these thoughts in my head and try to make something out of them but they just kept spinning and spinning through my head and I could see the chaos everywhere around me. It started turning into a very uncomfortable world where nothing felt right. It didn't feel like acid anymore, it felt like I was going insane. I'd never went that far into acid and tripped like that. I was getting lost in my thinking over and over again. I thought the peak was over, and T's mom was coming home soon so I decided it would be a good time to leave. I said my farewell and left the coolest room I'd ever seen in my life.

After that, I went to my car and started driving back home. It was getting to intense though. I thought all these people were honking at me and I felt like everyone was against me. All the cars seemed evil and I was getting overwhelmed. I wasn't straight to drive so I pulled over on a street to just chill for a while. I was by myself and very afraid. Everything around me was staring at me and torturing me. The trees all looked disappointed at me and like they were going to kill me. I'd been seeing crazy visions all night of evil thoughts every time I'd get lost in another pattern of thoughts. I didn't feel right and called my friend 'M' and told him that I really need a friend to help me through what I'm going through. I was stranded on acid and needed someone. Thankfully, he came and picked me up and took me to Denny's. This is when the peak ended. I started coming down but still felt like I was in acid land, and was loving it. Hallucinating like crazy, and everything felt so much more real. I could see what I was tasting and smell what I was seeing. 

That last trip all happened yesterday. The thing I love about acid is it makes me think about what I'm doing with myself. I started thinking about myself a lot at Denny's and decided I'm done with acid. I don't think I could ever take a trip again because my last one was too scary. I would never want those repetitive thoughts coming back to my head. It made me feel like a schizophrenic crazy man. I saw people in my ceiling when I got home and started talking to them. This is a side of me I never want to see again. The lesson I learned from this is that people can't do acid a lot. It really does fuck with my brain and drive me crazy.

At the same time, I'm glad that I had that trip because it's what I needed to scare me away from acid. I've finally come to accept the fact that LSD does fuck with your head, and I was always in denial of this before. I think LSD is more of a once in a life time thing that most people should experience. It makes me want to be productive and get my life straightened out once I start coming back to reality. I'm not sure how my brain is going to be affected by all my tripping but I know that now is the time to make a change in my life and stop doing drugs. I don't feel nearly as sane as I used to. I look at myself in the mirror now and my pupils are still huge and I just look like shit. I look like a crazy man and I really need to change. I bought the ticket, and I took the ride. I don't know if I regret it yet but I have a feeling that this will benefit me in some ways and damage me in other ways. 

I can still see the acid in everything and I'm not sure if it will ever go away. I think I'll always have the LSD tint in my vision.

Setting:  my familiar, comfortable home, with 2 good, true friends.

Previous dosing interval:  Three weeks

Dose:  4 Jesus Christ and 4 Hoffman Bicycle Trip. I was told the Jesus Christ was a conservative (minimum) but amazing 150ug each. Hoffmanns also excellent.

[Erowid Note: 
Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be done casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements were derived, it is reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.] 

Quality: Jesus 10 out of 10, Hoffmann 9.25 out of 10


So, I'll try as best I can to explain something as ethereal as was presented to me. My friends were dosing, and I was the trip-sitting since one guy was taking enough for five people, and the other enough for three. Here is the report that my friend gave me a while after the experience:

'We were tripping together, when I felt a surge of energy unlike any other. I had to excuse myself, because I had to lie down, everything was too much. So I go into my room, shut the door and the blinds, lie down, and get control of my respiration and heart rate. 'Relax, be the energy, let the river take you...' I was getting these huge rotating, overlapping and flapping arches type visuals, but the auditory vids were just as amazing, as the vids made 'bionic man' type sounds to them as the were going through infinity. As this is going, the experience is becoming more tense, I can feel every cell in my body flying off in a different direction. I'm getting stretched from everywhere so tightly, and the energy vids are showing what I'm feeling, that finally I feel free of my body, and the energy turns to Pure Light. Pure, unadulterated ecstasy. Casually the Light subsides... 'Now that I'm through, I wonder what's next, or is this acid out of gas?' 

'LOL this is some SUPER high-octane dose, mate, I havent even started yet...' True enough, I surf through the universe on giant waves of energy, until I am taken to another planet. This planet is so neat, all the aliens are so different, yet the landscape is similar to ours. I stroll around (feels like a stroll, but I'm flying) this planet for a while and observe. Again though, I feel that fission sensation, and the Winds on my cells pulling me Everywhere again. It was building in waves of ecstasy, like an orgasm, until again, I diffuse into the Light... Bathing in the sun... Orgasmic ecstasy...

I flash out of the Light, and see the universe folding over itself, contorting itself, bending, the power of the energy doing this was Omnipotent. 'I' was less that a particle of dust in a camels nose. I hold on to the only thread of words I could force myself to remember: 'You took acid, don't be scared, when its time, you will be back' I am transported to a new planet. This planet feels much more strange, more alien. And sure enough, these guys were shape-shifting. It's really hard for me to remember/express even 1% of the situation... They look more aggressive, and they stare at me and change shapes in front of my eyes. Not human shape, but fluid, liquid, sinuous electric shapes. They definitely give me the sense that I don't belong there. I will myself away from there, and proceed to fly around the planet, just looking down from away. I hoped the Winds would come take me away from this place... But I didn't wish where to else to take me...

Again, for the third time, the now familiar cellular-explosion was imminent. I get pulled more and more, till again, the beautiful Light, or God as I came to understand (but this is a whole new story). More beautiful ecstasy... For me its easy to be this calm on these VR environments. People only have bad trips went they fight the acid, or don't accept what they see. Your on a train. It won't stop until it reaches the station, so relax and enjoy the ride.

This ride took me to a third planet. Here, however, gravity did apply to me, and I was quite heavy. There were these angry, shape-shifting aliens again, and this time they chase me. I start running away, only to see that I too am shape-shifting this time. My leg goes through my chest and turns into an arm, all my arms turn to legs and I run on all fours, shifting and shifting until the aliens catch me. This was Not pleasant. I could feel very malicious intentions from them. They bound me and were getting ready to do who knows what with me. At this point I felt my control of the trip being restricted, so I had to change environments into where I have more control. I convince myself that this is acid, and I can get away.

I gather all my strength and run out to the main room where my friend and trip sitter were. They were playing 'I had a friend who hung himself' by Primus, and I start yelling 'no one is going to hang themselves in my house! turn that stuff off!!! My sitter immediately turned off the music and started calming me. 'Don't freak out, its only acid, you might think your not here now, but I see you so you must be. Sit down and drink a tea. There's a good bloke.' He then puts on some Hendrix and gets me an ice tea. That brought me so far back to me, it was amazing. I sat on my comfy sofa and I look outside (on a bright summer day) and it was snowing and blizzarding. Yep I think, this is going to be just fine. '

It was an ordinary February day, I had a sugar cube hit Id obtained from my buddy A. I had done acid once prior, and still experienced flashbacks from it, distortions of my visual field, borders and definitions would disappear. I had all but given up on mushrooms, I had done them 5 times and had 5 bad trips, The last 2 times both ending in paranoid breakdowns. I felt I had done something horribly wrong, everyone hated me or was reporting me to the police, I saw girls from past relationships in the mirror looking back at me, but nonetheless I decided to trip one last time.

Hallucinogenics take a long time to manifest themselves in me, usually a hour and a half to two hours, I had eaten lightly the previous day and had been ingesting Vit C for about a week prior, Thats about all the preparation knowledge I have, but it works for me. About 90 mins after ingestion, I noticed my hands were about 3 times bigger than usual, each finger the size of a whiteboard marker. I closed my eyes, I started falling through blackness, actually being drawn into it, the blackness tore open and revealed a field of red, green and blue stars and planets racing past me, a familiar hallucination that occurs in me on just about any drug, or even if Im just very tired.

All sorts of odd sounds seemed to be coming from outside my room, detuned saxophones, people yelling, soft piano lines, then these sounds would slowly fade back to the traffic on the nearby highway, The world outside my window beckoned me, trees moved slowly in my direction, their branches curving around to from ornate designs, I stepped outside to the bluest sky I have ever seen, I lit a cigarette, looking at it and my hand, something seemed amiss, the scene looked very distant. I walked around my neighborhood, feeling very tall when walking downhill and about 6 inches tall when walking uphill.

When I returned home I was fully tripping, it had been about two and a half hours, After using the bathroom I glanced at my reflection, this is when I completely disconnected, mirrors are usually what grab my attention when tripping and this time was no different. The light was off, so all I saw was a dark figure that seemed to be about fifteen in front of me, The figure was unrecognizable, but as soon as I though that, it became reality and my mind was gone, rather my ego, I wasnt me, The only thing in existence was this scene of the dark figure lifting its arms, it was in my field of vision but I didnt feel I was even there, It was just the only thing their, After five minutes of this (or maybe only 2 seconds) I composed myself and turned on the light, My face immediately began to melt, Then my shirt became my old football uniform, complete with shoulder pads, My shirt was black and red, so the uniform was too, unlike the purple one I actually wore when I used to play, Then my reflection became her again, a former girlfriend that I often dream about, I loudly said No! and jumped back, shaking my head, I felt exhausted so I lay down.

I put on my Ipod and lay down listing to radiohead, my ipods white backlight seemed trippy, so I held  it up to my face, with a rush my whole consciousness was sucked into the sea of white light, I was in my ipod, Each note making my body jolt with a myriad of tactile sensations, Thom Yorkes voice was fluctuating from fast to slow motion, new parts of the song formed, which I remember, but dont actually hear when I listen to it now, For another hour I just laid down on my bed immobile, glued to the ground, part of it. Staring at my ceiling, It glowed brilliant White, then faded to Pitch Black, then slowly became nothing. Not Black, Not White, Not Gray, it was just nothing. A sort of transparent indescribable cloud, Kaleidoscopic arrays of color came next.

I went outside to have another cigarette. I had the quintessential false feeling of sobriety, I wasnt hallucinating but something just wasnt right. I sat on a curb at the bottom of my apartment complex, To this day Im not sure if the next events actually happened. A car pulled up, its owner got out, went over to the lease office, opened the mail slot, looked inside then left, Another car did this, then another, When I predicted that the next car driving by would do the same, it did, two more times. I saw a woman walking on the street, then I would see one of the exact cars that had already passed me, pass me again. I floated home in confused stupor. While trying to sleep I suddenly felt a deep religious conviction, God was talking to me, I felt a massive sensation of guilt for all my past sins and broke into tears, After about an hour I fell asleep after twelve hours of tripping.

Since then, The world has never been the same, every horizon appears to be painted, with all sorts of specs of light dancing in it. Stationary objects stand out much more, I occasionally experience flashbacks of varying degrees, sometimes a clocks hands disappear, sometimes I mistake a car or bush for a fully formed person, in khakis watching me and smoking a cigarette, I was diagnosed with Persisting Perception Disorder, and Schizotypal Personality Disorder in 2007 and have since ceased the use of hallucinogenics, I still remember the last trip I had though, It was undoubtedly the most profound and mystical experience I have ever had, But if your mind is still clear, and you havent tripped yet, remember its not for everyone

It was week 4 of my freshman year in college, and I was going nuts. Smoking pot at least 15 times a day, taking Oxycodone and Hydro left and right, drinking, taking Ecstasy, but the experience I am about to describe quite simply blows every other drug experience I've ever had right out of the water. 

On a Friday it came to my attention that a few friends (a female we will call C, a male named A, and another male named J) had found a hook-up for liquid acid. 'Holy shit!!!' I thought. I'd run into acid only once before this in my drug taking history and it was crappy (and very expensive, $10 a hit) blotter. This shit turned out to be $5 a hit and apparently very potent. All my friends went and dosed at about 12:30 pm, I did not as I had no money at the time. After they came back, 2 hours or so later, they said it was soooo intense and they needed to be alone. So I decided to go get money and dose myself. Everyone who had tripped had done 2 hits maximum, stupidly I thought I'd do 4. 

I arrive at the dealers house and take my 4 hits. The dealer and his girlfriend are already tripping and we listen to some Moody Blues. After about 30 mins, and 2-3 bowls of some fine herb later, I left the apartment and headed back to my friends' dorm rooms. Walking home everything began to morph. Lights were shining like the moon into my eyes, the street began to look like I was looking at it through a fish eye lens. Walking by people I was convinced I was acting really high and not normal. Anyway, after about a 20 minute walk back to my friend's place, which usually only takes about 5 mins, I sat on the couch. At this point I thought to myself 'This is quite possibly the craziest thing I've ever done.' I had just taken 4 hits which, from what the dealer told me, was equal to about 6-8 blotter hits, I was in my friend's shitty dorm room that was piled with garbage, and everyone else was nearly done with their acid highs by this time. 

So there I was, tripping BALLS, and watching Blue Collar Comedy (which I fucking hate) while sitting next to some buds. At this point I began to feel very sick, but I stayed on the couch. This is when the visuals truely began. I looked at the couch I was sitting on and it suddenly became not just a small 5 foot couch, but 10 miles of couch. The entire room I was in expanded to the size of an airplane hanger, while I remained small. 'I don't feel so good' I said and made my way to the bathroom. After urinating for about a minute I looked in the mirror. What I saw may have been the most terrifying thing I've ever seen in my whole life. It was me, but as an old man. Somehow I knew I had had a dissapointing life and knew death was inescapable. My flesh was wrinkled and I wanted nothing more then another person to be with.

I went back outside to the couch where there were about 5 people all smoking. I saw them all as giant frogs, disgusting and horrid, who wanted nothing more then to please themselves. I was disgusted by the obvious egotism I could literally see coming off of them. My friend, C, looked at me and said 'Man you don't look so good, do you want to go back to your room?' At this point I could barely answer. My entire mental state was so incredible, but so hard to describe. I saw that at every moment I am the only thing keeping myself from happiness. Every emotion I felt was a direct cause of doing or not doing something, and I could see these paths these decisions would take me on. Every decision I saw as a string of energy coming from my heart and connecting to a point where my next decision would be made. The responsibilty I suddenly felt terrified me greatly and I realized what a child I was. 

At this point I was in no condition to just 'chill' with people. I asked my friend's J and C to take me back to my dorm room. On the walk there I could barely understand what was going on. Everything looked like a terrifying jungle to me, and everyone struck me as so disgustingly ego-centric that it made me insanely depressed. After finally getting to my room, my trip really pulled into high gear. I experienced something I have never felt on any other drug. It was as if my memories were literally tied to my mouth. Every time I spoke or moved my mouth, it was not my mouth that moved, it was a memory that was evoked. At one point I yelled that I didn't feel well, this evoked a memory from my childhood when I lost my favorite jacket. It was literally like I could experience a memory on demand with my mouth, they were literally cross-wired.

My eyes too were connected to memories. Many times I looked in the mirror and when I did I felt the most intense love for a stuffed animal I had not played with for years. At this point I was completely gone, when there was no light I hallucinated that everyone I had seen that day was in my room looking at me and studying me. I was sweating a lot at this point and my gut was making A lot of noise. I felt so sick and just wanted this overly intense trip to be over. At this point I opened my window and puked onto someone elses open window. The room was spinning, and I kept having a vision of my consciencess being a glowing ball of white static light. It made noise that was too intense for my ears and terrified my with its power. another hour of indescribable visions and insights and my trip began to come down.

I went to sleep about 8 hours after I had dosed due to sheer exhaustion. Waking up later that night though I felt the most intense feeling of peace and contentment. Everything was going to work out, it felt as if I had been through physical therapy and could finally walk again. The next day the after-effects were still with me, my touch especially felt very soft and insulated in a pleasent way. While this was a very intense and memorable experience I do not suggest 4 hits of liquid unless you have tried it first.

It was late after one of my favorite bands played in a small venue in Philadelphia, PA. It was about 1am when me and my best friend Matt were walking to my car as I heard the words being whispered 'doses doses' We approached the young lady, and she led us to her fearless leader Fabrenzio. We purchased 20 hits from Fabrenzio, and he quickly ripped us a strip of 20 off of his sheet.

As soon as we got into the car we called some friends to find the hotel we would be staying with for the trip, and I was handed a nice sized square of the colorful blotter paper and quickly administered it my mouth. As we arrived at the hotel destination, our friends told us they would be going to bed, and we would be forced to make the hour and a half drive home now.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

After about 40 minutes I began to feel the start of what would be the most intense tripping experience of my life. The first hour was quite pleasant. I felt a nice glow start to take over my body and made me smile very largely. We listened to some trancey music, and some TOOL. We both agreed that we had heard and felt parts of the music that we had never heard in the countless hours of sober listening before. I began to notice my speedometer to start the breathing effect and other various objects in the car. We engaged in very deep conversation of how much we appreciated the acid, and how it made us think of the world in many different ways. 

The second hour is where it got interesting. As we arrived to our home town, I decided that a discount store would be an interesting location to walk around and talk since it was the only thing open early in the morning. As I pulled off the highway, and arrived at the stop light, the world melted. The first time we had stopped in approx 2 hours was at a stop light in front of a food store, where we had realized that the dose we had administered had been much larger than previous times. I had never experienced heavy melting and visual distortion like this before. All my previous trips had been only a hit or two, the most being 5 hits where I experienced a very mental experience, rather than a visual one.

I quickly realized that driving was very strange, and seemed dangerous, so we quickly arrived at the discount store. As we exited the car, we were encountered by men with leafblowers blowing garbage out of the lot, and large street sweepers floating across the spaces, which frightened me at first, but managed to keep my head remembering the potential of this drug. Our entrance was amazing, the lights and aisles and cash registers all glistened and morphed beyond the most vivid movie depictions of LSD trips. As we moved throughout the store, I was very disturbed at the people we viewed. Many of their faces scared me and I questioned the moral stability of these people. I even recall a small demon girl running down the cereal aisle, her face was disasterous, it made me naucious to look at her disgusting expressions and horrible body shape.

We began a deep conversation about LSD and movies we thought were influenced by it, and we had wondered if Fight Club was at all involved so we decided to look for it. Strangely enough, after searching the large section of DVD's, and not finding our movie, we began to walk away from the area where we saw a small stand of mixed DVD's where the bright pink soap bar held by Brad Pitt on the cover of the movie stood out to me. We quickly snatched the last copy on this stand and made our way to the registers. Checking out was a complete disaster. I could hardly keep my composure as the old woman took our money and her face melted and her smile raged with her crooked yellow, monsterous teeth.

The third hour to the 5th hour is where it all began to go wrong for Matt, but was the most intense part of my entire evening, and most visual. We started the trek back to Matt's house about 25 minutes from the discount store. The drive was difficult and intense. The road would not maintain shape or perception, it altered constantly from being wide and short to long and narrow. The surrounding trees grew taller with the long narrow roads, and fat and colorful with the wide short ones. Stop signs changed there consistent shape, passing cars reminded me only of the cars in the animated classic Roger the Rabbit movie with their flowing shapes and inflatable appearance. We arrived at Matt's house where I could hardly park my car reasonably.

We made our way to the front door where we quickly realized that the door had been locked, and he was without his key. Now, this situation was sticky because his mother was sleeping and we wanted not to wake her and have her find us tripping out of our minds. We couldn't report to my house because my mother was already up, and I did not want to face her either, so we decided to sit at a diner and enjoy the trip. We made the drive to a local diner and as we arrived I had noticed that Matt had began to act strangely and had been talking about recent rough times he had been going through and was very upset about the situation he had been in, but I convinced him that everything would be fine and we made our way into the diner.

This place was really strange. The patterns, and shapes were plentiful and had made for quite a visually fantastic spectical.  The workers, and the owner which we had known from the many times we had visited before, had looked like complete circus animals. Their smiles widened and intensified with every movement, and made me uncomfortable. I kept convincing myself of the drugs powerful stimulation and that I could handle this powerful batch of acid. Even though I wasn't hungry, nor was Matt, we ordered mozarella sticks and water. The water tasted like straight pool chemicals, and made me sick to my stomach. I tried my hardest to keep the sick feeling out of my mind, but it persisted for many minutes. I calmed the feeling with a few bites of the mozarella sticks, but then shortly after realized that the cheesy sticks had been another bad decision. I felt even more sick now than ever, and it took my every inch of strength to hold back a sickening display in front of the employees. Matt had been answering most of my questions with other questions and seemed very distant from my focus but I paid no mind until these next events.

Matt and I had been talking quietly about acid at the diner as to not make it public that we were completely out of our heads. We both agreed that the two young female employees seemed very strange and they disturbed us both. When Matt suggested very loudly that we give them some acid to help this situation, I decided it was time to move on. As we attempted to leave, the display continued when Matt tried to pay our bill with his new Digital Camera. When the waitress refused this seemingly great offer, he quickly produced some money which the horse-faced monster accepted and let us go. The walk to the car is when I realized that something had gone astray with my best friend. He removed the camera from his pocket and clenched it in his little skinny fingers, or wait, are they fat and chubby?? Anyways, he raised the camera high in the air, and quickly thrust it towards the ground where it skid many feet. He added to the display by trowing his cigarettes and lighter away into the parking lot. I quickly ran to the camera and shouted 'What did you do, that was your camera.' He just looked at me and shrugged his shoulders with his hands out with a large smirk. His scruffy face annoyed me, and I knew that something was not right now.

Even though I tried to convince him he would be mad about this action in the parking lot, he didn't give a shit and we made our way to the car. Since we could still not goto either of our houses, and had no safe haven to play this trip out, we began our next leg of this trip in my car. We spent the next several hours driving in my car where I had discovered that Matt had been developing a 'Bad Trip'. He quickly became very confused and disoriented with himself. He was unable to keep a constant thought, and was very annoying to me. He would ask several questions to me, completely out of the blue with no real meaning or good answer. I can still remember the most amusing phrase of the evening which spewed out of his mouth more than a dozen times in that ride 'Am I alive, am I dead - or is this backwards?' I didn't know what this comment meant, or how to respond so I calmly tried to talk him out of his bad experience, where I think my words just played worse into the madness in his head. I had many thoughts that we had taken too much, or the doses were contaminated, or that we would be stuck in the trip forever.

After a while of driving, I could not sit in the car any longer with this madness, so I quickly started thinking of solutions that would help me, but none of them were logical, including the one were I drop him off at his house and leave him for his mother to deal with, which seemed the most amusing to me at the time. As I continued our drive around town, circling many of the same streets over and over again, Matt seemed to be coming out of his head trip and I began to realize that he was becoming coherent again. We decided to make our way back to his house where we could end the day by sitting in his basement. His mother was still sleeping but after ringing the doorbell, she quickly arose to let us in. She had discovered something in her son's face that made her believe we were in some sort of trouble and asked us many questions when we arrived that made me severely paranoid. We made our way to the basement finally where I put Fight Club and began to watch with my friend.

Matt turned to me several times asking what was going on, and repeated the previous funny phrase of 'Am I alive, dead, or backwards?' I had found that he was still in this bad trip partially and it took me many minutes to coerse him out of his dying head trip. He was still pretty out of it when his mother announced that she wanted to use the treadmill in the basement. So I decided to remove him from this potentially disasterous situation with a breakfast invitation that he quickly took and followed me to his front door.

When we reached the car he had snapped out of it completely when he saw his camera. Yeah it was bad. He attempted to turn it on and it just squeeled in agony from the broken components trying to move. We drove around a bit longer where for me the visuals were still very exotic and colorful. We discussed the previous nights events and both agreed to make our way back home for some sleep and food. I spent the next several hours awake around my house where I was still having very vivid hallucinations and a hard time getting the motivation to sleep. I finally slept around 4pm and made it out until about 9pm. 

I could only think as I wrote this experience out, of how absolutely amazing the trip was, and how I had really been blown away with how powerful and long lasting the doses were. I don't know where this batch came from, or even how much we took but I do know that if you find a crazy mother fucker named Fabrenzio walking around with some crazy acid - give him my email :-)

P.S. - We discovered the next day we ate approx a third of the 20 hit strip (we're assuming) and we had surprisingly put about 125 miles on my car in just driving around the city after the diner. Crazzzzzzzzy

'Just too pure and undistorted, just too pure for one to sweatily hastily punch into a computer.'

LSD.  The word intimidates some and draws curiosity from others.  I myself was intensely curious of this psychedelic drug, after being an avid salvia and weed user for months following my first trip.

I scored a single hit from a shady friend of mine outside of a public library.  He was tripping off the same batch as he sold it to me, and declared it to be of excellent quality.  He showed me some drawings and writings he must have made while he was in the library.  I was very, very interested.  This had gone through probably 4 hands since manufacturing, so I was forced to pay a premium of $15/hit.  I learned later that this $15 was a small price to pay for such an amazing experience.

A week or so passed before I was in a situation where I could use it.  Some of my stoner friends were sleeping over at one of their houses and wanted me to come.  I think they expected me to bring more acid, but I could not.  I ended up being the only one there tripping.  By the end of the night, 8 or 9 people had showed up, including two girls, whom I ended up befriending greatly.

~8:45
I ingest the single blotter square.  Red, 1/8' square, nothing special.  It tasted like paper.  I swallowed it after 10 minutes of playing with it in my mouth.  I went upstairs for about 30 minutes and watched TV.  I felt nothing and was anxious to get started.

~9:15
I venture back to the basement.  By now, I am feeling giddy and energetic.  I started to use the computer but quickly became bored.  The giddiness was starting to become very noticeable and I told everyone I was feeling threshold effects.  The girls came over at around this time.

~9:35
'The Baron,' we call him, picks up interest in my condition.  Mild hallucinations were starting to develop, when I told him this, he decided to try a fun activity.  We stood around a pool table and started throwing pool balls around.  This was a very cool sight.  The balls were making translucent trails behind them and seemed to be on fire.  I grabbed the yellow ball tightly.  I felt I was able to squeeze it like a stress ball and was able to convince myself that I could actually do so.  Something compelled me to hold it for a very long time.

~9:50
I get back on the computer.  The girls were very interested in my Windows Paint abilities, having seen drawings I made on salvia.  I drew a TV remote crashing into the earth and stared at it for a long time.  I am having an intense rush of energy.  I have consumed more caffeine than anyone I know, but the only time I remember feeling this kind of rush was when I snorted Adderol about a year ago.  I somehow acquired a pool table triangle and had it around my neck.  I was mentally unable to remove it, it stayed on for a good portion of the night and was the inspiration for several more drawings.  The Baron found an extremely fun device: a scooter that is propelled by its steering wheel.  I was gliding around the basement on it, probably the happiest person on earth at the time.

~10:20
The first hallucination I can remember was watching my friends prepare a Salvia quid.  I was staring at the fractallizing corian countertop, watching them dexterously seperate leaves and stems with massive, massive hands.  By now, almost everyone is very, very high on marijuana.  I didn't smoke any, feeling perfectly good myself.  I felt different but in a very fine way.  D and T ask me to join them with a cigarette.  I step outside into a beautiful night.  We are huddled in a chilly hole leading to J's basement.  I stare at the wall, it opened up and let me look inside of it as it told me a story.

'To some point,' he says, 'you can be worried about everything.  The world, it's metabolism, yourself, all those around you.  The universe can stretch before like some unknown, worry-inducing thing.  Nut then, the cigarette smoke tells me, it will all be okay.'

'This computer.  This computer is so amazing.  The colors and heartbeat and breath that are spwering, spewing out of the monitor.'

This is when the classic hallucinations started kicking into high gear: fractals, breathing walls, melting ceilings, giant hands and feet, morping, new, bright colors.  A lot of what happened is a blur because none of it makes sense now.  Everyone, including me, was having a hilarious, social time.  I stayed up late with a lot of people, but being so high and full of munchies, they became annoyingly lazy and incoherent.  I was offered salvia and weed but refused both.  This was one uncomfortable part of my trip: the ampetamine-like rush was starting to get to me, I hyperventilated a little bit and felt like my lungs were the size of ping pong balls.  It was important for me, however, to experience both the highs and the lows, the fears and the ecstacy.

Around 1, I went outside to have a cigarette by myself.  This was definitely the high point of my trip.  The sky was moonlit, patched with clouds and trees.  The clouds glowed with colors that I had never seen before.  The trees towered over me with mind-squishing dimensions.  Everything around me grew, rooted itself into the earth, shined with auras that warmed the soul.  My mind was racing with thoughts beyond notes, drawings or any part of the English language.  From the side, I watched myself back up against the wall and close my eyes.  The universe had been packed into my brain.
I came back and scribbled into Notepad:

'That last cigarette out there. Man, if words could only come close.  Windows paint can't really come close either.'

no video or optical illusion could possibly come close to the beauty eminating from the forest out there.  And I am just a small, infinitely small, observer.  Nothing, I remember to myself, will ever, ever come close to this kind of knowledge.  The information imparted onto me just then, out there, enjoying a cigarette, will be ultimately lost in translation.

By 2 AM, everyone was completely out.  I sat on the floor, awake and alone.  I probably shouldn't have been afraid to hit up the bong before, but now I felt it was too late.  I was WIDE AWAKE.

3 AM, still wide awake...
4 AM, 5:30... awake the whole time.

I entertained myself by staring at multi-dimensional fractals by placing my eyes about a centimeter away from the floor.  My body was exhausted, especially towards the end of the night.  A couple times, I ventured upstairs looking for alcohol.  I felt that alcohol would have been a perfect antidote to calm my nerves and let me sleep.  I was hungry for sleep.  I desired it more than anything.

'And this LEVEL, this totally third level of thinking.....'

7:30 AM.  The hallucinations slowed to a stop.  I had not gotten a wink of sleep, though I felt mildly refreshed when the sun rose.  J got up too and kept me company as we talked about the night, used the computer and relaxed.  I drove out for some McDonalds with most of the guys.  Though I hadn't eaten in over 18 hours, I still couldn't finish the meal.  I got home and still could not sleep immediately.  I was awake for most of the day, probably because I was excited about the whole experience.  I had mild HPPD in the following days.  Nothing serious, just small reminders that said, 'Hey, don't forget, you did LSD not too long ago.'

We were four explorers. Each one of us had a different responsibility. One held the beat, the other thudded along, the other soothed the soul, and then there was me. We were in a band, at this time. The four of us played little gigs here and there. We just enjoyed the music and didn't fantasize about making it big. We lived in a nice, hip little community and people were all very nice and happy there.

We usually didn't play while we were tripping. The lights, the crowd, the energy, it could lead to a pretty bad trip or a pretty bad show. But that October night we decided to drop 4 tabs each. Now, these tabs were quite strong. 2 hits was quite sufficient for a fun little foray into uncharted territory. So, 4 hits was a pretty heavy dose.

About 30 minutes after we dropped those polka dotted doses, the show began. We started with some blues covers while we waited. Into the second song we could feel it working its magic.

Now let me just explain, the people who come to see our shows are usually partaking in the psychedelic fun. Whether they were smokin pot, or trippin balls, these weren't square crowds we were playing for. So when we started acting strange and when we started saying some really bizarre shit in between songs, they were pretty large as to what we were on. After a couple more songs we were flying. This part gets kinda fuzzy, as it's been awhile, but I will relate as much as I can.

The stage went off into orbit. The music was the force that propelled it through the cosmos. We landed on Pluto to regale the ice people with the strangest music ever and then we went to other planets I've never seen before. All the while the music had the momentum of a comet. When I would look at the amplifiers they would ooze and green jelly poured from them. My guitar seemed like it was an extension of my being. The music took on angelic and demonic aspects at the exact same time. Sometimes we would be floating past the beautiful planet of Venus and other times we'd be standing on the sun itself! Letting the flames torment every fiber of our being.

Then there was nothing. No stars, no earth, the guitar and drums were gone. My body had crumbled into asteroids and smashed into the moon. There was nothing. And from this nothing came the most beautiful sound I could have ever imagined. It sounded as though god was speaking. And all this nothingness quaked and evaporated, and there was life! The music WAS life. Everything that is and was was right there! In the air. All my fear and love and hate and joy, it was all right there in the air. We were all cosmically linked into the same vibe and we were all playing as one. No...the music was playing us. Ecstasy and joy on every level. Life was everywhere and in everything!

That night was truly amazing. To be able to control your own trip so much like that and to know that you're controlling others' is truly a mind blowing experience. I felt so alive and whole that night. It was without a doubt the most magical night of my life.

There's a lot of buildup here before I get to the actual trip report, and for one very good reason: when I finally tried LSD, my experience carried the weight of ten years of expectations. Because I am absolutely certain that this long-term, positive way of thinking about acid influenced my eventual experiences with the drug to a profound degree, I feel that I should go into some detail.

A few months ago, I told a friend of mine that I had wanted to try acid since I was ten years old. She laughed and said that I reminded her of Marla in 'Fight Club,' who says at one point says, 'I haven't been fucked like that since grade school!' It's easy to see how, in this society, one would be as shocking as the other. I have, in fact, been fascinated by LSD ever since (oh, and I know it sounds cliched) fifth grade, when I discovered the Beatles. I was never around drugs of any kind, except for alcohol as a child; and don't take my interest at the age of ten to mean that I actually tried it then.

Once I hit my mid-teens and drug experimentation became a real possibility, I tried to find acid, but couldn't--it is very difficult to obtain in my area, especially without a network of certain kinds of connections. So, long story short, by the time I was twenty-one, I had long since taken up smoking cigarettes, used marijuana on a fairly regular basis, had discovered and waved good-bye to alcohol, and experimented with ecstasy and cocaine--but I had yet to try that one substance whose reputation originally interested me in this whole drug thing.

Pot was a great way to relax or kill a lazy afternoon; alcohol was, on the whole, not worth the next day; e was loads of fun but not something I would want to do on anything approaching a regular basis; coke was one hell of a high--but something was missing. I had, in all honesty, expected more. Drugs, I had found, were mostly good fun but lacked the one quality that had sparked a ten-year-old's imagination. I didn't want a mood-enhancer or just a way to get really fucked up. I wanted the world around me to change for just a few hours. I had tried mushrooms, but they were weak and the trip was, well, barely a trip at all. Bright colors and soft, friendly towels and the feeling of being incredibly stoned were all well and good--but I wanted to SEE things.

And finally, eleven years after the dawn of my curiosity, I got some acid. 

I'm here to write about my third LSD experience, specifically, because it was by far the most intense trip I've had. The first time I tried it was spectacular, and three other friends were there experiencing it with me--I got some definite visuals, but that trip was still mostly mental, like the mushrooms to the tenth degree. My second trip was only on one hit, and was not very intense at all; mostly it kept me awake, and very aware of and interested in my surroudings.

But the third time...

This was not a planned trip, but it couldn't have worked out better if it had been. I'd had two hits of LSD bumming around in my freezer for 'whenever' for a while, and it was only at about 12:15 on the night in question that it even occurred to me to do them. I had some friends over, and we were sitting around, doing nothing, smoking some pot, when it occurred to me that I didn't have to work the next day--so hey, why not? At 12:30 I took my two remaining hits, quit smoking pot for the night because I figured anything I smoked would be good pot wasted on someone who wouldn't notice it, and sat back. No one else was tripping with me.

The effects began within about half an hour--I was giggly and high-feeling. We were watching 'Team America,' and I was laughing myself to tears. Within an hour of taking the acid, I was beginning to trip. The signs of an oncoming trip were by now familiar to me--a vague purplish tint to everything, shadows that grew, moved, breathed, and generally crept about in ways that shadows shouldn't. It was time, my roommate Kate decided, for a run to get a sandwich (for her) and cigarettes (for me). My hallucinations were quickly becoming much more intense than anything I'd ever experienced; putting on makeup before going out became a 30-minute adventure I'm not even going to bother trying to describe. When we finally made it to the convenience store (let's not give out names here), I was beginning to peak--and this peak lasted hours. 

I highly recommend a bright, busy, neon-lit convenience store at 1:45 am to anyone who is tripping for not-the-first-time and who is with a responsible babysitter. I had to be careful and not make remarks on what I was seeing for anyone to hear--no one likes it when people on drugs cause scenes in public. On the way in, I told K, 'As your attorney, I advise you not to let me say a fucking word in here.' Then we giggled about that for a while, but I'm pretty sure that's as druggy as either of us acted. I say 'either of us' because, in my experience, people 'babysitting' people on drugs often act far shadier than the person who's ON drugs. Not so in K's case. It was AMAZING inside--the colors were insanely bright, the neon looked beautiful, the floor was crawling and alive. The touch-screen were K ordered her sub was probably the most fascinating thing I've ever encountered on a trip. The screen was moving; the words were wavy, crazy and all-over-the-place. I was seeing different fonts. I was seeing pictures in place of words. I was seeing the LCD screen in 3-D. 

We made it out of there without actually causing any kind of disturbance at all; at most we were being loud and giggly, but I held it together and didn't let the ~really~ hysterical laugher set in till we were back in the car. Then we went for something of a country drive, stopping briefly back at the apartment to pick up one of the friends we had left there during the sandwich run, because he wanted to be on this drive. Hey, who can blame him? So I was driven around for about an hour on a beautiful summer night--we drove down by the creek and smelled the summer air.

I was tripping so hard at this point that it's very difficult to maintain a coherent narrative. I remember the music we were listening to--first Make Believe (the band, not Weezer's latest disappointment), then some 80's mix which gloriously featured both 'Come on Eileen' and 'Enjoy the Silence'; and finally--flawlessly--Crystal Method. Perfect. It was one hell of a drive, and I can remember pretty much every specific--but nothing ties them together, so I can't maintain a readable narrative if I go into them.

When we got back to the apartment, I was still peaking. I sat around and watched K play Prince of Persia, which was amazingly interesting. This is one of the rare video games that's actually interesting to watch when you're not playing even when you are NOT on a hallucinogenic drug. Being on a hallucinogenic drug, I happily watched K play for several hours. The screen grew and shrank, got more and less purple, and I had difficulty seeing that the colored shapes moving about were anything but colored shapes.

There was one very interesting moment of note. I briefly went in to my bedroom to change my away message online. In typing my new one, 'tripping in 7-11 the shelves were stretching out of control' (note: that's a Nada Surf lyric; the store we were in that night was not a 7-11), I had a definite weird, weird, weird moment. I wasn't typing so well because my hands were shaking somewhat and I wasn't, for obvious reasons, seeing the screen too well, or to rephrase--I was seeing the screen VERY well, thank you, but not entirely, well, correctly.

The most difficult part for me to type was '7-11'; finding the numbers and the dash was not easy, and required a lot of concentration. So BECAUSE they required so much concentration, I distincly remembered typing them--or did I? When I looked up to read my message to check it for typos (yes, even in that state), what I saw was, 'tripping the shelves were stretching out of control.' To be sure of what was there, I had my roommate read it out loud to me. Yup. I had been concentrating so hard on getting those numbers and that dash right that I had--you guessed it--only done it in my head. But I'd thought that I'd really done it. And that tiny moment, the confabulation of having typed that simple little phrase, innocuous as it may seem, is the only time I've ever actually become disconnected from reality when under the influence of any drug.

When I realized what had happened I was amazed and elated. Now THAT was a trip--an actual voyage to the inside of my own head, while in a waking state. By the time K put away the PS2 and our guests filed out the door, I was coming down a little bit--by which I mean that shapes were no longer crawling out of the walls and furniture and I was probably even able to type without having a minor psycho mind blip occur. 

So she went to bed and I (of course!) stayed up, watching movies, then playing Prince of Persia myself when I had come down enough to control a videogame, then watching another movie--'Kinsey'--as the sun came up. I'm not sure exactly when I stopped tripping; my best estimate is between 10 and 11 am, though for the whole day after that I was still feeling kind of spacy. As for how much of that was drug and how much was lack of sleep, your guess is as good as mine. I did get some very interesting visuals IN my head that night as I was finally drifing off, though, so I think the drug probably had some definite lingering effects.

I'm still in the afterglow of that trip--those few days following a really great, intense experience. I feel like I've seen things in a way that's, well, wholly new. I also, having come down from the trip, have a great appreciation for the way things ARE normally. Tripping is a great experience, but by the twelfth hour it gets wearing. The next day, and the day after, and the day after that, it's still a little comforting to look at an LCD touch screen and SEE an LCD touch screen, the way you know it really is; to be able to look in the mirror without your face stretching adn melting and morphing around itself; to put on makeup without feeling like you're in danger of rubbing your nose away; to buy a pack of cigarettes and not really notice all that garish neon. 

I don't, and have never, bought into any mystical theories about drugs. I don't think that acid helped me to 'see God' or become enlightened, or anything like that. I do think that acid was a tool that helped me to get back a little bit of childlike wonder. It's enough, after a trip, for everyday things to be everyday things. And at the same time it's comforting to look at them and remember what they were like when they were NOT everyday things.

There are very few experiences in life that can withstand eleven years of buildup without being even somewhat of a letdown. LSD, I am relieved and very happy to report, is one of those things. I doubt I've seen the last of it.

It was late October, 2005. I had been tripping on acid a couple of times before, first in early 2005 and the second time shortly after midsummer. They had been pretty intense trips both, first was very visual with a short panic attack-experience because of big dosage (7 drops of liquid LSD) and the second was more mental with just 1 drop and spent outside in nature with profound perceptions about nature and myself and the involvement of fractal geometry present in everything around us.

This time I wanted to experience it all by myself with no friends around so that I could concentrate on the experience by 100% and have nothing to do with others disturbing my trip. I had got myself a good-sized piece of blotter acid a couple of weeks before I thought I was going to trip. I took the weekend free of work so I had the time to come down properly and clear my head off the possible weird thoughts and paranoia there would come and had bought myself some potato chips and candies to eat during the night if I felt hungry and an energy drink to drink if I started to feel too tired.

So, then late on the friday-evening I took the blotter from my fridge and put it first under my tongue and then after about 15 minutes, chewed it up and swallowed the rest of it. Mum was in her study and asked me to come there because she wanted to show me some beautiful picture of a cat-eye shape nebulae which was very amazing in the way how it actually looked like a cat's eye. We chatted something with her and I went back to my room and sat in front of my computer and listened to some music, goa-trance from mid 90's. I had decided to give a good listen to my favourite recordings when I was tripping. I drank a couple of beers when waiting for the onset.

About 1 hour later the acid started to kick in. I felt a warm feeling rise through my body, it started from my feet and rose up very quickly and stopped right in the middle of my chest. I looked around myself and saw that everything was a little brighter than usual, like the colour contrast would be more intense. This was similar to the earlier trips, but in a different setting, which was my room. The only difference I noticed was that I felt the alcohol's effects covering my flow of thought which was the major difference when compared to the earlier trips.

Every object started to leave patterns behind them when I looked around, but they didn't take any significant shape and were just stay-after images in the vision field. I just noticed that they would stay there longer than usual. About 1 hour later the alcohol effects wore off and my mind started to work again. I put in a goa-trance cd I enjoyed very much and went to lie down on my bed. It was one of my favourite cd's, Pleiadians - IFO to be exact and I had some good time listening to it and letting it drill my consciousness into the songs so deep that they almost became touchable. After about 2-3 songs I realized the acid had started to work and I felt really good of listening to the music and just analyzing every layer and shapes of sounds and the way they formed a good, working whole, many different wholes to be exact that made the song work just the way it should be working, giving good visual stimulation to imagination in the form of caleidoscopic shapes and some archetypal forms.

2-3 hours had passed since the digestion of the blotter piece and I felt a bit unsure about myself and started to meditate on everyday problems that came up to my mind. I light up my favourite incence and a candle and set it on the floor of my room and just sat down and started to think and I found a solution to everything I had a bad feeling about at that point and had no fear anymore and just thought that everything will go as it will go.

I had put in another recording, which was Psychopod's Dreampod and noticed that the candle fire drew funny shapes to the floor behind it which then started to take more arranging form. I stared there for a while and then again concentrated on listening to the song. The complexity of the sounds and patterns in the song gave me fantastic feeling of euphoria, as I understood that this is what psychedelic trance to me is all about, the soundscapes changing fluently and fast enough with a certain amount of strict control so that everything sounds carefully planned and very mathematically arranged.

Some hours passed and I started to feel a bit tired and went downstairs and took the energy drink from the fridge (a bottle of half litres) and drank it almost instantly. I felt my heart beat a lot faster and started to feel mentally very aware of everything. The effects of the energy drink were very clear and I felt very good afterwards. The time was about 03:30 and I definitely felt the effects of LSD since everything I looked at gave me information about itself.

I went to the other room to see our rabbit which was there in its cage and he seemed to notice that I wasn't quite sober. He had been very shy before, even though I have had him for over 6 years but now when I opened his cage he jumped out of the it and came looking & sniffing me like I was somebody totally new. It seemed perfectly clear that animals have feelings and are very sensitive, and just like us humans, they think as well, not on the abstract level but they have a consciousness which isn't so open than ours and thinks more on a survival level and isn't able to invent complex inventions.

I don't know how long I spent just observing the little one, since I was almost completely enraptured by this living being. Some hallucinations occured the same time, like feathers everywhere, with a caressing feeling and a bit of euphoria. They were caressing me and the rabbit, like we were best of friends. Suddenly I just snapped out of it and gave him something to eat and went back to my room. I started to feel tired again and went to bed, and put on Shpongle - Nothing Lasts.

Time started to slow down into really small fractions and I felt my body relax from bit by bit and the music started to feel more and more intense from my headphones when suddenly I was in a total visual world caused by it, went through different places of fractal shapes and every sound and detail in the song gave me visual stimulation so that it was like a guided dream. And what a beautiful dream it was. Suddenly my consciousness woke up and I opened my eyes and my room was still there and there were no hallucinations except that everything was bending and stretching from direction to another.

Then I closed my eyes and the recording took me to a place where there were lots of people watching a show where some guy was breathing fire. It was fantastic since it happened because of the music which was so profoundly done and detailed that the songs completely came alive in a visual sense. As the cd evolved, my consciousness started to fall asleep further and further and the last time I looked the time it was about 09:30. I was still conscious when the cd ended but fell asleep very quickly after that. I slept about 4 hours and woke up feeling very fresh and both mentally & physically good, with a very positive attitude towards the day. All and all, this was my best psychedelic trip so far, besides LSD I have had a few with mushrooms but this was something completely different from them. But that's another story. :)

SUMMARY--

You can call me Delysid.  I am in my early twenties.  Up until the experience which I'm about to divulge, I was, in my own opinion, fairly inexperienced with drugs of any sort.  Of course, like most Americans, I had consumed large amounts of caffine over my lifetime.  I had smoked pot in high school, but due to the group I smoked with, never got much enjoyment out of it.  I had consumed alcohol in small amounts up until just months before the experience when I started drinking heavily habitually, but still not quite to the extreme of alcoholism.  I had always had an interest in 'drugs'.  Even as a child I used to love reading in first aid books and encyclopedias about the effects of all types of substances, illicit or not.  But it was the weeks I finally read the cult science fiction calssic 'The Illuminatus! Trilogy' that I first considered trying psychedelics.

My thoughts mostly focused toward acid, although I had heard some interesting stories of mescaline, a substance I still hope to explore.  I discussed it with the friend I knew to be most interested in the subject, who I shall refer to as 'Entheogen'.  She and I agreed that since we were both so interested in LSD we might as well just try it and get it over with.  Actually, we were MUCH more excited than I make it sound.  In the subsequent weeks we used her contacts to get ahold of a few hits, and then finding a time to actually do it.  During this time, I almost chickened out, but thanks to Entheogen I followed through on what would be one of the most amazing experiences of my entire life.

We had four hits, one for each of us that day, and two which Entheogen and our friend 'Leary' would take the next weekend.  And so, at 9AM, we put the tiny squares of paper on our tongues and prepared ourselves for the best day of our respective lives.  For a while nothing happened, and like anyone inexperienced with psychedelics, we worried nothing would EVER happen.  In a little over an hour however, as music played in the background, we both, almost simultaneously, began to feel an incredible rush of euphoria and expectation.

I have to confess, I was in literal awe.  I had never up until this point been so blown away by the purity of a feeling.  The joy my religious upbringing had promised and failed to supply was being poured out by the barrelfull.  And the feeling of expectation was almost unbareable, however our attitudes didn't match this.  We didn't care if nothing else happened because the euphoria was far beyond what we'd been experienced with.

Along with this euphoria and expectation, was the amazing change in the sound of any and all music.  Music was celestail, the music of gods.  In fact for weeks after I mounred the loss of those angelic ears, to hear what I still consider the true nature of music.  But all this was only a small part of what occured that day.  During the first hour, while still in a fully euphoric state, I experienced my first, shall we say, 'Acid Epiphany'.  The music we were listening to was happy and upbeat and, feeling the music as I did, I realized how numb we become to the power of music.  I dable myself and I enjoy nearly any type of music.  But seeing how commonplace music ISN'T made me wonder why we take it for granted so much.

Entheogen is very interested in the video and flash work that Larry Carlson does.  So inevitably, we ended up watching one of his long works.  I must be quite candid and say that she had shown me his stuff before, and the sad truth is, it quite literally creeped me out to no end.  I found it interesting, but also very unnerving on a kind of subconcious level.  I was nervous about watching any of his stuff, because I feared it would turn into one of those bad trips.  But oddly enough, it was simply facinating to me.  This brought about Acid Epiphany #2.  It was a great counterpoint to Epiphany #1: We don't always have to be effected by things.  It's somtimes good to hold your head above water and just look down calmly.  I must note here that I constantly think in contradictions anyway.  I believe, to quote F. Scott Fitzgerald 'The test of a first-rate intelligence is the abilty to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.'.

I of course shared these first two Epihpanies with Entheogen.  I kept #3 to myself... and I'm not entirely sure it should be called an Epiphany, but I guess it depends on your point of view.  At some point in the early stages, I looked at Entheogen and just wanted her sexually.  There are many personal reasons that this is complicated, but I won't go into them.  Suffice it to say that it was not an option, nor did I entirely want it to be.

This lead to a questioning of sexuality in general and an essential, and quite overwhelming distaste for what I saw as a 'mascualine predatory sexual mode' in which my body wanted to do something no matter the consequences.  It felt animal and not human, hormonal rather than reasoned or even emotional to be more precice.  I went mentally into an intense psychological and philisophical thought process of just what it means to be a reasoning animal.  I felt intense shame.  I decided to get some fresh air.  I told Entheogen I'd be back.  She asked if I was okay.  I told her I was fine and I'd tell her if it was going bad at any point. 

When I went outside, the light, the colors of the world were beyond anything I'd ever seen.  I took it in with utter joy.  I could NOT experience this alone and could NOT let Entheogen miss this.  I ran in to get her.

When we got outside, she was not quite as impresed.  I imagine I was having a slightly more visual experience than she.  But she wanted to go for a walk.  I of course, being the more nervous of the two of us, was worried about this concept.  But being so joyous at my new eyes, I had to oblige.  I said we should go to the end of my neighborhood and back.  I put my hand on my cheek as we walked and it seemed that I could feel EVERYTHING about my cheek.  On the way back, we passed a bush with purple flowers.  She picked one for each of us.  I twirled mine between my fingers until we got back to the house.  But a feeling was growing as I twirled it and finally in front of the house I pinpointed the nature of it.  I could sware I felt the life of the thing.  It felt like an insect squirming between my fingers.  I had to drop it.

Back home, we tried to call some friends.  We weren't able to get ahold of anyone.  Finally, I was convinced to go for another walk.  I wanted to set a boundry again, but Entheogen said:

'Let's just walk until we feel like stoping.'

I had the desire to explore the universe, so I fianlly let go my inhibitions and agreed.  Our first stop along the way was at the nearby let's call it a 'low-price superstore', the kind of place where you can get groceries, clothing, household supplies, small electronics, or even get your car serivced in minor ways.  Anyhow, the second most humorous part of the whole day was as we were walking up and I was looking at a family standing outside. I am never normally one to think this, but their baby was UGLY.  When we got inside, I told Entheogen and of course we spent a rediculous amount of time just inside the side entrance laughing hesterically.

We each made our way then to our respective restrooms.  The men's of course, had no line, while there was a long one in the women's.  I had to wait by the restrooms for Entheogen.  I heard a lot of random noises coming from inside and even at one point got so nervous as to call her cell phone.  She was fine of course.

As I waited and watched the throngs of customers, I realized something about my sight.  I remembered seeing like this before, or at least thought I did.  I felt, and of course will never be able to confirm, that I had been given the eyes of my childhood back, seeing everything clearly and with wonder.  But I was more perceptive of the people.  I saw sadness in people that broke my heart.  One woman in particular, gaunt and pale, and the man she was with just had the look of a complete jerk.

When she got out we spent time exploring the store.  We finally got a call back from our friend 'Lavinia' when leaving, but we weren't really able to talk very well at this point.  We had a much easier time understanding each other than making others understand us.  It should be noted that while my visual experience was possibly more pronounced, I did not seem as effected in the area of speach.  I spoke with a bit more clarity than Entheogen throughout.  We went on to visit our friend Leary at his place of employment, a fast food joint.  Here Entheogen wished we had a floating camera to follow us and chronicle the day.  But she also explained that she felt like a camera herself, and I understood her to mean that she seemed to be taking the world in like one, an observer recording the universe.  I've seen this sentiment in other experience reports actually.

When we left, we walked by a small bank of sand left by a construction crew and pretended, for just a moment to be at the beach.  This is lighthearted play, and I point it out beacuse it must be said that it is not a typical activity that I engage in.  I have fun, but in my own weird ways.  But I was able to just play like a child.  It felt beautiful.  We were then headed back home.  We sat for a while on a sidealk, facing a dead end street.  A man far at the end was walking toward us.  I have never come to realize so strongly as I did in that moment, how much we disconect ourselves from other people.  I watched him walk all the way toward us and finally past us, and until he was close, he almost didn't seem real.  This made me mildly sad.  We drew a bit with chalk rocks on the concrete, and this made Entheogen want to get back and paint.  So we started back on the road.

As we walked, a bag blew by.  Entheogen is fond of the movie American Beauty, and if you don't know, the is something in it about a plastic bag blowing in the wind being beautiful.  She saw the beauty in the plastic bag, but felt stupid saying it.  Once I had coxed her into explianing, I told her this:

'It's not stupid at all.  The general concesus of people who saw that movie thought that idea was great, so if they think you are stupid for actually seeing that beauty in REALITY, they they are hypocrites.'

We stoped again at a stone and metal fince.  Some one the metal greating was missing and we sat there on the stone looking at a very pretty man-made pond.  I had my final Epiphany of the day as we discussed my reasons for taking this trip.  I had previously told Entheogen that I was going to do this for what I'd consider spiritual reasons.  I grew up religious and had renounced pretty much anything even vaugely supernatural within this last few years.  But I professed to believe that the 'spiritual' and 'natural' were two sides of the same coin.

Now, as I was right around the end of my peak, I realized that this theory had to be right.  Exlpain it as god or call it the universe, do whatever you like.  Terms don't matter, we're all talking about the same thing.  I'm not saying everyone's right.  More like everyone's about the same amount wrong, so there is no reason to worry.  We will catch tinny little glimpses of whatever we are 'really' dealing with and that's all we need, even the biggest glimpse we'll get is ultimately tiny and that's okay.  Some of us will seek and others will be happy with what they have.  That's fine.  People, including me, will continue to argue and fight about what they believe to be true.  It's okay.  It's fine.  It's all alright.  This was of course, a very comforting revelation.  It's okay.  And I realized that this was the moment I'd searched for all my life.

We went and sat by the pond.  Now is the MOST humorous part of the day.  We sat for a while and suddenly and old man comes walking up.  I assume he's going to tell us we are on private property and we'd better go.  But no he informs Entheogen who's feet are in the water that there are aligators in this pond.  Entheogen believes he's joking.  He says no, there really are aligators in there.  I tell her after he walks away that we should go.  We pick up and leave.  My assumption is still that he was trying to get rid of us, but I think he was trying to be polite about it.  Still, to two people at the end of the peak of their first acid trip this was quite strange and quite funny.

One last funny moment was when we passed the flower bush again.  Entheogen was picking some to paint and I was telling her what I'd felt before.  She kept feeling them trying to feel it with no luck.  I saw man mowing his lawn.  I told her we should go.  She thought I was being dumb, then I uttered the line that would become a classic: '[Entheogen], we are sitting here FEELING FLOWERS!  It may not seem weird to you, but trust me, it's weird.'  From there on out it was mostly these funny typse of moments as I was coming down.

AFTER-EFFECTS--

While the day was quite amazing, I have to say that some of the after-effecs were somewhat difficult to deal with.  Once I was finally alone, I was a bit frightened of everything, just mildly, and, as is often the case I'm told, I could not sleep at all.  I was severely depressed the next day, which I am told is less typical, and have never read of in my studies, only one person I know claims to experience this after-effect, but I presume this was just my reaction to the 'normal' world after seeing things in such a beautiful light.  I have suffered from clinical depression, so this might be a factor.  (SIDE NOTE: I want it to be clear that I have not been on medication for that condition for a while and wasn't at any time near that of the trip.)

Although I'm not convinced they were true flashbacks, I consistently, for weeks afterward, could sware occasionally that I was seeing something in my peripheral vision and turned to find nothing there.  This became more common after the subsequent experiences I had with a dissociative called DXM, though they subsided after I stoped using anything for a while.  But those are stories I'll come back to tell later.

The night started off quite regularly. I had been riding in a beaten-up Mazda for several hours with my friend (let's call him Lex) trying to find the equipment to satisfy our plans for the day. The idea was: we'd have black lights galore, tons of rave toys to entertain ourselves with, ten hits of acid (naturally), and a few drug-driven movies to watch. 

Shortly after meeting up with our friend at a pre-concert tailgate party at around 6 PM, we acquired our first and most important item...the acid. Something described to us as 'Pink Elephant' by the local dealers. It came on blotter paper and sealed in a ziploc bag. We were promptly instructed to keep it out of the light. Whether this was for protection of the acid, as they asserted, or protection of themselves, we didn't argue. I stuffed the acid into my back pocket and proceeded to buy a beer from one of the vendors. After perusing the event for about thirty minutes, we decided to leave and make the journey back to Boulder (my home town). Along the way, we called a few friends who had also planned to trip that night, with mushrooms being their substance of choice, to get the blacklights and glowsticks. With that taken care of, it was just a quick drive to Blockbuster and we were prepared.

Back at the apartment, Lex and myself proceeded to entertain our drug-crazed guests as best we could. Fortunately, given their state of mind, they would have been content trying to make conversation with a stapler, so we didn't need to strain ourselves. We decided to eat our shares of the acid on the spot, being that our friends were already warming up to their oncoming experience. After a bit of an argument over the sparse contents of our nearly emptied stomachs, we elected to take 500mg Vitamin-C pills, two at a time for the next several hours. Lex being the acid veteran, he insisted the vitamins would make for a better trip. I had no choice but to agree. After all, why trip if you're not going to TRIP?!?

The hour of seven found me in a state of daze, turntables rotating furiously as I attempted to cope with the rising jitters that accompanied the dose. The music in my headphones sounded unusually clear, and seemed to reverberate throughout my head. My extremities were noticeably numb, and the only thing bigger than my apprehension was the dumbstruck grin on my face. I was nervous. Not twitchy as one might expect, but I had never indulged in this quantity before. So, needless to say, I was excited to see what lay ahead.

As my watch passed eight(T+01:00), the sun was descending and so was my ability to commit to rationality. I felt as though someone was tugging at a string that ran down through the top of my head, and that was all there was to keep me on two feet. My body was vaguely responsive to my commands, but all the while I felt as though there were energy waves moving through me, dictating my motions. Tired of spinning and curious to explore my now less-familiar apartment, I threw LTJ Bukem into the player and slunk away to my bedroom. 

As I had expected, the visuals were not wholly intense at this point, but I noticed that if I stared at certain objects for any length of time, they would bobble and shift slightly. I decided to stretch my tense muscles for a bit and attempt to meditate. After about ten minutes I deemed it a lost cause. I had been easily able to focus on previous mushroom trips, but my current state proved too energetic for me to remain calm.

After a few minutes spent in stark confusion, I resumed my activities in the living room. My friends were involved in a heated debate about how the smurfs should be politicians. Interesting, I thought, but hardly substantial. I loitered for a few minutes, unable to sit down, and then proceeded to aimlessly surf the internet for the next fourty minutes.

Just as I signed off, at about T+2:00, it hit. The torrential swirling replaced the overpowering glare of the computer screen with innumerable shades of iridescent colors that blew me back in the chair. I stared in awe as the bare wall shifted and shimmered, eventually turning to dust and fading from view. Excited and determined to experiment, I migrated to the bathroom, where I stared at my slightly shifting face until I was satisfied the reflection was, in fact, real. Next came the blacklit living room, where my fellow space cadets were occupied shooting nerf weapons at each other. 

Fighting through the chaos, I decided to play a video game. My unfortunate choice was 'Sega GT' on the XBOX. I played for a half-hour, and six wrecked Audis later, decided to give up anything involving coordination. I instead went outside into the mellow summer air for a smoke, and watched the fading sunlight disappear behind the grey-shaded mountains. This was definitely a high point in the trip, as the slightly rotating clouds and varying reddish and purple hues captivated me. Once the sun had set, I went back inside to be greeted by two cloaked figures toting glowsticks and LED hand lights.

The display was intriguing. The spiralling light sources left trails that appeared several feet long. Being an avid raver, and having never seen glowsticks present such charisma, I was left speechless. All I could do was stand and stare. The lights seemed to carry a certain emotional connotation that changed with the shades. This is a difficult feeling to relate but basically, I was 'feeling' colors. Yellow elevated my apprehension, blue calmed me, green gave me a sense of energy, red made me uneasy, and white blinded me, leaving light-blue dots imprinted in my vision.

Though the lights were interesting, I decided it would be best if Lex and myself went for an excursion. The clock passed ten before we were ready, and we left the apartment with assurances echoing from the peanut gallery that they wouldn't 'fuck up the place.' This gave little comfort, but we were too energetic to be held back. We donned the cloaks that formerly were worn by the light show duo, and ventured out into the wild. 

The scence in the parking lot was somewhat frightening. I wanted to talk to everyone, but knew that many wouldn't share my enthusiasm with hallucinogenics, and may end up reporting something to the authorities. This considered, we took the paved path that lead out to our local golf course. 

We were two acid-tripping imbeciles stumbling around a driving range at 10:30 PM, in cloaks, no less. I felt awkward but somehow open. The next two hours were spent quite constructively, with discussion involving everything from political policies to the stupidity of the act we were indulging in. What followed has stayed with me for quite awhile. Lex turned to me briefly, a look of ardent enthusiasm on his face and exclaimed, 'Dude, you know what's an awesome word? GLOOP!!! It's like glop and soup combined! Doesn't that sound awesome?!?'

Now if I had been high, this may have triggered more of a response, but all I could do was smirk. I was amused, certainly, but I also couldn't help but fear for the sanity of mankind. I eventually succumbed to giggling and after five minutes, our conversation rotated exclusively around our newly created word. This could only have been upstaged (which it was) by our crusade to find and capture the missing 'moon nuggets,' which to any normal person would have resembled golf balls.

So, at about 1:00 AM (T+06:00), our pockets loaded with thirty-nine total golf balls (yes, we counted them), we arrived back at the apartment. To our surprise, the mushroom children were huddled on the floor, clinging to a few oversized bean bag chairs, watching 'Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas.' Satisfied that our night had been a productive one thusfar, Lex and I joined in the ordeal and watched intently as the movie seemed to make less and less sense by the minute. By the time the movie ended, circa 2:20 AM, I could feel the acid beginning to wane in intensity. For the next several hours, we sat and watched the blinds covering the screen door, as we could discern rainbow-like patterns emerging from the cracks between them.

Time passed, and Lex proceeded to describe his surroundings. The black lights appeared to take the forms of shimmering purple skulls, as he described them, and he eventually began laughing at a vampire supposedly trapped inside an 'Ocean's 11' poster. I would have expected this to cause a bad trip, but he claimed to be far too happy to have complications. The darkness gradually relinquished its hold on us as the sunlight crept over the horizon. After smoking a few cigarettes and chatting about various subjects, being that we were the only ones left in the apartment, we decided to go to sleep, which proved more challenging a task than it sounded. Three hours after beginning the attempt, I finally dozed off.

The next day was a bit hazy, and contrasts were enhanced, but otherwise I felt great. For that matter, I felt as if I had been somehow enhanced spiritually by the experience. Whether it was the moon nugget hunt, or the magical exploding wall, I couldn't be sure. One thing, though, I WAS sure of. Next time, I'm trying it at a rave. Should be interesting.

I've done LSD several times over the course of the last year, I would estimate twelve times total (I had not used it prior to this period of time).  I'm in my early 20s.  I would say my experiences prior to this trip had been fairly typical.  I have a reliable supply of strong enough stuff, and I generally take two hits.  The most I have ever taken was four hits, though of course dosage varies.

This time was fairly typical.  The week ahead I had made plans to trip with my friend Casey, one of the two people I usually trip with.  We had tripped together the month prior and it was a lovely experience, especially the comedown which we had spent drinking coffee in a 24hr coffee shop and reading a local tabloid.  It was a nice sunny day and I was expecting another nice, pleasant trip.  We live in a suburb, but generally ride the bus into the city to trip, to enjoy the city atmosphere for a bit before retreating into a pleasant and relatively safe park near downtown, before riding the bus back into our suburb.  It can be a bit formulaic, but it's pleasant and generally how we do it.

So, we rode into the city and arrived around 2:30pm, and promptly dropped 2 hits each of a batch of acid we were both pretty familiar with, having tripped off of it before and knowing others who had.  Good middle of the road strengh cid, one tab would get you high but not as high as we felt like.  So, we dropped, and then walked around a bit.  About an hour and a half passed.  We were both tripping quite hard and sitting together in this little garden place we know about downtown, sort of tucked off from the hustle and bustle.  Suddenly, my cell starts ringing. Now, I normally just have my cell on because I like to have it as a clock, since I don't have a watch (actually, I obtained one the day after this).  Anyway, I'd forgot to turn the ring off.  So what the hell, I figured, and I answered.

I immediately recognized the voice of my girlfriend sobbing.  Her cat was dying.  Now, she's not really cool with me using drugs, and so I tend to keep it on the down low.  We sort of have a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy.  Now, keep in mind I was out of my skull on acid.  It was awful. I blurted out that my friend Casey was on acid and I was babysitting him, so I couldn't come see the cat one last time and be with her, though I normally would.  The conversation was sorta fucked up and I might have been incoherent, but she was crying and my cell gets bad reception, so she didn't catch on I was flying too... though at the time I was worried she had some inkling.

So, I did the natural thing, and grabbed my skull and cursed and felt awful and didn't know what to do (basically how I spend most of my free time actually).  After some deliberation, I decided (probably foolishly) that I was with it enough I could pass for sober, and my girl needed me.  So, my buddy and I got ourselves bussing back to the suburb. He came in case I bailed out, we wouldn't be split up.  I called her, etc, there was some standard acid confusion, bla bla bla, my buddy and I split up.  As a footnote, Casey spent the rest of his trip alone in our burb, and actually had a really pleasant trip apart from a bit of worrying about me.

I got to my girlfriend's house. I'd probably been tripping about 2.5 hours at this point, and was high. Peaking even.  I was feeling sad about the cat, worried about pulling off what I had to pull off. I'd never needed to pass for sober for a prolonged period of time before, and was gonna be with my girlfriend, her teenage brother, and her god fearing mom.  I had visuals, racing thoughts, a 'body high' feeling, etc.  So, the door opened, everyone was there, this cat was dying and stuff, they were supposed to spend some time with the cat, then take him in to be put down (vet's advice).

It was really sad, etc, etc.  I won't get into the crazy specifics of how it was. Really unpleasant.  But here's the thing, the highness just... died.  It was like, apart from a slight body high, I just sobered up.  Before I knocked on that door, if I stayed still and looked at the ground, it looked like it was rippling.  If I looked at anything carefully, I saw fractal patterns etched onto them.  All that stopped.  My thinking became clear.  I was able to express myself in words clearly.  And this lasted for the next five hours that I spent with them, at the vets, etc.  It was amazing.  Once I was by myself, away from them (about 12-13 hours after I'd dropped), I was high again, typical burnout.

Anyway, it was just interesting, how under a stressful and prolonged experience where being sober was preferable, I suddenly felt totally sober and was able to act completely normally.  I even did stuff like, in the car, stare at things to see if I got the normal fractals... nothing.  Once I was alone, I felt like I was high and there was no way I could be sober. I didn't want to be high, I just wanted to be sober.  

Anyway, keep your phone off when you do acid. This worked out for me, but I could easily see it having gone bad and the experience between the initial phone call and arriving at the girlfriend's place would probably qualify as a 'bad trip,' though there was some cynically pleasant conversation with Casey.  Anyway, the experience of just 'sobering up' seemed worth reporting.

My first time using LSD was one of the most amazing experiences of my life time.  I have been smoking pot for quite some time and just started experimenting with halluginegens.  I had tripped on mushrooms and salvia divinorum several times and DXM once before I decided to try acid.  My friend called me to tell me he could get me some acid if I wanted it, so I bought 5 hits for myself and was planning on taking it the next day before going to the Camp Verde hot springs to camp.  When I told my friend Jessica she got very excited so I talked to my friend again and bought 5 hits for her too.

The next day we took the acid in my dorm room at about 3:00 in the afternoon.  Jessica only took 4 and sold her other hit to another friend who was going.  Jess and I had to wait for about 45 minutes for our ride to get there.  I was slowly beginning to feel not quite normal when Jess came to my room, saying she didn't want to be alone.  We both agreed we were a little fucked up.  We started to get kind of giggly and objects were beginning to be surrounded by rainbows of light coming in through the window.  Things were given rainbow trails when I moved my head.

I went downstairs to my friend's room to see if he was there and stopped on the way to stare at the gloss coating of the cement in the stairwell as it flowed like water, carrying footprints with it.  My friend wasn't there, and when I got back Jess was excited to see me.  We sat and stared at things for a while until I decided to weigh out an ounce of mushrooms to bring along for my friends. This took a very long time but I eventually finished and put them in a camera case with a box of baggies, some syrian rue, and my digital scale.

By the time my friend arrived to pick us up we were tripping pretty hard.  We grabbed all our stuff and headed down to his car.  As we were packing the trunk I beat on my hand drum to listen to the echos coming of the building.  It took about 40 minutes to drive south from Flagstaff, AZ to Camp Verde, during which Jess and I sat in the back like little kids on a road trip, staring out the windows and asking non-sensical questions.  The 40 minutes felt much longer.  Just outside Camp Verde we got onto a bumpy dirt road winding around the contours of mountains through a river valley.

We were told we'd be on this road for an hour before reaching our stop.  Jess and I couldn't believe it, the 40 minutes had already seemed like forever.  Rocks in the sides of hills took strange shapes and the landscape filled us with awe.  I was asking if we were lost about every 10 minutes.  Jess and I were constantly afraid for our lives as we wound up and down mountains on the tiny road with no guardrails, but cheerfully so.  The sun set on the way, making a beautiful color on the mountainous horizon.

When we finally arrived it was dark and we were glad to stretch our legs.  We were meeting more friends at the springs, but we had no cell phone coverage, the springs were about a mile hike away and we didn't have any idea how to get there.  We found a friendly hippy who was sitting outside his van with friends and I agreed to give him an eighth of mushrooms in return for guiding us to the springs.

Nobody had a light and the terrain was rocky so Jess and I walked together, talking happily and catching eachother as we would trip on unseen objects.  We again felt like little kids, always getting behind, laughing, and asking somewhat pointless questions.  Ocassional patches of sand were incredibly strange sensations.  In the darkness every large rock seemed like a curled up human.  I could hear footsteps behind and in front of me, making it seem like I was part of an invisible, moving crowd.

Jess and I both noticed light coming from behind us on occasion, but it never had a source.  There were more rainbows, in the form of strings, making up nets and grid patterns to the side.  Unseen branches hanging over the path and hitting us in the faces caused me to hallucinate fake ones in rainbow color.  It was at this point the I was the most in control of my visuals.  I got rid of the unseen crowd because it was freaking me out a little bit, and then created my own personal iridescent 3D spherical force field around myself.

After about a mile of hiking we reached a fast moving river which we had to ford.  I was cold and waist deep and we had to lean sideways to not be swept away, carrying our belongings above our waists.  Jessica and I were tripping very hard and this was quite an endeavor.  At the end of the ford I payed our guide, whose name was Rennick, then gave my other 2 companions their mushrooms before walking a little farther and finally arriving at the springs.

Our friends weren't there and we were confused but also cold so we went into one of the springs.  It was a small rectangular pool inside a stone room painted with many images from previous visitors.  We sat in its warmth and I found that by lifting my hands from the water I could manipulate the steam that came off of them.  I sold some more mushrooms to some cool people who were there when we got there.  I smoked some pot out of a pipe that was offered to me by a cool old kinda fat guy who later bought some mushrooms.  He sang songs and told us storys from his lifetime.  I later found out that the pipe and weed had belonged to a man that he knew who was murdered in an argument fueled by speed and alcohol.  That tripped us out.  We looked in wonder at the paintings on the walls.  After quite some time our friends arrived, late, and I was surrounded by familiar people.  They were all drinking wine so I got to have some good red wine in the comfort of the spring.  Jess and I were still both very happy and I felt positive vibes from her all night.

When we had been in the comfort of the springs for quite some time we decided it was time to go back and set up our camp.  On the way back we had flashlights and got to see the whole endeavor in the light, which was interesting.  At the camp we set up my tent and then all huddled in one of my friends tents, eating granola and chocolate and covering ourselves with blankets to stay warm.

Once my hands warmed up I played a little guitar before laying down and cuddling with Jess until the rest of our party returned from the hot springs.  Everybody seemed set on going to sleep, so although we weren't tired Jessica and I went to my tent and got in our sleeping bags to stay warm.  After just laying there for a while we both decided that we were not going to sleep and that cuddling had been nice.  We unzipped our sleeping bags and put them together, holding eachother and carressing eachothers backs and hands all night.  It was very intimate and comforting, and turned out to keep us much warmer since the night got very cold.  I felt very close to my friend, and my feelings for her grew quite a bit over the night.  

In the morning we all sat in the sun and ate granola, trail mix and canned vegitables.  A blunt was rolled and several people smoked it in a circle, while me and a few others played guitars and hand drums.  It was a very nice day, and we left around 12:30 to head back to Flafstaff.  I didn't feel bad, but a little fried and not 100%.  I slept for 17 hours the next night and felt refreshed in the morning.  This was an incredibly positive trip, and though I took a lot of acid, it was never overwhelming and I stayed in control the entire time.

Having done acid for the first time previously less that a few days before this trip, and having found it to be a truly mind expanding, soul cleaning, positive, wonderful, and fulfilling experience, my personal mindset for this particular trip could not have been better.

Myself and two other close friends, both of whom had been present at my first trip, which also happened to be collectively, our first trip. We decided to plan a trip into a small country house located in a small village somewhere along the west cost of the UK. As with any well planed trip we came prepared with all the usual suspects, namely shit loads of top notch music, some hash, food, an open mind and youthful sprit. When we arrived it was within an hour of dusk. We each dropped a trip of strong acid. As we waited for the trip to come on, lets call him bob, set up the sound system, while I rolled a joint. Nothing like a smoke to kill the jittery first hour or so before the onset of the trip. In retrospect nothing could have prepared me for this trip.

To set the scene, we were in a large 120 year old house, the kind with walls that are about 11ft high. The walls were ordained with green wallpaper depicting flowers, and vines. The carpets are red and cream also with interesting visual patterns. We were located in one of the upstairs rooms and had moved beds and comfortable armchairs up there on a very drunken previous party. Suffice it to say there was more than enough room for the 3 of us. So there we were, the three of us, set up comfortable wise, beckoning the onset of the trip.

As the music began to echo and reverberate through the room, I noticed that the patterns on the wall paper were starting to twirl slightly, this was about 1 hour after dropping. Within 2-3 mins I was seeing strange cartoon faces in the walls and textures appeared sharper, the trip had begun and I was loving it. In retrospect I got the most trip out this trip for some reason. The other 2 were still coming up. We decided to go for a walk around the house, it now being dusk and with poor lighting in the other rooms, they took on the twilight of the night. There was this fantastic energy flowing through my veins; I loved every blissful second. 

My recollection is slightly faded of the events on that night. We wandered the house, exploring rooms, and watching the shadows morph and attack each other, forming a vivid and brilliant visual symphony. I felt like a child again, every object having a life of its own bestowed upon it by LSD. Every nerve in my body was suddenly awakened, charged with a glories energy. We may have spent 45-60min wandering the downstairs like 3 doped-up headless chickens. The other two enjoyed the experience also.

We then went back up stairs for a smoke. I had discovered on the pervious trip, that while on LSD I enjoyed to draw with a pen a paper. So I began, I could fell every movement of the pen as it glided over the page, and did some really nice and highly creative stuff.  Again in retrospect LSD unlocked in me the ability to draw and not only when Im on it, so I recommend that everyone give it a go. I did this for about 1 hour, stopping some times to chat to the others and laugh at things, and sometimes even trying to communicate the incomprehensible joy that is LSD, finding that a knowing glance is all it takes. This was one of the most pleasant and relaxing times in my life.

For a change scene we migrated into one of the other rooms. It was small and had no working lights, and a bed. The others got up and stood on the bed and started laughing and walking around on the bed, then left the room. I had to give this a try. By this time I was tripping balls and the world had become a complete symphony which I had become completely immersed in, it was awesome. Getting up on the bed I stood there, and couldnt not see what all the fuse was about, then as I walked around, it felt like a water bed, I stared to sink into it laughing my arse off. I got off the bed and proceeded to look out the window and I began to hallucinate. I saw this army guy swinging in a tree just outside the window dressed in full military fatigue with a gun, and some other really cool shit. I called the other two back in to have a look, but they failed to see anything. For some reason they werent trip as hard as me. 

I went back into one of the other rooms to relax, chill and begin to draw again. I did this for a while. The next thing I know, after drawing some great stuff, was that when the other 2 talked to me there voices sounded metallic and echoed. I was really wasted, they asked me if I was ok, and I reassured them that I was. I was loving every second of this. Then the other two went back into the other room where the music setup was. I stayed alone in the other room drawing for about 30 mins drawing. Then bob came in to get me and took me back into the other room for a smoke.

Im not sure what happened next but as I sat there I had this wave of joy, and extreme lack of concern for every thing, as I just experienced pure, simple elementary existence. As far as I could see all that existed was my joy. It was the most peaceful I have ever felt and something I will never forget. I think my friends were getting concerned about me, the ask me if I was ok, I could not even talk I just sat there nodded and smiled. I will never forget that feeling. I think it lasted for 5mins. It was extremely profound. After that extreme high the trip began to decline.

A lot of repressed memories and dark parts of the past are somewhere in my head, always there, projecting all that evil shit that I couldn't deal with and tried locking away. Denial is a tool we all use, if it's blaming others for things you did, if it's irrational rage at the world, or just being pissed off at your girlfriend that dumped you for not thinking about her at all. My weekly sessions with my psychologist should have taught me that the barrier between the things we lock away and day to day life help us cope with reality.

So when I bought a shitload of LSD, I should have thought about that. A triple dose, just to check out if this stuff is for real, and I was propelled into a beautiful daytime trip, enjoying relaxing music, seeing the beauty of nature and just having a great time hallucinating. I opted not to smoke marijuana to 'enhance' the trip, favoring a more lucid route.

The next day, I had smoked some weed prior to going to my psychologist, 20 hours after the end of the trip - and a bit of that state of mind came back. I was more open than I usually allow myself, as we both probed into the sides of my psyche I don't like. I decided not to change a subject as I usually do when introspection starts becoming a painful ordeal.

Upon leaving the psychologist, the barrier between all the bad emotions pent up in my subconciousness and my day to day life was broken, not shattered, but enough to see that there is a flood of darkness and pain inside myself. Driving back home, I was feeling a mixture of rage and pain aimed to it's source for a change. For the next three days, I was in a hard and lonely place, my spiritual pains starting to manifest physically. Until I went to a party, took another dose of the acid and danced like there's no tomorrow.

Again, after I woke up, I saw that the wall skillfully built around my past was broken down again. I am now swamped with self loathing and hatred, I am having trouble with day to day tasks that never bothered me before, feeling more detached, less REAL. Identity slowly fading to a sum of all the crap in my past, and dealing with it is no easy task.

The opening of the gates to the subconciousness is not something to be taken lightly - my trips were spectacularly enjoyable, but left a vulnerability that was not there before. Accelerating the progress of my healing in a way, helping me see with what I need to cope with, is one way you can look at it, as my psychologist has commented since that facing the parts that you don't like in your mind is the first important step to correcting the problem. Knowledge of not being psychologically stable at the moment of taking this drug was there. Other than that, the set and setting were perfect. The quality of the LSD is top notch, with the highest purity I have tried ever. There is no body load whatsoever, no loops, no muddled thought and no confusion but rather a spiritual experience.

But the other way to look at what LSD did to me is much simpler. I was psychologically not fit to take a deep psychedelic substance, and took it anyways, something that fitted perfectly with my need to escape from reality. I have since been on the border of breaking down. Lack of energy, zoning out, overcomplicating everything simple in order to excuse myself from doing it, self loathing, hatred aimed towards everything, fear of others, fear of myself, and most of all, a hollowness that can be felt throughout my soul.

I broke down a wall, but I wasn't prepared for what's on the other side.  I just wanted to escape. I escaped from a dark room and find myself in a dungeon.

There are moments in my life, where I remember myself as the person before, and the person after an experience, I had one of those moments one evening late in the summer of 1996.

Myself and a group of friends had gathered at a buddy's house, his folks were at their summer home and we used to have get togethers there to party, have bonfires, and listen to music... it was always a good time.  But this one night has stuck with me, I remember it as if it had happened yesterday, the vivid image burned into my memory.

My friends and I had come across a vial of liquid LSD.  We had done it many times before, see colors move and wave, things seem more alive, make cigarette trails and circles but never in my life have I had an experience like I had that night.  I tear up even retelling this story in print, not because anything horrible actually happened that night, but I, still to this day, feel that I was given some insight from God, as to what's to come.

We had dropped the acid at about 8:00 pm, they were on the large sweet-tart rolls that have the dimple in them.  Each one had two doses on them, and always anxious to start the fun, we were getting disappointed after about an hour with no effect.  So after about an hour had passed, we took another.  In retrospect, I think this may have been a big mistake, because as the night progressed, I can only say I was taken to a place that living humans shouldn't visit.  

To this point in my life, I was not a very spiritual person, not a religious person and had no advance knowledge of the stories of the history of the Bible, the events of the night would surely change that.  Anyways, on with the story...

More people had shown up, some that we had partied with before, some that I've never seen before in my life, it was a friendly atmosphere, and at about 10:00, I began to feel the effects of the LSD.  It began as a normal trip, things began looking not quite normal, flowing wood grain, things that I could associate with my previous experiences with this drug.  

Then, my friend invited me to come up to his room to look at the fractal generator on his computer, which he referred to as 'god'.  I played along, it was neat, but he continued referring to this piece of electronic equipment as god, and as he did so, I began to have a feeling that what he was doing was VERY wrong.  After several minutes of listening to him, I stood up, and calmly said to him that 'That is not God'...

I got up and walked out of the room, and started to make my way down the stairs.  I got about halfway down, and began to feel dizzy.  I sat down on the stairs, put my head in my hands and closed my eyes.  I remember having a short conversation, like an argument, with who I could not tell you.  I said 'No, not yet' and they agreed with me, that it was not the right time.. and suddenly, I felt as if I was being pulled from my body.  Further and further back I was pulled, I could see the house and then the city, then the state... but stranger still, I was aware of all the people, things, animals, and that they were all interconnected, like a huge puzzle fitting together in perfect symmetry... and then I stopped.  

I could feel a presence over my shoulder, not intimidating presence, but felt such a love from this being that I can really not begin to explain it in words.  It told me that it needed to show me something, and that it was the most important thing in the world and asked me if I was ready.  I said yes, and then all of these images began to flash through my mind, slow at first and then faster and faster, I would later realize this as images described in the Bible, from Adam and Eve, through the present time, history flashing so fast that I couldn't grasp all that I was seeing.  

What I did get from it is that God is in all things, no matter how miniscule, no matter how insignificant.  I couldn't tell you how long I was there, a second, a minute, an eternity, but as quickly as it had started, it ended.  The presence then told me that I'd been shown the most important thing the world has ever known, and that I was to remember and tell as many people that I could.  The feeling that I had seen this once before was strong in me, I later likened it to what people are shown, before they are born into this world.  I remember nodding my head, and then I was told that I was going to be put back into my body, and was reminded once again to remember and pass on what I had learned.  And then 'BAM' there I was, standing outside the house on the front stoop.  

Standing there with me, was another one of my friends, Wolfy, he had also dosed with us that evening.  The conversation we had was chilling to me, to say the least.

He looked at me, cocked his head, and said 'Where'd ya go?'

I said, 'Wolf, you're never going to believe what just happened to me.'  He kind of smiled and started to walk around me.  I then told him that I thought I had just met God, and started going into some of the details of the experience.

He continued to pace around me, and again, smirked at me, and said 'You know, all that stuff you were just telling me...  You don't want to remember that.  The people and the Garden..' his speech began to speed up, '...the this and that.. You don't want to remember that'  Every time he made a revolution around me, I felt as if I was forgetting a little bit more of what I'd been shown.  Then suddenly, I felt this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach.  I looked at him, and said 'Oh my god Wolf... you're Satan.'  Again he smirked, winked at me, and walked into the house.

I stood outside for a bit, then myself walked into the house, most of the people at the party had wandered outside to the bonfire in the back.  I went down into the finished basement, it was empty save me and I sat there for awhile... then I had this thought, that a girl I had met earlier in the night was going to come down the stairs, and say something about 'freaking me out'... and click... the door to the basement opened up and down the stairs the footsteps came.  Sure enough, the girl walked around the corner and the first words out of her mouth were 'Hey Jeremy, I hope this doesn't freak you out but I know your ex..'

I said, 'I really don't mean to be rude, but you are freaking me out, I have to go.'  And I walked up the stairs and began to make my way to the back door of the house, see if I could find some normality with the other party goers.

Just before I opened the sliding glass door I thought... 'Wolf is going to make a comment of peeing his pants'... I opened the back door, and as I stepped out onto the porch, Wolf stood up and wiped his leg, and said 'Oh my God, I think I just peed myself.'

I was beginning to feel very afraid, a sense of impending doom began to make a knot in the pit of my stomach, like the world was going to end.  I kept looking out to the horizon for signs of a mushroom cloud or something, and I couldn't shake it.  Then one of the girls sitting around the fire walked over to me, looked at me and said 'Don't ya get it?'

I said, 'Don't I get what?'  It suddenly felt like she was making fun of me... She tapped another party goer on the shoulder and whispered something to him and giggled.  I began to sense the presence of Evil at the party very strongly.  She then looked at me again and said 'You really don't get it, huh?'  Then another person stopped next to her and repeated the same thing.. 'Jay, you don't get it?'  I had the sudden need to be far away from this place... The question began to travel through the party... 'DON'T YOU GET IT?'  I could hear it as I walked back into the house following me, and no, at the time, I can honestly say that I didn't get it...

I called my parents house, and got my Mom, I told her that I needed someone to pick me up, told her where I was and that I wasn't feeling well, I needed to be around people I knew loved me.  The question was still floating in my head... don't you get it?... I walked out the front door and was sat down next to my car.

The front door of the house opened, and my friend walked out, the one that was referring to his computer as 'god'.  He asked how I was doing and I told him that I had called for a ride.  We had some small talk and I was actually starting to feel a bit more normal.  I was thinking of calling back and canceling my ride... and then a thought came into my head and told me that if I kept partying, I would die.  I shook it off and began to get up, and all the hair on my body stood on end.  My friend looked at me, and asked what was wrong... 

I said, 'Don't you see it?'

He said, 'See what...?'

I said, 'Oh my God!  Oh my God!' and began walking to the street... It had to of been in my minds eye, but I saw a fire in the sky, and pointed to it... it was growing, and growing... I dropped down to the ground and covered my head.

It passed over head with the sound of a thousand locomotives, and disappeared into the distance... At that moment, I knew that I had witnessed the end of the world.  I turned an ashen white, at that moment, a car pulled up, it was my brother and his girlfriend.  My Ma had sent them to come get me.  I left the party that night, a changed person.  I started going to church, something that since I've stopped as the church centered a lot around giving to get, and I didn't feel that was right, so now I just pray, and look to God to find the answers.

I don't really know what happened to me that night.  It wasn't like any other trip that I've ever had before, and I had always had a good experience... I still couldn't tell if what happened that night was a good experience or not, but good or ill, it did change me.  It was also the last time, that I took a hallucinogenic drug.  I realized that there are some things, that us living humans are just not meant to experience.

I pray for the world, and hope that day, that is so sharply burnt into my memory, never comes to pass...

God Bless you all...

A little background information; At age 15, throughout the 10th grade of High School, I dropped Lucy every other day and was able to even keep composure throughout High School while doing so. Never once did I have a bad journey or anything that felt remotely wrong at this point in my life. At this point in my life I was a worry free kid. The drought set in and my life changed drastically. I got into hard shit and became very depressed with my life. My last trip with Lucy (11 days before my daughter was born) was a rough one but I had my daughters mother who I was very close with at that point to guide me through. She had also been my chemical companion throughout various past experiences. 

Alright so here it is all laid out. Not a very perfectly planned journey by any means but I did learn a few very important lessons about my life and life in general and all around it was a very good experience. Throughout the night before dropping I had around 4 or 5 beers. Around 4:25a.m. I decided to drop 3 hits of the blotter which I recently acquired from a loving brother. The first hour was spent in my room just laying down watching TV I dont exactly remember what was on the TV at the time. When it reached 5:25a.m. I was feeling nothing so I decided to drop two more. Layed there and watched some more TV until it reached about 5:40 a.m. when I felt like I had diarrhea coming on from some little caesars pizza and crazy bread I hate ate a few hours earlier. My mother was just getting out of the bathroom and getting ready to head to work. 

I got up and went into the bathroom and opened up the window nice and wide which faces to the east. While sitting there I could feel it coming on slightly and in my mind I got very excited and felt as if I was purposely purging out all of the negativity in my life. I felt nothing but good vibes radiating at this point. After getting out of the bathroom I went back into my bedroom around 5:50a.m. and sat back down and took a nice swig of beer and could still feel it coming on slightly. It felt like as soon as I sat down my mother called me from downstairs to print a report for my little sister because she couldnt get it to print. I went downstairs with minor anxiety and printed it and headed back to my room. 

At this point it was 6:00a.m. Upon getting back into my room I laid there feeling out Lucy and letting her get a good feel of me. Everything felt right at this point. Everything was beautifully coming together but I was not totally satisfied. Around 6:15a.m. I went to grab for the last 2 hits and my phone started ringing immediately as I reached. It was my mother asking me to wake up my little brother for school. I felt like this was an omen not to drop anymore because she had stopped me while my arm was outreached. I woke up my brother and went back upstairs. Sitting on my futon things were starting to take hold even stronger but I still was not satisfied and while looking at the last two hits I thought to myself well I can either sit here and have a low to mild experience or I can see how far the rabbit hole will go with all of these. Seeing as this has been my first experience in over a year I dropped the last 2 hits.

At this point it had reached 6:35a.m. The sun was up in the east but my windows face the north and the west so my room was fairly dim at this point. This is where things really started to go into overdrive. Laying on my futon I was watching Funny Farm because it was on HBO at the time and seemed suitable and non violent/threatening. At around 6:55a.m. it hit me like a ton of bricks. I was totally blown away. I laid completely flat on my back on my futon breathing deeply in and out keeping a good mindset and watched spots on my wall begin to swirl and take on what looked like a life of their own moving in various motions. At this point all was good and I was enjoying. I turned back to the TV and it was annoying me so I shut it off and laid back watching the ceiling. The visuals were utterly phenomenal. At first in a good sense but then they started to get a dark feeling to them. I brought my blanket up over my head and shut my eyes and inside my mind I was having some very wild visuals that I have never experienced to this intensity before. Things that seemed to look like skeletal figures with geometric lines forming their shape. Utterly amazing but at the same time frightening.

It felt as if the demons (how my mind put it at that time) were closing in on me. I felt like I was fading out and I became very claustrophobic and felt as if something was making it hard for me to breathe while under my blanket. Very overwhelming feeling. I pushed off my blanket and laid on my side staring at my futon gazing into what looked as if it was the fourth dimension. While gazing it became dark again and what looked like a demons face came before my eyes totally white face made up of total energy nothing physical with black eyes. This fucked with me bad so I sat up and tried to regain composure. At this point only a very small amount of time had passed. It went from 6:55a.m. to only 7:15a.m. I couldnt believe my brothers and sisters hadnt even left for school yet because I wanted to go downstairs where it was more open and bright. Things were very intense so I decided to try and give my daughters mother a call who used to be chemical companion and would guide me through when times got rough. With 3 back to back failed attempts at calling I think it set me off very bad.

I laid down on my back again and stared at the ceiling. The next visual was the most intense I have ever seen in my entire relationship with Lucy. Above me on the ceiling were physically lifeless forms. They were made up of complete energy with a light white glow. They were in a circular shape all connected at the head, arms at their sides, and legs spread out. They were moving in a circle in a counterclockwise rotation. I felt like fading out again and began to but things started feeling negative and I felt as if the demons  were grabbing for me (this is what was running through my mind).

I closed my eyes and I was seeing some very fucking cool but scary shit. Things that looked like ancient egyption pyramids and peoples of that time along with skeletal figures and demonic looking faces. All incredible and I'd do it over any day of the week but at that point where I was at right then it was a little too much for me. I needed somebody to be there with me and help me understand and comfort me. I attempted to call my daughters mother again with no luck and became upset and realized that it had only hit 7:40a.m. and that my little brothers and sisters were gone at school. At this point I totally lost track of time up until the end.

Downstairs I went and turned on a fan and pointed it at the couch and headed to the bathroom. In the bathroom nothing too spectacular happened. Just the usual off and crooked look to everything. I came out of the bathroom and laid down on the couch and watched the TV hoping it would keep me leveled off. This did not work and I found myself gazing off and getting an overwhelmed feeling of anxiety. I forgot the purpose of why I was journeying in the first place and only wanted to come down. Things felt off and not right and generally blue. I tried calling Erica one last time with no luck. The air from the fan started to annoy me so I turned it off. I stared out the window and became annoyed because I couldnt go outside feeling that overwhelmed and not knowing the purpose of what I was doing in that realm and feeling like nothing was being accomplished and very overwhelmed of the intensity of what I was seeing.

I had to figure out something to do. Right in front of me was my answer. The computer. I walked up and hit the mouse and the screen saver shut off and Windows popped up. I looked at my desktop and it was distorted looking, the buttons seemed larger, the color was off, out of the corner of my eye the printer looked like it was lifting off the desk and coming back down over and over again everything on the desk out of the corner of my eye was floating and pulsing. The exact words that came flying out of my mouth were Fuck That. I got up and sat back down on the couch. Everything was just so very intense and I felt so lost after only a few minutes I jumped back up and made my way back to the machine determined to get online to talk with some people I knew would understand where I was at and be able to help me through.

The visuals were still intense and throughout my whole time on the computer it was very intense. I felt like I was inside the monitor at some point and others I just watched everything on the desk float. I made my way here with little trouble. Ive been a computer nut since I was 11 years old. I went to my post where I asked earlier around the time I originally dropped for people to send me some good vibes. On the screen I read a post that I hadnt previously read before dosing saying Its been a long time coming. You know what to do. Its like exactly what I had been thinking. That I had no clue what I was supposed to be doing. I had totally forgotten the purpose of my journey and why I was gazing into the astral plane.  I have so much respect and appreciation for everybody who helped me out throughout that thread especially in the beginning. Everybody was throwing short and compact hard hitting good spirited punches at me. I will never underestimate the value of words even on a computer screen ever again in my life. Where I was at that point in time I was clinging on those words. I will also never forget what those guys did for me. They may not realize it but they truly helped set me in a good place. I have much love for them and I feel a much deeper connection with that forum then I previously had.   Sitting with my face close to the monitor I felt like I had a connection with each and every one of them. It was absolutely beautiful. I could honestly feel their good intentions and felt like I was making a connection with their spirit through their words and avatar. It was like I have known all of them my whole life and they understood me and where I was at that point. I became very calm at this point. This is when I could not connect to the forums. I had just started to feel better and I felt like something very demonic was keeping me away from the love I was feeling while here. While here I felt as if all of the negativity in my body was being purged with the help of the vibes I was receiving.

I went back and laid on the couch and reached out and felt like I made a spiritual connection with me uncle who I was very close to growing up. He was like my role model and I respect him. He is a very wise spiritual man. I felt overwhelmed with good vibes again and once again felt like I was purging out the negativity in my body. I called him and when he heard me rambling about how I dropped 7 doses and was tapped the fuck in and didnt remember what I was supposed to be doing here and I am totally lost and on and on and on he laughed. He said Matthew you need to go outside. Its a beautiful day and the earthly spirits will love you right now. Get up go outside and lay down in the grass and let yourself be engulfed with the positive spirits who will help you figure out what you are trying to do here. I replied saying I cannot go outside. He shot back Its not that you cannot go outside its that you are setting boundaries for yourself as you always do. Let go of your boundaries and travel outside. I looked out the window and it all looked so big out there (mind you I havent been out of my house at all in literally 3 or 4 months.. except for a few times with my daughters mother. I ditched most of my friends due to my anxiety that I have a hard time controlling) I just couldnt do it. My uncle continued to laugh and told me that everything would be alright and to keep purging out the negativity and thats the reason I had come to purge the negativity, the boundaries, the fear of responsibilities and maturity, and thinking to much of what other people think of me. It still didnt seem to clear to me at this point. What he said made since but he cut me short because he was at work leaving me confused and sort of upset with him.

I got back on the computer and read back to see what happened from there. The pictures posted were absolutely beautiful. They produced some wild visual distortions and I had to close some of them because they were very intense. Especially one of a girl on the blotter.  From time to time between posts and such I laid down on the couch. I watched the ceiling and many geometric patterns that looked like grafitie letters and designs were pulsing on the ceiling and changing form constantly. At one point the ceiling looked as if one big spiders web. I think the web represented many personal problems of my own that I have weaved. I could see it perfectly but became lost inside of it and lost my way.

At one point I tried to call Erica my daughters mother again and things were slowly coming down at this point. This time she answered and I tried to tell her where I was at but she didnt want to hear me. She started screaming nonsense at me that I couldnt understand. One thing I did understand was her last line. How often in the past year have you been here for me Matt? I was there for you last time this time you are on your own.. It made perfect sense to me and I needed to hear this from her. It helped me contemplate on many personal issues and set me back on track as to what I was doing and trying to accomplish.

Things slowly faded out. Visuals became less and less robust. The mind grip let go slowly. Around 1:30 p.m. The effects were totally gone for the most part. The afterglow is still upon me as we speak. From 1:30p.m.  4:00p.m. I laid on my futon and contemplated many personal things. I have come to some conclusions and some things are still left unsettled. 

All in all it was a very very good experience. It taught me a few valuable lessons and left me with a few questions to answer on my own. 

I am anticipating my next meeting with Lucy with open arms which probably will not be for a while.

And this chapter comes to a close. Damn that was a long time coming.

On many occasions I have used LSD to enhance the visual aspect of the event but always staying to a moderate dose to avoid any possible complications (police, other substances). However, I recently decided that I was going to do a little self-experimenation with some of the strongest paper acid I have ever taken. The purpose of this experiment was to find out if it is possible to waste my supply of LSD by taking too much. For instance, When I smoke Marijuana in a blunt or if I roll up a really fat hog-leg, I use more Marijuana but obtain the same high as if I had only smoked a bowl (minus the nicotine effect in a blunt). 

Over the course of 2 months I ingested various amounts of LSD. Let me also add that my supplier was the chemist so there was no decrease in quality of product. The first dose I took was one hit. The trip was common and comfortable and lasted nearly eight hours. For the next three days I loaded my body with vitamin suppliments and ate very well to prepare myself for the next series of doses. My next dose consisted of one hit plus one hit+1hr. I noticed an increase in overall intoxication and visual patterns. The duration was around eight to nine hours. Again for the next three days I re-nourished myself and to save repetition of facts just know that after each dose for three days I reloaded my body with vitamins and minerals. My next dose was two hits at the same time. I noticed instantly that my trip came on a lot harder, was more intense and lasted a lot longer, almost 12 hours at this point. My next dose was two hits at the same time followed by one more one hour after noticable effects were reached. I noticed each time that the initial dose seemed to determine the intensity from the get-go and the secondary dose seemed to help continue the intensity. For two weeks I did no drugs and ate very well. I decided that this break would help in any tolerance and would also be benificial to my body considering what I had in store for my next round. I needed to do a larger dose to determine how much was being wasted since lets face it three hits isn't exactly a waste. 

So I decided to start off with five hits at once then five more hits three hours after effects began. About 30 minutes after I took the first five hits I went into what I would call an instant peak. I was tripping very hard for only about an hour and a half when all of the intensity dropped. So I decided to take the other five hits and no increase occured. I thought for sure I would have crossed some kind of deminsions at this level but it didn't happen. I decided to wait a week and try again with a much larger dose. 10 Hits followed by 15 hits for a total of 25 hits. Now I wanted to time this so that I would get the maximum benefit of the LSD without wasting any. Basically I wanted to trip harder than I had ever before and get the maximum effect from each of these 25 hits. I had started to see a pattern developing also. 

I took the first 10 hits individually one every 5 minutes for 50 minutes instead of all at once. I started into my trip by the time I got to my 6th hit. It was kind of slow and gradual with little spikes of reality leaving flashbacks. Then it hit me about an hour and a half into the trip. A hardcore peak that lasted for almost 45 minutes. During this time I only saw the colors purple, red, blue, and white. I lost all sense of time (thank GOD for stopwatches) and I could not determine what was real and what was fake. My coordination and balance were no more. I began to wonder if I really should take the remaining 15 hits. When I began to come down and I could hear without the echo again I closed my eyes and stuck the remaining 15 hits in my mouth and swollowed. What happened next was nothing like I expected (of course I was expecting death). I continued to get further from my peak and the intensity continued to drop. But what didn't stop were my visuals. I continued to have outrageous visuals without the peak for what must have been 16 more hours. I was just calm, but tripping. 

So after a few days of recovery I decided to look back on my experience and make my final determination of what is the best dosage regimine for the greatest effect. I learned that taking 10 hits gradually gave me the same effect as taking five hits at one time, only taking ten hits over time made the trip last longer. I also learned that I am are going to do LSD I should decide how long I want to trip. 12 hours is the minimum when going over 3 hits. If I am going for a short trip then I take no more than five hits at one time since I also learned that I can only trip so hard. There is no other dimension to be crossed it is just a set dimension in my mind that I reach each time I trip, just how closely I examine it depends on me. If I want to trip for 24 hours or more and it is possible I might do a gradual increase to about 5 or 6 hits (one hit every 10-15 min) followed by an all at once dose of 5 or 6 hits at the four hour mark. This should get me to the 14 hour range where a ten strip will be needed to continue into the hardest realm of a trip. By the time I reach the 24 hour mark I will be tripping from the acid as well as the lack of sleep which is when the MOST VIVID AND INTENSE VISUAL WILL OCCUR!!! 

So I guess I would have to say there is no such thing as wasting LSD but unless I want to prove something or change who I am I take my hits one at a time.

This is a two part report of my most dramatic experiences on LSD.
===========================================================
PART 1

Living in Ft. Worth in spring of 1999, my brother one day brought home a strip of purple paper, and gave me 'about 4 hits worth'.  I still to this day have not been able to find out where he got it, what the name of that particular street paper was, or if that really was 4 hits.  However about two days later I decided to give half the strip a go, since I had a day off.  At the time, I had no alcohol in my system, nor any other drugs besides a couple of bottles of Coca Cola.

I took the paper at about 6 in the evening, keeping it in my mouth for 15 minutes before swallowing what was left.  This was far from the first time I had used Acid, so I expected the trip to hit after an hour or so.

The first moment that I noticed I was tripping (my own personal test- if I look at a cigarette right out of the pack and it somehow looks kind of bent, I'm probably starting the trip) about 25 minutes after eating the paper.  Soon my skin began to tingle in a familiar way, and my mind began to branch out in its thought processes.  It was to be a very strange trip indeed.

After an hour, I was hallucinating lightly and my brain was beginning to process thoughts that I now cannot remember or fathom.  At 7:30ish (thanks to my watch) I put on my combat boots, and started walking through my neighborhood.  This in and of itself was a strange reaction to the acid- usually LSD makes me very introspective and reclusive.  I began to hear a 4 bar melody playing in my head, one I had never heard before.  The music stayed in my head, looping infinitely throughout the rest of the trip.  

As I rounded the corner from my house, I noticed that the sun appeared to be setting in a most remarkable and amazing display of colors.  Glancing at my watch proved that this could not be- the sun had set almost an hour beforehand.  As I walked, I found it amazing that my own brain could hallucinate in such vivid color and realism.  The colors did not bleed over into the nearby objects, such as houses and trees, but instead stayed perfectly  within my view of the sky.

As I walked, part of my brain latched onto the fact that my brother was partying at a friend's house that night.  I decided to see if I could find out where the party was.  I had no idea what his friend's name was, where his house was, or what area of the city the house was in.  However, as I walked I began to have images popping into my head (in a sequence that appeared to be random) - A big American Flag.  A silver wristwatch (mine was black).  A Super Nintendo gaming console.  A four foot green glass bong.

At about this time is where my trip became very heavy.  I often find that when tripping on good acid, my memories at the peak of the trip become a mixed jumble of hallucinogenic and fantastic concepts, most of which are also (in this universe, anyhoo) impossible.  When I sober up it becomes hard to put them into chronological order.  This is what I remember from that particular trip.  Keep in mind that I am not insisting that any of this really happened- this is only what I remember in Dolby Surround Sound and Technicolor imagination:
- Running along the top of a wrought iron fence, not unlike a ninja in a kung fu movie.
- Walking through an alleyway where the brick walls were covered in odd graffiti.  At first, the number 1 was scrawled across a dumpster.  Then, in two separate places, the number 2.  About fifteen seconds farther down the alley, three instances of the number 3 spray painted on the walls.  Four 4's, five 5's etc. on up to 10.  I have since visited the alley in question, and found nary a number painted there.
- Drinking a cappuccino at a coffee bar two miles from my house, and feeling the fluid actually get absorbed into my body on a cellular level.  I also met up with my friend Brian at this time, and he has since put my arrival at the coffee shop at about 1:30 am.
- Being able to actually control the direction of the breeze for about half an hour.

There are more, but those are the biggest.

Sometime around daybreak, I began to come down.  I could still, however, hear the music of the melody I had been hearing all night.  Upon my arrival home, I drank roughly half a gallon of orange juice, sat down, took off my boots, and began to write down the notes to the melody.  By the time I was done, I was no longer tripping at all- just very, very tired.  My legs felt as if I had been walking all night. (I have since ascertained that this was exactly the case- I walked for about 10 hours, through back roads, main streets, around the empty parking lot of a mall, etc.)

Two very strange after-effects of this trip:

A) The song I heard in my head that night was actually very good.  Four bar melody, almost Trip-Hop in style with an industrial beat.  Any musicians reading this will understand my wonder at this:  The song is COMPLETELY unlike anything else I have written.  I am a heavy metal musician, and most my stuff is 8 bar riffs with aggressive feels to it.  The song I wrote that night is WORLDS apart from anything else I have ever written.

B) When my brother came home, I told him about my mental flashes and visions from earlier.  He told me that his friend had a big American flag on the wall of his living room, a silver Timex wristwatch that he always wore, and they had spent the evening smoking weed from a large green bong and playing Super Nintendo.
I am a hardcore skeptic.  I do not believe in clairvoyance, per se, and think people who claim to be psychic are usually fulla shit.  However, I am also convinced that for that evening, I somehow was able to remotely view my brother's habitat by merely concentrating on it.

As a footnote, I have done acid about 15 times in my life, in varying doses (once was tricked into eating a cube with 8 hits of strong liquid on it).  I have experienced a mild recurrence of HPPD-like hallucinations at times (they are usually VERY faint), and also have had some rather strong flashbacks.  It has been 2 years since I took my last LSD, and about 9 weeks ago I had a flashback so strong it almost felt as if I had done another hit.  I actually look forward to the flashbacks at times- they are much more smooth than actually doing acid, and last only a couple of hours.  The only bad side effect I have experienced is that during one trip, my skin broke out in a visible rash.

Many a time have I taken the plunge into Timothy Leary's magnificent pool.  The difference is that no matter how many times I dive into that same pond, I never know how deep it goes.  

A while ago, a friend and I each had about 4 hits of high-powered blotter acid.  It was actually a birthday present from him to me.  So the day we decided to drop, we had called Matt over to babysit us.  We kept talking wonderful things about my birthday the next day, and it had put me in such a phenomenal mood.  Matt arrives and we each put our 1/2 inch by 1/2 inch square on our tongues, and wait.  Patiently we wait.  So patiently in fact that we had begun to think the worst about the expensive paper that rested firmly on our tongues.

Then it began.

I walked over to the sink and remembered thinking that the draining water looked more than a little funny.  I turned to Ben and at the same time, he turned to me.  We gave each other that look of intimate knowledge that this wait had not been for naught.  We smiled, walked outside, and smoked a cigarette.  The sun was setting, but that word is all too common.  The sun was no longer setting.  The sun was dancing, playing, and surrounding us with its mighty warmth.  It was embracing us with the colorful horizon.  All we could do was lie down on the porch and stare.  We stared for hours at the sky.  Stars were slowly brought into view on the backs of other constellations.  I saw Leo frolic with the hunter, Orion.  Scorpio left the big dipper in search of the next hapless soul to walk by.  

I could see things move, patterns shift, and new shapes envelope the world around me.  However, this time I wasn't as interested in these beautiful visions as I normally was.  This time I wanted more, I was getting more, and wished that all could feel how happy I was, then and there.  Ben was the same way.  I thought for hours we had been having conversations and listening to the most beautiful music ever played by man.  Every word he said was in tune with mine.  Our words played off each other like instruments in an orchestra, the perfect accompaniment to each other.  Such peace, such blissful harmony.

Matt came outside to check on us relatively often, but he was never really worried.  He knew the better safe than sorry rule.  Just knowing that I had a friend who cared enough to be my babysitter was enough.  

By the time the LSD had peaked, plateaued, peaked, and plateaued once more, I realized that my temporary bliss was finally coming to its halt.  The motion around me slowed to a lull.  The colors were no longer showing off their splendor, but had now wrapped themselves around me.  The music had dwindled to a muffled tune, but never quite went away.  Instead it kept repeating itself, as if searching for something yet undone, unheard.  I could hear the rhythm, and feel it's drumbeat.  

I closed my eyes and thought.

Words began to offer themselves to me from the mouths of great poets of long times past.  Homer added his philosophy, Faulkner leant me his strength, and TS Eliot gave me his poetic grasp of our language.

I opened my eyes and found a notebook.  I began to write these words with the fervor of the great men.  They had become my muses.  They inspired me to put down all I could think to say, because otherwise it would've been lost.  An hour passes by going at D-Lysergic speeds and I read what I have written.  A smile spans the entirety of my face.  I race down the stairs and began to read aloud the poem that had just come forth: 

Tonight, I walk the stars again.
Wander my way past heaven.
Throughout the skies and outerspace,
I step up to my lonely place.
Against the laws, and deep within,
I parlay into that wonderful sin.
Where truths are false, 
And false is true.
And no one knows but you.
Where colors change and eyes will shift
and you can watch continents drift

I think, 'But is it real?'
I scream, 'It seems so real!'

My tongue burning from dots before,
But I cannot taste it anymore.
We think. We feel. We breathe.
We lie awake and seethe.
Can we feel it changing us?
Does it tear in half our minds' axis?
Then our mouth and minds dissolve,
Crying and flying and feelings resolve.
Purer thoughts and clean absolve.
Drive us to the point that we evolve.

And then faces change, one by one,
To the father, the spirit, his only son.
'It is a religion,' Timothy had said.
And now the sky turns red, and walls have bled.

Emily tells us, 'It is a cleaver of the mind,'
Something that excels beyond this grand design,
Through a dot, a plane, a space, then time.

Let me be the first to welcome you,
To a non-linear dimension, friend.
With this one tiny droplet I can send
A man to his furthest depths.
And he will come back again.
Through the fire sermon, a game of chess,
And a burial of the dead,
One can split in two halves, a thought in their own head.
'We should listen to what the thunder said,'
Thomas Stearns had told us.

So the spinning ends, the light is real once more.
We can no longer see our music as we could before.
And although we still may feel it, we still may know
We still may never discover how deep feelings can go. 

I hear the approval come from the two members of my audience, and a deafening applaud by the poets who had offered me the means to say exactly how I had felt for so long.  I bowed to them; they ought not bow to me.

I slept hard that night with vivid, pleasant dreams, because I guess that LSD-25 is the stuff that dreams are made of.

Thinking back over my experiences I feel compelled to submit this one in regards to my most notable LSD experience.  A few years ago I'd begun taking LSD and very much enjoyed it.  Unlike mushrooms I never felt 'weirded-out' or overwhelmed.  Acid feels to me like I'm zooming around, alone, in my own mind without the 'E.T./higher intelligence/teaching' aspect that goes with mushrooms.

At any rate I aquired 5 green geltabs which were very highly recommended to me.  I started with 2 of them at about 11:00 P.M. with a roomate who was coming down from MDMA and almost ready to go to sleep.  The acid came on very intensely and I was quickly inundated with colorful geometric patterns that surged forth from everything around me.  Quite enthused at this I gleefully took the remaining 3 as my roomate went off to bed.

The trip quickly progressed to outlandish proportions and I found myself writhing about on the floor in ecstasy--the somatic pleasure a large dose of clean acid can induce is remarkable!  I had managed to turn on some electronic music before I became completely overwhelmed and as I lay there tried to get into it, however was unable due to the magnitude of the experience.  I was tripping 'in between' the single moments of the music such that it had no coherence and the song was essentially unrecognizable.  Between each note was occuring an enormous amount of visual and 'meta-cognitive' activity such that I was simply too distracted to hear the music.

Sometime thereafter I was flooded with massive, reveletory perceptions of 'eternal cosmic well-being' and began laughing uncontrollably and blurting out things like 'It's okay!!!  Everythings going to be okay!!!' etc etc.  At this point my roomate emerged and was upset as he claimed I was very loud and so he couldn't sleep.  Finally I managed to get a semblance of a grip on myself and promised to keep quiet.  This was nearly impossible and so I resorted to hiding behind the couch and smothering my laughter with a pillow.  

Eventually the laughter subsided and I then (for some reason) grappled with the TV until it turned on.  At this point the trip reached an intensity previously unknown to me and I began truly *hallucinating*.  In my life this had never happened and hasn't since that day.  What I was watching on TV was in no way what would be viewed by a 'sober' person.  Giant Mardi-Gras style parade floats with dancing Japanese soldier's batons took the place of a typical scene and at this point the 'education' began.  During the next couple of hours I watched as the history of humanity, and, primarily, the oppression of women was displayed to me.  Alongside these fantastic, kaleidoscopic colored 'super-beings'(who seemed composed of light-energy or some such substance) were black-and-white scenes of horrible, disfigured masses of humanity racing along.  The split was remarkable between the two.  Intermittenly these female 'super-beings' with these outrageous tentacle-things coming out of their heads would appear and explain the course of humanity to me.  It was explained that evolution was the 'name of the game' and that we were moving toward becoming these fantastic beings ourselves.  

All this was occurring through the TV and not through some manner of 'channeling' of information through my mind (ala mushrooms).  The beauty and 'awesome-ness' of the 'super-beings' was as intense as the horror and abject gruesome-ness of the black-and-white inmages that poured from the TV like a VCR tape running at 2X speed.  It was like a massive cosmic crash-course in the past and (maybe) future path of humanity.  I have since found that watching TV while 'tripping' is, invariably, a bad thing...  

This is extra-ordinarily difficult for me to explain in this write-up what I experienced so try to make sense of it.  The entire room was basked in a white-ish light and the feeling to me was that something MAJOR/HUGE was occuring right then.  That THE 'big thing' was happening and I was totally overwhelmed with the cosmicity of it all.  I'd shut my eyes and feel like I was flying toward/through a narrow evolutionary filter--which was at once frightening and astonishing to me.   At around this time I also had rather serious revelations about myself and that I needed to resolve my own conflicts and issues--it all pointed back at me whenever I looked elsewhere for the causes of my misery and unhappyness in life.  My ego was shown to be something that was 'in the way' of this.

Needless to say I was quite unsettled by this experience and it took sometime for the earth-shaking revelations to 'assimilate'.  And no, I wasn't 'enlightened' from then onward and in fact found the magnitude of the revelations too large to incorporate practically in my life (coupled with a lack of desire to, among other issues).  I haven't taken LSD since then and not because I don't enjoy it, but because it's simply too 'mind-opening', like cracking an egg with a mallet or some such thing.  I find it to be too 'open-ended' and leaves me like a ball of yarn that's been unwound.  This is for high doses though and I'm sure that more prudent amounts would be more manageable to me if I'm ever so inclined again.  Other Tryptamines can have the same effect but I find that they often seem to bring me into contact with the aformentioned 'higher-intelligence-mind-info-channeling' thing that, although a bit creepy and 'weird' at times, can serve to guide and teach me in a more 'restrained' fashion...

A couple of weeks ago, my fiance M and I were given two Necco candies with Lsd dropped on them.  We took it the night we got it, after a nice, mellow dinner party with close friends.  It was a very impulsive move; usually he and I make preparations such as location, purpose and general feelings about taking the drug.  But that night we just decided to take them right when we got home, as it was already midnight.

We arrive home and then ingest.  I feel I must also say that I am a paraplegic as of last Sept., and since the car accident I have tried MDMA, Cannibis and 2-CB, all with good results.  This was to be my first LSD trip in my new body.  

We begin to feel the effects within an hour. The usual giddy, absolutley goofy euphoria engulfs us, everything is made into a joke somehow.  We mill around the apartment aimlessly, realizing that we have tripped in this house, with the same atmosphere, too many times.  It is becoming stale, and why did we do this anyway?  I began to feel kind of foolish and irresponsible, we did not have a purpose for this trip, we did it to get high.  We are both feeling kind of claustraphobic so we go outside to smoke cigarettes. 

By this time it is about 2 or 3hours into the trip.  The steep climb of the high is evening out to its plateau.  We hear a single car approaching on the nearby road, and it is pretty much the only sound that is around us right then, and we both tune our ears to it, listening to the nighttime driver getting closer to the round-about that is right up the street from our apartment complex. As we listen, we hear the tires suddenly start to squeal, and then screech, and then SLAM!, and with hair raising clarity we can hear the EEEEEEEE of the car horn stuck on. We look at eachother with the classic, 'Oh, SHIT!' faces. M pauses, then says, 'I have to call 911.'  M runs into the house, gets the cordless phone and brings it outside.  He holds the phone in his hand and stares at it, and I know exactly what he is thinking: Shit, am I coherent enough to do this? I'm so fucking high, but I have to call.  So he calls.  After M reports what we heard, the dispatcher takes his name and adress, and we hope that the cops don't come and try to talk to us.  M hangs up the phone.  The car horn is still stuck, but it shuts off after a few more minutes. I try not to imagine the reasons why it got stuck, or how it turned off.  Soon we hear the approaching sirens, and tow truck.  

Needless to say, this event took our trip and spun it 180 degrees.  We discussed how strange it was that we took this drug on impluse (which was unusual for us), and after wondering why, we went outside and this whole thing began to transpire.  We talked about how even though M was really high, he could not _not_ do anything, because when we got into our accident, people called 911 for us, people put out the fire we started, people dragged us up out of the ditch and saved us.  We ruminated that this night might be part of some cyclical karma and in another, parallel world, we had saved our own asses.

We went back inside and crawled into bed and held eachother, we were both a little unnerved.  After we had calmed down for a while, M asked if I wanted to make love.  I said yes, and we began to embark on a very healing and spiritual, sexual journey.  Those hours are so dreamlike to my memory.  It went something like this:

I don't know if anyone else experiences this, but when I get tickled, I laugh and squeal, but underneath there is a real feeling of fear, like someone is coming too close to a sacred or private place, physically as well as mentally. M began to tickle me on my stomach, and I got that feeling, and I used the LSD to push past that feeling of fear (or let him into it).  What I felt then made me cry, and then I would laugh again, and then push him away when I needed to rest (pushing past fear takes a lot of energy).  After a minute or so I would let him back in, and this cycle of crying and laughing and gasping continued for about half an hour, and it began to bring up all this cruddy, phlegmy stuff that had been in my lungs for weeks (I can't cough like I used to), and I could breathe much better. Then we proceeded to take the energy we had built up into our hands, and our hands danced together, pushing waves of energy back and forth between us. Then we talked about some issues in our sex life that had been festering since we got into the car accident. And after all this, I felt so completely husked clean and light.  M setteled down to go to sleep, but I was not so lucky.

I have always had a hard time sleeping after an LSD trip, and this was no exception.  My mind started up with the circle of thoughts, over and over, and when I tried to go to sleep it felt like once I slipped over taht thin line between sleep and wake some vital function would stop, like my heart or breathing.  I began to wonder if the LSD was having some sort of reaction with my other medications (Neurontin for nerve pain and an antibiotic).  I would slip in and out of this paranoia, in which I though if I fell asleep I would die.  I kept waking M up and asking him to tell me I was OK, but he kept falling back to sleep.  I finally decided that since I was thinking I would die if I fell asleep, I just wouldn't 
sleep right now.  The logical part of my brain knew that things would be ok and all I had to do was ride it out, I figured I only had about two hours left until baseline. So I woke M up once more and asked him to set up the TV and VCR so I could distract myself and stay awake, which he gladly did.
About halfway into my movie I began to experience back pain, and I thought, 'Oh great, here we go,'.  I tried not to think about too much because I knew that would make the pain worse.  This was pretty much the only thing I was worried about with LSD and my new body, and it was showing up.  On MDMA and 2-CB the only physical effects I got were increased spasms and stiffness in my legs.  I got those on LSD too, in addition to back pain.  

Despite me efforts to distract myself, the pain kept getting progressively 
worse until I could not move.  When I moved, or if the bedsheet was moved over my legs and feet, the spasms in my back would twitch in protest.  But I had to turn myself over every few hours, and this was excruciating.  By about noon the day after we dropped, I still could not move without pain.  M brought me food in bed, and more movies.  I began to worry when I found the back pain did not leave my body even though I was no longer high.  
At about 6pm I was turning myself over again, but this time when I did it the pain in my back just about tripled.  Now, there was a small part of me that was really intrigued by all this, especially when I found I could feel the shooting pain all the way down my right leg (read: I could _feel_ my right leg).  But by now both M and I were really worried, and we tried to call all our friends that knew anything about muscules and massage but no one was home.  We contemplated taking me to the hospital but we didn't know how, since every movement made me cry out in pain.  So M got a cold pack out of the freezer and put it on one particularly nasty, spasming muscle.  
By this time I had been awake for almost 36 hours, and despite the pain I found myself finally passing out.

When I woke up about 4 hours later the pain had lessened to the point where I could turn over again.  Then I went back to sleep.  All in all I was in bed for about a day and a half.  The pain gradually let up, although it did take about 3 more days to feel completely normal again.

The whole trip was a incredible rollercoaster ride, and I have decided that because of the pain, I will never take LSD again.  But I do not regret this trip.  The spiritual awakening between M and I was well worth it.  Plus, I got to scratch another drug off my 'first time in the new body' list.  I am anxious to try salvia, DMT and I may be getting fungus soon.  Wish me luck.

I've done a lot of drugs in my life, and i find that the most profound experiences and insights they've given me are the hardest to express.  I believe they're even ineffable in a direct sense, though one can hint at them and convey at least some of the intended meaning.  This is my attempt to share my most 'profound' drug experience for whatever benefit any readers can glean from it.

My best friend P. and I had been doing drugs together for a while, usually acid at varying doses.  We learned over past experiences not to enter the trip with a goal, e.g. 'visuals', 'enlightenment', or even 'fun'.  

We went to a friend's place to get acid.  Our friend, C., had a dropper full of lsd, and we each bought 10 hits from it. 

At 7 pm C. measured out the drops into our palms and we licked it out.  The strange metallic taste lingered as it went down but was drowned out by the orange juice we drank to wash down centrum pills.  We said our goodbyes and walked out into the city.  We were both excited but didn't say anything for a while.  The noises of the city were brash but exciting as we sat on the stoop of the apartment building while P. smoked a cigarette.  We decided to walk to a coffee shop about half a mile away to chill out and watch all the people.  I lost myself in my thoughts along the way, and when my attention shifted outward, my inner dialogue stopped.  The lights, people, sounds, and 'vibes' seemed more real than they had ever before.  It was as if the same two dimensional cityscape I passed every day had suddenly gone to 3D as it ought to be.  A thought shot across my mind - its early, not even 15 minutes yet- 

I looked at P. His face had become a complex interplay of pinks and whites, and an explosion of perceptions and associations of him flooded my mind.  He turned towards me with a depth of sincerity and happiness in his face that people on entheogens, and in zen consciousness tend to have.  I was startled that through his face, i simultaneously saw the universe and a total void.  We talked for the rest of the walk, though I forgot the gist of it.  As we reached the cafe, i pointed out that after only about half an hour I was already higher than at any time in my life, and that we'd be soaring to uncharted heights.  The most acid i'd done prior to that was 6 blotter hits and he'd done no more than 4 or 5 at once.  P. changed dramatically from innocently open and loving life to stricken with terror. He complained a bit, but I talked him down somewhat. I didn't realize I had a harmonious 'flow' of well-being up to that point until P. disrupted it on the surface level like rain on a pond.  

I missed the cool night air as soon as I set foot in the cafe.  I shot a look at P. And he seemed a bit tense.  Ordering drinks was fascinating, above all in that I was acutely aware of all the undercurrents of feeling in the cashier and other customers in line.  I desperately wished their silly masks of civility, false confidence, and comfort would be abolished.  I walked with P. to the couch, hyper-sensitive to every sensory stimulus as newly shaven skin during sex.  We sat and talked for a while about the things we percieved from the place and its patrons.  People sat around us, pretending we didn't exist, and the jukebox started playing shitty 90's alternative - it all hit me like lemon juice in a cut. Of one mind, P. and I got up, and left.  we talked about how we'd never learned our lesson that city tripping sucks, and went to a park.  

As we walked to the park, my consciousness 'split'; more strongly than ever before.  The 'more real' and 'aware' part was not confined to my body- it spread out, and in dimensions i wasn't aware of. Every detail of every thing held infinity, and vice versa.  There was at once a unity to all, and a dichotomy of spirit and substance, almost as 2 sides of a coin.  The less aware essence of me was talking with P.'s less aware side about people we know, and the way to get there.  P. was becoming fearful, and I was ecstatic - we both felt 'something big' on its way in the near future.

We reached the park and lay in the grass on a slope for who knows how long. The usual time distortion I get on trips was stronger than ever.  Deep relaxation spread through me in waves as I looked up at the sky through leafless tree branches.  Orgasmic isn't quite the word for that feeling.  Physically I melted away, and my 'less aware consciousness' melted away too.  after that I percieved what I've only percieved a handful of times in my life (with and without drugs).  

Classifications of this transcendant reality can only vaguely be compared to those of mundane life.  Good and evil were irrelevant, there was only a greater good.  Color, sound, etc. were irrelevant as well, just raw perception without limits.  The words 'purpose', 'significance', and 'will' hint at what pervaded everything.  Everything was as it should be.
(Describing it like that feels like I just drew a bunch of stick figures and told you that's what the sistine chapel looks like.)

As I 'descended'/'coalesced' i realized P. was having a bad trip. The look on his face was unforgettable - 'the pits of hell' - was what it said.  He asked me to take him home and i did.  We walked back in silence.  My 'thought stream' was a sea, too vast and varied to remember.  Deep concern 4 P. was side by side with elation, and a noticeable absence of words from my thoughts.  It was the familiar trippy feeling of an absence of mental static, and being cleansed of the mental impurities that had built up over the course of my life.  

We got to P's place and both reveled in the feelings of security and safety he was exuding.  We talked about plato, buddhism, and psychology.  Every insight felt fresh and pure, as if opening new doors.  I told P. about what I saw in the park, or at least tried to, and we calmly shot the shit until dawn, and then crashed. 

Incidentally, i had the only 'visuals' i've ever had when I was in the park.  The trees danced and melted, and the sky knitted up over a shimmering whiteness as I was coming down.

I was reminded on this trip to: 
beware crowds of sober people
beware sensory overload
beware the bad trip, especially when you drop 10 hits ;)

and i learned why Lao Tse said:
'those who speak don't know and those who know don't speak'

Recently I had an experience with LSD that I will never be able to forget. It is the trip that all others will be compared to...the effects it has had on my view of reality are shattering, and I believe that, although it was a bit jarring at times, it was an invaluable learning experience..

First, a few thoughts on psychedelic drugs in general - I believe that everyone needs to experience a reality that is otherwise completely alien to the individual. There is absolutely no way to imagine the effects psychedelic drugs have on the brain without living through it. If we can exist in a completely different dimension for a few hours, we can objectively view 'normal' reality for the first time. It is freedom from the mundane, and it is a world where money, government, oppression, and all the pervasive aspects of the world can dissolve into the background completely and honestly. 

So now that I'm done preaching, I'll get into the experience.  Me and my friend were bored one night, and put 10 dollars down on a bottle of liquor before coming home, with the intention of getting pleasantly inebriated and laughing at the television.  Well, this changed when a certain friend showed up with a vial of LSD.  Interested in jumping down the psychedelic waterfall, we got our money back on the alcohol and bought a hit for each of us, which was dropped on our tongue.  We quickly drove home, wary of drug effects hitting us while I was driving, and started to buzz a little as we arrived at my house. The effects I had experienced many times before had hit my brain, and we spent the next 6 hours or so laughing like idiots, smoking cigarettes and generally having a good time just looking at the curtains and house plants gently swaying in wind that wasn't there.  About 7 hours into our trip, we figured the experience was pretty much over, and sat down to watch a movie.  We couldn't have been more mistaken.  At one instant, my friend was flashing the lights on and off, and I was laughing.  The next instant, all hell broke loose in my mind.  It was as if the switch that controls my perception of reality was yanked out of my brain.  It must have both hit us at the same time, because suddenly my friend wasn't smiling anymore...he had the look that an infant must have on his face the first time he experiences a thunderstorm -fear and wonder.  The conversation that took place at this moment will shed some light on our state of mind..

Me - Oh my god, I think I'm blacking out..
Friend - The light.. looks different.
Me - What happened?
Friend - I was turning the light on and now it looks different.
Me - Did we go somewhere?
Friend - I don't know...everything is different..

This kind of quiet mumbling continued for another two or three minutes, until we both sat down on the floor and faced each other solemnly.  We were both so incredibly dumbstruck at the feelings that were pervading our minds that we could do nothing but stare at each other with a stupid kind of disbelief.  I stretched my arms out and stated that my mind felt as big as the room.  I had the very tangible and frightening feeling of melting into the floor and up the wall, and I when I licked my lips, it felt like I was licking someone else's.  All of a sudden I got up and started to walk around the house, which was a chore. The walls were groaning and breathing with life, and it was difficult to recognize my family members or even myself in the pictures hanging on the wall. We wandered around my home of 19 years as if it were an alien landscape.  I sat down in a chair and attempted to turn the computer monitor on, which I could not.  The button was jumping from side to side so quickly that my finger couldn't find it fast enough. I looked at my arm, and it looked extremely distorted.

I could see red and blue and green lines pulsating up and down my arm in rhythm with everything else.  Eventually I did get the computer on and managed to play a song.  I laid on the floor and listened to the music, which seemed to be coming from all directions at once.  As I closed my eyes, I felt my body rise off of the floor, and patterns and colors assaulted me.  I ended up listening to an Eels song over and over again.. one of the lyrics was 'my skin is melting off, i'm mopping up the sweaty drops..' This drove me nuts, it was fascinating and real.. I felt like I was connected to the earth in a way that I've never been before, as if I was not an individual anymore, but as big as the universe itself, engulfing the room with my mind and body at the same time.  For a while I got frightened, I felt like a deer with a rifle pointed at it; helpless and alone in a different dimension. Time didn't exist, and it is difficult to let go of yourself in that way.

I went and laid down on my mother's bed, thinking it would be comforting.  I curled into a fetal position in the middle of the bed under the sheets, which was incredible. I could imagine what a baby must feel like in the womb. Within moments though, I had the very strong feeling that there were other beings in the room with me, entities about 3 feet tall making strange noises and surrounding the bed.  This was frightening and I got up and went into the other room.  I spent the next hour staring at the close rack with some pants hanging on it.  The clothes were all swaying back and forth with such intensity. It was startling, I never thought one drop of acid could have such a powerful effect.  My friend had laid down in my brother's room and was meditating quietly, and I did the same thing.  I don't remember the hours after I laid down, but when I came to, the major effects were gone.

The next day I could barely talk. I was simply shattered from the experience. As I slowly gained my strength over the course of the morning, I began to realize the blessing that I had experienced; I had a new respect for my life, just *being* had a new meaning for me. As of now, I am exhausted, but I feel good for getting this off of my chest. I haven't had any experiences with LSD after that night, I feel like I've been there and felt the true effects of the drug.  Future exploration is likely if I can find a good source, but where I live it is damn near impossible.

This was my second time trying acid and I must say it was not too much different than the first.  The first time i tried acid i bought what was supposed to be 'real strong acid' and it was 2 hits dropped on a sugar cube. Since it was my first time, i decided to have a sober sitter stay the night at my house.  I dropped the acid and i had high expectations of the trip.  About 30 minutes after dropping, I look in the mirror to see my pupils are as big as pennies, so I was like 'wow, im gonna trip balls'.  This however was not the case.  After about 2 hours, nothing seemed to happen at all, and i was slightly confused becuase my friend bought some from the same guy with me and he said that he tripped like crazy.  After 4 hours, i began to feel tired and i gave up and I knew that all i had bought was just something that made my pupils big.  I was dissapointed.

About a month later, some other friends of mine who get their acid from a completely different source asked me if I wanted to get some. They had gone on camping 'trips' numerous times and told me how much fun it was. I told them that last time i got acid that it was fake, and they reassured me that what they got was 'VERY REAL'.  So i bought 2 sugar cubes with one hit of acid dropped on each.  Since i had nothing to do after work on the sunday i bought them, i decided to trip when i got home from work.  I didnt have a sitter this time, and i was actually kind of skeptical becuase of the last time i got it. But they said it would work for sure.  I dropped one cube at about 10 PM.  I called a friend who talked to me till about 5 in the morning.  By 12 in the morning, nothing seemed to be happening (although my pupils were large), so i decided to wait a little while longer before i took the other one.  

About at 1:15 i dropped the other cube, knowing that it wouldnt work.  My pupils became a little larger than before, and then i thought maybe it would work.  My stomach started to feel a little wierd, and my friend on the phone told me it would work.  Well i stayed up till 5 in the morning and not a damn thing happened.  I was pissed because my friends said they took 2 cubes from the same batch and they tripped nuts.  Nothing happened again for me.  I will try acid again, i will probably keep trying it until i realize that I am either 1.) psychologically immune to it (i dont know how) or 2.) that Acid is real, it's just hard as hell to find some that works, or 3.) Acid isn't real, and I should just stick to smokin pot and looking for mushrooms.  If anyone else has this problem, please post it because i dont think i am alone here.

I dissolved a sugarcube with LSD in water with the intention of experimenting with very low doses during my regular work day. No clue about dose, strength, age, or provenance of the LSD - my former roommate had found some cubes in the back of our freezer when we moved out of our apartment and gave me some. I kept the water in a clear glass which I covered with plastic wrap and kept out of direct sunlight during the 8 days or so it lasted. I took sips from the glass on 4 or maybe 5 days, some of the days consecutively, some with several days in between. Who knows how much LSD it was, but Im wildly guessing that it was between 10 and 30 mics on any given day. I tried to make sure to keep the liquid under my tongue for at least 30 seconds before swallowing it.

My motivation for doing this was curiosity, and the desire to try LSD for its stimulant and anti-depressant effects, rather than its psychedelic effect. [I continue to be a champion of the low dose.] The idea came to me for two reasons. First, several of my friends/acquaintances had been taking daily low-doses [they estimate between 25 and 50 mics but who really knows] for antidepressant effects, for intervals of up to several weeks, with good results. Second, I am intrigued by early research with *daily* microdoses [10 mcg] of LSD for the alleviation of symptoms stemming from autism.

The effects were stimulating/antidepressive like caffeine but without the jitters. I have never tried amphetamine-like substances aside from Euphoria (4-methylaminorex), so I dont have them to compare to. On most of the days I got an alert, a brightening, within an hour, and the alert was pretty much as far as it went for about eight hours, except for one or two days where I must have gotten a slightly higher dose. On all the days, I was more energized and motivated to do stuff, with a long peak around T+4:00. My mood was generally lifted and quite happy and confident. My body overall felt really good, like a tiny all-over MDMA flush. I came to really like the reliably pleasant effects. In fact, I imagined how nice it would be to have these effects every day. Not that I want that to become a habit. 

The first day of the experiment, I was paying attention to whether I would get any anxiety feelings, which I have been susceptible to in the past. I got no such feelings [anxiety feels like lack of control, which isnt really that fun when Im trying to work]. I felt more focused and able to concentrate. 

The second day I tried my microdose, I was feeling sort of blue. After taking the sip, I walked around town for a bit, and felt very independent and self-assured. Then I entertained myself all alone, with no desire to really interact with anyone else. I felt autonomous and grounded. This could have been an effect of the drug, or it could have been a coincidence.

The subsequent days that I tried my sips, they were like little afterthoughts in the day. I didnt plan on them, I just realized some time during the day, oh look, theres my glass of dilute LSD, and I was psyched to take some, but with about as much concern as having a latte. The final day of my experiment, I still got an effect, which means whatever drug was left didnt suffer too much from a week of sitting out in room-temperature and ambient light.

On one of the days, I got muscle tension in my lower back, which is not where I generally hold tension. The tension faded once I got away from the computer, left the house, and moved around for a while. I did not notice any effects on my sleeping pattern or appetite.

It would be nice to continue this use of LSD, which fit nicely in my regularly scheduled life. I wonder what the long-term effects might be from doing daily microdosing, aside from the obvious problem of unreliable supply.

I've enjoyed taking a look through some of these accounts of 'Trips', the good, the bad and the ugly. I wonder if anyone else who's had a bad trip and read some of the other stories here has felt a loosening of the sphincter reading other people's nightmare episodes?! :)

It's been about eight years since I last took any form of hallucinogen , at this time I cannot say whether I ever will again.  I tend to have the opinion that whatever path you take in life, one way or another we all reach the same conclusion and our experience then takes us across the divide to places where we won't tell the living our tales.  Anyway, I digress.

Acid! The following account is an example of one very bad trip in around 30 good ones, but it's so far out there I thought I'd cover the bad stuff
before the good.

About ten years ago I bought my third trip from a guy in my home town Norwich (UK) It was a 'Strawberry' and I was told it had been double dipped. The guy had a reputation for selling good acid so I happily gave him my cash . My being in Norwich was just a social visit over a couple of days and catching up with friends. On the last day there I decided to drop the tab and use my friends house as 'Trip HQ' He knew what I was up to, he had gone to work and left me his keys to make myself at home.  I began to come up on the acid towards the lunch time. It was to be the first and last time I'd ever trip alone . Outside it was a glorious sunny day but I was happy enough in my temporary sanctuary to even think about going outside. The LSD rush started blazing up my spine and racing through my guts, I felt a little uneasy with it but had enough mind to allow myself to just go with it and wait until the rush plateaued. It did just that a little later , I'd decided to sit in the upstairs of the house and listen to music on the radio in a sunlit bedroom . I was having a wonderful time , watching floral Escher type patterns breathing over my skin , I enjoyed looking in the mirror looking at my grinning face with very distinct map contour patterns gently washing over my flesh . Its seemed like a great start eh ?

Well, I vaguely recall deciding to go downstairs again for some reason then the next thing I recall was awakening on the floor of the dining room alone. The first thing I noticed was that there were blowflies buzzing around a bowl of catfood on the kitchen floor (Which was in view) I remember feeling perplexed as to why both flies had two bright neon after images in red and blue . I sat up and tried to figure out why I was on the floor in the first place . Now its worth pointing out before I take you down my helter skelter that somehow because of my black out , I'd completely forgotten that I'd taken anything at all . Prior to tripping I'd also written myself a note of reassurance in case things got too weird. So, sitting up on the floor still, I found my note and tried to read it. Alas because I was acid addled the words made no sense to me . Instead they morphed like alien glyphs and danced around on the piece of paper. It was then that my last little link to sanity crumbled and I heard my voice utter the terrifying words 'I've gone mad!' I had a feeling that I had to be somewhere else which then got heightened by the digital watch I was wearing suddenly bleeping a time alarm at me but I had no idea why or what it meant .

So I left my sanctuary , I later found out that I left the back door wide open thus making the house entirely a burglar's free for all (Fortunately without that as a repercussion). I remember walking almost on auto pilot down a busy street heading towards town, I saw one of my old school teachers who also saw me, but the only thing I did was force a grin and keep on walking. I did indeed walk, not so much as a conscious effort or with any sense of intent, I felt utterly out of control.  I collided with
someone carrying their shopping-vaguely heard them cuss at me as I continued in my stride, I turned down a passageway between two houses and strolled though the backdoor of a house I'd once lived in, past the new inhabitant and out the front door. I walked into the city center from there - I still don't know how I survived crossing roads but I did. I strolled into a city cafe where my friend's son was working, he saw me and said hello, but in my acid addled state of autopilot I just walked past him into the main cafe and sat down, then I stood up and walked out of the cafe without uttering a word.

Other than being completely out to lunch on LSD at that time in the trip , I don't recall hallucinating, moreover I was more a puppet on a string guided by some subconscious walking mechanism which had its own design on where I should be, there was certainly no cognitive thinking to my actions. After the brief cafe episode of the trip, the situation just went from bad to worse.

Somehow I'd navigated myself through Norwich during the busy lunchtime shoppers and begun to head in the direction of the city's central park 'Chapelfield gardens'. As a child I'd always felt a sense of friendliness and comfort there. Now in my fried state the familiar comfort of this park had shifted to its polar opposite, I was now hallucinating on top of everything else. The people in the park were all walking around but my perception had begun to distort their heads and faces beyond any form of human recognition. If you could imagine for a moment being surrounded by people in a busy place where their heads had been removed and replaced by Squids and Octopus you might begin to accurately picture the scene confronting me in the park. 

Everyone had tentacles smothering their faces and dangling down their necks like fleshy snake beards, even the women and children were not exempt from this disfiguration. The octopoid heads were white in appearance and each person seemed to have baleful staring eyes where their ears should have been. Even in my state of auto pilot I felt nothing but sheer terror at the alien swarm of people walking around me .

My feet had obviously decided to make evasive maneuvers because I then found myself out of the park having crossed yet another treacherous main road and was now heading towards a multi storey apartment block. I recall that I got inside the building somehow and wandered in circles on one of the floors of the apartment block, I seemed stuck in a loop of wanting to get out, walking around a circle of short corridors and arriving at a janitors cupboard, I would open the door expecting to find an exit and be confronted by a dead end with cleaning products and brooms. I would repeat this several times like a fly that desperately flies in circles around a kitchen only to collide with the same window again and again. I don't remember how I finally broke the loop but I did.

The next thing that happened was the memory of walking around some side streets, into someones back garden via an alley way, I recall a middle aged woman looking a little afraid of me being in her yard and rushing into her house closing the door behind her.  I left the yard and I think I walked between two garages, the gap between them was tight, perhaps I tried to go through it anyway, In my mind I was a being trapped inside an ever tightening spiral that I relentlessly marched along. As the spiral tightened my body would begin to crush, if I were to continue down the spiral I would surely be crushed to my final atom...

I must have snapped out of that little loop of fractal thought mental torture, I was now adjacent to a main road in Norwich called 'Unthank road' I was in a front garden of another house, the inside of my mouth felt like plant matter, when I tried to scream, my tongue shot out as a mix of flesh and thorny rose stem. The situation was utterly hopeless, and getting ever worse with each lysergic eternal minute.  Over the other side of Unthank road from where I stood was a dental repair workshop, a discreet looking workplace that looked just as much part of the houses above it.  I recall that I walked into this workshop to the surprise
of the men who were working there, I think they said 'Hey, where do you think you're going' etc, but I was too far gone and on my way out again still under the guidance of this momentum and hidden agenda of the auto pilot within me.

The adjacent side street began the final demise of my terrifying trip, you'll have to indulge me in this part and go with the flow of reality and abstract woven together.  First off, like a lemming I walked across this side road, onto the pavement then promptly plummeted a good seven ft into someones basement flat, there had probably been a flight of steps leading down to this concrete pit but I didn't see them and wouldn't have known what to do with them if I had. I guess I clambered up to street level again and limped my way up this street which was a bit of a cul de sac. Part of my subconscious memory must have recalled that an ex girlfriend had lived at the end of the street. I found myself walking up to her old front door which was one of those aluminium framed, double glazed types. I recall my reflection looking somewhat like a Francis Bacon painting, a mixture of anguished flesh and black oils ripping like blood down my body .

I was falling in eternal darkness, like a fleshy sack of bricks. As I fell forever I would crash through intermittent panes of glass which would shatter and tear me in my never ending descent.  With the sound of breaking glass was the wavering crescendo of the word 'Mad' repeating in waves...mad, Mad, MAD,MAAAD, MAAAAAD, MAD, Mad, mad...over and over as I
plummeted, ripped and torn in darkness with splinters of glass falling beside me.

Back on the street a voice was saying 'There is a way out of this, there is a word, and if it all ever gets too much you just say
'_____________' and a door will open to allow you away from here '

Back on the street I had staggered a few more paces then fallen.  I was now a seven year old child lying on the pavement, my best friend's parents stood over me feeling concerned 'What happened', 'He's hit his head', 'Call an ambulance'. A disk shaped hole appeared above me with someones arm reaching down to me to try and pull me up into safety, I tried to reach the grasping hand but couldnt. Then the hole disappeared. 

I was staggering along the street again at the bottom of the cul de sac.
My gaze lifted to the sky and the sky's gaze fell upon me, each cloud was now a giant type of amoeba type organism, covered in dots which pulsed in colour like the skin of a cuttlefish, each giant amoeba had a giant blue human looking eye observing me.  I could hear voices taunting me, telling me I was stupid, telling me how thick I was for looking for the answers , telling me I had spastic consciousness. The amoebas seemed to be singing a never ending song which was something like this...

'I'm an umpsquamadic peel and if I ever know what I feel, then I know that I felt like this before and I always knew what I was timely for...' (Repeat into infinity with a chorus of about 1000 people !)

I briefly saw existence as a giant clock face of a billion dots between each second , the dots were ticking forward in a relentless advance like the movement of a second hand. Each dot was the equivalent of someone's lifetime. The internal monologue described that living and dying was part of this eternal chain, It showed me that there was a gap of nothing at the point which marked 12 on the clock face and that was a one second break from the never ending cycle of existence that any soul would have. Then the monologue started laughing at my dismay.

In reality, I briefly became conscious enough to recognize that I was stumbling through a small childrens play area at the base of the cul de sac. It's worth describing to you a little about the geography of where I was. Adjacent to the cul de sac is a small path which leads to about four flights of stone steps leading to a street below. This street is called 'Park lane'. If you go through the gap in the fence at the back of the children's play area there is a steep foliage ridden embankment that leads down to a flint gravel parking area at the rear of a Park lane hotel. Guess which route I took!

In reality I passed through the gap in the fence, failed to notice the dangerous drop below me then tumbled down the embankment onto the flint parking area. I was crawling on my hands and knees by this point.  A piece of flint had torn the palm of my hand making it look like a stigmata wound which was pretty appropriate to the following delusion...

I was in a place that looked like 'The sea of holes' from the Beatles' 'Yellow submarine' movie. This was a white void with an infinity of swarming black dots, I could hear air raid sirens and the sound of buzzing, In the sea of holes was a giant cross which had a festering bloody pile of guts and organs spread across it staining the wood crimson. The guts were smothered in wasps stinging the ruined flesh causing venomous pustules.  It was an image of impossible pain.  Then the monologue returned booming over the sirens and drone of the wasps 'This is Christ, he's still suffering for your sins, still paying the price...' More
laughter, then a fleeting moment of reality. I had crawled across Park lane and collapsed in the gutter on the other side of the road, my jacket was gone, there were cuts and grazes over my bare arms. A wasp had landed by my elbow and was making a snack for itself on one of my cuts.  I remember trying to brush it away and it stinging me as I did. 

Over the other side of the street I saw a woman pushing a pram and looking at me with concern but now I had returned to acid Hell again. My body was a
giant mass of green flesh punctured all over by cactus like thorns that had grown from within and broken my skin on the way out. I had no arms or legs, I was more like a mass of tendrils with an apple shaped mass at the top. My form was that of pain, nothing more and nothing less.

A brief flash of a police car pulling up beside me, someone getting out ...

I was pain , floating in the sea of holes, there were a billion holes, each one a passage leading to another identical ocean of swarming black dots. The monologue told me there was only one whole which lead away from here...

I was in a hospital, lying on a padded vinyl mattress with medics standing around me, I was human shape again. The doors of the room I was in swung open to reveal an idyllic country side scene of green hilly pastures, bathed in glorious sunlight and a friendly looking old Oak tree in the foreground view, if only I could crawl through those doors I would be safe, my soul saved.  But I couldn't move, the doors swung shut then opened again, now I could see a hospital corridor instead of the fields, someone was being pushed past on a stretcher trolley.

Back in the sea of holes it seemed that my gaze in any direction would erase the back dots in their masses, for the first time in this nightmare trip I felt a sense of conscious hope. I began to wipe swathes of dots by sweeping glances into the void around me...

'What have you taken ?'

I was gaining hope by the minute, stripping the black dots away , removing these taunting false exits...

'What have you taken?  Was it acid ?'

Surrounded by a self created white void of comfort I gazed at the final bunch of black dots and knew my release from Hell was merely held by these remaining few ...

'He's out of it still.'

I had gazed all but two of the black dots away, these two now had a bridge akin to a line seen in a dot to dot puzzle.  In my mind my voice returned as I stared at each dot, I heard my own internal voice yelling 'One Two, One, Two, One one, Two...' Then, the two dots looked like my own hands with cuffs around them. The black line bridge had become a visible
chain, the white void had faded to become a hospital room. I was in fact on my back on a hospital bed with my arms trapped beneath me, I was looking through my legs at my wrists grazed with the rubbing pressure of police hand cuffs around them.  

Then I yelled, 'Get these fucking hand cuffs off me !'

In the room with me were a male and female police officer from the Norfolk constabulary, they had obviously been the people who had lifted me from the Park lane gutter and taken me to hospital. The male officer obliged my demand and removed the cuffs. The woman police officer asked me stuff like my name, If I knew where I was, but the best I could muster was a brief
groan. They both looked a bit frustrated and left me in the room on the hospital bed alone. I was rapidly regaining my sense of self and conscious of reality. I recalled that I had indeed dropped acid sometime earlier, my Hospital surroundings and the amount of cuts and bruises I had were confirmation to me that whatever I'd done, It had seriously backfired big time!

I sat on the edge of the hospital bed, noted a number of missing Items I had recalled having on my person prior to all of this . I found my pumps in the bedside cabinet and put them on. Then I took my first deliberate steps across the room I was in. The bizarre nature of this entire episode had one final twist installed for me. I recall walking to the door of my single bed room and opening it, a few feet away from me were the two police officers facing each other having an intense conversation about what to do about me. They were so engrossed in their discussion that neither noticed as I came out of the room and begun walking down the hospital corridor. There was a window that stood from floor to ceiling, the type that pivots in the central vertical axis, so judging that I could fit through the gap, I squeezed through it.

There is little left to tell of this story, except to say my walk from the hospital to the train station was quite distressing, I was in a lot of pain . had stitches in my chin, my elbow and hand. My right forearm had swollen up purple making it look like Popeye's right hook.  I was still semi-hallucinating but very aware of how I'd nearly died and how I had a lot of explaining to do when I got home to my girlfriend. There were no legal repercussions for giving the police the slip , I had caught a train back home to a village in Suffolk which was not in the jurisdiction of the Norfolk constabulary, however they had contacted my father who was in Norfolk , so I had quite a bit of explaining to do for him too!

If anyone is interested in seeing some of the visuals I had during that hellish day, I have (The last time I looked) a website partly dedicated to the episode which can be found at geocities.com/hellclouds4, as well as an artist's page on Erowid.

In retrospect, it was the worst day of my entire life. It was the closest I can imagine to having full blown psychosis. I think it was nothing short of a miracle that I didn't end up over someones car bonnet or worse. Do I believe the monologues and symbols of that day?  I'm not entirely sure I do, I now understand that intense adrenalin bursts whilst hallucinating are responsible for dragging the mind into the abyss of fear and worst possible scenarios. I kind of feel that I would have a very bleak outlook for life and reality if I believed for a moment that anything I saw in that trip was true. I've had some other trips which were glorious and the polar opposite of that day (You will find more of my accounts of these here soon ). So I tend to agree with Aldous Huxley that Heaven and Hell are both valid states of consciousness. It all depends on where the person is at and how we navigate through the psychedelic state which determines which destination we arrive at. If anything puzzles me at all about that day, It would have to be the black out I experienced early in the trip, I suspect that had I not lost consciousness I would probably have not forgotten that I took the drug and therefore wouldn't have panicked myself into an internal Hell fractal.

Chair and I were at a barter faire in Eastern Washington, and we were enjoying the festive air of the place.  There were many people with booths full of goods to trade or sell set up along many straw-covered pathways.  People came from miles around to attend this fair gathering, and there was a lot to do.  So we set about obtaining some LSD.  It's not always easy to walk through a crowd of people not knowing if they're government agents or not, but we wandered through the late sun and located a man with an interesting shirt who offered liquid doses for $2 apiece.  We agreed, and decided that 5 drops would be a reasonable number for us each.  We knelt before him as though he were Queen Elizabeth and we were being knighted.  The drops that came from the little Sweet Breath bottle had a slight minty taste, but I'm sure our breath was sweeter for it.  We thanked and paid him.

We were walking along with a set of bamboo Unklungs, which is an Indonesian instrument.  It consists of a hanger, with eight separate and removable instruments, each a different note on the scale.  Each of the eight handheld pieces is basically a frame with two bamboo cylinders that vibrate and make a noise when shaken.  There is a Primus song that uses these instruments (I think - it sure as hell sounds like it, but I've never checked the liner notes to know for sure) and it's track 8 on Pork Soda, if you want to know what they sound like, regardless of whether that's what they use or not.  We found a vendor with several glass pieces, and we worked out a trade for a foot-and-a-half bong.  The bong was the nicest piece the vendor had, and it would have sold for more than a hundred dollars at a head shop.  At the barter faire, it would have cost $50 to $70. The bong was predominantly blue, marbled through with green and orange and white.  It's absolutely beautiful, and thicker than any other bong I've seen.  It's still intact after being battered countless times, a year later.

We had also obtained several types of beautiful buds (Mango, Pez, G-13, Smiley, Purple Star, and some White Russian we'd brought along) and we decided to go back to our tent and take some icy bong hits out of our new bong. We had brought a cooler full of ice for just this purpose.  Our tent was set up on top of a hill, overlooking the entire barter faire in all its glory.  The place was full of people - it looked like a temporary city had been erected in the middle of a desert.  There was a constant stream of incoming cars.  There were drums beating in the distance, and the happy cries of the delighted participants of the faire.

We sat at the edge of our tent, taking bong hits and trying to decide which of our six varieties of weed we liked the best.  We watched the people from our hill, and sat and talked until we felt the acid coming on.  The body high was apparent rather soon, and it was very good.  The euphoria intensified gradually but surely, and we decided to descend back into the strange land of the people.

We wandered through the aisles aimlessly, marveling at all the people.  The visuals began to kick in, and we were laughing and holding each other.  Many of the people stared, but they were not worried.  There were shops with huge shelves of multi-colored candles, and obviously those were interesting to look at.  We could smell the world, and all the strange herbs and foods.  As dusk slowly rolled in, we saw many fire circles being formed.  There would be a circle of hay bales and a fire in the middle.  A lot of smoking went on in these circles, as we soon learned.

We sat at one fire circle in front of a booth where energy drinks were sold.  There was a giant tye-dyed mushroom tapestry stretched out above the shop, which is why we chose it out of all the other fire circles.  We sat down, marveling at the complexity of the hay bales, when the people already sitting there asked the circle if anyone had a pipe.  We happily procured a lovely glass piece, and to our amazement it was loaded with an amount of weed that it was never designed to hold.  The pipe was passed around a few times, and then reloaded to the same bountiful level.  The circle had broken up a bit, and after two hits, our happy pipe-loaders decided to go strolling, leaving us with this heaping bowl.  We smoked it, and then new people came to sit.  Seeing us with a smoking pipe, they offered to load some.  The fire was warm, and we were giggly and happy to the point of being stupefied.  There was no way to express the all-encompassing sense of happiness, giddiness, joy of life and sight and sound and creation.  These people with their generous weed-sharing ways were just small examples of the glory and bounty of this barter faire.  We were all one, all happy and all sharing in the beauty and warmth of the communal fire.

Chair and I decided to explore this Nirvana further, and reluctantly left the circle of never-ending smoke.  It was soon forgotten, for the acid was triggering such euphoria and intense happiness that nothing could be regretted.  We gazed in astonishment at the people, each face a shifting psyche wanting to connect to us.  There were women with bells, and I excitedly pointed these out to Chair.  It was nightfall, and we ended up at the central fire, the massive, drum-surrounded heart of the barter faire.  The drums took our breath away - there was a community of drummers harmonizing and any one of the drummers could take the beat to a new level.  There had to be at least thirty drums going at once.  The people were dancing and laughing and blissfully gliding through each other.

On our way back through, we stopped to catch the end of two fire-dancing women, and then the belly dancers came out.  They were beautiful, seductively instructing us in just how a body could flow like water, or take on a serpentine elegance of writhing and weaving and breathing together.  After that ended, we found a giant swing set in a less populated part of the whole affair, and began swinging and kicking our legs.  When we looked up at the stars, it was insane.  The stars - the whole sky - looked as though it were being stirred with an invisible spoon, like cookie dough and the stars were the chocolate chips.  But it was far more spectacular than that - the colors were so vibrant, and the stars seemed to wrap and undulate through each other as they swirled and sashayed through the deep blue night.  It was incredible.  The air even tasted better - we were so alive, all of our senses turned on to 'Divine Reception.'

We made it up to our tent, although unfortunately, I thought the ground below was wriggling with rattle snakes.  Chair fortunately was not deluded by the ground, and we successfully planted ourselves in front of our tent again.  This time the lights were all turned on, as it was dark, and that was a whole new dimension, seeing the lights from above.  The stream of cars was still snaking through the hills, and the tent city of desert dwellers was swelling.  I zeroed in on a particular truck with a little camper, and watched it bumping along.  When the truck hit a particularly large bump, the back end dipped down, and the corner of it spiraled down and swirled to mix with the dirt.  I explained this to Chair, who laughed.  

The whole place was vibrating and throbbing, and howls went up from around the camp.  I howled back, eliciting more howls in return.  This went on for a long time, throughout the night.  Chair and I went into the tent and laid together.  When I touched his hair, my fingers came away dripping with the rich darkness.  I could dip my finger into the puddle of his hair and pull it away, stretching long pieces of it out like taffy, even though I wasn't actually holding his hair.  I got an image of hundreds of eyes, and purple shafts of light shot out of the pupils of each in unison, shortly before a charcoal bullet was released from the same place.  Chair was lying right next to me, and one of his eyes kept disappearing.  His face was melting into the pillow, so I tried to keep his head up, but every time he put it back down, it would start melding with the pillow.

Our conversation was about the true freedom we all need, and this, for just this short while, was that freedom.  In our glorious, infatuated, excessive bliss, we began singing 'Get Up, Stand Up' by Bob Marley, emphasizing 'So now you see the light...' for we'd never felt so unrestricted or truly happy.

The next day, someone gave us an eighth of mushrooms.  The man camping next to us came over for a while to talk, and discovering that we'd purchased four hits of blue Felix paper acid, he offered to dose us from his vial.  We told him we were saving it for when we got home, so he put a total of twelve drops on some chips which we sealed up.  Then a man camped on a slope near our hill informed us that he'd been robbed, and since he was so upset, he wanted to smoke.  In return, he gave us a six-foot bong.  There were also some sugar cubes scattered on the ground from the bastard thieves' raid, and he told us that half of the cubes had been dosed and half had not.  He had been picking them up and eating them, and was quite fucked up.  He referred to the bong he gave us as a ten-foot bong, and had gotten scabs all over his face from who knows what.  He was barely coherent, but he enjoyed smoking, and it calmed him down.

Later, before we left, another nearby camper smoked us out heavily and we traded a small bud of White Russian for a luscious, fresh, glittering green bud of Pez (that's where we'd gotten the Pez from earlier, too.)  The bud he gave us was easily four times as big as the one we gave him.  Everyone there was so generous, so wonderful - the experience was the single most happy event of my life (and Chair's) - until we took the chips that had been dosed when we were back at home.

LSD (2) : Festival / Lg. Crowd (24), Glowing Experiences (4), General (1)




 




DOSE:
1 hit
sublingual
LSD
(blotter / tab)





BODY WEIGHT:
135 lb




Intro:

A few weeks ago my GF (well call her Summer) and I (well call me Valk) did our first trip on LSD, taking 150ug. Experience was amazing for us. Visuals, mental expansion, good conversations, everything we hoped for our first time but it left us a bit hungry to go higher, expand our minds further, to see *more*. So with that in mind we decided to drop 250ug in an incremental increase of what we did our first time. And oh boy. It was a ride. Not sure if the dosage was higher than we were told or if the effects going from 150ug and 250ug are just that much more pronounced but wow. Visuals everywhere of all kinds, some ego-death like experiences reminiscent of losing a sense of self and what reality is (your place in the world, where you begin and end, losing a sense of perspective in thought, thinking from a third person view and etc), thought loops, synesthesia, moments of overwhelming euphoria, love, tears, fear, and also some panic about safety and hurting oneself (not suicidal, but just thoughts of possible injury while tripping). Was an experience. Trip lasted in total, from taking the tabs to getting in bed trying to sleep, about 12-13 hours. Trip lasted in total, from taking the tabs to getting in bed trying to sleep, about 12-13 hours. Also this is mostly written from my perspective, but at times Summer adds her thoughts. Enjoy!

The Trip:

So after showering, cleaning myself up, and putting on some clothes I had put out for tripping, Summer and I took one tab at around 8:20PM, supposedly 250ug each. Putting them under our tongue we left them there for around 5 minutes or so before swallowing them with a little bit of water. After that we chilled, talked about random stuff and what we expected to happen, ate some food, set up our VR headsets in advance to make it easy in case we wanted to get on, and waited for the effects to start.

Summer Thoughts: "The thing I always notice during the come-up is some stomach discomfort. It feels kinda like negative G forces like when youre falling on a roller coaster or suddenly cresting a hill while driving. There is also a decent amount of jaw pressure like someone is grabbing the sides of your mouth and squeezing. These feelings slowly fade as you approach the peak, and completely disappear once you hit it."

As happened in our last trip, the effects took about an hour to really get rolling/started but once they did they were very apparent. Laying on the floor together looking at the ceiling which has a soffit running down the middle, and seeing it get wavy and pulse slowly, I knew we were well on our way. Throwing on a YouTube playlist with good music/visuals, we laid around enjoying ourselves on the floor or the couch talking about stuff and just enjoying the sights as they started to manifest.

After awhile, and due to me pretty much drinking water the whole time (being on acid Ive discovered gives me a need to drink a lot), we decided to venture out of the computer room and towards the bathroom. Going to the bathroom and leaving the safety of the office/computer room is always a bit of a production for us when were tripping and we pretty much always do it together when we drop, as being apart seems to on occasion send Summer (or me possibly) into a bad space if we dont have each other there as a rock to lean on. At this point we were definitely on the come-up but not quite peaking yet. Pretty good amount of visuals, some audio distortion, and we definitely were getting into a mental head space together. After a thankfully uneventful trip to the bathroom, not counting the bug we saw on the wall haha, we were back in the office just chilling and watching our trip playlist on the 4k flat screen TV. 

What Ive found amazing about acid is just how much color it can add to usually black and white only images/videos. Theres this amazing animation on YT that is black and white only but combine it with acid and it feels as if there is color everywhere in it. Like rainbow effects in every cell, every frame. Kind of like what you see looking through a prism or what it projects onto a wall. That combined with the jaw dropping soundtrack it makes for an amazing video to trip to. I ended up getting on my knees on the floor with my feet tucked beneath me, allowing all my focus to go into the video. It becomes a surreal experience, my entire world, my entire existence becomes this animation. Its an amazing thing to feel and is hyper powerful. Also watched an Alan Watts music video which is also absolutely jaw dropping. They both are great videos to come-up on as the effects are hitting me. The last video has actually made me cry it felt so emotional in the moment. As do other videos on this drug, it boosts my emotions soooo much.

Summer Thoughts: "The difference between 150ug and 250ug when it came to visuals and sounds was considerable. 150 had patterns manifest on surfaces and behind closed eyes, but 250 felt like visuals were overlaying your entire vision. Everywhere I looked, patterns and rainbow swirls took over, and the more I let my vision space out, the more intense it got. Meanwhile, sound was getting very distorted. Sometimes it felt like sounds were coming out of boxes, or that things were stuttering. We could feel the nature of sound change if we held a cup close to our ears. At one point, music didnt even sound like music anymore as it was so choppy, pitch shifted, warbley, and just outright chaotic. Couple this with synesthesia and suddenly I was seeing sounds, feeling smells, hearing visuals all while my brain was highly influenced by any change in mood or emotion. Every sensory input was felt throughout all of my senses and it was such a profound experience. Its one of those things you truly need to experience to understand."

For awhile longer we watched more videos, talked, looked at the walls, Summer poured me some Pepsi and paused for a second mid-pour (for her she said that pause felt like minutes), I had a moment where I was unsure where my body ended and where it began, and we just enjoyed everything. After that there was another trip to the bathroom. At this point we were just about to reach the peak and were really beginning to experience the visuals as they were becoming very noticeable even without having to focus on any one thing. For example the wall in the front bathroom of our condo is so good for this drug lol. It breathes, and swirls, and changes shape all around you; it seems as if the bathroom itself seems to breath. Also note these bathroom trips probably happened every hour from now until the end of the trip, so Ill stop mentioning them. But realize this regularness, bathroom breaks every hour, maybe contributed to some of the mental looping we found ourselves in later. A reality that repeats in regular ways, like going to the bathroom every hour, can get me thinking in loops. Sadly though we did one bad thing when we went to the bathroom this time, we left the door open to the office when we were gone and our cat JoJo managed to get inside without us realizing.

As we got back into the room, we shut the door and I started to look at some of the art in the room. Was at this point I started to believe Id peaked as the visuals were becoming much, much more insane compared to our last trip. The art and posters were literally exploding for me, faces breaking apart, morphing and pulsing as they grew smaller and larger, things sliding apart, pieces of the drawings appeared 3D and seemed to come out of the posters/paintings, rainbows and halos around what seemed to be everything, and etc. Was an amazingly beautiful view for me. Sounds as if it would be scary to see these things happen but in the moment for me, it was just a sense of omg this is fucking awesome lol. 

It was soon after this we finally realized the cat was in-fact in the room with us. JoJo is a great cat but he can be hella stubborn sometimes and hard to get out of a room. And as it was the middle of the night, as cats do, he can get into this mood and start acting restless and crazy. Now when youre tripping balls and youre around a kitty that can be aggressive sometimes and/or extra playful/stubborn, that can lead to bad thoughts which at this point in your trip nearing and/or at the peak, can have drastic ramifications for your state of mind. This is what happened to Summer.

I was on the floor trying to coax Jojo out from beneath the couch-side table in the corner and she was on the edge of the couch by the table. After a few seconds no luck, Summer gets up to go across the room to the desk to get the laser pointer (always a good way to get a cat to go where you want) and as shes getting up Summer has this acid induced vision/hallucination of Jojo leaping at her and attacking her that then set her off in a really bad way. Was like flipping a switch. I was distracted with the cat, but as she came back with the laser point I look up at her and see her face. Her eyes have this look of absolute terrified panic, like... the look of incredible fear as if she has just seen a demon or some other mind meltingly terror inducing entity. Its hard to describe but it immediately freaked me out and she begins to frantically cling to me telling me to never let go, to please, please, please, not let go of her. I grabbed her tightly, my arms around her, telling her over and over Im not going anywhere, that I wont ever let go as long as she wants, reminding her that I love her and that shes safe with me. I made sure she was safe and somewhat calmed down and got the cat out of the room.

Summer Thoughts: "This is when everything started going downhill for me. When the cat was acting weird, it started unnerving me as it always does when Im tripping, but this time it went a little further. Valk tells me Jojo didnt actually do anything hostile, but my fragile sense of reality led to me seeing Jojo come at me like he was literally trying to kill me. My brain was so impressionable, emotional, and easily influenced in that moment that it freaked me the fuck out. I blacked out. Its like when you hear of people getting so angry that they black out and beat the fuck out of someone and finally come to minutes later wondering what happened. Thats how it was for me, but instead of attacking the cat, I was apparently just frantically trying to get him out of the room. What brought me back was Valk holding me telling me to come back and that everything was okay. When I realized that I had lost control of myself, this sent me into a negative thought loop for hours. I was so terrified that I was going to lose control again and hurt myself somehow, and I just couldnt get over it."

Was at this point we started rolling hard, riding that wave at the peak, riding the crest of the wave and surfing down the steep cliff of its face. I was truly realizing now that this trip definitely is a magnitude more powerful experience than our previous time when we did 150ug. The next handful of hours were a blur but Ill try to hit some of the things I remember. 

Experiencing mental loops where you find yourself looping back to the same thoughts as if youre in a cage of your own making/mind, unable to break out. Conscious of the fact youre looping mentally but unable to stop these thoughts. I wrote in our journal at one point that it's a feeling of helplessness. Stuck in your mind, unable to stop looping. These loops arent always terrifying or bad, but you are unable at times to end the cycle, making you feel helpless, unable to control your own mind.

For example, Summer was experiencing a loop that she got stuck on for a bunch of our peak, whether she was really tripping or not, was this reality or not, was she real or not, and etc. Having to remind herself that shes just in our condo, in our office, doing acid with me and that it would eventually end. She would know this and understand it but would then have herself loop back to questioning what is happening, if she is real, if this is real, entirely forgetting again that she is just laying on the floor of our office on the carpet or sitting on the couch with me. An existential crisis. And looping like that again and again and again and again. And the thing is, and I can confirm this from my own experiences, she was at times aware she was in a loop but unable to escape. Its like being pulled along, almost as if something is forcing you to experience these thoughts over and over again. Your whole world is often time condensed down to this thought, you almost lose track of your surroundings and are consumed inside your head, even if you have your eyes open.

Summer Thoughts: "So, Valk summed this stage up for me pretty well. The majority of my thought loops at this point were along the lines of What if I never stop tripping and Im stuck in this helpless state forever? and Does the sober existence I keep trying to reassure myself of actually exist, or is this all something I am making up in the moment? Does the sober existence I keep trying to reassure myself of actually exist, or is this all something I am making up in the moment? I was almost certain, for what seemed like an eternity, that Summer did not exist and never has. I completely lost touch with myself, and had begun talking about myself in third person. I never felt like anyone else, but I certainly didnt feel like myself either. I remember thinking over and over that I just want this to end. It was miserable."

Loops like this can take on a life of their own too, as you seem to almost descend into them. Further and further down into you mind or into the idea youre looping back to. I mentioned to Summer at the time that it was like going down a sinkhole, a sinkhole with paths that wind down around the walls of the hole, going around and around down and down further and further. But what can happen is sometimes you can trip and fall and instead of winding around the wall and walking the path, you fall headlong down into the pit. Reaching places you arent mentally prepared for as you didnt take the path down but fell headlong towards the bottom, giving you a burst of emotion or a burst of thought that can be too powerful for you to handle causing you to react very powerfully to. Either in a good or bad way.

One thing that happened to me during this point in the trip is I was having a hard time keeping myself from tempting fate in the sense that I wanted to purposely fall down that previously mentioned sinkhole, or something like that, and see where it would lead me. Like I wanted to go out into the dark of the living room with the lights off, me tripping BALLS, and see what I saw: both mentally and visually. Let my mind free, let it take me wherever it wanted, and letting my brain manifest whatever it wanted me to see/hear/smell/touch. 

At some point, while Summer and I were laying on the carpet together again, I told Summer of this and she began clinging to me again begging me not to go out there with a lil bit of panic in her voice. (She later said she thought I meant like outside the condo, which I can understand.) Though even if she had known at the time that I only meant the living room, just the dark and shadows would have probably been a big no-no for her.

That thought consumed me for awhile and I got stuck wondering if I really did want to go out there and explore the deeper parts of my psyche or not, and for what reason. It felt like the person that was me was trying to actively fight from letting that happen. I kept telling myself, or kept telling the entity that was me, that on a rational level I didnt want to do that because Summer was going to need me and I couldnt ignore her to explore myself. But then I began thinking was that just my subconscious trying to give me a reason not to do it, it saying do not do that youll regret it, in a way I would be able to understand and likely agree to. And the thing is that there were parts of this thought process that felt like it wasnt me thinking it but as if I was thinking of myself in the third-person.Thinking outside of myself.  Not me thinking it but the entity known as Valkeir, if that entity even was a thing at that point for me. Eventually after looping through this a bit I came to the conclusion that it was probably good Summer was there to keep me from doing it, regardless of the reason, just because going into a dark room with shadows, with some of the thoughts that were rattling around in my brain, and being by myself, may have been a recipe for disaster and she kept me from that. Kept me from falling into a possible pit of something through her need for my presence.

A good summary for this part of the trip, at the peak, is that it was somewhat like a lucid waking dream it was somewhat like a lucid waking dream. You are awake, but at the same time you feel as if you are dreaming. This awareness is counter-intuitive because even though you feel like you are dreaming, you arent in control at the same time. Very similar to being in an actual dream and realizing you are dreaming but unable to wake up from it. Also just like in a dream your situation, your mood, your emotions can change on a dime. Things/visuals/sounds can be mentally indistinct, but at the same time vivid. Your entire world can constrict to your body, your mind, your partner, a video, your leggings as the patterns swirl, etc. There is nothing else. This is your world now. 

Also a reminder, this entire time the visuals were literally everywhere still, they went on for hours and hours. At times youd feel the need to close your eyes to give them a rest as its exhausting, your eyes feel tired from all the stimulus, but there is no rest. Even with your eyes closed you see colors, and shapes, and fractal patterns dancing in the darkness of your eyelids. So out of breath from seeing things, is how we put it. You feel exhausted mentally, physically, and emotionally from such an experience.

After maybe an hour or two longer, we were beginning to come down from the big peak and starting to go down the backside. The subsequent peaks getting less and less intense. During this phase it felt as if we were gaining a sense of perspective back. For example while at the peak it felt like we were losing a sense of perspective or a sense of self, and coming down from that huge peak were slowly gaining perspective back, settling back into a sense of I or me rather than him/her or even more indistinct pronouns (if youre even using pronouns). We both were able to get our brains back in a lil bit of order again, at least to the point where we both agreed there were no more existential crises that were going to happen or intense hallucinations and ended up getting intimate and it ended up being really really fun! Wasnt able to quite cum this time, as its still really hard to stay focused long enough, my brain was still going a million miles a minute and every single stimulus was a possible distraction from what my partner was doing. But just gotta say Summer has a very very talented tongue and my sense of feeling her touch and tongue was exquisite. A++++ for effort, would have sex on the floor again.

At some point, towards the last maybe ⅓ of the trip we ended up watching Dean Deacon's "When I Was Done Dying". And I just started crying with tears running down my face during it, it summed up so much of what we had experienced, experiences that Ive really only touched the surface of in this trip report. Sooo much more happened that I havent even mentioned. Tripping is an experience that lasts for hours and hours, and hours. For us, easily 8-12 hours of real time, and in the trip those 8-12 hours can feel like a lifetime, multiple lifetimes, an endless sequence of eternities. I could fill up another 6 pages with our experiences, but its so hard to put into words adequately, especially now two days later, what we went through that night and early morning. But in this video they do it beautifully. Soooo many scenes in the video hit REALLY REALLY hard and are sooo fitting.

Finally as the trip began to mellow out and exhaustion began to overwhelm us after everything we experienced, we ended up just chilling for awhile, watching anime, listening to music with our Subpac, messaging friends on discord and etc. Just trying to unwind and decompress a little bit. Visuals were still there but less apparent, noticeable but no longer overwhelming. Eventually we ended up going to the bedroom, got in bed together, held each other and finished our trip together, finally falling asleep.

This describes one of my last experiences with LSD. Before this experience I had taken LSD maybe 20 times and mushrooms less than 10 times. I also had prior experiences with marijuana, inhalents, alcohol, and nicotine but I was not a regular user of any of these. It had been about 5 years since my previous experience with hallucinogens. The intervals between LSD experiences had grown longer with time The intervals between LSD experiences had grown longer with time, and the doses had grown larger too, in an effort to somehow test myself and touch back on something very wonderful that I'd once experienced on LSD. I was not taking any prescription medication; although, I probably would have been a good candidate for Prozac at that time and was what you might call depressed.

I was spending my birthday alone. I recall it was going to be the world premier of Madonna's 'Erotica' video on MTV. I was at a place in my life where I very much wanted to be successful at something, but I didn't think I was accomplishing much. I can see now that I was pulled in too many directions by my naive ideas of 'success' or 'doing right.' I was in graduate school, nearing completion of a PhD in a subject I wasn't much interested in, and I was feeling very sorry for myself. I was lost and trying to get found, either by finding my self or finding my non-self. I was a Buddhist and practicing meditation and had a pretty good vocabulary to describe my experience.

I had bought some LSD from a friend who assured me it was very good and strong. I had really quite forgotten what the actual experience of acid was like, and I wanted to get an unambiguous dose, so I decided to take all 4 hits at once. It was early evening (8pm), my housemates had already come home and gone out for the night, so I took four hits under my tongue and swallowed the paper when I felt myself starting to get altered. As the buzz increased, it was like, 'Oh yes, I remember this. Hello. This is really it.'

I was laying on the couch and watching TV and getting quite high. I hung on as long as I could stand to watch (waiting for the Madonna video), but the faces on TV kept flashing to weird and sinister forms the faces on TV kept flashing to weird and sinister forms. Of course I kept telling myself that it was all my projection, just the inner part of my mind manifesting, and, yes, it was unpleasant. I did some stretches and deep breathing to try to relax. I prayed to the drug and my mind to please let this be a learning experience. And please let me not hurt anyone.

By this time I was really getting overwhelmed by the visuals and had to turn off the TV and reduce the stimulation. Madonna's video came on and I couldn't understand it, but it had some powerful images and I liked the music. I was giving myself worrying thoughts. How would I know if I did something to hurt myself? What would prevent me from drinking poison or stabbing myself or mistaking a housemate for an evil being and killing them, etc., etc., etc., ad nauseum into the most extruciating loops of yes/no, 'who said that, 'who said that?'.'

Somehow, of course, there is a part of the mind in all this that is still just observing. Even as the panic was intensifying, there is something which is capable of noticing things, and which is capable of directing action. As I noticed this, I somehow formed the thought that, 'Yes, you might do something to hurt yourself or others. But if you notice something that doesn't seem right, just slow down a little and consider changing course.' This was not a complete relief from the looping thoughts or fantasies, but it did provide a little fresh air. Even if I had no confidence or was lost in confusion, I could just notice things as best as I could, and just try to do the reasonable thing.

This helped a lot, and it inspired me to call a friend. I don't think I outright asked for help, but she spoke to me very plainly, asking what was going on. I explained I had taken the acid her friends had sold me and I was very confused and scared and ... But suddenly, the most interesting thing happened. As I tried to explain what was happening, I tried to find a center or a problem or a locus of my experience, and I could not find it at all. It was as if a great space had just become apparent. I still felt quite high, but I had to conclude that absolutely nothing weird was happening. I had taken this drug, and, moments ago, I had been completely delirious, but now it seemed as if there was nothing but a kind of dumbfounded responsiveness. It was all happening and yet nothing was happening. It was all happening and yet nothing was happening. 

I'm not sure how to explain this part, but somehow the trip transitioned. It was about 11pm, and I recall not knowing what to do with myself, so I called up the girls who had sold me the acid. They were two very cute lesbians, possibly bisexual, and they invited me over to their apartment to hang out. Still feeling very high, and now somewhat sexually excited, I got myself together enough to walk over to their place. The evening air was cool and refreshing, and the walk of 1.5 to 2 miles was very grounding.

When I got there, my mind was somewhat racing, but it was still possible to connect in a good-natured way. I feel somewhat shy and awkward, but it seems always possible to get along with a little humor and honesty. They had another fellow visiting who showed us the scars on his abdomen where he had been nearly severed in a motorcycle accident when he was pinned between a semi and a car. Wow. The girls and he had been drinking and had snorted a little speed. We just hung out watching music videos and talking. The other chap left around 3 or 4am, and I stayed until dawn. I had some unrequited love-type feelings for one of the girls, who was very attractive, but it seemed to be okay to just experience that lustful feeling without trying to particularly act on it. I finally walked home as the sun was coming up and enjoyed the sunrise and feeling of activity starting to pick up in the small town.

LSD is really great. But you never know what will come of it. There is always a journey involved, usually with some struggles, fear, and paranoia. Seeming truths arise and pass away. It may be possible to hold them for a while, but in the end you are holding to something different than the truth that once was. The psychedelic and entheogenic qualities of the drug seem to allow the mind to compress and expand experience without as many walls or rules as usual. It is interesting how there are consistent patterns to one's experience, though. The senses and the habits of personality, emotion, and cognition do flex and bend, but there is regularity and repetition. Sometimes it is happy, sometimes sad; LSD is a great potentiator. This experience was a culmination of many acid experiences. Yes, it is everything; yes, it is nothing. The journey continues.

It was late April, and my friend (let's call him E) had the house to himself while his dad was in Mexico. The two of us had been strengthening our friendship through weed, and frequently talked about engaging in psychedelic experiences. He told me he had a plug nearby where he could buy 350 microgram tabs for cheap. I was ecstatic, of course, as I had only previously taken a small dose of 75 micrograms ( the results were significant, but nothing to write home about necessarily).

Him and I quickly planned to set up a trip-day and everything leading up to the day went smoothly. The morning of, I kept track of my heart rate on my samsung galaxy watch and made sure to keep it low enough to maintain a peaceful state of mind. Before driving down to where E lives, I spent the afternoon with my other friend, whom I nervously ate chinese food with. The stress and anticipation for the trip made it difficult to eat, and so I took it with me. Im not entirely certain of what happened leading up to getting the tabs, but E and I were ready to go at around 4:40 PM that afternoon after having driven down a few hours earlier.

Before me lay the 350 microgram aqua-green square of infinite wonder. I was spooked, but hyped nonetheless. I kept telling E that this was almost 5 times the dose that I had originally taken a few months earlier. He suggested I cut the tab in half since I had my doubts, but I pushed through anyways. At 5:00, we had both placed the tabs on our tongues and I defected to the other room to meditate and clear my head while the acid slowly seeped into me. As soon as I felt the tab completely dissolve, I went back into the main living room and tried my best to set the mood and relax with E. Part of this was turning on Drive Home, by Steven Wilson on the Youtube TV---a really beautiful and emotional song that is close to my heart. We discussed that we ought to have our own tether that would anchor us to reality if things were to go completely sideways. We discussed that we ought to have our own tether that would anchor us to reality if things were to go completely sideways. Mine was the aforementioned watch, Es---his special ring.

It wasnt until about 20 minutes in did I notice some changes. My face turned flushed and red, I started feeling really hot. Soon after, the first initial impact hit me like a ton of bricks. Immediately I started to become a bit hysterical. This wasnt I expected at all,'' was probably what I was thinking. My extremities began to turn numb and tingly, like I had just slept on them for a few hours after a nap. I tore off my shirt and guzzled down all the water I could. It took a little bit longer for him to get there, but E started sharing similar experiences. Every wave of tingling energy made me feel like I was right on the edge of losing consciousness. In fact, it was the same feeling I felt right before passing out and having a seizure in the ER---only extended indefinitely. I tried turning on a more calming song, but its normally gorgeous and soothing harmonies turned sour and awful. I was emotionally distressed by this and started to grow more hysterical.

Everything that happened around this point in the story is very difficult for me to keep track of; and I only have a rough idea of the context of some of the experiences I plan to write about. However, the general cloud of hysteria grew larger and E and I turned on survival mode.

It became clear quickly that neither of us could handle nor comprehend what was happening. The environment around me took a life on its own. We sat on the couch together, hand in hand, exclaiming in our own shared hysteria. It felt like we were riding on the same rollercoaster, our trips had synced up. Whatever it was that we experienced came in waves. E would tighten his grip on my hand and say Hold on...Im peaking a few times; which of course caused me to tumble down the rabbit hole even further. Proportions of the room, distances between walls and the sizes and shapes of objects around me dissolved into mere suggestions of their nature; the most debilitating effect overall was the struggle to maintain spatial awareness throughout the house.

Everything that made up my field of view became a wash of bright colors and indistinguishable textures. However, the more I looked at a specific object, the clearer it became. As these visuals settled in to both my mind and Es, we began to desperately hold onto reality. The two of us walked throughout the house, reciting facts about our lives that we both knew absolutely to be true. I ended up completely glued to the watch. The blue watch face on the screen bulged and shifted and made it difficult to read time. It was around 8:30 pm or so when I realized I was counting and announcing every minute to E that went by. At this point I was panicking because I knew I was experiencing a bad trip. I told E that we needed someone else to tripsit us. He agreed, and I messaged my other best friend (lets call him B) with plenty of difficulty. The keys seemed to be in a different position on my phones screen every time I looked at it, and my messages were short and nondescript. Luckily, B made it about 20 minutes later.

B took mine and Es experience to be rather funny. He approached the situation calmly, even making the observation that we had made the entire downstairs a mess. Bs presence put me at ease very quickly, and eventually the acid winded slowly down to just a good fuzzy feeling at around 11:00 pm. The three of us wrapped up the night with a fat blunt and some good music. However, this would only be the beginning of the comedown that would last until late in the afternoon the next day. I got zero sleep that night. Theres something about acid that keeps my mind racing at a hundred miles per hour. I felt deathly exhausted, like my entire body and consciousness was hurled through a jet engine, but I didnt once doze off. My legs felt stiff and sore, as did my jaw and neck, like they had been clenched for a really long time. The next morning, B had come over again. He was selling wax, and E and I bought a few grams. So a little later at around 10:00 am, I took a healthy-sized dab to see if I could remedy some of the effects from the night before. Interestingly enough, the dab triggered some of the memories I had the dab triggered some of the memories I had, and since I was occupying the same trip-space, I ended up living through flashbacks of the whole night.

The entire trip was an extremely fun yet sobering experience. 350 micrograms kicked the life out of me; I am even willing to say that I experienced an ego-death. Acid is not unlike a black hole, and I had to cling on to whatever I could before I passed through the event horizon.

My most memorable lsd experience was the first time I ever done it. I had stayed at my friend Barry's house the night before and so did our friend Griff, that morning our other friends Chad and Rachael came because we was all planning on going to Barry's brothers house and hang out. A few minutes before we left we was all in Barry's room getting ready to smoke a joint and Barry's friend Sonny came in, he told him that he had liquid acid and it was $8 a hit, normally all of us would tell this man to stick his $8 acid up his ass but this is a small redneck town where you will get to come across acid once every other year so how could we refuse. everone only had enough money to get 2 hits, but after I got my 2 hits I started thinking that after this when will I get to trip again so I said I wanted 2 more.

Sonny talked me into doing them then instead of later so I bought 2 more but when he gave me the 2nd hit he 'accidently' gave me a 3rd hit. after this we got 2 hits for Barry's brother and went to his house, on the way there I noticed my weed buzz was getting better and better, I could tell that I was starting to come up, and then when we got there I realized I had never been so fucked up in my life, Rachael told me to walk in the bathroom with her and she pointed at the flowery wallpaper in Greg's bathroom, the flowers began to move slowly, and I started thinking to mysself this is it Im beginning to trip. As I walked out of the bathroom into Greg's living room I felt the ground shaking like an earthqauke I really freaked out because I didnt know that I could feel stuff like that when you are tripping but I guess you can. After I figured out what was really going on I walked outside with everyone else.

We all decided to go to this cave up above Greg's house, it was in the middle of a large feild, the guy who owned it had cows, sheep, horses all kinds of stuff, it was a farm basically. On our way to the cave I had to slow down and catch my breathe because it was hot and I felt like I was going to pass out, The sun was so bright, it was a bright orange, and at one point it felt as if I was standing on the sun. I looked down at the ground and I noticed neon blue Greatful Dead Bears being flashed in front of me as if it was done with a laser pointer.

When I got to the cave I started walking down into the hole in the ground, I am usually afraid to walk down things like that, I guess I was always afraid to fall, but where there was usually fear was triumph, I fell once on my way down but got right back up and started again and I made it. It was so strange when I was walking down the path it looked like the everything was cheaple animated like as a cartoon charector would see if he was watching himself walk down a very steep hill.  When we all reached the bottom everyone got down in the water and walked into the cave itself. I just sat down on the grass. I looked up at the walls of the cave and the circular walls of rock was there but there was what looked like a white and green liquid oozing down the walls of the outer part of the cave and all flowing into the inner part of the cave, it looked like melting ice cream. I freaked out, I jumped up and started screaming for help, everyone else freaked out and started running to where I was at but before they could even get out of the water I remember yelling, this is fucking awesome. There was nothing to be afraid of. I then sat back down and I looked at my hand and it was decaying into bone, everyone saw me and started laughing because they knew I was peaking my balls off.

After I finally quit looking at my hand I lyed down in the grass and looked up at the sky, it was still blue but the clouds were moving in very fast motion and they were changing colors in the process. It was kinda like what the sky looked like in the Doors when Jim Morrison is following the indian to the cavern. When I sat back up I noticed that my pants were breathing, when they exhaled my blue jeans turned into blue potleafs in this non stop pattern. After spending about 2 hours in the cave we all came out, I came out a different person then what I was when I went in.

After we all got out we all just kinda spread out a little bit in the feild and I was lying on my back and so was everyone else and we were anywhere from 15 to 50 feet away from each other and we could all talk in normal volume and we could hear each other perfectly clear, it was as if we left our bodies on the ground and our souls had flown to the sky. We layed there for about 10 minues, after that we decided we should go back to Greg's but on our way back to his house the guy that owned the feild showed up and the sad thing was I didnt realize it because I was licking on a grape sucker and I started staring at it because the different shades of purple was moving around and making cool shapes, when I realized that the owner was there I caught myself laughing my ass off, Greg got me to be quiet but I couldnt help it.

After the owner left we all went back to Greg's house, on the way back I kept telling everyone that the owner was the worm and that he represented everything evil in the world, when we got back to Greg's we sat on his front porch overlooking a large field of sheep, while we was sitting there the dreaded owner went down to the field to feed the sheep, when he got their food out they all started running towards their food bin, normally people probably wouldn't really notice it but for me it was one of the coolest things I saw all day.  We stayed at Greg's house pretty late. When we went back to Barry's house Chad and Rachael followed us there. They stayed there for a while but then went home. It was about 3 in the morning and me, Barry, and Griff were wide awake, Barry brought out some of is moms magazines and usually we was making fun of everything his mom liked but for some reason looking at the magazines was fun, we was going through them and deciding which girls we wanted to have sex with.

Finally after awhile we got bored and decided to go outside. I was still having a little bit of visual but not much. We decided to throw rocks at this sign about 50 feet away and we all tried a few times, they hit it but I didnt. We went back into Barry's house and Barry fixed Romain Noodles for us. It had been a long time since I ate them. It felt weird eating them, they felt so slimy. After we ate we went into Barry's room, we rolled a joint to smoke in the morning. About this time it was morning, it was about 7 so we all decided to get some rest. We all 3 slept for about 3 or 4 hours, when we woke up we just sat there and talked about how we felt about the trip for awhile. I didnt have any visuals or anything and the head trip was still there alittle bit so I felt really good. When Barry was giving me a ride home we smoked that joint and the body buzz of the acid hit me all over again. When I got home my mom just thought I was fucked up on dope, she had no idea that it was acid, and that is my most memorable experience on lsd.

So I decided to finaly try LSD with a good mate of mine. Being excited for about 2 weeks I thought there would be no problems what so ever because I had done lots of research and knew what could happen to me.

Nothing could have prepared me for my experience.

We both took 1 hit at about 3pm in the afternoon and then settled down for a quite afternoon/evening.

We were pretty much waiting for it to hit us while watching tv, an hour passed and nothing.....and hour and a half passed, a slight head-ache but nothing....2 hours passed which made it about 5oclock with no effects what so ever. We then began to think that nothing would happen so I remembered about some weed we had stored away for a rainy afternoon, we got it and started to roll out some joints.

At about 7pm, 4 hours after taking the LSD we smoked the weed and it might have not been the best option considering this was the first time I had taken LSD.

Within 10 minutes we both just clicked into peak mode. It was like I was normal and then 1 second later I was tripping hard.
I started to feel very scared and paraniod about what was going on, I didnt know what was happening to my mind. My friend still knew that we were only tripping but I didnt.

By this stage I couldnt remember taking LSD and my mind was starting to play all sorts of tricks on me, I couldnt get a grip on what was real and what was fake. I started to doubt everything..even my best mate. I couldnt accept that it was all real, my mind was spinning and everything was moving in a fowards directions and everything looked digital, it all looked very smooth and fake. My perception of my best friend was a little man standing up inside my mind, he wasnt real and he was trying to trick me into things by telling me that we were only tripping on LSD, I couldnt believe him. I thought he was in my imagination and he wasnt real by of course he was. I was trying to fight against my mind so hard it was making me crazy. Everything felt as if it was a big mind game in my head, it felt as if I was not inside my body but I was a spirit flying around fighting inside my head and everything around me wasnt real, it wasnt there.

I had no sense of feel left in my hands of legs, I trying holding a glass but it felt as if there was no weight in it, it was floating in mid air. This was all VERY scary and I was becoming a wreck...

The first hour was the scariest hour of my lifetime...I though I was going to stay crazy for ever and it really was scary. After about an hour and peaking and being scared out of my mind, seeing everything from a different view I started to understand what was going on. It sort of clicked in my head after being told about 100 times that we wer eon LSD. I finaly got a grip on reality. I knew we were only tripping.

Things started to change...I went on the couch and lied down to relax and listen to some music...amazing. The music felt as if it were playing inside me, it was so relaxing and enjoying.

I remember looking at the walls and seeing them moving into weird shapes and colours, everything would not stop moving. It was fantastic after I had finaly got a grid on reality!!

I'm still not really sure when or if I will do LSD again, I would like to experience it again because it really did open up my mind to a different and scary world...

To sum it up, I had never been so scared of anything before in my life and it was truly terrifying not being able to control my thoughts and not being able to stop myself fighting my mind, but I am glad I went through some of it. I didnt really understand how powerfull a mind really is and I really do have alot more respect for LSD now, I'm not sure why it didnt take any effects after some hours and I'm sure the weed did something to set the LSD off because it was instant....

I learnt that this drug needs respect, and if its to be taken it MUST be with nothing but respect for it....

I am writing this in july of 2009, two years and two months after the first time I had tripped on any kind of psychoactive. It was the last day of my freshman year of college and I could not wait to be finished. I had five hits of acid, and two of my best friends since middleschool had decided to go camping at a lake about 75 minutes from where we live. A place we had been to a million times before.

So we arrive and set up camp and at 8:45 we dropped... I did two hits, 'deuce' and 'rosy' both did one.

About 45 minutes after we dropped we all had this feeling of nervous energy coursing through our bodies. I was constantly tapping my feet because it felt good, no visuals yet. Around this time deuce says 'You know, the thing about acid is... It's not that it makes you hallucinate, it's that it just straight fuuuuucks you up.' Rosy and I laughed hysterically at this and agreed that it must be true... We were about to find out how wrong we were.

10-20 minutes after deuce's observation I tried unsuccessfully to get deuce and rosy to go down to the water's edge with me. Finally realizing that no one else wanted to go I grabbed a bag of chips, a boombox, a flashlight and a gallon of water; not that I needed all this but I didn't want to get to the water's edge and think of something I might want and end up making several trips... 'better to be prepared' I muttered to myself. 

I turned and faced the direction of the water (which is about two to three hundred yards away from camp) and noticed how dark it really was. I took one long drag off my cigarette and received my first lsd induced visual; as I moved the cig away from my face I could distinctly the glow of the cherry and my hand move in slow motion. Almost like a brush stroke out of a painting, or as if someone had filmed this action and removed many of the frames to slow it down. This did not startle me, but produced an intense feeling of excitement. I took one last look at camp and had an urge to tell everyone what I just saw, but knew that I could not do it justice. Instead, I struck out for the water.

There I was, trudging through waist-high grass carrying an absurd amount of things and smoking a cowboy killer. I arrived at the water's edge and sat down in the grass which made the grass a little taller than myself. I breifly took note that the seed pods of the weeds I was sitting amongst were pulsating, 'very cool' I thought. I fumbled around with the boombox and put in a mix cd I had made months before and hit shuffle. The first song that played was 'one of these days' by Pink Floyd. I remained in the sitting position for about half of the song observing the grass and all the subtle color changes it was going through. I knew the part where the bass really kicks in was coming up so I decided to lie down for it. As my back hit the ground the music kicked in. This was the first time I had seen the night sky.

The midnight blue sky exploded with billions of stars, some of which were there and some of which were a result of the lsd, these billions of points of light swam around and danced as the music played. The sight was so beautiful that it literally took my breath away. I deeply inhaled and as I did the sky looked like it was getting closer, and when I exhaled the sky got farther away. This process of inhaling and exhaling repeated itself about six times before I actually caught my breath and returned to a normal rate of respiration. Once my respiration rate returned to normal the stars stopped dancing and spread out all across the sky and formed a plethora of geometric shapes; with little white lines connecting each star to another one. These shapes would then slowly rotate while each individual star would subtly change its hue. At this point I realized the song had stopped (the boombox was fucked up) so I took this opportunity to run back to camp and tell deuce and rosy all about it.

Running the little trail back to camp was an experience that I still can not put into words, the feeling of the warm air on my face, the light of the campfire in the distance, the sound of my feet pounding the earth... It was amazing. 

I arrived at camp to find that rosy had taken the lantern and was wandering around the woods, while deuce was idly sitting staring at the burning wood. My heavy breathing combined with the look on my face must have alarmed him, because he asked if I was ok. I proceeded to try and explain what I had experienced, but was unable to. I ended up begging deuce to come down to the lake and check it out, but the stubborn bastard refused to do it. While I was trying to convinced deuce to go, rosy meandered back up to camp; I immediately laid into him 'Dude you fucking have to come down to the lake!' Rosy too refused my request. I would not relent, it was now a battle of wills. How long could deuce and rosy withstand my beligerent requests to go to the lake? I knew what had happend out there and neither one of them had experienced anything like that in the woods or at camp. After 10-15 minutes of nagging I finally got rosy to go to the lake with me.

When we got there he had a very similar experience to what I did... 'We gotta get deuce down here man' said rosy.

Eventually we all three were sitting by the water's edge, I was obsessed with the stars, rosy was looking across the lake (which is fucking huge) at a mountain-side covered with trees and deuce was looking at the surface of the water. I was breifly captivated by the water because it looked like it was moving with massive amounts of speed, yet it was realitively still. At this point I leaned back in my chair,looked up at the night sky and let out a gutteral yawp that could be heard for great distances. I just had the urge to do it, and when I did I could feel all the vibrations of my vocal chords and the air rushing out of my lungs out into the sky that I was so captivated by. 

Those were some of the highlights of the night.

The effects wore off soon after the sun rose in the morning...

My First Acid Adventure

I had previously taken magic mushrooms (cubensis) but never taken LSD. I had only smoked marijuana and done mushrooms up until the night I decided to do acid. My friend told me he had really strong tabs so I bought a couple thinking I'd go have a few with my mates or something like that, until I decided to start tripping.

Instead, I decided to get high with my mates who were there already, and they said they could be trip sitters because they weren't on hallucinogens (just smoking weed and one was on ecstasy).

I took one 160ug tab and was waiting and smoking marijuana which caused my perception of time to be slightly off. I thought it had been awhile and I wasn't feeling the LSD at all yet, I just felt pretty stoned smoking bongs almost back to back. After about 20-40 minutes, I decided to take another tab (making the total acid taken around 320ug) and sit for awhile.

After I took the second tab there was not much time before the LSD started working. It felt as if a switch had been flipped and I was 100% sure I was feeling the effects. For the first half hour or so I spent so much time laughing my face hurt the next day and my abs hurt. After that time I'm not entirely sure but it felt like the second tab kicked in and I started experiencing a level of high I never have before.

I remember looking at somebody telling them they need to calm down they're too high and they need to relax and they look so fucked up, then my mates explained to me later I was talking to myself in the mirror. I ended up staring into my long hair seeing it move and change colour and light intensity without actually moving it or doing anything. The walls of my mates house were breathing heavily at the same time as I was. The walls and I had synchronised breathing patterns for awhile when I started seeing patterns on the ceiling. I felt a bit surprised but not in a bad way, so I tried to close my eyes and relax for a moment but experienced intense closed eye visuals which were more colourful and more abstract patterns than with my eyes open.

I kept my eyes open and my friends constantly tried to keep me in a good state of mind, which they managed to. 
My mate had to pick up his girlfriend from work, and he didn't want to leave anyone in his house alone or me by myself for safety reasons. He gave me an hour roughly before we had to go get her to get myself ready apparently, but it took most of that time tripping and sitting on the floor putting my shoes on.

As we were about the leave the peak set in, three of us got in his car (me in the back) and he started driving. It was night and everything was dark, but it felt as if I was running very very fast or flying through the air because my window was open. It was one of the best feelings of my life, it felt like flying at high speeds or just cruising beyond my body. Since I was tripping so hard I didn't get any motion sickness for the most part, I was too busy looking around and phasing into different realities. I found that transitioning from being in one room or place or even looking at one spot to another felt like a significant change in the world and reality and everything. I found that transitioning from being in one room or place or even looking at one spot to another felt like a significant change in the world and reality and everything. I forgot I was in my friends car and on the floor in the back there is a raised section behind the middle console, I started stroking it and praising it, thinking it was my mate's dog. My mates both laughed at me very hard.

We got to his girlfriends work (Mcdonalds) and one of my mates went in to get me water. He came back and gave it to me and firstly it was too heavy to hold, then for the next few hours I kept trying to hand it to different people asking if it was their drink I was holding.

On the way back I was in absolute stupor and still peaking, laughing and watching the patterns form in my mate's car. 
As we arrived back they invited my close friend over to make sure I was okay and to me he appeared out of nowhere or a portal or something in the night and I just started yelling his name and hugging him and laughing until everyone told me to be quiet because it was late. Instead of going straight back into my mates house I stared at some trees and saw them all swirling around and animals move around in them in the dark which didn't exist. The stars seemed to draw figures and patterns and visibly move significant distances. I eventually went back into my mates house and he put some music videos on which I listened to and enjoyed but mostly tripped out hard at how many 'layers' or visual layers I was seeing in the videos.

Probably a good 8 or 10 hours after taking the second tab, I was feeling very tired and very good still, like the nice feeling of ecstasy. I just lay down and tripped out for a long time and fell asleep. My dreams were extremely vivid although very abstract. My dreams were more hallucinatory than my waking hallucinations. I felt as if they were real and they confused me much more.

The next day I woke up with a brutal headache and everything was too bright for me, so I had to wear sunglasses the entire day. It was pretty ruthless doing 320ug for my first time, however, I did not experience any bad trip (which I have later from taking lower dosages of different acid) nor did I feel nauseated or like throwing up or experiencing diarrhea (which generally happens as I come down from hallucinogens). My body recovered extremely well other than the pounding headache which I got rid of with some painkillers or paracetamol. I can't remember all of the trip vividly, but it was the most intense experience I've ever had with drugs, moreso than cocaine, speed, mushrooms, hashish, etc.

This event took place on a Saturday night with 4 of my close friend.  Previously we had all been using acid for about two months.  We started off by just doing one hit when we first started and then gradually building our way up to a higher dose comfortably.  And we had been doing acid every weekend for the past two months.

This day was very different though than before.  Previously we had always ended up dosing at night.  We planned it out for this particular weekend to dose as early as possible so we could experience our trip during the day and go for a hike.  I had gotten out of work early and woken my friends so we could meet up.  I called C and E and told them that I was out of work.  E picked me up from my house and we went and picked up C, B, and J.  We picked C up at her house and B and J were at the Wal*mart down the road from us.  When we picked up B and J we dosed ourselves.  E took 3 hits, C took 3, B took 3, and J took 2 strong sugar cubes.  I took 4 of the same kind that everyone else had taken after me and E had a quick rock, paper, scissors match to decide who was to get it.  As we drove away from the Wal*mart we headed back up to Cs house so we could get our things together for the hike.  We arrived at her house in a matter of 10 to 15 minutes.  We proceeded up to her room to grab some batteries for the stereo we wanted to bring along with us.  After we got the batteries we started our walk.

Having only been in the house maybe 10 minutes and walking another 5 I was already starting to feel the body high.  Although I wasnt yet seeing or really hearing anything yet.  I just felt good at the moment.  We kept walking through the woods for another 15 minutes or so until we got to a stopping point and decided to settle out in the middle of this large grassy field.  As we sat there I realized that I was beginning to hallucinate and apparently everyone else was beginning to as well.  C put on her stereo and we began listening to music and talking about life, the field we were in, how cool the sky looked, and all the rainbows we kept on seeing all around us.

My mind set at this point and time was that I was really happy.  In fact I was overflowing with happiness at the time, I even mentioned to everyone that I was extremely happy.  As time went by I started noticing the trees off in the distance starting to split into different trees and wave back and forth as if it were breathing.  At some point and time Cs stereo had died due to lack of battery power.  My friend J though had a mandolin with him though (its a kind of folk instrument).  He at first began strumming it in the most awful way.  It made this horrible screeching noise that caused me to see the trees in the distance grow eyes and glare at him.  We all told him not to do that.  So he started playing something on it for real for a few minutes until he decided that he just couldnt concentrate enough to play.  We all agreed it was for the better because of the fact that it would create some horrible noises if he were to mess up.

Soon the sun started setting and we had been out in the field for at least 2 or 3 hours.  So we decided it was best that we started heading back to Cs house for the rest of the trip.  And besides the dark it was getting really cold.  We all managed our way back to Cs house with little difficulty other than the face that I kept on noticing or rather not noticing certain fences.  When we arrived inside Cs house her parents at the time had company and we all had to greet them which was extremely hard to do because I kept losing my concentration.

Previously though before we left the field I got a bit worried about a phone call that came in and I was unable to respond to who ever was on the line.  I thought it was something important because I didnt recognize the number and it happened to be a business number.

After dealing with Cs parents we all headed up to her room where we were locked away from any outside distraction and could really be as loud as we desired which was a very good feeling.

At this point and time though I think I really started tripping.  Previously I was only hallucinating and hearing different things.  To me my trip and my hallucinations were two completely different things.  I have a really hard time remembering most of it though.

I do clearly remember though that as I was tripping I would get these waves of energy a type of surge of body energy.  Each time this happened I would completely blank out.  I would forget who I was, what I was, who was with me, where I was, and what I was doing.  Each time this wave of energy hit me I only had a few seconds to recollect myself and try and remember everything.  But as soon as I would collect any information I would get another wave of energy.  I remember though that it was a sort of game in my mind.  Where I would do something or say something that would cause these waves of energy to travel through me.  It was really interesting and different.  Before this night I had never experienced anything like it.

I felt very inhuman to the rest of the world.  I felt though as if everyone else around me was playing the same game with me.  Each time I would get a wave of energy it felt SO good.  It became the point of the whole trip as soon as I figured it out.  It was sort of like my being was just reoccurring some type of active stimuli.  I cant really explain it because each time a wave hit me I would forget nearly everything.  But as time went on things became more and more in depth.  The best way I can lay out my mind at that time is like having options really.  In the beginning of the trip I only had 2 or 3 options.  But as time went by I had 20 to 30 options.  These options though were not really options they are just an example of how much detail I had in my life.  Everything was extremely simple in the beginning then slowly became more complex.  From the start I only knew that I was human and I was alive.  Soon a began to know that these other beings around me were human and that they were my friends.  I started to remember I had cigarettes, a phone, a wallet, and other possessions.  After a few hours of doing this I started to come out of it all.  It was probably 4 or 5 hours after we got to the house that I felt like I was back at least somewhat into reality.

But my mind was extremely messed up from it all.  I kept thinking about the trip and what it meant to me.  What it all was.  What was the point?  It bothered the hell out of me and I couldnt figure it out.  I proceeded to start walking around in Cs room and back and forth to the bathroom to help clear my mind and think a bit.  No use.  I tried expressing this to my friends.  And as soon as I would get a clear definition in my mind of what had happened I would try to explain it and I would shortly forget almost immediately.  It was really aggravating.  After a while I started to have my friends worry about me a bit.  This really didnt help me at all.  It made me more irritated because I knew I wasnt having a bad trip, just a very strange one that had my mind very messed up.

Sometime later in the night though B and J had to leave.  They promised to hangout with some other friends and they had to leave.  This though has to be one of the weirdest things about acid.  Saying goodbye.  For whatever reason while we were saying goodbye we always had one last thing to say.  It made it difficult to go our separate ways.  At some point and time though we all managed to say our final goodbyes and they left.  At this time I was no longer tripping and I was only hallucinating still.  My strange trip was over and I was with C and E.  I was still trying to figure out the trip though in my head.  It had to be one of the most complex and hardest things that Ive ever thought about in my life.

At some point and time though I came to a conclusion about humans.  I felt like people were just this plague.  All we were is a being with desires, needs, and wants all the time.  Always consuming always complaining about something.  It started to get to my head and I tried my best to just not think about it anymore.

Near the end of the day (sometime around midnight) E wanted to go.  She had to drop me back off at my house considering she was the only way I would get back home.  I went back home reluctantly because at that point and time I still wanted to be with my friends and try and figure it all out.  Although I didnt express my reluctance I still was.  When I got home I greeted my parents real quick and headed up stairs with my dog.  When I got upstairs I started petting my dog and received only love back.  It was a good feeling to have something there that would just give you love back I started petting my dog and received only love back.  It was a good feeling to have something there that would just give you love back as long and I just petted it.

I logged onto my computer and checked out some stuff online and got uninterested fast.  I noticed C was online and decided to start talking to her a bit.  We talked about our experience and how we were feeling at the moment for a little bit.  But soon I decided to start to watch a movie to help calm my brain and get it off the thoughts of this trip.  I figured if I got some type of outside distraction from my trip it would kind of phase out of my head.  I only watched the movie for an hour before my mother had come home from work.  My parents started getting into a fight that got loud after a while.  This really started to freak me out.  I started thinking that my parents were going to get divorced and they were going to move away and Id have to leave all my friends behind.  So I decided to head downstairs to get them to shut up.  And they did.  Apparently my presence being there while they were fighting was enough for them to stop and just go to sleep.

After more time went by I realized it was around 2 in the morning.  I was still hallucinating too.  I decided to call my from R because I heard he had a bad acid experience the week before and I wanted someone to talk to about my experience and get some advice in case anything happened.  He calmed me down a lot by saying things like, Dont worry man, in the morning all the bad and strange thoughts in your head will be gone.  You wont be thinking the same anymore.  Just put on some good music and relax as best as you can.  I took his advice and went upstairs on my computer and started listening to some of my favorite artists.  It really did calm me down a lot.  But I soon got bored because all I was doing was just sitting and listening.  I decided to go into my room and just watch TV for a while.

I still couldnt get the trip off my mind, but I wasnt so worried about it anymore after talking to R and listening to the music.  I laid in my bed and started watching some movie on TV and got really comfortable.  I must of laid there for a few hours because I remember looking at the time again and it was around 4.  I went back to my computer to check and see if anyone had tried to contact me.  But no one had.  I went straight back to bed and started watching a different movie.  My head though was still on constant thought of the trip.  Shortly though I was able to fall asleep.  Although I didnt sleep for very long.  I woke up around 9 in the morning.  My parents thought it was odd I was up so early considering I usually sleep until around noon.  I told them that I must of been just getting used to waking up early throughout the week.  When I woke though I was still hallucinating.  But for the most part the thoughts of the trip were completely erased from my mind.

I felt a lot more at ease with the rest of the world and felt so much better as a whole.  I dont think I could classify my experience as a bad trip but I know it wasnt good.  It was somewhere in-between.  More likely a borderline bad trip.  Ive decided though that whenever I do acid again Im not going to take the same dose as I did that night, Im going to dose myself a bit lower and Im going to take a break from it for a week or two just to give my head sometime to think and recoup.

I have learned a lot though from the experience.  I learned that acid is not something that you want to take very nonchalantly.  Previously I was taking it like it was candy.  I know now how serious this stuff is and how badly this can really mess with your head.  Ill take more precaution in the future with my dose and my surroundings.

This was the month of November of 2018. I had a friend with whom I usually dropped acid the entire summer of that year. By September our relationship was becoming a bit patchy and by October it was not a lot immersive as it used to be. In November we met and she expressed her wish to drop some acid to cherish the last days of fall with me. That night I sent her a stern text saying that I do not want to trip out with her as I want to trip with someone more spiritually intimate. She calls and starts shouting at me and we meet that night and she convinces me to a trip outside Montreal. I arrange the trip and we agree to a date.

The day of the trip begins with missing the first bus to our destination. We took the second bus and head off. When we reach there at around 2 pm we decide to drop 100 µg of tab each. In less than an hour she begins to feel the effects but I am not tripping. She says the clouds were frame-dragging and I wasnt able to notice it. I wait the next 15 minutes and during that she goes to a nearby public toilet when I decide to take a second tab of another 100 µg tab. We started walking after that and she is unaware that I have now a total of 200 µg in my system. In the next half an hour/ or forty minute that follows I start tripping. 

Of all the trips I had so far I have come to notice a few quirks and features surrounding me. I have observed that I start to understand that I am tripping when suddenly my teeth and gum become extremely sensitive. I have observed that I start to understand that I am tripping when suddenly my teeth and gum become extremely sensitive. When I breathe in the air makes my teeth shiver and my gums experience a tingling sensation. This phenomenon I have come to associate with death. Why you may ask? Just weeks prior my beloved grandmothers death in 2012, I saw a dream in which I saw that all of my teeth were falling into the sink and I cant stop it from happening. My gums felt exactly that sensation in the dream. In 2012 I had no experience doing LSD or any other kind of psychedelics except for smoking up weed.

In the next two hours I am tripping and she is out of this world. She started feeling queasy and she asks me how soon can we leave the place for Montreal. She started to feel that we will never make it into the city. I had the bad idea of walking towards the bus depot but we were tripped out so much that cars in the highway were scaring her even though we were on the side of the road. We make a pitstop near a gas station there we call a taxi. While waiting for the taxi, I speak about another quirk of me tripping. This I call the Second Stage where I start seeing these silver membrane(?)-like intelligent entities appearing in the periphery of my vision while I have my eyes open. I call them intelligent because I see them to be playing with my attention. Taxi arrives and in the next 10minutes we are in the bus depot. She felt safe and in the half an hour we were off to the city.

Inside the bus we were laughing and giggling unstoppably and this is now 7 pm. I see we are getting into the city when she tells me that her hands are still cold and she cant get them to warm up. I see her hands and they were red and I got scared and quickly took her hands in my hands with the intention to warm them up. In the the next few minutes I pass out holding her hands. While passing out I feel some unusual amount of heat flowing out through my hands into her skin. 

Now that I am passed out, I vividly start hallucinating with lots of closed-eye visuals until everything becomes clear, there is a black background and and a high frequency sound starts to appear. I hear it and it felt like it was a sharp knife cutting through my head. By this time I start sweating profusely and start shaking as well (this was what she told me). While all this is happening I start seeing this ball of energy that looked like plasma (?) or ball-lightning comes out through my chest and immediately after I see two golden colored snakes burst through my chest and start spiraling and coiling around this ball-lightning. While they were spiraling I see they were radiating different colored lights and they went ever so high while coiling around. Just after the snakes stop spiraling and coiling around the ball of energy, I see a small entity that was purple-red in color and looked like its a small demon with horns, a pointed tail and a rust colored staff" on its right hand. It quickly climbed up the snakes and goes on top of their head and it looks down at me and gives a wicked grin. I wake up with sweaty hands and head and I see her opening eyes as well. 

I see the bus closing in to the Montreal bus station and I asked her whether she see what I saw and she replied that she wants to talk about it when we get down from the bus. After we get down with our bags and stuff we stared at each other and started crying and I shouted at her Did  you see that?!. She said yes. I asked Did you see what I just saw?! And her answer was yes. She went into the washroom  of the station for a quick refresh while I was with the bags only to return and say that something was dressing her up and playing with her hair in the washroom while she was washing her face. She felt it viscerally and she hated it but she understood that it didnt mean her harm. I was totally dumbfounded by the experience.

We took the metro and in there some weird stuff was happening with me which I cant write here as it needs a lot of background story but I was seeing a lot of the part of reality as frames presented to me to perform certain actions. I strongly had the feeling that this was the work of the devil and sensed eerily felt that there was lot of magic involved in my experience. After we get down the metro she starts saying something was touching her before she got down and she felt nasty the way that thing was touching her in the train. She was constantly pointing to someone and it wasnt there. We go  to each of our homes respectively and dont talk for two or three hours until at 2 am she texts me saying shes still hearing voices talking to her and she cant control them. One spoke in Persian and was laughing and another in English. She was freaking out. I was in my room, it was dark and was trying to sleep but I couldnt  because something kept squishing the water bottle that was in the room.

I was born a Muslim but I am not practicing Islam. The mythologies/folklore surrounding Islam talk about entities called jinns (genies) and angels and how they can appear to someone in altered states of consciousness which is what I saw. After the trip I came to understand that there is magic, there is evil, there is a God and yes there is an entire reality with other beings different from ours hidden in plain sight.

It was eight months ago. I had bought a hit of acid a few days earlier and arranged for two of my friends to help me with this experiment. 

I put the blotter of LSD on my tongue and let it dissolve while I waited for my friends to come pick me up. We drove around for a while, and after an hour and a half I began to get worried that it was not real acid, or perhaps I was somehow immune to its effects (hah).  

I was completely fine until six oclock, when I started to feel it coming on. I felt dizzy, disoriented, and confused. Colors were wrong, somehow. Another hour passed and I was very, very deep into my trip. Objects were so disoriented and light was everywhere. Everything seemed to be covered with a beautiful flowery, paisley print. When the car was stopped, I became panicked because I felt s though it was floating away, like a boat. I urged the driver to put the emergency brake on, or we would float down the street and into traffic. I put my seat belt on and held on to the sides of the car. After this fear passed, it was time to go back to my house. My friends and I sat in my room for a while. I was rather dazed and I could feel I was on the brink of a bad trip. Objects in my room were so strange and unfamiliar. 

This fear was assuaged when a friend put on Pink Floyds The Wall. We turned off the lights and lay down on the floor, and I instantly forgot my friends were with me. I was thrown into a world only Roger Waters and I understood. The entire cd is made up of a few songs, some weird sounds, and strange, hysterical voices. I felt that if I turned the cd off, I would die. I was terrified of the strange sounds, but Roger Waters voice seemed to speak to me. I felt like he was guiding me through my trip. I felt like he was guiding me through my trip. Its like he was saying, Yes, I know these noises and voices are terrifying, but dont worry, I would never let anything bad happen to you. Just stick with me, Anne. When the cd was over and the lights were turned back on, I was shocked to discover my friends were in the room. They gave me warm smiles and hugs, and told me I was doing great. I became to happy, and a single thought kept echoing over and over again in my head: You have to take care of them. I wanted to make sure they were safe and happy, and I made them swear they would wear their seat belts on the way home. I told them that my purpose in life was to take care of them and make sure they were safe and comfortable and happy with their lives.

I fell asleep soon after they left, and when I awoke in the morning, I felt very tired but satisfied. I was happy, and felt enlightened. I went through the rest of the week with a calm peacefulness. 

Acid was definitely an interesting experience, one I would definitely repeat. I would never embark on an LSD trip alone, however. If my friends had not been there, I might have had a terrible experience.

The Best Trip Yet

Me and my good friend moved from Houston to Austin for college.  With our new found freedom we decided a 'trip' was in order to start out the year.  It was his(lets call him S) first time to drop and my second.  My first trip was hardly a trip, I felt 'weird' and slightly drunk but that was it(pretty bunk stuff).  Two girls(L and D) we knew from high school came to visit us and brought the cid with them, 1 hit each.  I forget what they called it, 'black'-something, the paper was black anyhow.

We had ample provisions, munchies, oj, alcohol, a little pot, blacklight, various colored lightbulbs, and good music.  We were all comfortable with each other and the surroundings were pretty cool.  Me and S had a two bedroom apartment in a complex perfect for tripping.  Basically it's renovated gov. housing painted in purples, oranges, reds, yellows, and other bright colors in odd patterns with colored flood lights everywhere...cool.

So we drop the acid around 8pm or so.  Okay....we sit in the living room drinking a little, screwdrivers I think, and 45-60 minutes later I start to feel it.  My hands and feet start to feel slightly wet.  The carpet begins to take on an interesting texture.  We all agree that it is starting to kick in.  I remember getting up to go to the bathroom and thinking the floor was wet somehow or that my feet would go through it like water.  I drain the lizard and become entranced with the shower curtain.  It was moving, flowing like a flag in the wind.  I stare at that for a while and remember to get back to the living room.  

By this time we are all feeling pretty giggly.  We talk, laugh, drink a little more.  S takes a lamp puts a green lightbulb in it and sets it in the corner of the living room, so that it illuminates two walls.  Wow...they are textured so they start forming patterns.  I start seeing very aztec looking forms on the wall.  Snakes, vines, leaves, trees, and skeletons(but not scary).  I could hear the crickets and frogs outside and this added to the hallucination.  I then get up to do something but get distracted by the carpet.  It moves, ebbs and flows.

I'm pretty sure we all decided to venture outside for a while.  The girls needed something out of their car.  Now remember how trip-tastic this complex is.  The colors on the builings were moving, the lights threw shadows that moved, the air tasted great, the sky, moon, and clouds were incredible.  I felt euphoric.  We were tripping pretty good at this point and our conversations seemed to be looping.  I remember S running up to where all the electric meters, boxes, etc.. for our building and screaming 'I can control the world from here!'  We laugh our asses off, walk around, get strange looks and eventually remember what we came outside for.  High spirits for all.

Back inside we head to S's room, at least that's the next thing I remember clearly.  He has a pink light and purple light in the light/fan and a black light on in the corner.  He has a bunch of cool ass posters.  He had a 'Lord of the Rings' poster, the border has vine, trees, and characters from the book was moving around the picture.  Gandalf was in 3-d, things were moving and it blew my mind.  

At some point we put on the AENIMA album by TOOL and cranked it, probally around 12am.  Fan-fucking-tastic!  The cd is kept on loop for the rest of the trip which adds alot to the weirdness.  I groove to one song it ends, next thing I know I'm grooving to it again but I'm in a different part of the apartment doing something different.  Crazy deja-vu feelings and mind loops. 

I remember going outside with D and just staring at the sky and skyline from my balcony.  The skyline seemed very movie like.  The light of the city and moon seemed to getter darker and lighter.  One moment it felt like first dawn then midnight, then dawn again, etc..  After a while I felt like I had been standing there for days.  I felt how old the earth, universe and stars were.  D and I hardly said a word but it was not awkward.  At one point she leaned over towards me, I had the urge to kiss her but decided with surprising lucidity that this, considering our current state, probally was not the best time to start something.  We both head back in and I swear I saw an aura around D and it was sadness and dissapointment.  'Of course I'm tripping balls so who knows?', I remember that thought vividly for some reason.

Everything else is a blur.  My perception of time and thus the order of events is pretty whacked at this point.  I remember the kitchen walls breathing in and out, the floor at an angle it should not be, and afraid everyone was going to fall somewhere.  

I sat with S and gazed into my speaker cab for my guitar amp(you can't see the speakers just black cloth).  It had a Grim Reaper sitting on top.  We both felt that we were being sucked in to this black doorway by the reaper, S said the reaper said something to him.  

I remember sitting on S's bed staring at the ceiling with D, the pink tropical light was on, the ceiling fan was on full blast so you could feel the air moving and it made the light move on the ceiling a bit, and the track with the lightning from the TOOL album was playing. I thought I was on an island before a storm.  I felt at peace, and I never wanted to leave.  

I remember washing my hair for some strange reason.  The water felt great.  For a while I just sat on the floor and stared at things.  I glanced at the mirror and thought 'not a good idea' and left.

I played guitar for a bit.  Kicked on the delay and phaser, fantastic!  I got lost in the sound, I felt like I -WAS- sound, hard to explain.

I remember thinking that the last track on Aenima, was the best fucking song I had ever heard.

We all laid on S's bed and I felt some weird sexual tension. 

Everyone crashes at dawn.  Beautiful sunrise, -I- felt like a new day.  I lay in my bed and think it is the most comfortable thing.  The apartment is dead silent, I sit there for a while with my eyes closed enjoying shapes, and cartoon characters. I have auditory hallucinations, I hear whispers, music, and just weird things.  I eventually drift off into sleep.  I got up around 1pm and felt pretty drained.  I also felt like the acid did not totally wear off until the next day.

My perceptions of reality have changed and expanded.  In my trip I felt no spiritual connection(proablly because I am an atheist), rather the enormity and infinitnes of the universe compared to my meager self.  I pondered the struggles of mankind, the futility of war, violence, and other hippy thoughts.  Over all it was probally the best trip I ever had, as I have had a few more since:).

It is always a wish of every experiencer to be able to adequately describe a new experience. It makes one appreciate how remarkable the advent of language is and was throughout history. To recreate an experience through sound after the fact is truly fascinating to contemplate. The difficulty of describing something outside of normal experience reinforces this fact. I apologize for the crudeness of this report, I am not among those gifted with that creative force.

I am an experienced lsd user. I don't have an exact count, but I have had many dozens of experiences, in as many different settings. I've had good, and bad trips, l; goofy and enlightening experiences. None however were as intense as my most recent, an unexpectedly high dose on an empty stomach. My usual source of the compound had dried up, and an acquaintance happened to have a different supply. I decided to give it a try. He didn't make mention of the dose, and I didn't ask. This was my mistake. I purchased two tabs, cynically expecting each tab to be dosed at 75-100 micrograms max. My usual dose is what I believe to be 200 micrograms, although one can never know for certain, and I expected this to be no different than usual course of actions.

I woke up early, at 7 am, to dose myself at 8. I had to work that evening at 10pm, and this has always been a sufficient enough timeframe to be normal enough to do a passable job. I made myself a tea, and took the two tabs. Normally, I find that it takes my body about an hour to an hour and a half to process the drug and for the come up to begin. This time, it only took 30 minutes for the beginning stages of the experience to manifest. This time, it only took 30 minutes for the beginning stages of the experience to manifest. 

The beginning was coming quickly and powerfully, significantly moreso than usual. This caused me a great deal of anxiety, as I began to realize I had taken a much larger dose than expected. I've had experience with large doses, but nothing ever felt as overwhelming as this. I became violently sick, and became stuck in a loop of vomiting for almost an hour, before finally being well enough to go back to bed. The only thing tethering me to reality was the horrible nausea, and the fact that I was breathing. All I could do without gagging was hunch over the toilet and breath. The sound of my breath took on an extremely vibrant quality, and made the time sick pass more interestingly. My only other thoughts were of disappointment at myself for jumping into the void haphazardly.

Once the puke loop stopped and I returned to bed, ego death began. I phased in and out of experiencing having a body. For much of the time, there was no other quality to my existence other than what seemed like a pinpoint of energy located somewhere inside the space of my head. I could no longer see this world, nor hear it. Instead, the sensory input came from somewhere else. The pattern, the typical visuality of the lsd experience, came to life and took over all data being sent inward. The shapes moved and spun and interacted in a spatial dimension I could not comprehend. Combined with these shapes were sounds. The sounds came from nowhere in my home. I had no music playing, no sources of white noise. They were part of the visuals. There were strange clicks, hums, vibrations, and other sounds that I cannot describe as I have not heard them before or since. They made sense with the movement of the geometry. In that moment, the only part of me left intact became aware that this was the machine aspect of our universe, the behind the scenes interactions beyond the macro from which all complexity is created. It was all so amazingly digital. In this time, I managed to change my viewpoint to what seemed like looking down at my corporeal body, and it too was only the grey rainbow vibratory geometry like everything else. 

The peak began to fade into the plateau, wherein I returned to physicality. It became apparent upon returning to my body that I was rythmically twisting and convulsing in what I can only describe as a 3D manifestation of higher spatial dimensional manipulation. My contortions felt like I was being moved in ways that were physically impossible, but that the movements themselves were only a shadow of that dimension. I also did not feel like I was in control of my movements; I was being puppeteered by some external force. Eventually, I regained control of my body, and returned to the normal habits of an lsd trip. I put on a funkadelic album and zoned out to the sounds, while also deeply shaken by the totality of my experience. The remaining hours of the trip passed as they usually do, and I went to work at 10 pm without issue. 

I am pleased with the result of the experience, but I implore anyone who takes a new supply of any drug to always get the most sense of what they should expect vis-à-vis dose. There were moments where I believed my body couldn't take the experience and that I would require hospitalization. Luckily for me I was experienced enough to hang on tight and ride it out. But not everyone will be adequately prepared to dissolve into their vibratory state. Please be wise with these experiences, and only dose yourself this high knowingly and with the full expectation of it being nightmarish and disturbing.

Emotional Trip

I'm not sure if this will help anyone in deciding if they should or should not trip, but I hope it provides assistance of some kind. 

It was my first time taking LSD and I was slightly nervous I must admit.  I have tried many other drugs before, but for some reason LSD was always one that I was unsure about.  I decided to go ahead with it and with my best friend (who is a frequent user of the drug) I decided to trip. We stayed at her house in her room where we listened to rock n' roll albums and created art projects. At 8:00 pm we took the first half of a tab, (I only wanted to take a small amount for fear that I might not enjoy it) and for the first hour or so I did not feel anything.  Then all of a sudden with out even realizing it I started laughing.  There was nothing that was outright funny, yet I could not stop myself from uncontrollably laughing.  My legs felt sort of jello-like and warm and tingly.  I could feel my blood circulate through my body; I was warm, happy and very pleasant.  Then all of a sudden my friend has some candles that were lit and she blew them out.  I did not know why, but I quickly stopped laughing and started crying.  I had tears running down my cheeks and was silently sobbing.  For some reason I was very upset the candles had been blown out.  I just had so much emotion inside of me that I had to release it in one form or another.  In this case I went from laughing to crying- yet I wasnt that sad.  I soon stopped crying and began to draw.  One thing I found frustrating was that it was very hard to concentrate while drawing.  I could not focus on my work and I also could not get what I was creating to come out the exact way I had wanted it to.

Then an hour later at 9:00 we decided to take the other half of the tab.  I was still peaking and this added to me wonderful flow of emotions.  I was still giggly and happy, and just felt very pleasant.  We continued to draw and listen to music and talk about things we felt were interesting at the present time.  However, the entire time I was tripping I would constantly have millions of thoughts that would not stay in my head long enough for me to verbalize them.  I also found that frustrating.  

The night continued and I still was happy, just more mellowed out.  I was also very aware of my back and neck.  It didn't hurt, rather I was just aware of it.  I also found myself becoming attached to different objects.  For example, I had been playing with a lighter and could not seem to put it down.  I didn't feel right if I put it down- for some reason I needed to be holding it.  The same thing happened to a sweater I had been wearing.  The entire trip was clear and not as visually crazy as tripping on mushrooms.  For example, I could have a normal conversation with someone, but when I am on mushrooms I don't like to talk to anyone and enjoy being by myself.

Overall, I didn't see crazy images or have an tracers.  The only vision things that I saw were my friend's christmas lights in her room- they were blurry and fuzzy- they all blended together.  I didn't freak out or even remotely find anything scary or strange.  I was simply happy and very emotional.  I loved everything about my trip.  I was nervous at frist, however I felt safe with my best friend and knew that I could trust her.  I was in a comfortable environment as well.  However I did have a little trouble falling asleep.  It was strange in the fact that my body was exhausted, yet my mind was still wide awake and racing at 6:00 in the morning.  I was done tripping still I couldn't fall asleep easily.

General Info:

20 yr. old male
about 230 lbs.
I am on no medications

I guess I will give a little background on my drug use. I consider myself fairly experienced with mind-altering substances. I am a daily pot smoker for a little over a year now and I have done mushrooms about 7 times previous to this experience, so I felt I had a good understand of what was about to take place, even though this was my first time taking LSD.

Setting:
Me and my 4 friends (who will be named c,b,t,and s for the sake of this article) were relaxing in B's dorm listening to music, a fairly secluded area of the dorm building and no one would be bothering us.  We had plans to attend an art exhibit later that day.

Pre-Trip:
B had acquired about 10 gel tabs of strong acid (so he was told, and later ended up being the case). S and I each took 2 hits, C took 1 and T took a little less than one (this was her first time with any psychedelic and she didn't want to overdo it) all at around 2 pm. B took 1 hit and he was also trying out a large dose of mescaline for the first time, but thats another story.
So we dropped around 2 pm, and hung out in the room for about the next 2 hours. 
As I mentioned above this was my first experience with LSD , I decided to take 2 hits instead of 1 because I have read that 1 hit of acid isnt nearly as potent as 1 hit of acid taken during the late 60s and 70s, I wanted to get the classic experience so to say.  All in all I was extremely excited going into the trip, not 1 ounce of nerves. 

The Experience:
I started feeling the effects about 1 hour after we dosed. I started to get a little visual distortion and I had a noticeable energy beginning to run throughout my body.  At about the hour and a half mark I began to really feel the effects. The visuals were getting strong as the room began to breathe in a sense and B had a ton of band posters throughout the room that looked so vibrant and liquid.  My mind was running all over the place. We were listening to Phish (cant recall what song now) and the music seemed to dance all around me, like I was inside of it. 

At about the 2 hour mark exactly T began to feel her effects fully and for some reason it overwhelmed her and she I guess blacked out, fortunately for no more than 4-5 seconds. Unfortunately for me I was just beginning to peak as she went limp (she was sitting on B at the time so he was able to cradle her and comforted her when she came to). Even though it was only for a few seconds, and before I knew it she was completely fine and really enjoying her trip, my mind began to run with the idea of what would we do if she really isnt fine, we are all tripping what do we do,etc. Fortunately everyone besides myself and C had taken LSD many times before and they were able to calm me down get me to get back into the music which seemed to ease my mind. Even though I calmed down I will never forget  the fear, the only way I can describe how I felt it was as it I was on top of a building on the ledge, and someone came behind me and tried to push me over the edge, that sense of adrenaline and intense fear was what I was feeling for probably about 45 minutes.  It took every bit of me keep my sanity together over the whole issue. 

S decided it was time to head outdoors for a nice stroll before we went to our planned location (a local art museum was having an amazing exhibit of Modern Abstract art, Dali, Van Gogh, Etc.) When I reached the outside I was completely overwhelmed by how beautiful the world looked, I had to actually turn away from the sun. The entire sky was morphing and moving like I had never seen, the trees swaying back and forth looked so graceful and beautiful.  We began walking towards the Lagoon, a pond with willows and other trees all around it. Along the way we stopped many times to just gaze away and really take it all in. (this is about 3-4 hours into the trip) We reached the lagoon and began to stroll around. The ripples in the water seemed to literally come at you, like I could actually feel them getting closer to me. Every tree had its own face and what looked like little mouths all over them.

We sat down at a bench that was near the water and lit up 2 joints, which began to make everything even more vibrant.  We eventually made it onto the ground somehow and we were all staring into the sky as the clouds danced everywhere.  I distinctly remember seeing the sun glow in the corner of the sky and seem to morph and change like a huge burning ball of gas (hmm wonder why) as it moved across the sky. The fractals I was seeing as I gazed into the sky were almost like stained glass,it was just amazing.  I distinctly remember saying (in these exact words) I feel soooo weird.but not as much as I feel awesome! that basically should describe my experience ha ha. 

We made our way over to the art museum (B attends a college in the city, so everything was within walking distance). We had a friend, K, meet up with us there just to keep an eye on us as we were going to be heading inside a museum, for obvious reasons. As we entered the lobby there were about 5 employees and no other people visiting the exhibit.  Surprisingly  I didnt feel the sense of anxious awkwardness I feel on mushrooms when in the presence of people who arent tripping (or people who probably arent cool with it), instead I felt extremely upbeat as we were about to view some of the most amazing pieces of art ON ACID!  We got inside the exhibit and everyone kinda began to do their own thing and head their own way. We were probably there for almost 2 hours. Let me just say that if you have the opportunity to view amazing art like I saw on acid, definitely do it.  The exhibit was filled with Picasso's, Monet's, Van Gogh, Dali, Renoir it was an amazing experience and I will never look at art in the same light again. After the museum (this is about 6-7 hours since dosing) we headed back over to the dorms where we lit up another J and began listening to some music just enjoying ourselves and having great conversation. We headed out to a nearby diner, we were all still noticeably tripping, so this was an experience in and of itself. I have never had such trouble ordering something off of a damn menu, Im sure the waitress thought we were crazy. There were a few other kids who came in after us and began being really loud and obnoxious so we decided it was time to take off. We ended up over at Ks place and watch the newest Futurama Movie. After the movie we went back to Bs dorm where we smoked a J and all got into some pajamas and turned on The Flaming Lips:Live in Kansas City Zoo dvd, which is where I fell asleep (about 12-15 hours after dosing). 

I didnt notice any after effects at all the next day except that I was in an amazing mood with a new appreciation for just about everything.

All in all LSD is an amazing drug that should be treated with the utmost respect, it can be a great experience but it is extremely powerful as I experienced during the peak of my trip.  I had an amazing time and can definitely say that I cant wait until my next experience with LSD. Happy Tripping!

The Night I Accidently did 4 tabs

Prelude
The experience was amazing, scary, exciting and definitely life changing.  I spoke about my LSD experience with a couple of good mates. Excited to tell them what happened that night I soon learnt I need to choose who I tell carefully. I feel it shocked and scared them and I think it affected our relationship negatively from then on. They struggled to comprehend or understand what I was telling them. I think it shook some core ideals and life beliefs. They are good mates who know who I am as a person and know what I told them actually happened to me and I think this is why it scared them so much. 

It has been nearly 4yrs since it occurred, I still remember it well but the emotional connection has lessened over time. For a long time just remembering it and talking about it brought back all the emotions I felt during the trip For a long time just remembering it and talking about it brought back all the emotions I felt during the trip like I was there all over again. I think that is also why it scared my friends they could see and feel my emotional connection as I told them. They saw how real it was for me. I can still see their faces stunned lost for words and struggling to process what I was telling them, unsure how to feel about it and not sure what to say afterwards. Eyes wide open lost and confused.

I think I am a rational thinking person quite level headed in most situations, I also consider myself quite mentally resilient a positive thinker with some self-belief. I have an open mind to lots of different concepts and ideas of what life and reality is both scientific and religiously. I think the mind has more power than we know and psychedelics could be a key.  I did not know a lot about LSD just that it connected and expanded your mind and perception of reality. I also thought it to be possible to control the trip to some extent. Do and be whatever I want. Maybe even think about things and find an answer or understand what I couldnt before.  A short cut to a controlled meditation journey of personal discovery where there are no boundaries and endless possibilities. This is something I was keen to try and do if I got the chance.  

Well I got the chance all right... down the rabbit whole I would go thinking I was a real super hero only to find out I was like a child in a costume playing super heroes. Unaware of what I was doing, where it was I was playing my game and that the big kids would soon teach me where I was.  

LSD isnt something I came across very often and was usually not in very high doses. So, I would take the opportunity when it came along. I had tried LSD a few times before the night that I am about to talk to you about. First trip I ever did was mild couple of little visuals nothing exciting it did open my way of thinking a little as well nothing exciting. Others I took had also been like this, some a little stronger.  TABS - 20 mics- threshold. Some slight euphoria and body high.

However, the next time I did LSD was with a good mate one Christmas eve and my first real trip. Had lots of visuals that made my surroundings change colours, melting and morphing of surroundings as well as lots and lots of laughing and more laughing.  Also, some strange but good experiences that occurred. Like feeling stuck in the mirror trying to work out which side I was meant to be on. My friend finally found me and yanked me out when I told him what was happening. I marked the kitchen tiles with a cross using a texter because they were shuffle boarding around so I was trying to track them.  And lots more things during the 5hr trip. Was left feeling exhausted but very excited and exhilarated by the whole experience at the end it was all good fun.  SUGAR CUBE - 110 mics- A hit of some really good LSD. Visuals are getting a lot more obvious now. "Ripples" over laying my field of vision. Patterns from all different cultures seen on walls, surfaces, faces etc. Closed eye hallucinations become more apparent.

The night I did 4 tabs of LSD
The night was like most nights at home with my wife and 2 young kids. The phone rang it was one of my best mates I have known since high school, call him J. Hey bro got some wicked acid if your interested man. 2 Tabs and you will be flying bro and hugging the unicorns. I thought yeah ok why not its only 8- 830 on the weekend. Would love to trip like I did xmas eve again. 

A little excited I headed around to mates place he was at. I knew the 2 guys who lived there and got along with them well. When I got there the house had about 3 people I didnt know at all and they were all tripping pretty hard! Have been for a couple of hours. J was also tripping but still holding a coherent conversation with me. Everyone in the house was pretty high after dropping 2 tabs. J gave me a bag and told me to tear away 2 tabs. I looked at the sheet saw the perforated lines running down. J said 2 are yours 1 is mine. I saw 2 perforated lines 3 tabs. Knowing I shouldnt touch them with my fingers I tore them apart in the bag. Pulling down one of the lines leaving my 2 joined and his separated. I pulled my 2 out and put them under my tongue and gave J back the bag. He walked off while I sat on the couch letting the tabs dissolve under my tongue. I was watching the others in the house. One mate is walking around the house stopping leaning on his front foot lifting his back leg pointing at people randomly while dropping the words Naaahhrrrnn Bread. Another guy is sitting at the end of the couch in his own world I didnt know him. Had one mate next to me talking random stuff to me about his day telling me to get ready to trip hard he was just starting to come down after having 2. 

It had been about 5 mins tabs were mush and I had just swallowed them and waiting for them to start. J comes back into the lounge room straight up to me and says urgently, bro how many did you have holding out the bag I said 2 as I pointed to his saying thats yours there. He stood up looked at me and said man there is 2 there. Wholly shit man you have just taken 4 Tabs. I said no there is the line I tore down your tripping man I had 2. To which J replied man there is a line running the other way in the middle look. As I looked closely I could just see the other perforated line running across the middle of the rectangle making 2 squares. Wholly shit bro you just had 4 of these tabs wholly fuck man!!!! Get ready you are in for a big night. By this time the others heard what we were talking about and responded just like J did. Still tripping but on the way down knowing how hard they had just tripped on 2 were all in disbelief I had just taken 4 and said to me your fucked holly shit.. Wow get ready man... holly shit gets ready. I thought to myself not many people I knew had tripped like I did xmas eve. And normally tabs are not as good as people say they are so I thought and then replied its all good I will be fine I have tripped hard before. To which they all replied Nah man get ready. I shrugged and said oh well to late now. So, I sat back and waited. 

J came and sat next to me and asked how I was doing. Good I am starting to feel it now the room is feeling different. By this time my other mate was back to randomly dropping the words Naahhrrnn Bread again and everyone went back to doing their own thing again.  I was starting to see things differently and starting to comment on things and began being a little bit obnoxious, starting to get louder. I felt like I wasnt part of the group and they were annoyed with me being here especially the guys I didnt really know. They were on the way down and I was heading up. I looked over to the guy sitting on the edge of couch. He had long ginger hair and a bushy ginger beard. All I saw was Dr Zaius from planet of the apes. He morphed into Dr Zaius right in front of me. I nudge J next to me and said man I think its kicking in bro. Hey Is that Dr Zaius on the couch bro. J laughed as I sang the song Dr Zaius, Dr Zaius. I was now seeing things in the room begin to change and morph. I started asking J about things I was seeing as if to confirm I was tripping. Things started moving and changing colours. J asked how I was going? looking concerned I could tell he was keeping an eye on me. I told him I was ok and I was starting to trip. The others wanted to turn off the lights turn up the LSD trip music with the TV playing geometric shapes and colours. I was just starting to see stuff in the room melt and change and wanted to keep the light on so I could see it more and interact with them. But they were ready to relax and watch the colours as they came down. The lights soon turned off music a little louder. 

I sat back into the couch and took a moment to assess myself and the effects. I was well and truly starting to feel it. I thought I need to settle in I felt it was building so I repositioned myself and really got myself settled in a comfortable sitting position on the couch. The bright colours moving and changing on the walls from the tv playing a LSD trans music video really kicked in the visuals. Colours got bright and vivid moving and forming shapes. I soon closed my eyes to not watch the lights. I felt I had a dry mouth and needed a drink, I opened eyes and asked for one the room rushed past as my eyes closed again. I had a drink I think?????? I soon got a rotten taste in my mouth it tasted disgusting. Opening my eyes, I was not able to see the room or my body in front of me. No matter how much I moved my head around trying to see the couch or J next to me nothing. My body feels the couch Im sitting on and the lounge room its in. I can feel the space of the room but not view it or hear it. I wondered if I had just drunk from ashtray or can with cigarette butts in it????? Confused??? Thoughts of my body interacting in the lounge room from a third person view I saw me chewing horrible things from around the room. I then thought I need some chewing gum I started chewing it was like I was chewing on something rotten. I started thinking if the others were messing with me or if I was eating things not edible and being that weird guy in the room. My mouth felt very real texture while chewing with a very strong bad taste. This passed by quickly. I now saw a room again it was dark, music was loud Im in a nightclub lounge with neon lighting effect. I could feel something had changed? I noticed it was that it not only looked different it no longer felt like mates lounge room. This all happened within 20min it pretty much went from reality to some slight visuals to reality gone. 

I was gathering myself and accepting the new room I was now in.  I could hear the others making comments like, I need to settle down, Yeah, he is messing this place up hope he figures it out soon. It took me back for a moment. As I started to look around where I was the room became more focused. I was there now I could see 3 people from in the house. Ok you are here with us now settle down and enjoy being here one voice said in a relieved way. It came from my right. It was the guy at the end of the couch. I felt it was still the same people in the house but they were different now they felt more real and I could feel their emotion projected onto me. I felt to be meeting the higher consciousness state of them also I could feel their emotional state of annoyance but then acceptance and happy. If you can project your emotion to someone they soon understand and stop. When you interact based on emotion you can feel the intent behind the interaction meaning you dont wonder if a comment or action was done in a nice or bad way because you can feel their emotion when they do. Even though they were saying negative type comments I didnt feel judgment from them it was from kindness Even though they were saying negative type comments I didnt feel judgment from them it was from kindness. I was not hung up on social norms or insecurities, the fake show we all put on is gone this is why I felt it was the real them. Even though music was on I realized how clearly, I could hear them over the music while on the other side of the room. This place was nice but they wanted to just sit in this space and be left alone. Conscious interaction with other people and the clarity of the room and sound was perfect and I was able to isolate and pick up a noise across the room like headphones. They kept going about with what they were doing before I got there. I didnt really interact with them at all they were not interested. 

I looked at the room giving it more attention. It had no doors it felt like a small retro night club lounge lite up in neon club lights. It felt like it was its own place with nothing outside the room but an empty void. I remember thinking wow this is amazing. Am I really in this place I ask myself? I feel like I have arrived somewhere. I now understand I have left my reality and I feel different? Strong not physical body strong, my being. I had projection of a me but it didnt feel any weight on it or interaction from room like a breeze or temperature. I realize where I am and have grasped what is happening and it was incredible.  

 OK now its time to play I thought what can I do in this place. Feeling this energy about myself I thought how strong I might be and what I can do. I stood up and sort of prepared myself to muscle flex I guess is best way to describe it. Exert my energy of self-outwards. I built up and released. A huge energy shockwave pulsed out of me and the room bulged out around me as I flexed and then came back in as I relaxed. Holly shit I couldnt believe that just happened. It was like realizing I have super powers. Still in awe of what I had just done so excited. I started to realized how much power I might have. I barely exerted myself. This place felt like I had found the real me and my reality is a show shutting all this off. I thought wow is this what we truly are. I felt excited and really happy still grasping with what was happening and accepting it  yet not afraid in any way. I felt excited and really happy still grasping with what was happening and accepting it  yet not afraid in any way. 

I was now feeling strong and centred as I stood there embracing the moment and this feeling. I heard this voice, He thinks he is powerful have a look at him. This was followed by sniggering and laughs. I look across the room and see these dark figures standing around a table in a dark corner looking over at me talking about me being intimidating. I now notice I am in a completely new room. I was standing at a bar by myself no one else was there except me and the entities in the corner. This room was like a VIP room or a nightclub owners room. For a couple of minutes, they messed with me being a little friendly then insult me. I was starting to feel intimidated and not sure what to do. Then I said to myself no I wont be intimidated, I wouldnt let that happen in my reality so I ignored them. 

I stood up proud and faced them. This didnt go down well. The figure that seemed the ring leader of the group crossed the room towards me in a sort of shadowing motion appearing then disappearing crossing the room in 4 motions finally appearing in front of me. He was an evil looking person. He had slicked back black receding hair, a sharp pointy face and nose with 2 little thin moustaches. He was thin and hunched over a little wearing a silk smokers jacket. He said to me, you think you are strong and in control. Yeah, I replied. Youre not in control. He had this ability to be nasty but then he would be nice and I would see him as nice. I did not care about the threats or intimidation from him like it didnt happen. Come with me he said I will show you something. I started following him. Then all of a sudden, I was seeing myself from an outside view but was feeling and experiencing as the me I was watching. Understand what I am saying? You ready this is when people freak out!!! I feel so happy enjoying what I was doing. I started to come back like I had been removed and no memory after following him to now. I become aware and back in my body I see what I am doing I was naked slicing through a body's abdomen with a butchers knife covered in blood. I look around to see butchered bodies and blood everywhere standing amongst them the evil man also naked covered in blood laughing hysterically. I started trying to process what has happened in disbelief I had done this and I felt the enjoyment I had. Then it hit me the realisation at the possibility that I may have just tripped out and killed everyone in the house. Hoping I had not done this a news story plays out in my head. A man on acid has killed and butchered 6 people. Found covered in blood wandering the streets. No way, I said. It didnt happen they are ok. I was instantly back in the retro night club lounge. The other oblivious still doing them. 

All I wanted to do was get back into that room with them. It took a little while to calm down and get back to that room. Finally, I was standing at the bar again, I hear them all laughing at me. Telling me Im a puppet and they are in control. Again, the evil guy appears in front of me being all nice again and eventually says come over here. I told him Im not going anywhere with you and he will never do that to me again. He vanished back to the table at the back of the group. 

They all start telling me its ok we are just playing with you its ok come on your ok. Another figure crosses the room becoming a rich gangster wearing gold jewellery, purple pimp suit and a fur coat and hat to match. He talks to me and before I know it, I am driving in a Ferrari going to parties living large. Feels like a couple of months had gone by of me living this way. I finally stop and say I dont want this, this is not whats important to me not while I'm in the place. Bang back in the retro lounge room. It doesnt take me very long to get back to that room this time. Again, they snigger and are being all smug. See we are the ones in control. I had a thought maybe people like Brittney Spears other celebrities and people that started behaving strangely it was these things taking full control of them. I couldnt believe how they were able to manipulate me to forget, to hypnotise me so easily. From making me feel shit and attackers towards me to them being friends and me going with them.  

I stood at that bar tall and facing them not backing down to them. Then a sexy Burlesque looking woman is next to me all over me I realize its another of the figures from across the room. Somehow, she gets me to leave with her. I dont know why or how they were able to trick me into going each time but they did. Was like being spellbound by them. Im now surrounded by gorgeous women having every sexual fantasy and desire I have performed to and for me. She knows without me asking, it would just happen. Again, I become aware and choose this to stop. I love my wife and we have crazy awesome sex, this has no value I have her and love her more than I want this. I dont want this. Back into the retro lounge I went. Now I am able to go straight to the VIP room. 

This time however I tell them I dont want anything from them you have nothing I want and I do not want to go somewhere with any of you. They were agitated and unsure what to do trying to approach me but I say no go away. Finally, I said you are not allowed to control me ever again. Another entity starts towards me NO, I said go away I dont want it. What happens next was something I will never forget.  The feeling was like nothing I had ever felt before it was so overwhelming. 

Two huge pure white energy beings entered the room they stood 2 stories high and had a Hulk-like build. They had no features just white energy in the shape of a Hulk. I look over to the table and see them all huddled in the corner in fear. No longer the tough bullies they acted like before, now scared and in disbelief.  I herd some comments from them. How did this happen he brought them together? These 2 have been kept apart for eons. How can he have done this? They have both been waiting for this moment the opportunity to come along to find one another like something big between them happened or they would get something is what I felt. The POWER I felt from these 2 was intense just so much POWER!!! I cant describe it for you to understand. It made me feel so small and weak like I have no choice or ability to stop anything they wanted to do. It hits me from the inside and pushes out and it is intense and constant.  They were taunting each other pacing the room like fighters sizing each other up taunting and building up to battle. I remember how excited they seemed to get this opportunity to finally get one another. So small I was and being constantly kept in the middle of them as they circle around back and forth. I couldnt help feeling like they were fighting over me in some way. Like Good and Bad, but I could not say one felt like the bad one. Was just what I thought might be happening. I said no way Im not strong enough for this, their POWER was too much and it never eased off me. I was standing in between them the whole time. Imagine standing between two Hulks ready to fight. It was too much I said I am not doing this nope this is too big for me. I shut myself down and thought get me out of here. 

I then found myself in this endless loop of no space forming for any longer than 2-3 seconds no train of thought would hold construction. Then I realised a loop had started again. I was 2 dimensional and would slide across a space. I was standing on my front foot back leg bent and foot in the air pointing my finger. And I would hear Naaarrnnn Brreeaad and back to chaotic visuals like thought was not able to construct a formation. Was like all alternate realities flipping past like channels trying to tune in but unable to hold it. 

What is amazing to me is that the whole time my inner voice or thought was always still me What is amazing to me is that the whole time my inner voice or thought was always still me like Im sitting here now and any other day. Even though I have no body or container my thought is always present and very sober and me. While in this loop I started to think I might have broken my psyche am I going to be institutionalised stuck in this state because this had been continuing for what felt like a very long time. Am I in the foetal position rocking like a crazy person. Is this going to end? I started thinking about my kids and how I need to be there for them and I cant let them grow up without me and how I am going to miss seeing them grow up. I have to find my way back from this for them I cant let this happen. Then I thought about my wife and her not having me there to help with the kids. I thought about how much I would miss her and how much I will hurt her being psychologically broken or dead. Then I just managed to pull in and hold onto an emotional connection I felt for my wife. I remembered how much I loved her and the love I felt. As soon as I felt that love take hold of me in the distance a green light shot up from the ground into the now violet sky above me on some plane of existence it had stopped on. It exploded high in the air and spread around the entire planet slowly a veil fell down to the surface. At the moment it exploded the feeling of love was powerful and totally immersed me. Total love and happiness washed over me. It felt euphoric with a strong safe protection from everything.  I wanted it to stay forever I couldnt hold it though. As it fell down to the ground it weakened until it went away. 

After that everything slowed down things started to construct again still spaces changing like new construction of reality passing by me. I associate it to trying to tune back into my reality of earth. I did find the lounge room again music off lights on and quiet, but could hold it this happened probably three times. Each time I struggled to accept I was back to my reality and it was real. It didnt feel or look right. I finally got back and stayed there, I questioned it was real again it no longer felt real it was just like all the other places I had gone past. But I felt the familiarity of it then I sat forward and realised I was back I found it yep I was back. I saw J which confirmed it and then the others. 

J was there next to me. Fuck man how you going? Holy Shit. Fuck me. What the Faaark. Shaking my head putting my head into my hands running them over my head as I threw myself back into the seat Fuck Fuck Fuck I stood up quickly and said I need to get out of here and went straight outside. J followed me out to the brick letter box. I leaned on it and just kept saying Fuck, fuck, faarrk wholly fuck man. J stood on the other side and leaned down. I looked at him I could see he was worried. I just shook my head saying holy fuck bro I went to this place I met some beings I left this place and I didnt know if I would find my way back, I was in this loop for so long. I proceeded to walk around in disbelief and processing it all. I was still able to feel their power when I thought about them it would nearly overwhelm me to the edge of control. 

I called my wife to come and get me I told her what happened she was amazing I mean concerned about me as I walked around the house in disbelief rambling and talking while processing what had happened and that it did actually happen. It was as real as sitting here right now except I know I was sitting on mates couch for like 3hrs while this happened. It's still a memory for me no different to any other life experience memory. I began having these ideas of connection and the flow of everything around me its all a dance of interactions. And if you dont resolve an issue or let go it wont go away it is just on a loop always coming back around to conscious thought. The more unresolved issues the more loops the messier the flow of your song for your cosmic dance. Like hitting the wrong note in a song causes a misstep to the dancer. Handle your issues or let go of them.

4 hits ~~ Impossible, astonishing things  happened.  ~ Extremely vivid time lapses. [experiencing past, present, and future events happening all at once] - Body movements were extremely confusing / disorienting. Trails were so intense. I could see what I was/am doing in my past / present / future; the transition between each moment blended together. I could no longer really see my own hand in front of my face. My intellect and observations become one. ~ I lost my ego, depending on my karma. Total loss of visual connection with reality. The senses ceased to function in the normal way. The loss of reality became so severe that it defied logic. Extremely profound loop / thought lessons. Harsh teachers arose [metaphorically speaking...or not].

Spring was here, the snow melted, the temperature started to rise and freedom from being shut in from winter gave its yearly relief. Some friends of mine and I planned on going to a festival in late May. This was my first festival and I was quite pumped for drugs and live music. Because I was quite excited and had to work late the night before sleep was something I had little of. We were running a little bit behind schedule but we made it. My friend (well call him Ole) was excited as I was and because he was excited as I was he too had little to no sleep. We struggled to set our tents probably and in the end I am glad it didnt rain like it was supposed to because my tent totally would have been soaked inside.

When I arrived and saw everyone else on various drugs that were going around my first feeling wanted to get on the same level as them. After watching the main band that we went there for it was roughly 12:30 am. During this time my other friend (well call him Sven) had gotten some Oreos that had two hits on each Oreo. We went to our tents and got some more Oreos. I took one Oreo and both Sven and Ole took two Oreos.

We sat in the tents, smoked Cannabis and visited with the guy we got the Oreos from. After he left my two friends and I decided to take a walk. My guess is that it was around 1:30 am. I started to feel the affects around this time. It rained quite hard earlier so the night was cool and damp. In my head as I walked through the mud I imagined it as the area labeled between two trenches during WW1 called No mans land. This is a place where I dont want to be. Not sure why No mans land was in my head, it could have been the cool and foggy weather which is quite similar to European weather and the mud reminded me of trenches. While I was in No mans land another feel of worry swept over me. The dark realization came in my head that I was in an unfamiliar place that I have never been to.

By this time I would say it was around 2:45 am. I was kind of paranoid of giving my friends a bad trip so I never once said anything about No mans land or being worried about being in an unfamiliar place. I would about twenty minutes later manage to tell myself to calm down and that I was in an unfamiliar place but it definitely was not a hostile one. I have taken LSD a few times before so I learned the ability control and ease my worried tripping mind.

My trip started to turn good at this point. I became mesmerized by the trees as they swayed in the air. The branches seemed to sway in the wind so harmoniously that it was as if I heard music and the branches were dancing to the music. I did notice that someone was playing some electronic music by their tent. This made me laugh pretty hard perhaps because the idea that whoever was playing music had no idea that he was helping in my trip and that amused me quite a lot. We decided to take our stroll towards the outhouses to empty our bladders. Id say when we went to the outhouses it was around 3:30 am. I stood in a pitch black outhouse urinating while directly at face level there was a hand sanitizer dispenser. Since it was dark enough the only thing I could see was the shape of it. I started to contort faces I saw on this dispenser. I was going between smiling and frowning. In my head after I contorted the face to frowning for about the fourth time I looked a little above the dispenser and there was the most evil demonic looking smiling face with triangle shaped teeth. This face was huge and it took up most of the wall I was standing in front of. I quickly looked down, shaked and walked out of the outhouse. I took a deep breath and said to Ole as I was laughing shit dude its fuckin intense in there. He agreed as he looked back the stalls (I have no idea what he saw in the stall he went in). We walked around more and at this point we didnt really have a whole lot to do so we decided to go back to the tent and smoke some more Cannabis.

When we got back into the tent we smoked a lot of weed mainly because it was something to do and we had plenty of it. There was this extremely annoying security golf cart that drove right by our tent because we set up our tents right by the path (there were slim pickins for tent spots when we got there). The light flashing was a little nerve wracking. But we learned to deal with it. Ole humorously told me that this is my castle and I have complete control of it. Ole is quite a big guy with a deep voice. As I looked at him looking out of the tent at other people he reminded me of this large goofy medieval general that was in charge of an army that was protecting this castle. It was very cartoon like and extremely funny. We continued smoking and thought it would be funny to shine our flash light at people walking by. One guy with a UN helmet came walking past and he dropped everything and said in a much panicked voice Im cool man, Im just looking for the bathrooms. The even funnier part of it was he was walking in the opposite direction of the bathrooms. Right now I can admit that I feel a little bad fuckin with the dude. It was probably the Cannabis

It was starting to get light out by now. Ole then assured me that if it rains I will get wet. I am sure it was true and that was something that made me a little uneasy but at this time I was laying down in the tent staring at this red line through on the tent roof noticing that it was getting light out. I knew that this would bring on new hallucinations so I popped my head out and enjoyed looking at the branches while admiring the colors of green in contrast with the whitish gray milky color of the sky. The time then was probably around 4:30-5:00 am.

I sat back up and realized that Sven has been a little quite. Right after me noticing that my buddy was being a little quite I noticed that red line on the ceiling of the tent again. That red line distracted me. I looked at this line and noticed that the red inside the line started forming what kind of looked like D.N.A. As I was completely staring at the line I listened to Sven and Ole talk. Sven was getting a little worried about the tent and it not being waterproof. I told him not to worry. I had no reason to give why he shouldnt worry but at this time I was too enthralled by the red line and honestly didnt at all care about the rain. Ole assured Sven that it would be alright and he should calm down. Sven then said no its not, its not alright. At this point t was obvious that Sven was having a bad trip.

Ole and I tried talking to Sven again. He was unresponsive. We asked him again still with no response. He was in this total vegetative state for a good few minutes. Ole then humorously said dude your tripping balls. Sven then just got this horrible look on his face like he was just rejected by the girl of his dreams or something. We asked him if he was alright. Sven then finally replied I am just losing my mind. I humorously retorted right, isnt it awesome just relax and go with it in an attempt to lighten the mood. My eyes were still fixed to this red line and watching all the different shapes flow through it like a river. Ole then looked at Sven and asked dude are you crying, do you need a hug? Ole replied with no, I fucked up. Okay, I must vaguely explain background of this. Sven has some legal issues and he is essentially looking at 15 years in prison. He thanked Ole for being such a good friend and I thought maybe these negative emotions were leaving him.

We sparked up another bowl and Sven told Ole I get it now. Ole and I were trying to figure out what he gets but we never really did. He would not respond to the question what do you get?  He said it again I get it now. We asked again what do you get? He looked at Ole with a very angry look and said in a stern voice why are you doing this to me! We asked Sven what Ole was doing and he wouldnt say. I tried to calm him down and I offered him a cigarette. He replied to my offer no I am turning my life back to Christ. I knew Sven was a Christian so I encouraged it and maybe thought it would calm him down or at least bring some kind of light in his head. Sven then said dude I am never doing acid again. When he said this I had it my mind that it was almost a mission or something of Ole and I to calm him down and turn his trip around. At this point also I stopped paying attention to the time but it had to be at least 6 am and we all were still tripping pretty hard. Sven then proceeded to speak in tongues and call out for Jesus to save him. This to say the least freaked the fuck out of Ole and I. I then said dude we have been in this tent for way to long, lets go for a walk.

Sven got out first, then Ole and me. When I got out of the tent (which was quite the challenge) Ole told me that Sven stared at him as he was hiding behind a tree right by our tent and then ran away. Ole then started freaking out. He said dude this is not good, some crazed hippy with his knife on him running around thinking that people are trying to do something to him. Ole has some anxiety issues and has told me before that he is a paranoid schizophrenic. He literally thought that Sven was trying to kill him. I calmed him down and we walked around and discussed this crazy situation. Maybe a half hour later we saw Sven being carried away by two Sheriffs and some security while he was screaming on the top of his lungs JESUS IS MY SAVIOUR, HES IN THE WHITE VAN!   I had all these thoughts racing through my head. I have no problem with the whole Jesus thing but when it turns into a snitch thing then its no so cool. If he spilled the beans in detail Ole and I might get into trouble for harboring a fugitive. I began to panic. All these thoughts were racing through my head. We walked by a tent of some early risers one of them said to Ole and I hey you dropped something. We were obviously confused and looked on the ground. The guy then said your smile. I knew this guy had no idea of what situation we were in or the seriousness of it but regardless I found my smile again. When he said that the uncontrollable smile I gave felt like a surge going in face then into my brain of utter happiness and relief. In my still tripping mind I told myself whatever happens, happens and there is nothing I can do about it. I can be all freaked or try to enjoy the rest of my LSD trip. This took a lot of will and mental power. I was going to title this report Triumph of the will but unfortunately that is the name of a Nazi propaganda film.

My buddy Ole on the other hand couldnt achieve the apathy my brain had towards our current situation. He wanted to try to sleep and asked if he could share my tent because remember he still thought Sven was trying to kill him. As Ole and I walked Ole kept on reminding me what was going on as I was noticing all the tents breathing or looking at some pretty girls. I wanted to just walk around more until the LSD wore off but Ole wanted to sleep as he told me its time to go to bed. Being the good friend I am I decided to try to get some sleep. My good friend was tripping and he thought someone was trying to kill him. If it was any other situation where we had two tents and he wanted to stay in mine I would have felt a little awkward. I lay down and tried to sleep. The distractions left and the only thing I had was my mind and my thoughts. I started to lose my smile again and became panicked. I asked for a Klonopin pill that Ole was prescribed to. This helped me calm down but I sure did not sleep. I closed my eyes and enjoyed the patterns that my brain produced. I dozed off eventually.

The next day Ole saw Sven sleeping in a cot by the security tent. Nothing happened, the Sheriffs were allowed to be there in order to help security if need be. The park was on private property so it turned out that the police really couldnt do much. I doubt they even knew of his current legal situation. In the end this trip made me much of a more mature tripper. I have learned that sleep is very important the night before dosing. I will not trip with anyone having something extremely heavy over there head. Sven and Ole were much more mature trippers then I. This experience also has let me learn that even mature trippers can have bad trips. I dont want to know what kind of hellish crazy world my friend Sven was in but because of what I learned from this event hopefully I will never be there. As freaky as this was this is something now I can laugh about.

Obama had just won presidency, and I was moved to tears by his emphasis on America's greatest assets being truth, democracy, and egalitarian relations (instead of conquest, military force, and wealth).  I celebrated all night, dancing spontaneously at numerous parties on my college campus, shouting 'here's to humanity, here's to our mother earth!'.  I got blissfully drunk.

Once inebriated and back in my dormroom at 4am, I took 3 tabs on a whim.  The duration of the experience happened in this room.

The trip was a rollercoaster:  at points I contemplated suicide matter-of-factly (absent of terror and anxiety), while at other points I was seeing a divine eye and matrix overlooking me.

For this report, I want to focus on the 'negative' experience, as I think it highlights the possibility for 'unwanted life-changing experiences.'

As the LSD came on strong, I was staring out my window.  I saw beautiful trees, greenery, and thriving life (including groups of students merrily walking), but this beauty was CUT and MARRED by the numerous roads and cars streaking like dirty death bullets through my campus.  This led to the realization that I was in the city, deeply desiring a natural habitat but unable to access it.  

I have always been a huge fan of human rights.  While not religious, I firmly believe in the human spirit.  This experience undermined and questioned what I thought to be a guiding force in my life.

I lost my ego to the force of 'human conquest,' strangling every last living beauty from this earth.  I realized that no matter what I did, there was no way to escape being a firm member of a destructive civilization.  The notion that an environmentally destructive civilization is the 'natural evolution of humankind' became imprinted on my cosmic view.

Since returning to baseline, I have re-questioned my unwanted awakening, and do not plan to change my course in life (guided by love for both the planet and humanity).  However, it was a deeply disturbing experience that irrationally stays in my psyche to this day.

Here's some unfiltered, free-associated thoughts I wrote down while tripping.  I recommend skimming it, as only a few passages are worthy of keeping, but I am including all of it for a wholistic stream-of-consciousness (note: 'fungus' refers to the exponential human population growth on this planet since the industrial revolution):


'ahhh, a further degree of technological relation.  self to self!  mode:  conscious express uninhibited happening.

flowing through.  pulsating.  everything is electric!  electrified!

To think that this existence, this ability to sit around and take acid, to mobble bobble, all this free time, to think its based off of the industrial revolution....the pillaging and raping of the earth...the species dying, the population rising, two roads cut through like dirt on this computer screen, cringing at my being, two roads cut through what should be all unified grass and green...   oh civilization is a strange thing. 


Somehow, it really HIT IT when we got MACHINES to start doing the WORK.  WooooooW, we can't sustain this shit man!  the earth is getting fucked! (resemblence of holding onto consciousness, no but let it go.  ability to express clear.  functionability.  clear.    (why delete anything)

up against all this political stuff, yes i'll put fourth my part to change, but i also can't help but feel that i am like a fungus, a colonizing force meant to choke this planet of life yet somehow fully realized and capable of doing it

blaahaahhahhhahahahh!!! fuck the industrial blah.  throw up.  blah.  FUCK THIS CITY.

FUCK  THIS CITY.  BASED COMPLETELY OFF POLLUTING CARS.  UGLY CARS.  CARS THAT CUT THROUGH MY SPACE.  CARS THAT CUT OFF THE TREES.  CARS THAT MOVE AT GREATER SPEEDS, GOING TO DISTANT UNKNOWN COLD EFFICIENT LOCATIONS, than any human being walking relaxed in harmon;soiefjsa;lifh

beauty is all around us.

all around us.

all around us.

psychadelic drugs are worth our time and contemplation.

we need to accept the current levels of global pollution are necessary to sustain the current levels of population.  gotta fuck less.  

get crazy after while in city.

nasty.  gritty.  grimey.  pollution.  blah.. blah...blahh....

hey sustainable technology used for GOOD CAUSES.  like this computer and the internet.  but wait.  i'm connected to the fungus again.

if you might as well just shoot yourself to stop the fungus spreading on the earth and choking it of all its life, then BOOM LIFE IS MEANINGLESS AND ABSURD.  

what happened to the music man?

HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY NOT BE THE FUNGUS IN A FUNGUS WORLD!?!?!?!?  FUN  GUS!!!  

well, you can eat local only waht your hands have put in on \produce takt eh tiem to walk places or even bike yeah okay

STOP BEING THE FUNGUS STOP THE FUNGUS STOP THE FUNGUS STOP THE FUNGUS STOP THE FUNGUS STOP THE FUNGUS

bounce bounce bounce!!!
WE GOTTA STOP THE FUNGUS ON THE PLANET ATAAAHAHHH! F UNGUS ON MY SKIN!!! HS;LFKHJASG;LHASDF;LJASG;LASHF;LSDJADSDOIHSA;FLJ!

lost lost lost

wonder how long you'd stay dead in this room? before they discovered your body.  

LOST IS THE CITY!

lesser population timeless evolution social quality interaction 

simply having fewer people around to get to know, or having to relate again and again in a community to the same peop

when we're all kids we're running around making sense making sense hahahaha IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

looking back over 

I WANT OUT!  I WANT OUT OF THE SYSTEM!

free everyone in the street

YOU CHOOSE you choose you choose information overload information overload YOU CHOOSE YOU CHOOSE (that sounds exquisitely robotic - FUNGUS!)s   

reflecting from a slightly less enlightened? (not inebriated, not intoxicated, no, just wanting to run nonsense and play, throw big balloons against the wall).  loss of ego during this experience was to human/population growth, colonizing the planet like a 'fungus.'  (industrial revolution is the innoculation (on a human population vs time graph, we start to show unrestricted growth right after the late 1700's to mid 1800's).  quite a nasty greater-ego. felt helpless, and therefore figured life is meaningless, as no matter what i do, civilization will continue doing its thing.  

BUT THERE ARE WRITERS SPEAKING UP EVERYWEHRE!  COURAGE IS COMING FROM EVERYWHERE!  YOU NEED TO SAVE THIS PLANET!  (ah, returning to self)

but you're surrounded with consumer shit, everywehre, and you're not living according to your beliefs.  

you are not living according to your beliefs.

keep pressing as you are, but PROMISE YOU WILL CHANGE my friend, after this degree, you will forevermore LIVE BY YOUR BELIEFS FULLY.  (to continue meaningless fungal force is to live DEAD (by golly that's what a fungus!))

uplifting.  uplifting.  

need to change asap.  asap.???

no.  its fine.  

simply no more acid until fully living according to beliefs?

ideally, this stuff should be taken in a space of FREEDOM!!!!!!!'

I had been wanting to try LSD for some time. Prior to my experience with LSD, mushrooms and DXM were my two trips of choice. Since some friends and I were going to attend a festival and planned on taking LSD there, I decided I would like to try it out before we went so I could see what my tolerance was and know what to expect.

My friend 'K' informed me that he could get some 'good acid' for only $15. So I gladly purchased a dose (one sugar cube). That night a friend of mine 'S' was having a cabin party out at a lake and I decided to take the dose and not tell anyone (I'm extremely perceptive and even more so when on psychoactives) because I dont enjoy having people that aren't tripping knowing that I am (it's all the weird looks, expectations, and pragmatics of discussion that make me uneasy). This turned out to be a good decision on my part.

I took the dose and joined my friends at the bonfire on the beach. It was already night and very dark out as I started to get giggly.

The onset took roughly 30-40 min before I knew I was indeed on a trip. The conversations around the fire took on a new level of connection. I felt I knew EXACTLY what my friends would say before they said it, which meant that I had a witty (often humorous) response waiting at the end of their every statement. This was a very good experience, around the bonfire, I felt the way MDMA makes me feel, deeply connected to my surroundings and the friends around me.

When I went inside to get a beer and use the restroom I noticed that I was soaring to the plateau of my trip. The bathroom was exquisite! The beach motif in the room, with warm colors and such, was amazing...it was clear I was on my way. When I came back out and gave my friend K a beer, he suggested we play a little nerf ball. Intrigued, I joined his team of 3 and inquired about the rules. Nerf ball consisted of two teams of 3 throwing a nerf (whistling) football and trying to hit each other from roughly 60 yards down the beach in the pitch black. Needless to say this was EXTREMELY thrilling while on LSD.

I was all giggles as we would turn our backs to the other team and wait for the whistle of the football to come our way. Imagine something out of an old war movie with whistling torpedoes wizzing past your head. I scored for our team by hitting someone on their team and I was ecstatic, feeling the way a child does when they have found an inner connection with a new group of friends (although this had been my group of friends for years and years).

After the game (at this time I was clearly plateauing) my friend K suggested a boat ride. This idea caught my attention immediately and I ran to secure a spot in the back of the boat. After cracking a few jokes with my friend R who was accompanying me in the back of the boat(and crying after laughing for so long) we left the shore and began to cruise the black waters of the lake. I recall repeating 'the stars sure are good tonight' several times, to anyone who would listen. Out in the country away from the city lights we were privy to thousands of twinkling stars. These stars were the focus of my hallucinations. I had never seen anything so beautiful as the stars that night, but I wasn't viewing them the same way as I did when sober. Tonight (on LSD) the stars seemed to be on several different planes of dimension. By this I mean that I could tell how far or near stars were, which galaxies shown the brightest and found it extremely easy to mentally map our boats progress by merely using the stars. It felt like if we were to boat to the edge of the lake we could just continue our journey out into the stars and space. They (the stars) were projected in a sort of 3D real-time where depth, distance, brightness, and location all merged together making me feel as if I could navigate our boat to anywhere in the world with no problems if I so desired. One last note about the night sky is that I found (and still hold, strangely enough)a deep interest in flying planes. Since the stars were so detailed in their location and depth I could see EXACTLY where the plane's trajectory was from and where it was leading it. Imagine viewing the sky, not as a 2D plane of reference, but more of a 3D aviary where I could see up to, under, and around all sides of a plane in the night sky. It gives me a very real feeling of superior vision.

After the boat ride, my trip began to slow down and die off small bits at a time. I found that smoking cannabis (I'm a daily user anyway) gave me a great sense of normality, making the come down easy and light; but at the same time highlighting what was left of the LSD in my body. Around this time I found a seat at the now dwindling bonfire and starred at the flames, falling into a trance of inner reflection. I study philosophy at a local university and found that LSD offered me a much clearer (than mushrooms) window into my consciousness and the systems of the world. I should note that my entire trip I found myself again and again wanting to write about what I was seeing/thinking/feeling. During this inner reflection a Japanese tourist/friend of a friend was also starring into the flames quietly. I couldn't help but notice her and what she was doing. After nearly 30 minutes of watching the fire she reached her hand into the heart of the burning pit, calmly and without haste. She reached into the flames so far that from my vantage point I could no longer see her arm nor what she was reaching for. Her hand emerged holding a small piece of wood about the size of a persons fist. She looked at it then proceeded to place it in a different place in the fire. As soon as she had strategically placed this insignificant piece of wood back into the fire; what was once a dwindling spark became the raging fire it once was earlier in the night. This absolutely blew me away, because for hours my American friends had tried to beat, stir, and add to the fire to make it roar...and she had taken this all in and when everyone had tried their method she quietly crept to the fire, healed it, and backed away so as not to incur any recognition for her deed. This gave me a great understanding of the Japanese culture and how americans always believe they can fix anything by merely adding to it, when in fact the solution is hidden in the problem itself.

After the fire finally burnt out everyone went inside to go to bed. I found there was no way I could sleep and decided to drive home and shower before work the next morning. On the drive home (it was sunrise) I found incredible inner peace and sanctuary, while at the same time feeling slight depression and mourning for the sensations I had while on LSD.

This trip report is a mix of a difficult and enlightening experience. However, at the time I was extremely emotionally and physically distressed. This report is to help others decide whether or not to take LSD, particularly people who live in the country and are used to being alone. 

My story begins on a late July evening. I had just finished a typical night of smoking some weed with my cousin (known as T) at a friend's house. When the session was over, they had explained the night prior everyone tripped and they had a couple tabs leftover. I had done LSD before with Ecstasy and totally fried my brain, but that was months ago.  I was pretty damn bored that night, with nothing planned after my cousin would drop me off. I bought the tab for cheap and my cousin and I were on our way.  

Cousin T and I were driving around, and I was pretty excited to finally trip without any other substance distorting the purity of the experience. I was pretty excited to finally trip without any other substance distorting the purity of the experience.  I had put the tab under my tongue, and she immediately replied "Whoa dude. I'm not gonna be able to hang with you all night.  You're gonna be feeling pretty crazy." I was 18 and pretty naive despite past history of drug use. I had no idea what I was getting in to.

She dropped me off at my house and I had yet to feel anything.  I did not eat much that day, which turns out to be a not-so-good idea.  I went up to my room and put on King of the Hill on Adult Swim. Suddenly, the acid kicked in.  A character's voice began speaking quite slowly, and I visually saw their mouth moving slowly despite knowing they were not talking like that at all.  This experience distressed me despite being mentally prepared for tripping effects.  My room was dark except for the tv, and watching this strange effect amplified the madness of the acid.  My anxiety grew, and I began feeling detached from reality. I did not lose my cool, but I went downstairs to let my parents know I was going for a night walk (this was a normal occurrence for me and did not spark any issues).  

Although I went on a night walk to help ease my nerves, I vomited profusely a couple of times.  It was embarrassing, as I'm sure some neighbors heard it. My dad had Neil Young playing on his outdoor speakers and I SWEAR I was able to hear clearly defined music for at least half a mile, despite other noises of summer nights in the country like crickets or neighborhood bonfires.  I thought that was an amazing feature, and I rode on that for the rest of the trip. On my walk, I was able to keep it cool when cars went by, even though the headlights were exceptionally bright.  Lights from homes which shone onto the road looked distorted in a way that is hard to describe: almost sideways, and curved.  My peripheral vision seemed cloudy and bent in a strange, almost flashing way.  To elaborate, the light in my peripheral vision seemed to flash, but I knew this was only an effect from the acid.  Regardless, it actually kept spooking me a bit and keeping me on my nerves. Whenever I smoked a cigarette, I knew I only took one or two drags, but my cigarette LOOKED finished. IT WAS SO WEIRD, and one of the funniest/strangest effects I ever had off a drug. I am going to assume that is from how fucked up my vision was. I wonder if anyone else had that experience. 

I began playing Sgt. Peppers, and when I reached Lovely Rita, it seemed like I lost my ego. I am unsure exactly, but I forgot that I took a drug. I just felt like I was the only person in the entire universe who did not feel "normal", and this is I believe the worst part about tripping alone.  I felt so far-out of myself, I could not relate to my surroundings in the cozy way I had all my life. I was very familiar with the surroundings I was in, but I felt disconnected I was very familiar with the surroundings I was in, but I felt disconnected, and vivaciously nauseous the entire trip. I am sure my empty stomach and low blood sugar did not help me enjoy my trip.

I ended up making it back home after awhile, and I attempted to make Ramen noodles to eat something.  As expected, this failed, and I did not have a notion of what boiling water had felt like, and I almost spilled a whole pot of it onto my hand.  I ended up eating fruit, but I was shaking from nerves about this entire experience and I vomited all over myself.  I tried to go back up to my room, as I realized no matter what environment I was in, I was going to be uncomfortable and distraught.  This was the worst part of my trip: I legitimately felt like I was dying. I attribute this to ego loss, forgetting I was on a drug, not having a trip sitter to ground me, not letting anyone know what I was doing besides my cousin, and not really having a good time.  I never ended up falling asleep that night, and I had to work the next day all day.  I had a smoothie for breakfast with my parents, but I vomited that up as well. I remember wanting to be near them, and being relieved at watching the sunrise happen the next morning. I came off my trip, but I felt so physically ass-kicked that I NEVER touched LSD again.

In short, this experience actually enlightened my life by showing me to appreciate the health I have (mentally and physically) and to appreciate the boorishness of sober mindsets.  To be honest, this experience occurred about 7 months after my mom died and I did not properly grieve or accept this.  My trip has shown me that physical death is inevitable,  but you must treat your mind and your brain cells with ABSOLUTE care. This trip helped me become a more responsible person, and to stop treating substances as the "answer".  

I do not regret taking LSD, but I always wonder if I would be a happier person without it.  I stopped talking to those friends and my cousin, as I realized how toxic they were using drugs for recreation so frequently while never achieving the dreams they always talk about.  Can't win all the time, I suppose.  Thank you for reading this, as this experience meant alot to me. I hope it can help others as well.

I was always interested in the the effects of LSD and mushrooms long before I was ever involved in drug use myself, mostly because I knew it had inspired some of my favorite musicians, authors, and other figures I admired.  I was experienced with marijuana, having been smoking for the better part of a year and had been actively looking for shrooms for close to two months at the time but the connections kept falling through.  When my friends told me they had an acid hookup who was good I bought three hits, one for me and two of my friends who I will call C and J, with a kind of nervous excitement.

My friend C ended up taking his hit a few days before J and I, and I spent the day with him to see how he reacted.  His trip seemed very mental, though just from smoking weed with him on a regular basis I knew he often ended up in his head while I tend to be enthralled by how things look and sound and was expecting a very different trip than the one he had.

J and I took our hits at approximately 4:30 in the afternoon a few days later in our dorm.  I noted the blotter paper had a vaguely metallic taste.  I kept the paper on my tongue for about 20 minutes until it dissolved and I swallowed it.  After swallowing our paper J and I went downstairs where he smoked a cigarette (I don't smoke) and then we went into the store and each bought a bottle of orange juice to sip on while we waited for the effects to set in.

Back in our dorm we were starting to feel the onset of the acid.  I had butterflies in my stomach and was feeling very excited, though I can't say for sure if this was the effect of the drug or just my natural excitement about what was about to happen.
To occupy our minds for a while J put on Wasp/ Behind the Wall of Sleep/ Bassically/ N.I.B. by Black Sabbath with the Classic iTunes visualizer on.  I'm not sure at what point during the almost ten minute song I actually began tripping, but when it finished and I pulled my eyes away from the screen the effects of the acid were definitely hitting me.  The outline of my hand specifically seemed to undulate, like it was breathing.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

It was at this point that J and I gave C a call to drive us around and smoke some weed as we had planned.  He took us out and we drove around our usual burn routes and the three of us smoked two bowls I believe.  The music playing in the car was all encompassing. I was trying hard to keep up in C who was quite talkative (as he tends to be when high) but the sensory experience was too powerful and I really didn't hear much of what he had to say from the back seat.  As we were driving I watched the clouds which had some of the most interesting visuals of the entire trip, the clouds seemed to bloom outwards into starburst shapes in time with the music we were listening to.  We parked beside a river which we had planned on going to watch but J vetoed the idea in favor of sitting in the car and listening to music.  I was fine with that idea at the time, enjoying the view of the bushes outside (the branches of which were waving around in a very lifelike manner) though in retrospect I wish we had gone out to enjoy the river.  Inside the confines of the car I started to get sucked into my mind and grew somewhat silent.
It's hard to explain, but it was as though my mind split into two halves, one that was caught in a standard stream-of-consciousness and one that was watching the other half critically.  The second, critical half kept questioning if I was tripping (as the visual effect of the drug was quite different than I had anticipated) despite the fact that I obviously was.  Every now and then I was struck by an epiphany, that the only reason my mind was acting strange was because of the drug and then I would be happy to watch the world for a while, but then I would sink back into the uncomfortable mind patterns.  A change of scenery probably would have done me good to keep my mind occupied, but in the end J and I went back up to our dorm thinking that the familiarity of our dorm was what we really wanted.

In the dorm I laid down on my bed while J chose music.  The acid was making me feel completely strange by this point, though it isn't anything I can really put my finger on.  Everything simply seemed completely alien to me on a fundamental level The acid was making me feel completely strange by this point, though it isn't anything I can really put my finger on.  Everything simply seemed completely alien to me on a fundamental level, I remember even my blanket felt strange.  J put on the Klaxons, a band that I wasn't familiar with at all, which added to the alien nature of the world around me immensely.

There is a period of time here that I lost.  I don't know how to explain it except in contrast to how I felt when I snapped out of it: When I sat up what felt like an eternity after laying down on my bed (though it was probably not very long at all) it was as though I suddenly remembered who I was and where I was, and yes, I had in fact taken acid earlier.  The period of time in which I was laying down was one without thought, not even comprehending everything that I was seeing, hearing, and feeling.  The one solid memory I have of the experience was the poster beside my bed, a Klaxons poster to match the music.  The poster is set up like a collage and all the pieces of it were moving around each other in a fluid and slightly disorienting manner.

After snapping out of my trance if you will I was quite worried about the road the acid was taking me down.  I was aware that the trip I was having was not what I really wanted to have but just the fact that I knew I wanted to have a better trip seemed to calm me down.  What I really wanted was something normal to grab on to instead of the strangeness I had been going through and thinking about my trip as just the effects of a drug was a good start to grounding myself in reality.  J had also been having a mental trip and was for us finding a change of scenery.  My depth perception was all messed up as we walked down the hallway to the elevator, it almost seemed like the floor was slanted.

Outside, J called another friend of ours, B, who invited us to his room to play a round of Nazi Zombies.  I got myself under control in B's room while he and J played videogames but still had an anxious, nervous undercurrent to everything I did.  After a few minutes we had to leave B so he could study so J and I stepped outside and I called a friend of mine, M, who was a very experienced tripper.  I told M I was on acid and he immediately asked if everything was beautiful and perfect.  I told him it was more strange than I had expected, almost too disjointed from reality and he helped to talk me down.  Just hearing his voice practically lifted the anxious feeling from my trip and made me feel comfortable again.  He told me some websites to go to and by the end of our conversation I felt like I had risen above the trip and it was no longer in control.

After talking with M I was feeling tons better, but J was still floundering with the drug so he and I decided to go on a walk around the campus.  Being outside felt much better and we found a good spot to sit on campus underneath a sort of bridge that connected two halves of a building. We probably sat for an hour or more, sometimes silently sometimes talking.  Outside I finally returned to some visual effects of the trip; the bricks in the wall across from me seemed to be moving, every other row seemed to be scrolling to the left or to the right.  I talked about how I underestimated the acid, how it was completely different than I had anticipated.  He said that he too wasn't having a normal trip but had been spending most of the time thinking about his life, school, and other concerns that he had been having.  We decided that while we weren't having a normal trip it was still positive in the end.  It had put things in a new perspective for both of us.  Sitting outside there calmed us both down and put us in a sort of self-cleansing state of mind.  The total experience had left me emotionally exhausted, the way I feel after a heavy cry and something I hadn't felt in a long time.

By this point it was after 10:00 pm (it was the first time I really became aware of time) and me and J decided to go to his friend A's house.  I was feeling down from the acid by this point (though still slightly disjointed from reality, like after a weed comedown) so I drove us to A's place where he and his girlfriend had been drinking wine.  The four of us all drank a bunch of wine, smoked a lot of weed, and watched Across the Universe.  The movie, alcohol, and marijuana all combined to bring back the tripping state of mind (though with virtually no visual effects) and left me feeling very comfortable, much more so than I had felt at any other part of the night.

In the end, it was a good experience in that it taught me how to trip.  If I could go back I would probably do it slightly differently but I'm glad I had the experience.  I wish I had understood the drug more before I took it so that I could have prepared myself more fully I wish I had understood the drug more before I took it so that I could have prepared myself more fully but I feel that now my next time will be much more positive throughout.  More than anything this trip made me respect LSD more than I did.  As J said to me: People think that acid is just like a cool light show or something, but really it can put you in your place.  It was, ironically, quite a sobering experience.

I had done acid maybe 4 or 5 times prior to this trip, as well as dabbled in a few other psychedelics (psilocybin mushrooms, salvia, DXM, etc), so I had an idea of what to expect, though I'm certainly no expert.

I had 3 hits of paper sitting in my closet for a good long while, being saved for a time when I felt I could put them to the best use. One such occasion presented itself, and I went to the Florida Everglades (massive nature preserve, for those who are unfamiliar) with a friend of mine, on a particularly hot day in August. In preparation, I packed a backpack with 1 gallon of drinking water, a couple dry towels, clean socks, and a large can of insect repellent. I definitely should have packed more water because we finished all of it about 2 hours after we got there. We never used the spare socks, shirts, or towels (just precautionary supplies), but the bug spray proved invaluable.

We decided to split the strip of 3 hits down the middle, and each take 1.5. As such I was expecting a fairly mild trip, but the hits were much stronger than I anticipated and the experience ended up being intensely vivid.

We each took our hits at about 1:30 pm (sublingually), about 10 minutes before we arrived at the park. We began by venturing down one of the paths into the dense thicket of trees. I first noticed feeling a bit nervous and jittery (I hadn't tripped in a while) when we arrived at a fork in the path. We arbitrarily chose one and continued down it. Effects were more pronounced now (about 2:30 pm), I could clearly hear the water jostling around in my backpack with each step I took, which made me uneasy. The repetitive noise annoyed me, but I quickly forgot about it once I started to see trails behind the flying mosquitoes. We persisted, not really taking notice of how far we were really walking. The trees and bushes were starting to come alive, as if there was wind blowing through the leaves, despite the fact that I knew there was no breeze. As I looked at the ground, lizards and grasshoppers started showing their faces, running rampantly out of the way as the giant intruders clumsily marched through. My poor balance was worsened by the rough terrain, but after hiking for 30 minutes or so I adjusted. I stopped to examine a giant, orange grasshopper and stared closely for at least 10 minutes. It was glowing this shade of neon orange that seemed completely novel to me. We turned back after reaching a dead end. We emerged from the thicket covered in mosquito bites and completely drenched in sweat, which must have made us look even more bizarre than we felt. The drain of losing blood, marching in the hot sun, probably breathing in fumes from the bug spray on my arms, and the onset of the acid made us crave for a break.

We walked over to a shaded bench to rest, feeling relieved to cool off and sit for a while. Now I could really feel the acid kicking in (about 3:30 pm). The ground was crawling and writhing, and my entire body felt like it was vibrating with electricity. Birds walking around looked much larger than I thought they should be, and I felt a curious confusion. 

After a brief rest, we headed towards the boardwalks overlooking the swamps. There were quite a few other visitors bopping around, and they all looked and sounded so foreign to me, which at first I attributed to the drug's effects. After trying desperately to analyze someone's speech, I realized he was speaking French, and so was everybody else around us. This threw us into an intense state of hilarious confusion, and we could not stop laughing (loudly), making a mild spectacle of ourselves. Later I reasoned that a lot of tourists from French Canada probably come to the Everglades during the summer, but it made for an amusing twist at the time. We regained our composure and began hearing really foreign sounding animal noises as we approached the swamp. The only way I could describe it is to say that it sounded like a swamp ape, or some such mythical beast. The mention of the swamp ape sent us into another fit of hysterical laughter, which recurred every time it bellowed its primal grunts. The harder we tried to stifle our own laughter, the more uncontrollable it became. Acid has never made me giggly in the past, but I wasn't complaining, it was quite euphoric.

Once we got close to the swamp, we spotted a group of alligators, and I stared deeply into the eyes of one of these alien-looking reptiles until it swam away. The water was so clear, and although gators typically strike me as unpleasant looking, they appeared so beautiful at the time. Any irrational fear that I would normally have of being that close to one vanished, and all I could do was stare in amazement into its big black eyes. The gators seemed to pick up on it, and gravitated towards us during most of the trip. I should mention that we were safely separated from the swamp below, being suspended on the railed boardwalk about a foot above the gators.

By about 4:00 pm, we found a scenic spot to stare at the vastness of the swamp and delve introspectively into our individual experiences. The reflection of the sky glistening on the surface of the water looked like millions of sparkling blue diamonds, so bright that I had to squint to look at it. More positivity as I stood calmly existing, allowing myself to appreciate the beauty of the natural landscape. I took a second to look around me, I noticed about 10 other park visitors near us, trying to find what we were looking at. I guess my friend and I were both staring at the water for a long time, because they mistook us for keen observers of nature, when in fact we were staring at things they couldn't see (and likely never would). I nudged my friend to point out what was going on, and once again uncontrollable bursts of laughter flowed from us. The French tourists must have thought we were awfully strange; thankfully none of them felt alarmed, just shrugged us off as crazy Americans.

In another area, we see a gator jump into the water and swim towards us at high speed. It seemed alarming at first, but once it got close we saw something wrong with its leg. Once it was close enough we saw that its leg was in fact missing, and a bone was jutting out where the leg should have been. It was a little shocking initially, but the gator seemed just fine, swimming gracefully. It made me think of how a gator can sustain such a massive injury and continue living its life. No complaining, no self-pity, no medical treatment or moral support, just straight instinct and survival. I couldn't escape this thought, and I noticed that I was silently arguing with myself about the pros and cons of living in a structured civilization, as most humans do.

Starting to lose my grasp on reality now (about 5:00 pm), I see tourists in the distance imitating apes. I begin to lose my ability to tell the difference between the animals we observe and the humans observing them, as they seemed like such spectacles themselves. Overwhelmed and stuck in a loop with this uncomfortable feeling, I sat and concentrated on my visual experience nearby, watching the planks of wood unfold into vivid medieval battle scenes. I'm not really sure what prompted that type of visual, but I was grateful for the distraction it offered. 

At around 6:00 pm, we decided it was a good time to smoke the joint we had brought, and the weed added a pleasant lift to the otherwise dreary mood I was feeling. 

After a couple hours of continued exploration, we started to come down. The sun was setting at about 8:30 pm, and we headed out just as the mosquitoes came out in full force and devoured what was left of our flesh. It felt oddly refreshing. We got in the car, cranked up the air conditioning, put on some electronic-ish music, and drove out in our vessel of modern technology. The stark contrast was amusing, and was emphasized when I (accidentally) drove through a spider web on the way out. I jokingly said 'Fuck you, nature,' and we laughed once again.

We arrived back at my friend's house and sat on the porch discussing everything that happened. It was the most complete trip I've ever had. Despite being fatigued and covered in bites (not to mention smelling like shit) I felt refreshed from using my mind and body for 8 hours or so, drawing in so much experience and putting out so much energy. Also, I don't think I've ever laughed that hard and that frequently in any 8-hour period, which added to the pleasant afterglow. 

As I said, I've tripped a few times before. My previous experiences allowed me to (barely) keep myself composed despite being so overstimulated. Point is, tripping in public, especially in the afternoon, is tricky and potentially dangerous, so I'm glad I waited to do it until I had a fair amount of prior experience.

[Erowid Note: 
The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 

First off let me start by saying that I was not in the correct frame of mind for this experience, although I managed to enjoy the hell I percieved that night. 

It was two days before halloween and I had read thouroughly into hallucinogenics before deciding what it was that I wanted to spice up my halloween party with.

The night started when I had taken two tabs of what I believe to be LSD-25, and after being mugged of forty pound I recieved a phone call of a close mate who was eager to test the potentcy of the drugs we had just recieved. I had a further 13 tabs in my pocket at this point. On the way up to his house and after being lost for an hour walking up and down the same damn road and making numerous phone calls I finally managed to catch up with him. 

At his house we took two tabs each and waited for the effects to kick in. Being the impatient mug I am I decided to take 4 more and to my suprise nothing happened. Waiting a further two hours still nothing happened. Getting frustrated I took a further two and supplied my mate with another 3. At this point nothing out of the ordinary was happening at all, so I decided to go outside for a cigarette. As I was smoking it I looked up at the door infront of me and a kaleidoscope of colours streamed through the window, all the colours of the spectrum. I thought my mate was playing a trick on me to wind me up. In my mind the tabs were duds and he had aquired a disco light. Then all of a sudden the door started petruding, falling back and melting. The glass bowed and distorted forming patterns as it did it. I thought to myself what the f**k have I just done, I've taken ten tabs of some really dodgey stuff. A third scared, a third curious and a third excited I proceeded to tell my mate that I was tripping my balls off. I looked at him and in a flash he turned into the devil then in another flash into dracula. Then back to normality. I thought it was so damn cool lol. We looked at the tv, previously playing a racing game and set on pause the tv began to reveal crypted information. We both saw a skull with a  cowboy hat, a monkey smoking a joint and a turtle moving about the bottom of the screen and lots of trees swaying about. This really started to excite us as it was just so bizzare, I've had mass hallucinations before but nothing that similar. Its almost as if our minds were on the same wavelength and we were transmitting our thoughts into eachother. I focused on the screen and eyes proceeded to fly out of it, then a white light filled my vision and then disapated. The trip had started.

Now exact times are hard to remember and there were so many events happenign this night that I will try and put them in order of time. But to me the time is fairly irrelevant, what matters is what we saw and what we percieved.

We left the house as I wanted to go to the local woods to find a cure for cancer and kill some demons as I had heard that shamans used the underworld as a means of finding cures for diseases. I looked back at my mate whos name I later found out translates into prince (what the anti christ shall be called) and his head was a pyramid and he had one huge eye at the top of the it. His long hair curled out into fractals and so did the edge of my vision. At this point I was so crazy that it all seemed very mundane. I looked up and saw the moon which seemed an infinite distance away with tunnel of clouds surrounding me and leading all the way towards it, spiraling and swilring around. Its very hard to describe as it was so intense. It was literally the best thing I have ever witnessed in my life. My mate with one eye and an unaturally huge smile said maybe if you do more than three tabs you are crazy, this just made me laugh so much. I stopped as we were walking as a tree caught my eye. The branches morphed and moved gathering together, they formed a face. I looked behind the face and it split up, I proceeded to do this a few times then grew tired of it so I stared at the face and as I did this hundreds of eyes spewed out of its own. My mate called me and we continued. At this point my hair felt like it had tentacles reaching out into space and my head was exploding and projecting my imagination into the sky, it was comprised of spirals. It was a very wierd feeling. 

Throughout the night I kept feeling satan licking the top of my brain witha  sand paper toungue. 

Arriving at the woods I looked down at the floor which was now the sky, brambles sprouted forth and I took care to balance on the brambles not falling through into the sky. I looked up and saw a flower in a spot light, but brambles grew and got in the way. I cut through the brambles with my hands, picked up the flower. In an attempt to find the demons I cut through the trees infront of me. Disintergrating them with my hands and the flower. I'm not fully aware if they were there or not but I presume they werent as how would I chop them down with a flower. Oh well not too much of this makes sense anyway. I finally came in contact with the demons then. They had dark eyes and big grins with sharp teeth. There were three of them at this point and they grew bigger and bigger, I was going to kill them, but they drew power from my fear and would have overwhelmed me if it was not formy mater turning me around. He was pranging at this point and rightly so. We were two teenagers in a wood on acid at 4 in the morning. As we walked through the wood we looked down and to our amazement felt something out of the ordinary beneeth us, and looking down we realised the actuality of the fact we were currently balancing on dead bodies floating in a giant river of blood! We edged along it holding onto eachother carefull not to fall in. My mate said ' (my name) are these dead bodies in a river of blood' I reasurred him about this. We couldnt believe that we both just experienced this. We found a park and decided to have a walk and try and suss out what on earth had just happened. There were now thousands of demons but they cud only stay in the shadows and the moonlight  meant this was a very constricting factor indeed. I was very lucky as otherwise I would have been swarmed completely and probably would not have been here to even tell the story as I now what happens to people that recieve trauma on acid. They are left in a paralell world forever. And seeing as this wasnt the prettiest state of mind  in the world I probably would have killed myself fairly shortly after. After assessing the situation we decided to walk back to my mates house.

On the walk back there were big demons in the sky throwing lightening bolts down the the earth and when I mean big I mean giant like 400 metres tall.  It was the coolest thing I've ever seen ever, hands down. They kept shifting their stance moving about and twisting. I started coming down a bit at this point and could vaguely make out people in the distance although they were covered in a  shrowd of movement, colours and general distortion. We saw a woman in her house and stared at her which must have freaked her out as it was like 5 in the morning and we were out of our faces. But she was virtually unregnisable and impossible to define.

When we got back to my mates house he still had one huge eye and all the photos of him as a child in the house had one eye. It wasnt like I focused on them and they morphed. It was instant. I could not get my head round this at all. He decided it was time for sleep and went to bed. I went for a shit and realised I was still a pathetic human, I looked in the mirror and my skin began to melt, all over, I looked at my hands and they did the same.  I tried to get to sleep and did manage eventually although I do not know how. As I was distracted completely by this shape on the wall like triangles but longer and more curved, three of them with thousands of eyes coming out of it. There was nothing on the wall but everytime I looked at it there was this thing doing shit. It started to freak me out. I smacked my head against the wall and as I looked accross it there was a street with lamps that were lit up stretching out into infinity with no horizon in sight. I put my head under the cover and lights flashed up every where it was like a miny city underneath the cover. I looked out this door that was left open and it was very tempting to go outside. My major regret of the night was not going outside because who knows what would have been waiting for me out there. But then again that could have been my downfall aswell. It will just be one of lifes misteries you know. Like why does order come from chaos. 

Anyway the next day I missed uni as my head wasnt intact at all. In the morning the tv still had the skull and all that breeze although my mate couldn't see it anymore, and all the photos still had one eye.  I sat on a park bench and a butterfly flew around me three times. It landed becide me  and its wings folded up then started distorting and crunching into different shapes. It looked so real. I actually thought it was real. The grass around me formed patterns that were completely obvious. I returned to my flat and all the posters on my wall were distoring and growing lumps out of their heads so I ripped them off the wall. Peoples heads were distoring all that day, I was worried it would stay like that forever and I prayed to god to cure me. The only remnants of the trip after that day lasted about two months were ever time I grew paranoid and I was with some they grew a giant smile and their eyes turned black, oh and things looked like they were moving when they werent. I also had some crazy closed eye visuals for a while aswell. Thank you for listening as this is a good outlet for what I experienced. If this gets posted I might put up some of my other experinces and id be interested to see if anyone can make any sense of it.

A Recollection - - Communion

I am finishing up my time at college, and will soon be embarking to the east--to explore the world that was shown to me on the night of my very first trip, and the strongest most pleasure Communion I have ever experienced.

I want to preface this with the fact that like many other Psychonauts, I began as an atheist. My childhood was damaging, abusive, and painful - - and the remnants of that had followed me in a cold shadow all the way into college. It had gotten me in trouble with substance abuse--alcohol, benzos and the like. I felt very disconnected-- a sack of potatoes in the pitched shipping container of life. There was no divine spark.

That all changed in my sophomore year. I'm studying in the SF Bay Area, and so exotic substances are much easier to come by. On my campus, there were multiple resources to hook you up with any drug imaginable. I had always been interested in psychedelics, and when the opportunity presented itself, I purchased a high-dose gel tab (250 mcgs) and awaited The Call.

It came on a lonely saturday-- my school is a commuter campus and dies on weekends. Surrounded by the forests, in the waning days of summer, there was no better time. I ate a late lunch, knowing I probably wouldn't be eating till night, and dropped the gel at the tail end. It was around 5:25.

I went up to a local smokers spot on campus in a forest-flanked meadow to chill with a few friends. We smoked some weed/tobacco mix (colloquially known in Cali as 'mokes'), I told them I had dropped, and we waited patiently for the effects to kick in.

0:25:
After a few bowls, the high had initially outweighed any detection of psychedelic activity. However the now-familiar feeling of anxious belly-flipping began, and I noticed a strange slanting in my thoughts. I had always been an intense person, with a sort of mental tunnel-vision, but almost like coming out of the Cave, my mind began to really look into the world as a whole. It was almost sunset, and the sky took on the familiar pastel color of the late-day sun. As I looked up into it, I saw an infinite array of subtle dots floating between the clouds-- almost the way it looks when you close your eyes and the dots swim in your mind. I hadn't realized I was staring for so long, one of my friends asked,

'What do you think?' 'What do you think?' 

0:45

The effects had truly begun. Surrounding me was a forest of trees with wooden fingers, reaching into the soil. In their branches, I saw the complex of the human lung. I heard the rusting of the branches as an intense symphony of breathing sounds. They began to move in flowering tessalations to the rhythm of the wind.

'they are a sea of giant silent lungs!' I laughed, staring deep into them.

I heard the rocks, I heard the trees. My mind suddenly began a sort of Recollection-- a gathering of knowledge, slotting it into a grand scheme like a great cosmic puzzle. The passing of the seasons unfurled in my minds eye, and the trees loved and died and rebirthed endlessly as silent guardians of their time. 

The mountains shimmered with dead grass and I heard something whispering in them, indecipherable for now. 

I began laughing uncontrollably, my mind whisking from possibility to possibility, leapfrogging across the disciplines with a grand unfolding. I saw the rocks, the trees, the clouds, my friends-- all of us created in particular-- but by what?

1:05

My mind was now completly submerged in the waters. The sun was beginning to set, and the sky was painted with the most spectacular hues of scarlet and gold. The clouds-- in this strange almost purplish Grey-- roamed as pilgrims above us, twisting and dancing towards the east where the colors shifted into vivid teal and lavender of the earth's shadow. In this moment, my first internal Speakings began. 

I asked, 

'where are they going?' 

And a little part of me, but not me at all replied, 

'they are returning.' 

Confused, I was now immersed-- and my friends had noticed. They asked me questions, but I could not reply very much outside. I ended up repeating astonished 'woahs' on an endless fractal loop.

1:30

All the while, my mind was synthethizing my entire life's knowledge. Everything intrinsically connected, and I saw the world as an infinite complex of things. Spirits? Souls? The womb of some cosmic Creature? 

I began recieving variations of visions-- the first of which was a huge universe string. It was breadthless, all-colored, and vibrating as an atom. It glowed with a light I can only describe as heavenly, and I knew immediately that this was an image of the spirit. I attempted to touch it, and it was cool in my mind. Inside I could faintly locate galaxies, spinning like bubbles in a glass. On either side of its endless length was a vast, reddish emptiness.

I closed my eyes-- I study linguistics, and the characters and letters of multiple languages began to morph into each other, in flashes of rose pink and aqua blue-- I traveled through a maze of Japanese, runic characters, English into German, French, Dutch, Cyrillic-- as the story of Tower Babel was demonstrated. I spent alot of time in this state, taking in the Western Tradition in psychonautic context. It was beautiful, and at multiple times tears welled in my eyes as I truly rediscovered childish beauty. 

My studies of history, English, geology and the like were politely arranged in a coherent narrative that has become the foundation of my personal philosophy and spiritual development since. It was a moment of intense clarity, and one that I still look fondly back upon.

2:00

Now there was a significant tonal shift--I Called it the Slump.

I returned rather sudden to the real world. A new group of strangers had entered the meadow, and started to smoke with my friends. They were alien to me and caused great discomfort. They did not like the fact that I was tripping, and I was forced to exit the ethereal realm and attempt to converse with them. They asked me what I saw, and feelings of righteous anger welled within me. It was difficult to speak, so eventually the strangers let me be and began to talk with my friends. I listened to them talking, and I took on an almost psychic quality.

I could hear their inner souls. They spoke out loud, but it was as if I could hear through their words to their core.

They were like men at a masquerade, hiding behind skinny masks. Inside, I could tell they were immensely uncomfortable. Partly because of me, partly because of themselves. Like Holden Caulfield, they echoed phony language and basic culture-- nothing transcendent as I had just experienced.

I feel bad about it looking back, but I was immensely self-righteous and totally in mastery of others thoughts. I could hear their insecurities, their fears, their wants and dreams-- and none of them had to say a word. I was attuned momentarily to the psychic world-- I have never repeated this experience in all the trips I have had since. (After the trip I had relayed my observations of the strangers' lives to my friends. They told me I was about 80% accurate in my observations).

2:20

I became increasingly uncomfortable as the strangers remained and the sun finally set. The sky had lost its mystic beauty as night beset us. I decided it was time to go, as I could feel the peak beginning and knew this was not the place to enjoy it fully.

I bid my friends farewell and set off on a solitary walk around campus. It was almost silent, and at once I felt more at peace. The nighttime looked steeped and saturated with color-- midnight blue and navel orange was everywhere, and I listened to Op. 95 'From The New World' on my headphones, trying to recreate the majesty of earlier. The moon rose from the east, above the mountains, and I was at once called by an interior force. The moon had an aurora around it, shimmering rainbow and silver. Like the Pharos of Alexandria, it guided me from both within and without. At this moment, my first true Speakings with what I can only describe as The Cosmic Voice began.

2:30

I was peaking, and sought to personify this in the physical plane as much as the mental. I ran without aversion through the bare forests on the side of the hills that flanked our campus, up to the top where an observatory sat. I made it, breathless, and finally alone. The valley stretched out before me, and I could see fields of lights in. All directions. I felt like a blood cell in a giant body of earth. 

At this point my memory becomes fuzzy, as the peak and the array of feelings I was experiencing overwhelmed my memory.

I saw the stars, and they seemed closer than ever before. They twinkled in rainbows, and I could almost see in the twilight atmosphere where our world ended and space began. Suddenly a voice appeared in my mind and began asking me questions. Suddenly a voice appeared in my mind and began asking me questions. It was reassuring at first-- 'How are you feeling?' 'Are you happy now?' 'Have you found something new?'

We talked, sometimes inside and sometimes aloud, for a while. At first I accepted it as me talking to myself, but over time I realized that this part of myself was totally intrinsic, did not share in my ego-- and almost completely omniscient. It would answer my questions as I asked, and never hesitated.

I do not remember everything I asked, only a few choice questions and answers, and these are paraphrasings rather than the actual conversation, which has been almost completely erased from memory. 

I asked,
'What are you?'

It replied, 'I am you so you can know.'

I asked, 

'why me? Why my pain?'

It answered, 

'so you can know this place in all ways.' 

'Are you God?' 

'I am as you want me.'

'What are you doing this for?'

'I had to.'

'why?'

'Else I would not exist.'

I felt a strange unease. It was instilling me with a concept. I closed my eyes and saw a flash of pure chaos, the thing chasing my god, the almost cosmic war between order and pure obliteration. It was a blackened gorge of blood red and green that devoured everything and sought to envelop my God, holding the universe within itself as a clam holds a pearl. I saw it for an instant, but began to literally weep in pain and fear.

'I did not want to show you the things you do not know.'

'but why can't you tell everybody? Return everybody?'

'that I do not know.'
(this was bullshit and I knew it, and The Voice knew I knew it. It was quite funny at times, in some ironic way.)

'What am I here to do? I want to speak about you'

'There is someplace for you to be. There is someone for you to see.'

This I did not understand, and began to argue with the Voice. It expertly disarmed me every time, echoing my words off the hillsides and teasing my lack of knowledge. I didn't take offense-- I laughed, because I knew I was speaking to my true teacher. It felt like a mother, a father, a pet and a master at all the same time--but it was within me, channeling through my mind from the outside, from the abstract, communicating telepathically through the modulations of my brain. 

'Give to yourself the gift you have been given. I cannot give that to you in this way.'

'I am the things, and they serve in their way. I cannot, anything more than that.'

'you were spared from another. Make yourself in that way.'

I laughed, cried, danced and yelled at this Voice-- as over time it became quieter and quieter, until it integrated back into my ego and disappeared.

3:30

At this point the peak had ended, the fractals were over, and I was tired. I made my way down the hill, glittering with leftover euphoria from being utterly convinced of the spirit and of my god. I was a soul again, and this cured my depression and set me on a path for knowing my god more. I met with one of my friends, and gave him a hug. I told him that when we laugh with each other, it's because we are both hearing God in the same way. He said God didn't exist, and this made me sad. I knew what he meant, but it made me sad anyways.

I went back to my room, where I rested, contemplated, as my brain began to scrub the knowledge I had been given. Eventually I fell asleep after taking some Nyquil, and awoke with an awakened spirit and new eyes.

Conclusion--

This was a profoundly spiritual experience. It cured my depression and atheism, and put me on the path to becoming a Psychonaut. Since then I have had many other trips-- some with visions of the Voice, others when I encountered the Chaos. But my entire world was rocked by this trip, and I will never forget it. I hope to break through further with other psychs, such as DMT and Ayahuasca.

I'm not afraid of death in the same way anymore. It'll be the ultimate leap-- a moment of gut-wrenching fear, then ultimate peace as my information is reintegrated into the universe and restored into the womb of the Cosmic Voice. I want people to hear my god and find their own, as it expresses itself through all souls in different ways. I truly believe this God is all Gods, and speaks in all Poetics and order equally. It has made me intensely reverent of the world, and of the fractals of the Voice that inhabit it.

Time lost its meaning years ago. Years?

'Picture yourself in a boat on a river...'

I grip the twin-sized boat-mattress for life support. Questioning reality, and the existence of an infinitely small number, I ponder my sanity. What makes it possible for me to make it possible to take this substance, and why is it possible? I questioned psychedelics as a whole - what do I get out of them, besides beginning to question the very constructs of my own brain? Lacking proper judgement at the time, I felt as if my brain was becoming bankrupt over and over again for questions it didn't have answers to. I felt as if my brain was becoming bankrupt over and over again for questions it didn't have answers to. 

At around 2:30am, I connected with my cat in an incredible way. As if the process of the tracking mechanism in a jet's missile launching system was in reverse, he absolutely freaked out to say the least. Hopping around the patterns on the floor, it was obvious I had affected this creature using my mind and body language.

I realize how much friendship plays a crucial roll in how I maintain a day to day life - simple things like a chat conversation affect me in so many subtle ways that must built up in some way. It becomes apparent to me music taste is heavily influenced on one's personal tempo. As far as hallucinations go, I visually witnessed the question of whether God exists in my desk, and it's impossible for me to answer with logical thinking. However, do I really think all of this is possible because of chance?

My room's center table retracts its legs and begins to float into the air. The Capri Sun's drink art of a beach part turned into an alien acid drinking bath. Cars outside sound like space ships launching at hyperspeed. My speakers fill with color, flowing like a DDR step chart with 50 feet in multiple ways. My icons on my desktop float, as if bobbing on top of the water. It becomes absolutely obvious how the Beatles were influenced by psychedelics. The album art of Revolver shows just how much these guys were directly influenced by this type of thinking. As I listen to several Beatles songs (Strawberry Fields Forever, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Taxman, etc.), the pictures I am staring at literally come to life. Focus shifts in the photographs - I can see and feel the wind pushing elements of the trees in pictures. Top-down, aerial photographs of the Earth warp into 8-bit style pieces of art. I find it particularly amusing how I can transform pictures at will into cartoons / 8-bit creations. One extremely memorable hallucination was watching a picture of the coast of California turn into top-down Starcraft-style spaceships engaging in war, while transporting troops on a dynamic playing field.

Memorable thoughts:

- does M.C. Escher's art make it more trippy for you when you're tripping? 'Hawww tripppayyyy is attttt?!'
- fixed size, variable depth. (the world's questions and answers.)
- lsd makes me question important ideas like, lsd, reality. what defines me from you? my chemical reactions from yours?
- is reality unreal? only in an unreal reality. :)
- we need more gauges! more gauges for deceleration and acceleration!

Throughout my trip, a key piece of artwork popped up often. An extremely psychedelic piece of artwork, a side-piece to my room, cycled through millions of colors. Seeing black and white was simply a matter of perception. This art felt as if it was a living piece of emotion, a snapshot of the artist's feeling and life at the time of the creation. It was up to me to interpret this in a personal way, and I feel it followed the general trip mentality of big-shark little-shark.

Big-shark little-shark, you might ask? It's impossible to explain, but perhaps you've experienced it before. I'll rest on that thought. Until next time?

LSD (2) : General (1), Unknown Context (20)




 




DOSE:
8 tablets
oral
LSD
(blotter / tab)


 
  repeated
smoked
Tobacco - Cigarettes
 





BODY WEIGHT:
175 lb




Here's a little background of my drug use. 

LSD: most I have taken is 10 tabs, was just fine even drove around town 'exploring' as me and my lady called it 
Pain pills: oxy 10's, hydrocodone (pill and liquid) my favorite drugs are opiates. 
MDMA: I love Molly, me and my friends would always snort the shit as it hit us faster and gave us more of a tweaky feeling and I liked the tweaky feelings
Meth: was told it was Molly, but upon looking at it, it was obvious meth, but didn't stop us from doing it. I really enjoyed meth a lot, but feel I got lucky the first time and didn't get addicted 
Addy: not my favorite thing in the world as I took 2 30mg er's and was up for 2 days in a row 
Alcholo: not bad, Can be enjoyable, but I would prefer to stay sober if anything. 
Air duster: my most favorite thing in the world. Nothing compares to airduster in my mind. 
Pot: used to be a heavy smoker, but it's just not worth it anymore 
Kratom: I also love kratom as it mimics opiates for me and I can not do any 'real' drugs per say 
Xanax: I used to really enjoy Xanax, the mentally calming effect it had, the carelessness, but I grew to hate it because of the stupid decisions I would make when I'm barred out. (Huffed gas)
Gas: didn't really effect me, felt like a weak air duster, so I didn't enjoy it. 

With that out of the way, I would like to say I am some what an experienced tripper. I used to kind of sell acid, and was tripping about every other day. Basically when I took acid, I was trying to force a spiritual experience, see crazy shit, etc. I never really respected her. I loved the intensity of it which is why I always went for the higher than 'normal' dosages. 

So let's get into the story that scarred me, and made me never ever wanna drop acid again! 
Me and the lady couldn't really do drugs out of fear of getting tested, so we resulted to drugs that didn't stay long in your system: Molly and acid, basically.

One night we had planned to trip with our friend out of town. We had planned it basically a week or two in advanced, our friend was gonna drop two and our plan was to drop 5, but ended up doing 8. Most of the acid I got was pure, never the fake synthetic shit, I wasn't about that. All of my acid had been on blotter paper, whether it had art on it, or just white on white. This acid we got, we were told it was a little weaker than the last batch, so that's when we decided to take 8. We had a total of 20 tabs, 16 of them were mine and the ladies, 4 was the homies. 

So we get to our friends house, about 40 mins away and right as we got there dropped the tabs. I didn't really keep track of time, but I will guesstimate when everything happened. 

T:4:20 p.m.- 8 tabs on mine and my ladies tounge, friend did not drop his yet because wasn't sure if he wanted to trip or not. The acid had no taste, other than the cardboard it was on. The guy I got it from drew on the hit sizes.

T:4:40- lady tells me she is already getting pretty heavy visuals and is feeling quite off, she's acting kind of distant, but we can both be quote shy at some times, so I thought it was that. It did strike me as odd that she was already getting heavy visuals, but we both didn't eat anything the whole day for this reason, and this was the most acid shes eaten so I didn't think that much of it. (I wish I had. Looking back now, there was so many warning signs of her having a bad trip)

T 5:30 p.m. I'm starting to slightly come up and our friend, my lady and I had just gotten back from the gas station (our friend drove) and we had gotten some smokes, me and my lady chain smoke like crazy on acid. For me it kinda levels me and keeps me connected to the world. So we're walking through the woods behind my homies house and everynow and then my lady says the phrase *it happened again*, I didn't think to much of it (I wish I had, like I said, so many warning signs of a bad trip was coming) I'm starting to get enhanced vision, H.D. Vision, as I call it and the lady said, the next day, that she was tripping harder than ever at that point, she said it looked like the grass was coming off the ground, and everything looked very cartoonist 
T:6 p.m.- were out of the woods now and I can feel the acid in full effect. It was hitting me very hard at this point, I was seeing intense tracers, depth perception was fucked, and some very beautiful patterns all over the ground. The friend asked us '1-10 how hard are you tripping?' And instantly the lady said '10' which really struck me as odd cause I was just now starting to come up and she was saying she's full blown tripping. 

Some time passes, we watched the Simpson's Halloween special, very hilliarious on acid, we were all enjoying our self, but I could not shake the feeling that something was off. The movie ended and we were all a little hungry, so we went down stairs to see what there was, nothing really looked appealing so we just got water. The lady was acting very different, she just seemed so disconnected from everything around her. I shook it off, thinking it's just the large amount of acid we'd done, and her being kinda shy around newish people (our friend) 

We go back to my friends room, and start playing some dead rising. It was very difficult to play, I was tripping really hard, but not getting very much visuals, more just a 'mind trip', I guess you could say. The lady was seeming reaalllyyy disconnected from the world at this point. She kept saying 'I wanna play a game', and we'd hand her the controller and she wouldn't really do much, so shed hand it back and then a couple minutes later 'I wanna play a game'.

Eventually, it was just my friend playing a game and I was on social media on my phone and just talking to my friend and the lady everynow and then, but the lady kept saying 'it happened again over and over, about 5 minutes in between each other I estimate.

I started to think, maybe I'm doing something that I do not realize, and she doesn't like it. I wish that were the case.

So we go downstairs cause we wanted to smoke, just me and the lady, our friend was doing something I don't remember and he didn't wanna get up. We're on the porch of my friends house and smoking a cig, and I ask my lady 'are you okay? You seem kind of off' and all she says is 'yeah' we keep smoking our stoggy, and I remember looking out onto his front yard (his house is on a decent sized bit of land), and it was dark by this time, and all I could see was fractals, patterns and colors. I had never experienced this before and it kinda threw me off and freaked me out, but I held it together and just focused on something else. I told the lady, 'this Is kind of getting really intense and I just want it to stop, but I also don't want it to stop', this was maybe the 3 hour mark of our trip, so we hadn't even hit our peak yet. The lady agreed with me, but still something seemed so off with her.
We go back inside and bull shit around with our homie, and he tells was about an hour prior, he had dropped 2 of his tabs, and that made us happy. I loved getting fucked up with friends.

About 30 minutes to an hour pass, and we go back down stairs to go out side and mess around in his big garage, and smoke cigs and he was gonna smoke some pot.

He goes down stairs and goes outside, but when my lady started down the stairs, she fell flat on her back and slid all the way down the stairs, it was kind of comical how she slid down them, but it was the love of my life, so I didn't find it all that funny. I made sure she was okay and asked again If she was okay (mentally) and she said 'okay' or 'I think' so this whole time were still trying to get outside my lady was becoming more and more disconnected from reality. We were all standing around talking, she was against the wall and just collapsed for some reason (she didn't pass out or anything, just lost her footing I guess). When she stood up, the look in her eyes was very odd, it was pure embarrassment, mixed with 'why tf did I just do that, is everything okay?' It kinda broke my heart, that look in her eye because she wanted to make a good impression on my friends and be 'cool' and didn't wanna make a fool of her self. She can be very self conscious sometimes, but she has kind of grew outta that and also all my friends love to chill with her and I, so this night did not ruin that.

After her falling, things started to change for the worse, she was fully disconnected from reality at this point, but I was also to high to realize what was going on exactly. In my head, it was the acid making her feel pretty good and just goofing around, doing weird stuff, but it was anything but that.

At one point she was laying on the floor on her stomach, shaking her rump-a-dump around acting very unlike her self. This was very odd because she can also be insecure as well, and is nothing like a hoe that'll do this for the fuck of it, but again I was still to high from the acid to put two and two together that she was so far from reality, she didn't really know what she was doing. 

We finally make it out side and goto the garage when things really went down hill. We were all messing around, giving each other shit and the lady was acting all big and tough so we told her to show us and pump some iron. She didn't really acknowledge that and did something else I can't recall. She started acting very violently towards me and my friend, but I was still under the impression she was goofing around and having a good time, so we kinda wrestled a little bit, but she was actually hitting kind of hard and struck me with a good right, so I put a stop to that. At one point she was screaming and yelling and that started making my friend kind of angry because of his neighbors possibly calling the cops and they kinda got into it and started at each other, but I instantly shoved both of them back telling them to knock it off.

My lady friend at this point was uncontrollable, walking/running around yelling at the top of her lungs, flaling around and what not.

We took her inside due to the scare of possible cops being involved, and she just wouldn't stop acting like this. My friend was still coming up on his 'cid and for a start to a trip all of this going on would not call for a good trip. He actually started to have a panic attack, and at one point was almost in tears. This whole time, I just wasn't really taking this serious as I really thought she would just start acting normal again and she was just enjoying her self. I thought she was horny cause she kept saying certain things pointing towards that and the acid was making it really intense to where she couldn't control her self (I really don't know what was going through my brain. I was so god damn high from the acid) so I took her to the bathroom, adjusted my self ;), and showed her that I could not stick it in right now due to the acid giving me limp dick. She saw that and kinda straightened up for a minute and I felt so much relieve, but then 'boom!' She was right back to acting how she was.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

She was screaming at the top of her lungs now, and my friend was panicking more and more at this point and yelled 'do we need to take her to the hospital or something' and I said 'bro I really don't know this has never happened' (this was when it finally clicked that something was seriously rong roughly 4-4-1/2 hours into this trip) I told her, 'if you don't straighten up were gonna have no choice but to take you to the hospital. You're parents are gonna be involved (she was kicked outta her house and not on good terms and moved in with me) cops etc' and she sobered up really quick and said 'okay' and I said 'you good now, babe?', and she said something that shed been repeating a lot and so I carried her outta the bathroom saying to the friend ' were going to the hospital idk what's going on with her, Can we take your car I don't trust mine?', and he was basically already ready. I carry her out of the house, she pukes a little while being carried, I've been around tons of people puking, and puked a lot my self from duster, so it doesn't bother me, but something about this little puke she did the sound of it I can still hear clearly to this day (8-9 months later) I don't know how to explain it. On the way to hospital, I text my mom our safe word (shes a great mother, she doesn't like me doing drugs or anything, but she said if I'm ever in danger or anything text her this safe word and she'll be there as fast as she can) she wasn't replying so I called her 2 times in a row and she finally answered and I explained to her the situation. At this point, in the car, my lady was kinda screaming and what not, but basically just repeating certain phrases over and over, and having spastic movements. My mom told us to not go to hospital so no one official is involved, including her parents like right as we were at the front door, so we just parked there. My step dad, I think is secretly very knowledgeable when it comes to drugs, so I'm sure that was his idea. They told us to get some orange juice to see of that'll help her, it ended up being spilt over my friends car. My friend started freaking out even harder, and couldn't drive and for some odd reason, I was practically sober, wasn't getting much visuals unless I really focused, and felt pretty calm in the head to try to keep the peace between us all, so I drove us to the house.

Basically by now she was not screaming or anything, she was just repeating phrases over and over. She would be like this until she came down, some 6 hours later. This killed me to see her like this. This girl is the love of my life, and seeing her so out of control, having no idea what she's doing, out of her mind hurt so bad and it still sometimes does to this day.

We're at the house now safely, thank God, and she's just doing the same stuff, my parents show up roughly 15 minutes later, and when I'm in their car everything feels so much better. Everything is so much more calmer, I knew we were gonna have a nice long talk about this, but that wasn't the matter at the moment. I felt so safe with them, and finally for the first time that night, I knew my girl was gonna be okay. I left everything I brought with me there, even my shoes, I just wanted to leave and be in the comfort of my parents. I gave my friend a hug cause he was shaking and rocking back and forth and kind of crying and said 'I love you bro' and left.

We made it home and my parents went inside cause my lady was being difficult and I couldn't get her out of the car and she was basically under control, just looping out loud still. It was so odd, I would tell her things about the real world and her pupils would shrink back to normal size, and for litterallly a split second, I knew my lovely girl was back, but then instantly bam, she was gone, pupils so large there was no color in them, just black from such dilated pupils. Those sights of her eyes have scarred me and I can still picture it crystal clear. It was the oddest/heart wretching thing to see her come back to reality fully, then a second later she was gone. I hated my self for getting us the acid, saying we should just take 8 a piece, I hated my self for everything that lead up to that. I got her inside and our dog even knew something was wrong with her, he was being extra sweet to her, giving her kisses and he even had a worried look on his face. We got her laid down in bed and she sat there in the same position for an hour or so, looping away.

Then another couple of hours she was finally able to fall asleep, but I was still worried so everynow and then I would listen to her breathing, feel her heart beat to make sure it wasn't to fast or to slow. I even woke her up sometimes when she would make noises asking her if she was okay. I kept saying, 'I'm so sorry for tonight', but she didn't understand why I was saying that and I told her, 'I'll tell you in the morning'. While she was asleep, kind of, I would go to our back porch and smoke cigs and just cry to my self. I was so torn up that I would let me and the love of my life get into that situation, I'm here to protect her and never let her get into sticky situations, never let her get hurt or anything, and I failed. I would go to our back porch and smoke cigs and just cry to my self. I was so torn up that I would let me and the love of my life get into that situation, I'm here to protect her and never let her get into sticky situations, never let her get hurt or anything, and I failed. I morally failed at doing that all night. It was the worst feeling ever looking back at that night, the worst empty, sickening feeling in my stomach I have felt to this day. I still feel that sometimes. The next morning when she woke up, she sat straight up and looked around super confused as to why we were back at our house, she didn't remember a thing. I explained to her what had happened and she could not believe it, but slowly some memories she had of that night slowly came back to her. Her side of the story is jaw dropping, she had a completely different experience then what had actually happened. Literally a completely different story than what I just told.

After this night, I swore to my self and her that I would never ever let us get into that kind of situation ever again. I made it my goal to look out for her if we were doing drugs, rather it just pot, alcohol, anything. I would never let her go through this again, because one time when she was looping out, she said 'I just want it to stop, make it stop please'. This stood out to me cause again in that moment, my girl was back, but was gone right after she said that. I knew she would come back enough to realize she was miserable, but just couldn't do anything about it. It literally broke my heart in so many ways.

We will probably never tough acid again, due to the fear of this trip. It is engraved into our minds and memory. It will stick with us forever. 

We are in a lot better place now. I'm in my dream college, passing it with flying colors, and she is in school for something she really enjoys. I'm so happy for us. We have so much good going for us, I know we're gonna have a great future, despite our interactions with drugs.

I will talk to her after work and see if she wants to include what was going on in her world for this report. If not, you guys will know. 
Safe travels, comrades! 



Hi I'm the little lady of the story you just read and now I'll tell you my side of everything:

My drug experience 
Pot: use to love it then it became more of a struggle 
Acid: both good and bad experiences
Xanax: I love it but it makes me stupid, though I do wish I could experiment more with it
Molly: absolutely amazing 
Meth: best hyped feeling I've ever experienced
Extacy: second best feeling I love feeling more open while on x 
Oxy: very mellow drug and helped me do my job a lot easier
Duster: it was fun but probably the most stupid drug I've done
Gas: not really that much to my experience so I'll give it a 1/10 
Kratom: it's a good substance when yoou can't actually do drugs
Morphine: by far the best thing on this earth, it is the best thing I have experienced so far with any substance I've done.


How I refer to what happened that night was me being in my dream world. I'll be honest I have always been the kind of person to keep quite about my opinion if someone else wanted something different (this is a bad habit I don't suggest getting into) and that night I had a bad feeling about tripping that much and with someone else but I blew it off because I have the tendency to ovethink things and I figured it was just that. I still felt good enough about everything to think everything would be okay.

When I started feeling the effects from dropping acid,about 20 minutes later, I was feeling good but I suppose more retreated now that I look back on it. When we got back to the house after getting stogys I started feeling really odd and kind of not good, it was a lot of effort to stand so I sat at the table in the yard for a minute, when it seemed like something was really off I decided to go knock on the bathroom where my boyfriend was, I wanted to tell him there was something up but for one it seemed like too much effort to really talk and two I didn't want to seem like I was trying to bring the mood down so I said nothing. Another note is with a couple of the last trips before this one, I would get sick on the come up which started up randomly after a few times tripping so I thought it was something I was going to get over and start feeling better again.

The next thing I remember is walking through the woods and my boyfriend and his friend were walking ahead and I couldn't hear what they were saying, I felt a brief moment of loneliness and had a slight thought they were talking about about me which was just an irrelivent paranoid thought( this small moment has played a dramatic roll in me now even today which I will explain later on) but as we were walking that's when I saw the sharp cartoon grass explained in the first part of the story and that was the last visual I saw the whole night. I supposed I had begun blacking out between those periods because the next moment I experienced was we were in the room playing a game

Now bare with me this is where things get confusing. When we were playing the game I asked to play and in my dream world I thought I was doing good but my boyfriend kept saying I was gonna die which was confusing.. This was my first glimpse of reality when I was in my dream world. I feel like if someone would had told me to snap out of it right then and there I might have been okay because that was the last moment of the real world that I had before it got all distorted by my dream world. The next glimpse I remember was us walking down the stairs and me falling all the way down. The pain kind of brought me back to what was going on in reality but my mind was still morphing it into some dream of mine.

The next thing that happened that I can actually semi explain was when we were in the garage and both my boyfriend and his friend kept telling me to get mad over and over (this didn't actally happen in reality) I decided to yell and run over to the punching bag and hit it and then at another time me and my boyfriend were having a hitting match which in my dream world seemed normal and fun( its like those moments when you dream something completely odd but you think it's okay anyway until you wake up) I remember slapping my boyfriend in the face hard and he did it back and I felt a pain in my cheek that made my right eye water and for a second I thought that this wasn't normal but in an instant my dream state sucked me back in and made it seem like it was a playful thing that was okay. The thing about my dream state is everything in it seemed so dark but instead of letting me be afraid of it, it was convincing me it was good, and if anything negative happened it would almost shield me from it and I would be all happy again.

The next big event that happened was we were all in the car driving and I was completely in my dream world at this point. It was like I was hitting duster and blacking out which is a scary thought because I was already blacked out in a dream state but when I 'hit duster' I would completely black out and later on wake up, this happened multiple times and one time our friend, who in the real world WAS our friend, but in my dream state I thought was my boyfriend, kept smacking my cheek trying to wake me up from passing out( this never actually happened in reality and I never even actually passed out at all.) When I was 'conscious' and we were driving I would wake up to us stopping at the same stop sign, passing the same semi, and pulling up to the same store over and over. It would happen in the same order, I would wake up experience one thing, pass out experience the next, and then it would all repeat over and over. When I was 'conscious' and we were driving I would wake up to us stopping at the same stop sign, passing the same semi, and pulling up to the same store over and over. It would happen in the same order, I would wake up experience one thing, pass out experience the next, and then it would all repeat over and over. As I came to find out the next day there never was a semi that passed us at all and the store I recalled we never pulled up to either. 

I remember us driving and someone on Bluetooth talking to my boyfriend crying and saying ' she needs help' and so on which sounded to me as if we were trying to make an intervention for someone on drugs and during that moment it felt like me, our friend, and my boyfriend were all like brother and sister and the person on the phone was our mom who I imagined being a overweight person, little did I know it was my boyfriends mom on the phone talking and everything I heard her say didnt match up with what was actally said but they were discussing about me, (also his mom is not fat at all haha) As the night went on I would pass out and wake up to find one detail change than how it was before, the car would be a different color or the seats would be different. And I believe it was a transition from our friends car to my boyfriend's moms car. I would continue to do so until everything was transitioned completely. Every time I would wake I would see little patches of the real car and reality as it really was, but even though I could still basically see everything my mind was still converting it into a dream Some how. 

Everything kind of seemed calmer after and I do remember pulling up to my mother in laws house and lying in bed. This whole time I just thought this was one big huge trip and I was just going along with it, it never crossed my mind anything wasn't was unusual from all the other times I tripped, the last visual I saw was the grass, everything else was just a dream. When I woke up the next day and realized we weren't still at our friends house and we were in fact at his mom's, everything was so confusing and I kept thinking about what all was real and what wasn't, turns out not much of what I actually experienced was real. 

A big lesson I learned from that night is to never abuse Lucy because she will fuck my shit up. From the first time taking acid it changed how I react to smoking pot. I will say that since that night, instead of smoking for comfort and joy, it's been a constant battle that has messed with me ever since. When I said to remember that brief moment of loneliness when I couldnt hear my boyfriend and friend talk, and how I thought they were talking about me, well every time I smoked pot after that, I could hardly hear what people were saying even if there right in front of me, and I constantly thought everyone is talking about me and even though it was a long time ago, acid is still affecting me through pot. One tiny little moment that happened that night, out of everything else, has stuck with me still. I am now incredibly paranoid which I use to not be and I hardly enjoy smoking any more, it's made my social life horrible and I still don't really know how to get over it. I am now incredibly paranoid which I use to not be and I hardly enjoy smoking any more, it's made my social life horrible and I still don't really know how to get over it. It's basically branded in my brain and if I would have known how strong acid can be even long after a trip, I would have been much more smarter with my choices.

Thank you guys for taking your time to read this. I know it is long, both of our experiences during this night, but there is no short version of this trip.

Again, Safe Travels, Commrades!

It was a day like any other, my friends and I were just sitting around and had nothing to do, in an attempt to buy marijuana the dealer had just ran out, but he had acid for sale for 8$ a tab. My whole life I had been curious to try acid, I always wanted to know what it was like to hallicinate.  The other friends thought it was a bad idea, so they left, leaving me and my other good friend who was also interested.  We bought 6 tabs then went back to his house.

8:30pm : my friend and I decide to drop 1 tab, just by placing it on the tongue and letting it disolve for about 10 minutes then swallowing, we repeated this process till the tabs were gone and we each had 3

9:00pm : I dont want to say I was feeling anything yet, but I was definitly feeling different, very relaxed and light headed

9:30pm : something strange was definitly happening now, it felt like my body was a bit floaty and felt oddly like jello

10:00pm : at this point the body jello feeling grew more intense and my friend and I could not stop laughing at everything, just laughing histarically, mild rushes of euphoria.

10:30pm : this is when the first visuals started kicking in with trails on lights, and the feelings of euphoria had grown more intense, and the jello feeling was still present, could not have a normal conversation without losing train of thought

11:00pm :Everything just seemed to make sense, no matter what I talked about, it looped around and came right back plugging itself into the most random outcomes Everything just seemed to make sense, no matter what I talked about, it looped around and came right back plugging itself into the most random outcomes, I couldnt stop smiling, and at this point the hallucinations were really intense, things would bubble when I looked at them, and my friends face would morph around and I would start laughing because of how funny it looked, we decided to take a walk through a local park and everything in my vision was bending and comming at me, and as I walked by things they had huge trails on them, everything looked intense

11:30pm : everything in my vision would now bend sideways and things would drift around, I hallucinated a tree that wasnt there, the night sky looked absolutely amazing, and I could not catagorize how I felt at this point

12:00am : we decided to walk back to his house, noticing that time took forever, as to what seemed like hours had only been 15 minutes, the jello feeling was not as intense, and the visuals sort of dimmed down a bit, but things were still funny and morphing

12:30am : it strangely felt like I was peaking again when I thought I had already peaked because I then got another rush of hallucinations, only this time, I could taste textures in my mouth that werent there, and I could see what I was listening too

2:30am : everything from 12:30 had continued until this point, where things gradually grew less intense, the body high feeling had mellowed down to just a slightly floaty feeling, objects seemed like they were on their own dimensions and different different ways form each other

3:00am : just sitting up late at night watching random things on youtube, everything was still changing colors and peoples faces were morphing around, I felt very relaxed and content at this point, though if I were to try and sleep, it would be impossible

Throughout the night the hallucinations would come and go but slowly and slowly getting less intense, thought process was a bit easier, and eventually at 9am the next day, I had gotten some sleep and slept through the whole day, I awoke sometime the next night, and felt completely fine

I would have to say that LSD defintly blows my mind, and it opened new doors in myself. In the future I wil definitly try it again.

Anyway hope you liked my report

Peace

It was the first month of my freshman year of college and I had ended up with a roommate, Evan, with whom I got along extremely well. We both listened to Phish and the Grateful Dead, we both liked smoking pot and we had both tripped at least a few times before. He told me that the first time he tripped changed his life significantly for the better; he lost weight, stopped playing World of Warcraft, and started living in a much healthier way. I had tripped before at a concert but I didnt have any revelations, just some intense visuals while listening to the music. We decided that the two of us as well as our friend Madeline would go to a gigantic local park with nature areas and trip together as a way to inaugurate our first year at school.

We took our acid sitting on a bench on campus, two hits each on paper squares about a centimeter square in size. Smiling with excitement, we mounted our bikes and set off for the park, which was about a fifteen-minute ride away. By the time we reached the center of the park, about 25 minutes later, I could feel an incredible feeling in my chest. The only way Evan and I could verbalize it was that we were feeling potential. My surroundings gradually started to look more and more colorful and I could see the sun starting to cast alpenglow on Mt. Rainier as we approached sunset. When a deer and a peacock simultaneously approached our group to within 10 feet, sending us into a state of silent awe, I knew we were starting to trip really hard.

We decided to go further into the park as the sun started to set. It was darker in the woods, but we were explorers in a strange land and were unafraid. We sat down in a clearing far off the path, completely surrounded by trees, and took another tab each. I started pouring dirt all over myself because I had realized that there is nothing inherently wrong with being dirty, its just a perception weve developed living in American society.

I started pouring dirt all over myself because I had realized that there is nothing inherently wrong with being dirty, its just a perception weve developed living in American society. We reached a parking lot and I laid down on the ground and put on my headphones. I listened to the Doors American Prayer album, a collection of poetry set to music, and watched new constellations appear in the sky and swirl around like a whirlpool. I could feel an incredible energy in all parts of my body. I couldnt speak except to make weird moaning noises. I was awestruck, overcome with the beauty of this planet. I felt what I can only describe as a deep, profound love for Earth and all that resides on it.

Later that night, when we returned to the dorms, I was coming down but could still feel the effects somewhat. I felt a powerful need to communicate the revelation that I had, that every human being is valuable and deserves to be loved. The only real sin is harming another human, I said. I would say to strangers I met, I dont know you, but I love and respect you, and Im glad we exist in the same universe. I couldnt help but feel such profound love for every human I encountered that it almost moved me to tears.

I usually take LSD when I have big questions about life and myself, last year I had made some huge changes after taking LSD that it positively affected my life. So one Friday night I decided to consult with what I call 'The LSD Gods' (great name am I right?). I took 250 ugs at 4:30 pm and went downstairs with my mother to watch the rest of the movie called 'Lucy' while waiting for the LSD to kick in. All in all my mood at that point was really good.

Close to the end of the movie I started to feel the body effects LSD usually gives me so at 6:30pm I decided to go take a bath and use my new bath bomb I got. It was probably the best bath I had ever taken, I lifted the bath bomb out the water and watched the bubbles for a long time. By this time I was seeing small visuals and got out the bath. At 7pm I ended up laying down and watching YouTube videos of soap cutting (yes soap cutting I know) after a while I decided to ask my mom to take me to the gas station for a drink. As I got into the car the visuals and body effects kicked in a lot harder. I've never been in a car on my come up so it was really different. We got what we needed and headed home, mind you my mom has no idea I am tripping at this point. In the car for some unknown reason I wanted to laugh but I knew my mom would ask what's funny so I tried to turn the other way and hold it in but tears came to my eyes and she ended up asking what's wrong. Now me and my mom don't have the best relationship and I have been trying to mend it so all of the sudden I start thinking about that and go into full blown crying and start talking to her about our relationship. 

We got home and I asked if we could sit outside for a few because I really wanted to talk more with my mom. I asked if we could sit outside for a few because I really wanted to talk more with my mom. We ended up talking in a full blown 2 hour conversation and looking back I feel like it was so helpful to our relationship and my understanding of our relationship. At this point I'm just staring at the brick walkway we have and seeing so many patterns in it (mind you my mom still and as I'm writing this doesn't know I was tripping) I got a call from my work saying I needed to come in which was really sucky because I wasn't going to get sleep that night but after I ended the call, I then for some reason really want to go on a walk seeing as we live in basically the middle of nowhere (we don't really have signal except 1 bar so unless we have wifi we don't get calls on our cell phone until we go about 20 minutes away from where we live). So here me and my mom are walking (I also didn't feel out of breath at all like I normally do with my asthma) and it was so enjoyable that I didn't even realize we were walking as far as we did. We eventually got back home around 8 pm and I went up to my room for the night.

I didn't really do much after that because I felt so emotionally drained in a sense when talking to my mom and felt like I got out what I needed to say but never could with my mom. For the rest of the night I was though in a really good mood and watched my favorite tv show Wynonna Earp (That episode was a really weird one too where everyone was under a spell and I thought it might make me go into a bad trip but it didn't which was good because I really enjoyed the episode.) and really just listened to music and was on Facebook looking at videos. I did decide at 11 pm to take another bath (I love baths) and realized my jaw started to really hurt from clenching it subconsciously. I also (which yes I am still kinda afraid of the dark) wasn't afraid of walking in the dark back to my room and even days after I still wasn't afraid.

I went back into my room and watched more videos by PsychedSubstance and documentaries by Vox, Vice, etc. (I really like learning a lot more when I'm high or tripping but I also like learning things when I'm not high or tripping either). I then started to worry about not getting sleep before a 8 hour shift at 11 am but I wasn't worried with anxiety like I usually am. 

Around 4 am I shut all the lights out and tried to sleep which to no avail I didn't sleep. I did however see a lot more visuals in the dark but my body and jaw hurt to the point where I took a bath with epsom salt. It still didn't work so I decided to wait till 8 am to call in sick because there was just no way as I already felt so tired but couldn't sleep due to the LSD. After laying for what felt like an eternity I finally fell asleep.

I had some really weird dreams but don't remember what happened in them, I just woke up really confused about what happened in them. I ended up sleeping till 10 pm and my mom thought I was sick (nope mom just tired from the LSD) but I ended up feeling some positives from the trip. My severe anxiety which causes me to have panic attacks daily was almost COMPLETELY gone. I also had some really good insight on my relationships with people and contacted them to try and fix the damage I had done in the past. I had better self-esteem about myself, and I also noticed that I haven't been eating as much or more like I get full quicker but I don't know if that's just the after effects of the LSD (even though it didn't happen last time when I took more). 

All in all this trip has given me a lot of positive outlooks on my life and I am glad I made the decision to take LSD that Friday night.

After about 35 minutes I was experiencing and intensity I have never felt before.  When I saw the frame of the house that was being built bending in pinching itself until either sides touched, I knew I may have done something wrong.  Going inside to my room with three other friends to listen to music the intensity was increasingly more more and overwhelming the more I recognized it.  As we go inside we turn on the music, we all lie down to stare at my painted ceiling and walls with glow in the dark stars all over the room.  Everything I had seen was roughly normal considering I had only eaten at most 3 hits at one time until this.  Again, everything was about normal until I peaked.

The stars that covered the ceiling had suddenly transformed into a full three dimensional reality and I was in the middle of it...naturally.  Some of the stars advanced towards me, some of the stars fell into the ceiling going further and further away.  And some seemed to just wiggle around where they were.  And then I noticed what the strobe light was doing to the painted ceiling and walls.

The walls and ceiling were all colorful graffiti style words going up the walls and into the ceiling and down again, so this became very interesting.  When the strobe light was out all there seemed to be was an infinite sea of stars I was easily lost in.  When the light flashed, words crawled out of the walls and onto the ceiling which in turn melted of the ceiling and back onto the walls.  Then it was dark...nothing but stars...again a flash and the words crawled all over the room in increasingly more and more undescribable fashions.  Then I noticed the ceiling fan.

The ceiling fan had one red L.E.D. light attached to each of the blades.  However, when the strobe light have seemed to stop the fan, the blades stood motionless and wavingly pointed to the floor and drifted back up again.  To each still and bending fan blade three red planetlike orbs with clouds spewing off of them rotated and circled each fan blade.  By this time I felt I chould maybe close my eyes....this is getting to be a bit more than I had anticipated.

When I close my eyes...it doesn't work.  My eyelids were like clear glass.  When they were shut, it was as if they were still open.  The light flashed, the words crawled, the room darked, the stars shined, the fan melting the orbs circling, my mind....BLOODY SHATTERED!

By this time I stand up to leave the room, as I advance towards the door ivy grew into my way reaching out with leaves unfolding.  Knowing they were no arms of ivy growing at unheard of rates in my room I press on and walk right through the things.  I reach my red door which had a white cross on it with a mirror and the word 'lazy' written in small font underneath.  Below the large cross is written 'life ends sometime' also in white.  I stumble through the ivy and reach the door where I stop dead in my tracks and look on in absolute...shock.  I say 'hell with it I gotta get outa here.' And open the door.

I walk into a white and gold house with glowing golds fading into shining whites and shadows crawling as i make my way to the bathroom to splash water in my face.  I turn on the rainbows, I mean the bathroom light, with sink water I splash it onto my face.  I open my eyes and watch my face bubble like pasta sauce with my meatball eye falling off my chin. 'I need to lay down.'

So I lay down and for what I recall to be about forty minutes with my eyes closed were a tree, a human, and the planet.  First the tree grew out of the muddy ground, decayed, then fell the the earth.  This cycled repeatingly over and over again until the human appeared.  The human rose out of the muddy ground, decayed and fell back in.  This repeated for who knows how long until the planet happened.  The planet was going around the sun, zooming in quickly to make the continents visible the continents swirled all over the planet running into each other still zooming in to watch a mountain form.  Then rain clouds formed over the mountain falling as rain melting the mountain back into the ground.  This repeated itself for who knows how long.  Thinking maybe nap time was over I went outside.

Outside I watched the moon fall behind a hill.  Behind the hill shone a bright and powerful white light.  The white light turned and came down the hill as car head lights. The head lights lifted off the road and beacame stars in the sky.  The trees were all dragons flapping their wings and swimming through the world.  While the boards on the porch were shrinking and stretching beneath my feet.  And thats about all I remember.

I never experienced any visitations this night.  No real intense revelation to change my perception.  No enhanced powers of creativity or ideas.  It was simply souping around and I was an observer....in the middle of it all naturally.  Things were strange and everything was a picture.  A picture that was transformed in every single way you could imagine.  When I started to come down, I looked at a clock and realized this had gone on for 22 hours and I had not eaten.  So in an intense after trip 'shower period' where everything is lovely and everything is one mystifying.  I had breakfast, which turned out to be a mix of vegetables in my Mom's home made soup.

Thorax focal point

I finally got my hands on some acid after trying to find it for about a year. I bought 5 250ug tabs (about 13 each).

I have long been scared of LSD. Having had some traumatic experiences in my life (lost my father) I worried these things could affect me in a bad way. I'm also that kind of person that overthinks everything and feels a lot of paranoia. I was sure I'd have a bad trip.

I took my first dose on the 13th of february at my apartment, approx 80ug (1/3 of a tab) and it didn't do anything as I attempted to redose an hour in to make it kick in. Smoked some weed to help it get going but nothing. I was a bit discouraged. I talked with my dealer and he said I might just be very resistant. I had rolled on MDMA just a few days prior however so we judged that might be why. I was still nervous as could be about taking this low dose. 

18th of february, I woke up at 06:00. It was a nice morning, dark and quiet but yet comforting. I contemplated taking the LSD in the early morning for a bit before deciding to take half a tab at 06:30, and then I took another quarter by 07:00.  

Within the first 20 minutes I felt a sudden change. It was subtile yet distinct. I was wondering if this was placebo or not. The next hour or so was quite uneventful. I smoked some weed on my balcony and went back in by the computer; youtube. Watching old BF3 sketches was very fun. Actually at this point everything started to become very funny.

I went on giggling for minutes on end. Every joke in the video struck me. As I was trying to gather myself from the latest laughing attack the screen suddenly vibrated. All the lines became squiggly just like I'd expect. It looked very real. The more I looked at it the more it begun to wave around. I stood up and walked around my apartment for a bit - everything was getting very swirly and I couldn't look at anything for too long or else it swirled beyond recognition. But it was fine, I was happy about it, intrigued to see how everything around me started to morph.

I remember feeling cold over my skin and it felt so intense and interesting. I pinpointed in my mind the exact feeling of it against my skin and felt it shower over me. Every sensory input was just magic. I also felt like I was the same as the wood my bed was made out of, or any other material. Every sensory input was just magic. I also felt like I was the same as the wood my bed was made out of, or any other material. 

I put on some music on my wireless headset and blasted away. It was a generic summer music mix on youtube with some half naked girl on the thumbnail. I watched as she danced for me on the screen knowing full well I was watching a still picture. I walked around my place some more and at this point it felt like the world was updating once ever second or so, like watching a series of pictures in succession, but yet with a very smooth transition between the images. The music wasn't doing too much yet though.

Now, at this point everything was moving and frankly I couldn't even tell if it was supposed to or not. I had frequent laughing attacks and a moderate euphoric state while I explored my apartment looking at things, wondering about my own interesting ideas.

Then it happened, I closed my eyes and in a split second orbs of light were swirling around my body, falling towards my center. As the focal point of energy became my chest the most euphoric feeling I've ever experienced washed over me. It was a lucid light euphoria, burning like a bright sun in my chest. I let a few tears of joy run down my cheeks. Everything was in unity. Everything could be channeled through me.

The music was causing my senses to change, music had color and it would create vivid visual distortions. My eyelids felt like flintlock hammers, closing in an explosion of colors sparking patterns of bright neon '8-bit' bricks that washed over the peripheral of my eyes in all the colors of the rainbow.

Again I entered the euphoric state I was in before, the anticipation had me giggle like a small girl as the universe aligned itself to channel its energy through me. I closed my eyes, orbs, collision, light, everything. My body felt elevated as I floated through the room, at my fingertips I could choose to enter a more euphoric state at will. I felt in total control. Tears of joy fell on my face. I could see something beautiful.

At around 12 I was coming down a bit. The euphoria had settled a bit and I decided to try and do something. My computer screen was swirling so much I couldn't operate it. And it felt extremely weird using something with my hands. Like they were cold and dead. 

As I sat by the computer trying to figure something to do I watched the girl on the summer playlist video thumbnail. Suddenly everything went dark, the pleasant picture of a young woman turned into a witch and a dark fog shrouded my periphery. I was a bit startled by this and tried to reach for the mouse to change the music. My hand looked sick, morphing into a green/purple disgusting extremity. I realised what was going on, stood up and walked into another room. It helped immediately (thanks internet!). 

The come down was annoying. The euphoria only lasted for the first few hours and then I was stuck in a very vividly morphing world while being relatively normal. It wasn't all bad, but at some point I would have wanted to watch a movie or something but I really couldn't see a thing. 

Comparing it to MDMA, it was much more intense. The euphoria is on another level. It felt more unstable, lasted considerably shorter and needed a lot more work to get there though while MDMA is just a sure ticket to happiness. It felt like an effort going through the LSD trip, like I had to remain vigilant and on guard. Absolutely worth it though.

Where do I begin? Well lets start off by saying these tabs we got were the most dank little things we have ever had. It was so intense that it made me go SUPER treehugger..something I am usually not. I'm honestly still coming down from my trip and I need to express this, yet I cant. It all started on Easter Day 2010, I met up with my friend G and C on a chilly cloudy day, we planned to watch the movie Hot Tub Time Machine and go back to G's house where we would drop our tabs and spend the night. It was all in a way first for all of us, my friend C was taking 3 tabs for his first time, I was taking it again in 3 years! And for my friend G well it truly was his first time. 

Now I'm going to fast forward through the night to the point of where we drop the tabs because that's the only part I want/need to explain...

The time is now 9:53pm..as we got back from the movies we were nervous yet excited to begin our journey with Lucy, we went up to G's room and found our 10 strip tab and cut them into individual pieces and we all took 1 in symmetry. We decided to go on a walk and wait an hour then take our other tabs. We walk around G's neighborhood complex, we wander over to and fro for a long time and walk by this little mail slot area with a bright florescent light over it; right there we decide this is our place where we will go back to and see if everything looks the same. After a long long long hour we drop our second tab (for C his second and third tab) all the while sipping on some tasty orange juice, C calls his brother to and tells him to hang out with us. Now we wait for another 30 minutes walking all around smoking and watching everything. Suddenly C's brother drives up and embraces our presence so joyfully. By this time we were all feeling different and happy but not yet tripping...not even close. We all decide to go on a walk and we eventually get back to the mail slot..this is where my trip began..we all looked at the mail slot area and agree in harmony that something is different. At this moment I take notice to a tree next to a lamp post with purple flowers that were boasting with vibrance.. It was incredible! By now I start to feel overwhelmed and over stimulated and lay on the side walk smoking a cigarette and watching the smoke, my friend C joins be on the ground laying down and we became part of it.

The time is around 11:30pm and we are laying on the sidewalk tripping! I start to see intense tracers of everyones faces and my hands. MY friend G starts to get a little paranoid and tells us to get up and that were talking too loud, which I totally understand because it was where he lived and it was his first time with Lucy, C and I struggle to get up from the ground as C says 'but it just feels so right..' We eventually get up and walk over near to C's brothers car and just hang out again. C starts to put on some Beatles 'Let it Be', I again start to grasp the the sidewalk and just lay down and enjoy life as my G starts to describe what he is feeling in immense detail. C, C's brother and I all nod in agreement 'yeah dude..just 'let it be' like the beatles would say.' By now we all decide we are about to peak so we better go inside so we all say our departures with C's brother, it was like losing a close friend, we all exchanged hugs and said bye. 

Somehow we end up in G's room trying to get comfortable. Lucky for us we had a strobe light available with color filters. I plug it in and set it on an open drawer with the green filter. Everything now starts to come in patterns. As G lied on his bed exploring the wonderful world of LSD, C and I tried to settle into these little gamers chairs but were relentless and eventually C pulled aside his chair and we both laid on the carpet. 

This is where my severe visuals start. I took off my glasses and closed my eyes and saw patterns of spades, diamonds, pyramids, and clovers under my eyelids all in rainbow! As C, G and I all stared with our eyes open in the room lit on and off and on and off again by the strobe light we (atleast I) started to see the energy in everything moving from one another between the desk then to the carpet then to me. Almost like everything was alive and connected and were all transparent and the electricity running between us all red, green and blue. 

Now the whole time we are listening to music and the I turned on 'The Unicorns' which have a trippy lo-fi sound to them and we all begin to peak hard. G, C and I start to watch the patterns on the ceilings and walls. We eventually get tired of this and look out the window...the extraordinary things we see..the leaves are like hands moving in a motion as if they were petting cats. The American flap on the neighbors house its roaring and colors are powerful. C and I are raving to go outside now; I start to explain nature and I want to be one with mothernature and that everything is alive and mustn't be killed! C explains 'Outside has been there all along, and now I have never wanted to go outside more in my life!' G calms us down by telling us that his Grandmother is sleeping downstairs and that we can't leave. I turn away from the window in disgust for ever making me want to go so bad..

The time is now 2:00am and we are all doing our own thing. G is lying on his bed feeling 'it' and C is..well C is doing everything he is looking at the walls, relaxing, touching things that look weird. I begin to love my visuals and grab the strobe light and flash it on the wall watching how everything has a flower pattern. I begin to feel the urge to see a tree and be outside again. But G, C and I all gather together and start the strobe light again and try to substitute our crave to go outside with overpowering visuals; we go on explaining the colors for several of tens of minutes.

The time is now 2:40am and we all hear rain outside! We all start to fumble around to get to the window! As we look out the blinds we want to go out more than ever. I try to enlighten the mood and pull all the blinds up and open the window. We all stare out into the abyss of the world and have a long conversation of rain and how its perfect for LSD for at least 30 minutes. I carry on babbling about how I want to be at one with nature and we all see eye to eye that we NEED to go outside but we CANT. I start to explain we are in a window of opportunity between the rain outside and 'fake' technology inside. C points out both literally and metaphorically we are in a window..we are all astonished.

Eventually we all settle down because we are mad we cant go outside and don't want to tease ourselves with rain anymore. I close the blinds and we turn on the lights and look in G's huge closet mirror. We light up some incense sticks- they smelling fucking incredible! C and I start to 'wave' around and look in the mirror. I put my hands in my pockets and I feel dime. I pull it out feeling every single groove on it and tell C to feel it. C starts to rant about all the grooves as he passed it to G and we start to say it probably has a 100 years worth of history and suddenly C drops the dime! Oh no! ..oh well..who cares it was just dime......

The time is now 3:24am and we are sitting down on the ground between the giant mirror and G's bed where he is still lying down. The strobe light is on once again and I show C a cord for G's alarm clock and we are astounded by its brilliance of pure whiteness. We show G and he is too speechless. We deicide to turn on the real lights and now I start to look into the wonders of my teeth and my mouth. I explain this to G and C. G says 'its like I'm seeing my teeth for the first time..' I begin to feel a Course Catalog for the university that I'll be going to that has a cover that looks like wood. It was breathing and actually felt like real wood! The great feeling we all know and love on LSD is the 'breathing' effect of everything and here it starts to take affect as we stare at the lamp shade, our shirts, our hands and G's bed sheets. We begin to listen 'The Unicorns' again, we start to find it amazing and how awesome it goes with our trip. At the end of one of their songs you hear them breaking a bottle in the song; I deliberately announce 'Did you hear that? That was just our ego shattering..' From now tlll around 5:00am we are on and off with the Television watching cartoons and frequently switching to human shows. We end up on Aqua Teen Hunger Force for a while and I started to really see the brilliance of color and patterns changing on the Television. The colors were not chaining but instead becoming constantly bright then brighter then just bright then brighter again! They were never NOT bright. 

The time now is 5:00am and we dawdle into the curiosities of the internet on C and I's iPod Touches. I visit a website and become dumbfounded on a picture of the universe. I show G and C and we started to have intense visuals once again. We roam over to google and start image searching 'the Universe' I find several photos and save them. We all gravitate towards a specific picture of the Universe with stars and dots around it. I gazed stunned and stupefied that all the stars and dots became purple, yellow, blue and green and started to pulsate and almost look like million mini fireworks as the Universe in the middle swayed like and ocean. C and I must have looked at this photo for a total of two hours, that was how amazing it was.

The time now is 5:50am and we have just ended watching the news on the Television dumbfounded by what was going on in the world. We all decide that at 6:15am we we're going to go outside. As C and I wait the seemingly endless 25 minutes to be up we gawk over the picture of the Universe again raving about how its still 'alive' after almost 8 hours and that we got some good shit for the visuals to last this long.

The time is now finally 6:15am! We prepare to leave and get everything ready. We walk outside-it has now been 8 and 1/2 hours since we dropped-and everything is BRIGHT, VIBRANT, and BEAUTIFUL. It was the most amazing sight I have ever seen. I couldn't help but blurt out 'Its like everything happened like it was on purpose!' We walked around for a bit taking in everything and then sat a park just looking at everything nature holds for us for an hour. As we are walking C points out all these snails on the sidewalk; C and I jump onto the rode scared to kill a life as G just continues walking..

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

We walk back to my car and I ask G and C 'Wanna go for a drive?' They animately say 'Yes!' I start the car and put on my iPod; The Beatles!!!! We soon discover that The Beatles fit and sync with everything! Everything is connected! About what we talk about and how it comes up in the song we are listening to. I back up slowly and start to drive..I travel down long roads (suddenly 'The Long and Winding Road' comes on the speakers!) and drive forever! We get to a big hill and once we got over it there it was- the most beautiful mountain side ever! We all fume and bellow at the sight. However we get to the end of our road and make a U-turn back home. Driving now was just pure euphoria while listening to the Beatles. Now instead of going back we decide to drive by our High School and look at it. On the way I saw a girl in a car next to me and was astounded! She was ALLURING, LOVELY, PREPOSSESSING, and all the things a goddess should be. I didn't want to say anything, but after seeing other women in other cars I had to say it 'Dude I'm just gunna say it, is it just me or are women just sooooo beautiful!!!' They were just like vastly bewitching and C & G both agree and we all explain how we all saw different women in different cars that were all drop-dead GORGEOUS!

The time is now 7:40am and we have just arrived back at G's house. We go to his room and watch Television. A Jackie Chan movie was on call Mr. Nice Guy...Jackie Chan was intense!! He was our hero and savior; this guy could use anything around him to fend off evil! He was about to be ran over by a gigantic construction truck and used his feet to kick off the tire while on his back on the ground to avoid getting run over! Jackie Chan, a innocent bystander, risked his life to save to two girls he didn't even know!! I start to crack my neck, knuckles and toes and explain how good it feels. C joins in on the cracking and for a moment we just sat and cracked. We all suddenly get hungry and start craving some Chicken Biscuits from Chick-Fil-A!

The time is now 8:25am and as we leave we wonder if we are still tripping so we look at the picture of the Universe again it was still moving and bright! We go outside and flick rain drops off leaves enjoying and soaking in everything. I drive us to Chick-Fil-A where we gorge on the best food known to man but suddenly after I eat one I start to become profound on the reflections of everything created from the rain and became full. C & G were still hungry so they ordered another one and feasted away! But something happened..as I watched them eat those Chicken Biscuits I realized the pain the chicken had to go threw to make us have a happy meal. I felt disgusted and yet at the same time I felt it was a fair trade off because they taste so good. 

The time is now 9:00am we eventually go back to G's house and bam! There was another Jackie Chan movie on Television called 'Who Am I?' We all laugh and watch. We can't stay on one channel and switch back  and forth between the Jackie Chan Film, The Fresh Prince, and a show on the SyFy channel with Jennifer Love Hewitt. Eventually we settle on the SyFy show and start listening to 'The Unicorns' again and surprisingly it synced up perfectly!?! The song ended precisely as the show when to commercial..you had to be there. 

Finally it is now 11:00am and C & I decide it's time to go home. We gather our stuff together for awhile all the while listening to 'The Unicorns' We get to my car and we say our farewells to G and drive off after a bit of rustling in the car just making sure we had everything. I drop off C at his home after an awesome night and tell him it was incredible and for him to say 'Hi' to his brother for me. 

I'm HOME! I park my car in the garage feeling the music flow through me. I get all my stuff and walk slowly to my room I get to the top of the stairs and a strange but similar figure stands there asking me if I even slept, I responded 'ehh not really.' My mom then advises me to shower and get some rest. I can only say yes. I put all my stuff away and in the fullness of time step into the shower...wow..what can I say..it was like a..REBIRTH!! I step out of the shower a new man. I get dressed in some comfy clothes and go downstairs to have some water and then it hit me! These were memories that I remember but were all jumbled up and had not line of chronological order. I quickly went back to my room to chat with C & G on aim to reminisce of a night that only happened hours ago!

I then became incredibly hungry and decided to heat up some Extra Crispy KFC mmmmm finger lickin' good! As I reached inside the bucket I saw some crumbs of the Extra Crispy skin of the KFC at the bottom (you know what I'm talking about!) and I ate them with my fingers like a starving caveman! Ironically my friend G hates the skin on fried chicken! What blasphemy!! Anyways that leads up to the time being now- the present: a gift. My chicken is downstairs waiting for me and I and writing this report still. SO now I must end it; BUT let me end it by saying this: LSD is something you cannot describe with words I only maybe wrote out 65% of what happened last night on this report. If I wrote all 100% of it it would be too long as it already is!!! FUCK look how long this shit is!

I preface by saying this is a very long trip report. Read as you please.

Whatever is said here cannot be fully accepted as truth. For words such as these will never be able to fully pass on to another an experience of such magnificent transcendence. We are limited by our vocabulary and way of communicating, thus we are unable to express to another the true essence or extent of an experience. 'What can be shown, cannot be said', as Ludwig Wittgenstein put it. A psychedelic experience can be shown but not said. So, the words that follow are just conjured up metaphors, allegories, analogies, images, and symbols that hopefully will give at least a single individual a creative idea, an epiphany, or an inspirational breakthrough - at least for a moment. Try and read everything here poetically, if it resonates with you, vibe with it.

This experience has taken me awhile to somewhat articulate  for others to try and understand. The reason is that words don't do it justice. I kept this experience internalized to fully embrace it, integrate it into my being, and not have the use of language taint and contort its meaning or essence. Even now I cautiously type these words fully apprehending not one single person will feel or experience what I experienced. Maybe they have or will, but to describe such an experience with words one will never truly know. One just has to trust the other person. So, I humbly ask for your trust; not your belief, but trust.

As a psychedelic voyager and explorer, I merge into the vastness that seems to be mind. Through the doors, windows, gates, labyrinths, and palaces I find myself. During these experiences, I learn and also remember. As well as try and bring back some form of an idea that can be articulated. Bring back a meme if you will. Something that helps people get through life simpler and easier, even if that feeling comes for a moment. These memes in a sense give permission to others, permission to experience a novel understanding about life and what the psychedelic experience has to offer.

Set: healthy mental state, calmly excited and trepidatious for the experience

Setting: my room, alone, AC and fan on, completely dark except for one candle that was lit toward the end of my bed on a bookshelf

Intention: to be the center of my own mandala

10:30 pm - drop

As I waited for the come up, I sat/laid down on the bed and played my Kaizen steel drum. 

11:03 pm - first initial energy building up

The drum sounded spectacular. Each note would resonate throughout my whole being.

11:23 pm - slight acid feel

Around this time, I remember walking into my living room and my dog Tia (who is my sitter for most of my trips) was laying on the couch. I was petting her for a bit, then I went back into my room and she followed me. 

12:07 am - everything is beautiful

I remember the notes on the drum sounded blissfully beautiful. I was also in awe over how soft and beautiful Tia's fur was - she is a Belgian Malinois. Petting her head and ears felt like silk. At this time everything was perfect and life felt divine.

Luscious flowing waves

I felt the oceanic connectedness feeling that many feel on psychedelics (common on LSD), also while petting Tia her fur felt like waves. Luscious flowing waves.

Boundaries shifting

This is when I first started to notice that my mind was becoming untethered and connected at the same time. If you have ever seen the fMRI image of the two brains: one on LSD and one sober brain, you will see how everything is looser and more connected while on LSD. I had that visualization of my brain and the connections I was making in the moment. I felt every inch of my neuronal pathways and every basement and attic that was previously left untouched in my mind, now connected to the whole.

Insanity gained and insanity lost (I wonder if I meant to write 'sanity gained and sanity lost', but I'm not entirely sure). I had some backups on hand if anything were to go south. I had Xanax at my bedside in case I started to go through a rough time, and sure enough, I did go through that rough time. I can't count how many times those small white pills went through my mind. I was so convinced that I was going mad that I knew I needed to take one or else I would lose my mind for good. Somehow, I decided to ride through the hell without taking the little white pill. I humbly ensure that this was the right thing to do.

At this time, the trip took a turn. Because my boundaries were dissolving so severely, it felt as though I was literally losing my mind. As Terence McKenna said, 'The psychedelic mantra... 'I've done it this time!''. I say this with the utmost sincerity in my voice... I honestly felt I was going mad. I felt schizophrenic. I have no direct family history of schizophrenia and do not know what a schizophrenic person thinks. But I convinced myself I was losing my mind. I would walk around my house, stopping randomly, and continue walking saying repeatedly, 'what the hell is happening!'. I then laid back down on the bed with Tia and I experienced a transcendent catharsis. Through the pain and anguish of losing my mind, I discovered I am the only thing in the universe. I was shown to be a singularity. With this realization, I bawled my eyes out for a good amount of time. The reason I was crying so hard was that of the pain in understanding that I'm the only thing that exists. I'm all alone. 'The last dance you dance, you dance alone'. Coming back from what felt like hell and expanding back out of the singularity, I had a new perspective. Coming out of being alone, I realized I do not have to live this life completely alone. We want to connect to others, that seems to me to be a main goal of humans. I felt tremendous love, hope, and compassion when I realized that there were two pillows on the bed I was laying on. This second pillow belonged to and symbolized my girlfriend. I understood I have someone with me side by side to live this mystery of existence together with. I did cry again at this point as well because of the emotions that were surging through me at the time. This was another lesson that we create the reality in which we live in.

Because I did this trip that night, because I went through that experience and felt those things, it felt as though I changed the structure and time of reality. My reality. And the reality of everyone in my reality, which seems to be me. I apprehended what shamans do. They are arbiters in a sense, who transform the nature of reality in the moment to a truer or novel form. The shaman is a true magician.

Toward the end of the trip, I remember having amazing sensations on my skin and in my skin. It felt as though I could feel the fabric or net of reality on the 4th-dimensional level, in my 3-dimensional body. It was as though moving my arms up and down felt like they were moving through spider webs, but the spider webs were inside my skin and attached to my skin. It seemed as though I was experiencing the network and connectedness of reality through my skin. It seemed as though I was experiencing the network and connectedness of reality through my skin. This was a sensation I have never experienced before. It was as though after expanding out of the singularity, I was downloading myself back into a reality I was creating. And this was the physical sensation of that experience.

8:30 am - end of the trip

The rest that follows are some ideas that came to me during and after this particular experience.

We are constantly seeking. Seeking on many levels: material, spiritual, psychological. We seek and seem to never be satisfied. We seek out into matter for the next thing: seek a car, a house, a lover, a book, a job, drugs, money, pleasure. We seek spiritual enlightenment through various practices including yoga, meditation, psychedelics, gurus, float tanks. We seek psychological health or closure through different things: psychotherapy, other people, lovers, family, friends, knowledge, power. We are constantly seeking. 

One blinding message I got out of this trip was that the thing we are seeking or finding seems to be ourselves. We are seeking ourselves. We are seeking outward and also inward, but what you have to realize in that all of this seeking, you are just seeking yourself. I truly understood this. I found myself during those 10 hours. I became the center of my own mandala. The next day after the trip I went on a long hike in nature to process the whole experience. During this hike, I had the song Wake Me Up by Avicii playing inside my head, 'All this time I've been finding myself, And I didn't know I was lost'. These lyrics had a tremendous impact on my mental state at the time. By the end of that hike, I felt as though I found myself and understood how nature loves courage. (reading this experience over now, I see that I lost myself after this experience. It took a while to find myself again and gather the pieces of my mind to put them back together).

We're constantly distracting ourselves, distracting ourselves from ourselves. Distracting ourselves through various mediums, activities, and thoughts in our lives. Distracting ourselves with TV, with technology, with other people, money, etc. After this trip, however, I discovered the utmost empathy for myself and others when we all distract ourselves. Finding and remembering who you are can be a scary thing. It's only human to use things to distract us from ourselves. And I have nothing against this spiral cycle. It's a part of being human and many human beings need it. There can be pain in discovering the self. I understand why we distract ourselves from that. Like the Bodhisattva after discovering himself, he goes back into the collective to help others realize their true potential. He apprehended the distractions others and even himself creates and has empathy because he discovered himself and remembers. Just try and remember who you are.

Discovering and experiencing that I am the center of my own mandala created a vivid feeling inside myself that I will try and express as an idea. This was the deepest lesson I learned throughout this entire trip, so it will not be easy to articulate. In fact, it seems not even possible to drag its essence from a higher dimensional matrix into this 3dimensional language. So, what follows must be taken simply as an idea. I discovered that I am the center of my own mandala. To get an image of this: if I am the center of my own mandala, I in turn am connected to everything else. Everything else around me seems to be a fractal extension, or difference in the pattern; essentially me. Everything and everyone seems to be me. I am everything and everyone. During the 2-4-hour mark was the toughest and most challenging part of the whole experience. All boundaries were dissolving and it felt like everything was closing in to a single point. A singularity. Certainly, part of the challenge was me going through ego death, but I have experienced ego death before and this had a different flavor to it. I became the singularity. I discovered that I am an essential part of the whole. I am a big player in the game of life. All that exists and ever existed in this/my universe seemed to be myself. I am all that exists. Just me. Nothing is 'real' except my own direct experience. 

For some, this view of 'I am the only thing that exists' may come off as egotistical. However, I would completely argue the opposite. If I truly experience myself as the only thing that ever existed and exists, then that means that everything in my life: every situation, every person, every being, every dream, every conversation, every setting, you, my dog, my neighbor, the sun, the moon, the ocean, that tree, that cloud, that star, that whisper in the wind, EVERYTHING, seems to be me. If I see that, I then have tremendously more compassion and love for not only myself but also every being and everything on the planet. If I am everyone and everything, wouldn't I want to treat myself with compassion and love? This brings happiness. So, having love, compassion, empathy, and all these other good virtues for others, literally seems like you are giving oneself love, compassion, and empathy. This view surely gives clarity to the whole human situation. And this realization had and still has a profound effect on the way I conduct myself in the world I create. It's like the Golden Rule: Treat others as you would like to be treated.

Toward the end, probably at the 5 or 6-hour mark, I vividly understood once again that we create the world we live in. We construct, from the ground up, our reality with our choices, thoughts, and intentions. Also, with the understanding that I am everything, I choose what my life will be like and how I feel. Psychologically, emotionally, and physically. We are the heroes of our own story. We write that story.

One idea: no one, especially the ones I love wholeheartedly, should experiment with these substances unless they are truly psychically empowered. Even if one thinks they are, they will not be able to un-see what they will see on these substances. Reason for this statement came to me after the trip. When using psychedelics as tools and in a shamanic context, there is a great deal of challenge, pain and suffering one CAN go through during the experience - this, however, can be one of the most beneficial parts of an intense psychedelic experience. I love my friends and family too much for them to have to go through those types of experiences like I have been through. I care for them too deeply for them to encounter anguish, distress, and very very challenging experiences. Carl Jung once said, 'There is no coming to consciousness without pain.' And I think he was on to something. These types of experiences can possibly be the one thing one needs most in their life, and my loved ones may want this sort of thing to happen to them. If that's so, I would be right alongside them in their discovery of self. But after this trip, I couldn't bear to think of having the same pain and suffering I went through be put on anyone I truly love.

After a very long and arduous 10-hour trip, through my expanded awareness at the time, a single word manifested in my head. This occurred after the remembrance that I indeed create and construct my own reality. This word will only imply meaning to myself, for only I can interpret the magnitude of the word corresponding to my life and all of life in general. The word was 'stay'. For those who have watched the movie Interstellar, you can see how this word seems to have a weight attached to it. Stay. Many of us here on earth move very fast and believe this seems to be the way to get things done. What this experience gave me was the affirmation to slow down, to stay; especially in the moment. Stay.   What this experience gave me was the affirmation to slow down, to stay; especially in the moment. Stay. Many of us are constantly pushing toward something, pushing toward a certain activity, or pushing toward a job/career, or pushing toward other people, or pushing in personal/social development, or pushing in the moment. I think letting go seems more appropriate than pushing. It's hard to get such a convoluted point across without contradicting oneself. People may be thinking I am against pushing towards things, and in life, you need to push towards certain things to grow and learn. Sure, maybe, and yes; but letting go seems to be truer to oneself and life almost. Things are unfolding as they should be, even if you have no conscious understanding of that, there seems to be a process flowing underneath it all. Letting go helps you flow. Plus, this seems to be a prescription for more happiness and less anxiety. I say letting go, not meaning let everything go in life and just not give a shit about anything; but let go of trivial things and negativity, and just have common sense. It seems to be like the coincidencia oppositorum, the union of opposites; where in order to push farther one needs to let go more.

As Terence McKenna said, 'True ecstasy is a union of opposites. It's the felt experience of paradox, so it is exalting and illuminating at the same time that it's terrifying and threatening. It dissolves all boundaries'. For those that read this entire report, understand the set and setting I was in, as well as my intention. These factors greatly influenced the trip I had. Every acid trip, or mushroom, or MDMA, or salvia, or DMT trip will be different for everyone every single time. Where you are and your mindset at the time, as well as your intention sometimes seems even more influential than the actual substance you are ingesting. However, dose also greatly affects your experience as well. Even when you take steps toward a safe and secure journey on a psychedelic with a proper set and setting, very challenging experiences can still occur. However, I am sure glad I had this difficult experience in my own house, alone. If I was anywhere else, especially in an uncomfortable setting, who knows what evils could have been unleashed.

The truths one sees while on psychedelics are not so much truths of reality, but more like models of reality. After having a deep, transforming experience one may think they have reached some form of enlightenment or nirvana. It may feel that way, but try to understand that the experience that you had seems to be a glimpse of only a small pixel of reality. A model one can take up and play around with. An idea to fool around with at the dinner table of the collective consciousness. Some models are more suitable than others, depending on your current situation it seems. It's difficult to say if one model seems better than another because no one can truly know this. I understand why psychedelic pioneers from the past say you can get trapped in the beauty and awe of a trip, and believe that that experience was the truth. Try and see that the 'truth' you experienced was just one truth out of infinite truths. Or one model out of infinite models. It seems as though it's our job to discern what models, ideas, and truths are worth preserving and discussing.

I am still unpacking this experience.

This seems only to be the beginning.

It is a rare experience that I think is one for the internet, and this is one of them.  This is the first time I ever did acid.  Prior to this I had taken shrooms about 10 times and smoked weed.  

I had wanted to try LSD forever, as long as I could remember, but it was so elusive.  Finally with my new job and my life in order I sought to find it again.  This time I came armed with a bit of knowledge that to my surprise, most people (even drug users) are not privy to- Silk Road.  I narrowed down my purchase, from LSD to shrooms, back to LSD, etc.  Made a list of potential products and vendors and the price in bitcoins, which I converted into dollars.  

I ordered 5 hits of 100 ug Sour Patch Kids from a vendor in the U.S., one who was trusted and had many rave reviews.  I spent the next few days breathless, not knowing if anything would come, if it would be fake, or if cops would come with it... It came 3 days later, and this was during the holidays.  

I went to my mailbox after getting off of work Wednesday, I work the night shift, and found a small package that I thought looked like it might be it.  Breathless with anticipation I took my mail up to my apartment.  I put everything else away then set about opening my mysterious package.  This had been a great night already because I girl I liked texted me at work all night.

Inside was some more packaging and pack of candies in black packaging.  I opened the candies carefully and looked inside- there were 5 of them.  Check.  This was going well so far.  Next came out the blacklight.  They lit up on one side or another, not both (except for one, which my seller told me he had double dosed), so this was another confirmation.  Okay.  Now time to put them away in a really good hiding spot until I find the right time to do them.

I did this and waited until Saturday (New Year's Eve) afternoon, after my couch had been delivered.  All morning was spent going back and forth with myself over taking something that I had no experience with, and from a seller on the internet (good reviews notwithstanding) that I had not seen.  I didn't know if I would freak out or if something bad might happen.  I had read enough trip reports on a reputable harm reduction website to know that bad things can happen with unknown substances. I had read enough trip reports on a reputable harm reduction website to know that bad things can happen with unknown substances.  To my credit I felt like an experienced psychonaut, so I felt like if anyone could handle it I could.  Luckily I told myself it was a small amount, and that only LSD is active at such small quantities, and I wondered why I didn't get the blotter.  Actually I had thought that it was sour patch kids blotter. 

Finally got my courage up and began walking around with the candy in my hand.  Taking the plunge, I popped it in my mouth and chewed it.  Tasted just like a regular candy.  Hmmm... was this good or bad?  Took some pictures for facebook while I was at it.  Since I couldn't find anyone to trip with, I figured I'd at least have my facebook friends.  

Now I am feeling good about my decision and set about doing things that I knew might be a problem later, like uploading my pictures or deciding on what to have for dinner.  Half an hour passes, then 45 minutes, I am looking at the clock but remembering reports about people thinking their acid wasn't working and taking way more than they should have.  I decide to go for a walk.  This is the end of December in Wisconsin, but I don't mind the cold and it is actually beautiful and refreshing.  I was hoping I would start tripping outside too.  

I walked for about 15 minutes, around my block and still didn't feel anything.  I was starting to get disappointed.  I thought about how hard it is to get acid or make it, and wondered why I thought that some person on the internet would have it.  I thought about a refund and didn't want to go through that with the seller, and not with my Silk Road account either.  I had read that they log your buyer stats and if you have too many refunds sellers might not want to do business.  I sure didn't need that so I thought about just taking it as a loss.

I figured that since it was the 1 hour and 15 minute mark and no noticeable effects that I would take another.  What could it hurt, right?  So I found the one that he had double dosed with the blacklight and ate that.  If this didn't work there was no way that it was legit.  

Sitting at my computer on facebook and the internet looking up things relevant to these matters, I began to feel strange.  Like my vision was getting weird.  Lights were going off in my field of view behind my vision like a firework show or strobe light.  An explosion of color and light.  It would get really light, then really dark, then the trip really started to kick in.  The visual perspective on things changed, they began to take on different shapes and especially when I would look around they would shape-shift.  

I was so happy at this point, because I love tripping and this was an excellent start.  It was all interesting, and while it became intense, was never scary.  I thought, I wonder what music sounds like now?  I couldnt for the life of me find the CD I had created on my computer and I had left the physical CD in my dads car, but it was no matter because I just played it on my computers library- Hurts Rapture.  And it did have me enraptured- music sounded so good, like way different and being experienced on more levels, it felt like.  Like it was a direct link to my soul.  Or maybe one of those movies like Constantine where time stops and the protagonist is in hell, but this was heaven.

I started looking around to see what things looked like now.  I had over the past few weeks hooked up my bedroom with all kinds of cool stuff in preparation for this trip- blacklights, psychedelic blacklight posters, lava lamps, incense, and of course my new couch.  Being after Christmas I had a new Sony blu ray player to go with my TV, and had made a DVD with my favorite metal videos.  With much effort I made my way over to my set to put them on.

What was amazing was standing in my kitchen watching the videos, and time would go in slow motion to where I wondered if my DVD had burned wrong or if I was just tripping.  So then I thought about it and I watched it speed back up to normal.  Once it got there, I decided I liked the slow motion better and my mind made it go back.  This was while I was trying to make dinner, which was the most difficult task of the evening by far- I couldnt coordinate putting the ham in the microwave, taking it out, and putting it on a plate.  Somehow that turned into a 20-step process and I kept getting stuck at step 4.  Looking at my TV and its stand was trippy anyway because the black glass shelves were sort of in a quantum state of superposition- not really in one spot, not really in another.  

And the mindscape was so extraordinary as well- I mean total joy and anticipation of every moment coupled with elation at seeing these things take place.  I wanted someone there with me very much.  My friend was at work and couldnt come over but she said I could text her, and I did.  When I told her that I had to take two, but that I was tripping hard, she said, Yayayay!  Haha.  

Later I found myself rolling around on the couch in a state of ecstasy, and thought that this would be awesome to do with a girl.  It frees all my emotions and unlocks your consciousness, and I thought that it was sort of like the drug ecstasy, which I have also never done but it seemed to fit the same description.  I wondered about how many trips I had left, if I could get away with taking one the next time and make it three more times.  I was glad that I took the amount that I did, it was amazing at ~300 micrograms and I can take it.  I will probably take the same amount next time and start early in the morning and outside.

What blew my mind as well was the fact that I took presumably 300 millionths of a gram and it had my consciousness crackling like a transformer- I could imagine the trace amount of LSD being like a key to my mind.  It was such a good feeling, like it was supposed to be there, taking every brain activity to another level.  Before the trip I asked my friend what it was like and she said that it was kind of speedy, like it could get going and my mind would not be able to slow down, but I found that I liked this as well.  I was full of energy while I was on it, and when I would get the idea to go do something and do it was like yay!  Like look out the balcony door- wow it looked crazy outside.  Like some kind of movie in sepia or something.  I wanted to go out for a walk but that seemed an almost impossible task considering I could hardly make dinner.  Plus it was about 30 degrees out.  I am an adventurous person by nature so I almost did it, but I didnt want to go to too much effort and freeze myself and I was having such an experience inside.

The only thing I would really want to change for next time is to have someone else around, it was fun to trip by myself regardless but it got lonely especially considering LSD  is a social drug. Set and setting is everything I picked a time that I was in a good mood, in my own apartment, with a job and most of my life in order. This was a memorable, and defining, experience of my life.  And a positive one since I gave this drug its respect and planned for its use.  I plan to order some shrooms from Silk Road next, as far as visuals and colors bleeding into each other I believe shrooms are more of the right choice, and for a great speedy trip that will take me to another dimension of joy and thought acid is the right choice.  I saw many unreal things on acid too, but it seemed to emphasize a transformed consciousness and altered vision rather than super trippy visuals, at least at 300 micrograms.

Melting Art, Witches, Entity Contact and The Akashic Records. My first LSD Trip:

I took the sugar cube around 8 or 8:30pm in front of a 7/11 while the dealer was right there. After he left I walked in the opposite direction down this street to my Russian friend's house which is pretty much already right there. I go inside to do some weed related business I guess and I still have the sugar cube melting in my mouth and my Russian friend saw this and was just kind of laughing and amused by it and kind of surprised but afterwards after I dropped off whatever it is that I needed to I somehow or other linked up with my other friend near 7/11 who is kind of a tweaker but he's not that bad. He's the one who introduced me to the dealer but the dealer was not fucked up or tweakerish at all. Anyways I somehow or another meet with this tweaker kid who I had been hanging out with in that part of town lately anyways, he was gonna smoke me out behind Vons. It was a really kind of run down scummy looking area that was very bleak and almost like a sewer (it was right near a sewer) with peoples back condo windows behind it and we were sitting on these stairs smoking weed and I was looking at the giant whiteish but dark wall for the whole backside of Vons just kind of lumber over me and it began to take on an ominous and abstract sort of vibe. The wall also seemed to kind of ripple but in a mental way and look less like a solid wall/surface and more like a liquid but these effects were super super faint and mostly just mental. The real trip hadn't even started yet this was just the creeping up part similar to mushrooms. Its also important to point out that I very well thought that this 'LSD' was total garbage. I didn't think real LSD was even around anymore. I had taken tons of acid' in the past but it was all bunk or weak crap so I thought that's how this would be but I soon found out I was wrong. 

After a while of smoking weed and weird creeping up vibes (this is only 15 -20 minutes after I took the hit) we left the back of Vons and shut the gate behind us and my tweaker 'friend' dips out on me and says he has to leave like he always does so we head in opposite directions and I head up towards my neighborhoods in the more suburban part of town still having the feeling in my mind that this 'acid' wasn't real acid. I mean it was only $10 a hit so how could it be? I've bought 15 -$20 hits in the past that were complete crap. So why would this stuff be different?

The next thing that happened though really threw me off guard. I crossed the street to walk up this hill back to suburbia and then this motorcycle zooms right past me while I'm on the sidewalk and it's driving down the street and it was so startling and loud. I didn't physically flinch I don't think but in my head I definitely did and I was thinking wow that was loud and surprising and so I realized at that point I was definitely feeling the effects of the drug whatever drug chemical this is.

After that though oddly enough nothing seemed to happen and I even took the long way home which was at least another 15 or 20 minutes and I noticed no effects during that time. 

The next thing that happens is I come to the very end of my neighborhood still not at my house and dont really feel high or anything at least not that I could tell, I didn't even feel the weed but my tolerance was high so I wasnt really thinking about it. Anyways I didnt feel like I was on anything or maybe just forgot I was but Im just sitting on this stone wall in front of these houses texting my OTHER friend who lives down the street from me who is actually like a real friend and hes the one I trip with the most. I dont remember if I told him to come out and take this other hit of acid or if I was just seeing what he was doing and if he could hang out but as Im sitting there (and I swear this happened exactly like in a movie or something) this random pitbull just comes out of nowhere and began inspecting the area Im around including me and is sniffing all around and then a little while later I stand up and the dogs owner who is this lady who lives right next to there comes from her driveway and looks very surprised and says Whoa come here boy (the dog), wow Im surprised he didnt maul you or start barking like crazy and then she starts laughing and this weird vectorial feeling took place in my mind while all these physical motions and events started to happen in this strange order and consistency. She was just very curious as to why the dog wasnt barking or going crazy. She told me she had seen me around before and wondered who I was and we both struck up what would then be a pretty long and immersive conversation. It first started out with me walking over there and facing her over on the side of her driveway but facing away from her house and her driveway. There was a black gate behind me and a tree on the sidewalk in front of me across from the gate and she was standing in front of the tree and I was facing her direction which was the direction of the dark street. This is when things got crazy.

Something about the lamp lighting from her driveway shining on her and the tree behind her with just darkness behind the tree and the strange mysterious look of the tree itself I got this really dark mythical type vibe and these really fantasy-driven, imaginative, crazy and kind of fantasy inspired delusional thoughts and feelings about her and the place I was at. This developed into visuals as well as altered perceptions of what I was seeing. I started getting feelings and visions that she was some kind of witch or mythological character and I was trespassing on herswamp?cabin? In her woods?.I dont know I was just having the most retarded, crazy, folklorish and eerie thoughts just constantly coming to my mind and not in a psychotic or intense way but I could just feel my imagination running wild and showing itself on my visual perception of her and this setting. ItIt was at this point that I knew this was actual LSD and that it clearly was still around today lol. Put me in a pretty good mood too. Thats also when the trip fully hit me and when I entered pretty much what I consider the real LSD space where nothing seemed normal. Nothing, and it hit me much harder and faster and more sudden than mushrooms ever had. It was like dabbing hash oil vs smoking weed; it just hit me all at once instead of gradually and in an undulating fashion like with mushrooms. 

She seemed very short at one point too when she walked around and made movements and she seemed like a witch/gnome hybrid or mix or something odd like that. Like some kind of mythical or folklorish character or archetype that hadnt been named yet. She almost seemed to look kind of ogreish in some ways and the way her mouth looked started to change. I remember her hair looked extremely trippy and vivid and seemed really vibrant and glossy and at some points even started changing lengths and texture. It also became clear to me that I was on real shit because I began to view her visually from a nonhuman alien perspective and my whole attitude about what I was seeing was drastically changed and broadened.

If I hadn't had tried any tryptamines prior to this it probably would have scared the shit out of me and shocked/perplexed me too much to carry on a conversation with someone I had just met. It was very strange being around someone who doesn't know you're on acid either. Especially after lengthy first time encounters. She was smoking a cigarette and the smell was really clear and intense. Despite me tripping the hell out and the acid hitting me for the first time I still carried out a very long conversation with her. We talked for what seemed like hours about what seemed like everything. We talked about alcohol, whiskey, weed, college, music, concerts, the neighborhood, break ins and crime and a bunch of stuffit was one of the most interesting and wonderful conversations I have ever had with another human being despite the whole eerie, folkloric, Wiccan vibe I was feeling and seeing at first. This eventually changed as we changed positions and new archetypes in the trip started to show as well as the colors. At one point she walked towards the driveway so Im looking at her standing in the driveway where its considerably brighter and more lit up; no longer having delusional thoughts or fantasies still talking to her about crime in the neighborhood or whatever and I noticed that everything behind her, on the side of her and in my peripherals all the colors and everything started to look really melty and liquidy. Everything in my peripherals all the colors and objects started to just blend together and it looked like swirled melty colorful paint, it was what I would call psychedelic tunnel vision. 

This was one of those effects or visuals that most people would probably expect to get from a psychedelic drug. When in reality these squiggly, colorful, artistic lines and fluids are trivial in the context of the experience.

Even the clearer more intense floral and arabesque patterns I would see later in the trip were somewhat trivial when it came to the main point of the experience. 

I remember at one point Im standing behind this black gate thing while shes in the driveway on the other side and the edges of the black bars of the gate began to vibrate and I wanted to laugh at it and point it out because I knew it wasnt normal and it had to be the LSD but knew I would just look like a werido but man the blackness of the bars vibrating was really cool looking and how my eyes kept changing their levels of focus on certain objects. The architecture there was interesting, it was like this strange black gating on top of this brick wall and with thorny rose bushes and roses behind it the whole area had a semi gothic appeal looking back on it now. Even had a bit of a dark bricky but ecclesiastical appeal or at least it seemed that way. Id probably appreciate it much more now.

Eventually her husband popped his head outside (obviously because she was talking to me forever) and to her he was just likeWhat are you doing..? he looked so puzzled as to why she was even talking to me. And shes like This is Ryan! He lives in the neighborhood I was getting to know him. The way he looked physically waswell funny and cartoonish. He literally looked animated in some kind of way or just really surreal and corky like a real life cartoon and felt that he was just another funny unique cartoon character in this world who had something of his own to say whether it was nice or not. Hes a pretty big (fat) guy and at this time he looked just completely round..like literally round and his whole body and his head was just another round sphere on top of this bigger round sphere which was his body. It was just like 2 circles stacked on each other and his slight concernment had me kind of amused and I wanted to laugh at the surreal situation. He tells her something like wellyou should come inside or something along those lines and I cant remember how long after that but we eventually part ways and she goes back in or something and I leave to finally go and meet up with my friend to give him the acid because he still hadnt taken it and I was already knee dip in this experience apparently.

I go walking down my neighborhood to meet up with my friend and don't see any noticeable visuals or anything on the way there probably because its dark but he comes out and we're walking and I...can't ...find .. the acid

I can't find it anywhere because it's not in the foil wrapper and I'm kind of freaking out and looking for it on the ground and shit and so is my friend and we don't see it anywhere and then eventually I reach in my flannel pocket and pull out the sugar cube. I started freaking out because it wasn't in the foil like it was supposed to be and was just thinking oh shit what if it went completely bad? But my friend takes it and then laughs saying he was looking for like a 'crack rock' looking thing. He didn't think it would be an actual legit good sized sugar cube.

After this (it's probably about 9:30pm or 10) we head back by my house then back behind my back yard in this canyon area behind my house and like 40 other houses in the area. A southern Californian deserty verdant/kind of tropical looking canyon with a creek and a few bridges separating the houses from the main trail and the abundance of trees in the middle. But anyways we're just sitting there, in the darkness and he was asking me if I was hallucinating and I said no because at that point in time I wasn't. Even though I was hallucinating up a storm just earlier at this particular time I wasn't and it was just really dark and cloudy. There were no stars out. It wasn't very 'visual' at this time mostly just my attitude and perception towards everything was different, I was smiling like crazy and talking like a fool sort of and it was just more of a feeling than hallucinating. And I told him that; that it was more of a feeling and he's just like;
'ya.. It's probably meth'

Because he had this same idea that I previously did which was that real LSD no longer existed and probably thought like me that you couldn't get anything mystical or profound from something even just a little synthetic. 

Eventually one of us or both of us prompt the idea to go to our Russian friend's house I went to earlier down near the 7/11. Or maybe the guy called us I don't remember but we both knew that's where we wanted to be because his house may be kind of shitty and weirdly foreign but his mom didn't care if we smoked weed or took psychedelics so we were down. I assume 10 to 20 minutes later is when we arrived there by walking and when we go inside his place or I guess just that part of town in general the whole vibe of the trip becomes much more upbeat and 'real'. We arrive to his place and sit down in his dining room with the kitchen and living room right there and Im telling him about how I'm on acid and he's like 'haha I know. I saw you take that shit' He then turns the lights on and they both see that my pupils are fucked and my Russian friend's just like 'Holy sh...You look like you're on a good one bro..'

And they both knew psychedelics very well and the way I was looking around at everything along with my pupils they saw that I was actually tripping and my other friend my close friend got happy and started saying 'wow I guess I will feel it after all' but I was still kind of worried that my friend wasn't going to feel the acid because it was out of the foil for a bit and it could have lost some of its potency and I expressed this idea to them vocally lol but we all agreed he'll still probably feel it.

A bit later I see this geography earth science book and on the cover is that classic picture of those sand dunes that you see geologists and geology books reference so much. I noticed how the swirly patterns on the dunes almost matched the swirls in the wood pattern of the table we were sitting at and kept looking at them and comparing the two in awe and both of them saw this and my friend was just like ya I should be feeling it anytime now. 

Shortly after this one of the strangest and most unique things that has ever happened to me occurred. It started with me smoking a few bong loads I think and then while they were talking about something I sort drifted off into my own world. I entered a trancelike state that was like nothing else I have ever experienced on any kind of drug. It wasn't like an exotic or enchanted hypnosis/mindfuck like with mushrooms it was instead just..a trance. A classic trance and I don't know how long it lasted because I lost complete concept of EVERYTHING. 

Literally everything around me and ideas about where I was were no longer being perceived and I wasn't aware of my surroundings only my consciousness and I entered this dreamlike state (literally) where I began to very very vividly remember a dream I kept having at that period of time in my life and it involves me in that canyon coincidentally enough and I began to really explicitly feel like I was in that dream again and not just in that dream but in the whole dream world. The whole dream mindset and the whole abstract strange unexplainable feeling of dreams I slowly started to remember. I didn't even fucking know I had this dream let alone multiple times but the LSD somehow made me remember. 

Like it just put me in this phenomenological trance which then put me into the dream mindset? But I remember how just by entering this mindset and this 'dream' headspace I was somehow able to know and internally confirm that I had remembered details from a REAL dream that I had had that I couldn't remember sober and I was also somehow able to understand that this dream had happened so many times before and that the dream headspace was so strange yet so familiar and so bizarre to be experiencing while supposedly wide awake in your Russian friend's kitchen. Or dining room whatever but it doesn't matter because I had completely forgotten that I was in that dining room there with them I don't even think I knew if I was awake or not. Dreams and dreaming have never been the same for me since this experience. I don't know how long that whole trance or whatever lasted but it couldn't have been that long because when I snapped back to reality in the most sudden and puzzling way ever I saw they were still having a conversation and smoking I believe I turned down the bong for a certain amount of time up to this point. I was no longer interested in anything to do with weed. Apparently my close friend was though because he really wanted to feel the LSD and he figured smoking would boost everything which he was right...

When I snapped back to reality I was stunned. I didn't even think experiences like that were possible.. I had the most intensely puzzled look on my face when I snapped back and realized I was just sitting there staring off into space on the desk not looking at them. After this I look at them and notice my friend who took the acid is now laughing hysterically and talking louder and my Russian friend has to tell him to quiet down because its late and his mom was trying to relax in her room or something. I can tell he's feeling it and he can tell too and those bong loads probably intensified it for him like it did for me.

But anyways after that trance was when I started to kind of see the magic in the substance and realized it was some serious shit. Who knows what's gonna happen next.. Strange to think that this is still just the beginning and my other friend is JUST now starting to feel the acid. This was gonna be a long and crazy night. Little did I know it would only get even more strange and psychedelic. 

I remember they were talking about something and laughing but I wasn't paying attention to them. I was just being high on acid laughing at random things, laughing at essentially nothing really and then they see me laughing and they I guess were talking about some kind of inside joke or something that happened to just them and they thought I was laughing with them just to be cool or something even though I wasn't even listening or paying attention to them I was just laughing at nothing because I was on acid and they tried talking shit haha. I don't know how they forgot I was on acid and that people who are tripping are obviously going to laugh at nothing and I wasn't even listening to their conversation anyways but this didn't occur to them. Not sure if I have explained it to them or not but it just really sort of annoyed me. My Russian friend was actually doing that the whole night, he kept treating us like we weren't on anything or like he somehow forgot that we were tripping. He even mentioned at some point that he forgot. It's probably because everyone who was there was pretty much just experienced with and knowledgable about psilocybin mushrooms and they all take that drug fairly seriously, it seems that it was both of them but now it's just my Russian friend who didn't take acid too seriously. 

My tripping friend eventually did after trying the acid obviously but my Russian friend seems to have a bias against synthetics. He (like us) never dreamed a synthetic could give an experience of cosmic consciousness or really even understand how it could. I don't blame him either but anyways both me and my friend on acid are both very awake at this point, everything is very vibrant and I want to say kind of artistic and perceptual. We both feel very zestful and excited at this point and were having a pretty good time. All three of us wax on about philosophies and even some stupid scary subjects like the Russian Sleep experiment. Its almost like our Russian friend was trying to trip us out or really get our thoughts going which I should have known but had no problem with. He even at one point tried to bring up different LSD myths about people cracking their backs in his house before and having 'LSD flashbacks' even though that is not even remotely close to how flashbacks really work and I explained this all to him and whatever. He even tried to bring up some kid who had a flashback and died because he had a seizure and I didnt believe him for one second (obviously because its bullshit) and just said Fuck him, Im glad hes dead. I think I even started laughing after I said that. 

This kind of emotionally bothered my other tripping friend who was still coming up but whatever. The situation would only get more off putting and emotionally striking later down the line he and I just didnt know this. I remember eventually at some point my friend is fully tripping hes just staring at the painting on the wall behind me. It was a rustic relief painting that was actually pretty cool and looked pretty creative and semi appealing at the time and I just for some reason decided to be kind of an asshole and say na..it looks like shit kinda. Just..fake haha and looking back it really didnt but I couldnt help but feel how fake everything man made seemed. The painting and wall seemed very shadowy and alive but also subject to possible distortions. It was a really weird kind of perception.

My friend was probably in a whole other stage of the acid trip at this point, he was probably at the eerie mythological swirly colorful stage. I can see artwork really grabbing a hold of your creativity and imagination at that stage but in this new stage I was in I had already gone through that trance and this stage was more clearheaded but my perception of everything was soo different and more real'. Around this time our Russian friend told us to leave the house temporarily like walk around the block or something and come back in a bit and so we did and I remember going outside the feeling I had about myself I felt so primitive and human but also like an animal. Hard to explain really but I was just in this very primal fight or flight mindset. Not as intense and as atavistic as the primal feeling from shrooms, this was a little more cartoony and surreal and felt less wild.  But this primal fight or flight feeling was very clear and there; like anything could happen at anytime whether good or bad and I would have to be front and center to deal with it. I had no more concept of material things or possessions and personal property and I think this is when my ego started to vanish and become small and my vulnerability started to go up. We made our way out of his mini condo driveway area after making a few confusing stops on his property under this large tree. The whole area was very dark and hidden and had a strange but sort of nice vibe. All these different locations gave off such different vibes it was really quite interesting. It was like LSD was just the magnifier of everything. The giant tree over us looked so weird and different, all the plants and trees did.. My tripping friend was doing something on his phone, we then leave and walk around the main street for a bit then eventually come back to the Russian friends place. 

I dont remember when exactly this was but at some point were at the dining room smoking weed and my other tripping friend is super interested in the weed and by how dank it was. I dont even remember whos weed it was. My attitude and the way I looked at weed was definitely different at the time, it was really weird looking at weed but it wasnt like I was really digging it necessarily. I was just uninterested in weed at the time whereas my other friend couldnt get enough of it. I remember me and my tripping friend kept having to piss and kept having to go to the bathroom the whole night. I remember going the first or second time and afterwards I looked in the mirror. My tweaker friend told me in the future after this experience that looking at yourself in the mirror while on acid is the fucking trip of your life.

 I did look in the mirror and I have done this on shrooms before so it wasnt too new, it was really only minimally different. I see myself and I have this vibrational higher dimensional alien/hybrid look to my face and my skin and I looked very detailed. I have had this alien/hybrid look to my face before on mushrooms but this felt a little less alien and more vibratory and yeajust like I popped in from some higher dimensional plane temporarily. The bathroom was very dirty but I was used to it and this feeling of looking in the mirror felt so legendary and personal that it made up for the bathroom being dirty. I felt that by looking in this mirror knee deep in my LSD trip it made me feel like I was a part of something that so many other people have been a part of as well. I felt like I was just another participant in this legendary trip or weird dimension. 

At some point when I return back to the dining room table I start looking around the table and this one piece of paper caught my eye. I guess this was a lettera private letter but how was I supposed to know? It was in plain view along with everything else and not even hidden so why would it be private? I wasnt even thinking about what it was or might be. The only reason my eyes were drawn to it was because the table was a mess with papers and books but it was the only thing on the table that had cursive writing on it so visually it really stuck out. At least with the LSD mindset.

I cant even read in cursive so I picked up this letter which I didnt know was private and proceeded to try and figure out and read or make out even just a few words so I started saying it out loud but not really saying much because I couldnt read it and then my Russian friend sees what Im doing and gets absolutely FURIOUS and tries to fucking punch me nearlyhe threw a swing like he was about to punch me but didnt touch me and he had a really aggressive look on his face. He was holding the bong as well which was pretty funny but as he did this motion he yelled Whooaaa thats a private fucking letter man! and at the same time my other tripping friend is completely thrown off and confused and like 'wtf..he said whoa right when my angry Russian friend did and the vibe of everything just went sour and aggressive instantly and I could tell my tripping friend was very surprised and offended by this and hes definitely not a pussy or anything or a stranger to tripping but I could tell by the look on his face that he had never been in a stressful situation while tripping before. It didnt play over well with either of them and I was actually the first one to try an calm the situation down and laugh it off. 

Even though I should have been the most frightened one there I just started laughing and making fun of my Russian friend for that and he admitted it was his mistake and he shouldnt have done that. He just thought I was mocking this private letter of his and what it said and I had to remind him that that wasnt it and I was just tripping on acid blah blah blah and he admitted he forgot I was on acid and ya I just kept making fun of him lol pointing out the fact that he tried to punch me with the bong in his hand. Eventually hes like whatever and gets up and goes to a different room to do something but in a non threatening way. More like a ehh theyre just tripping on acid type of way. I can read him pretty well. Its funny because right after he tried to punch me and tell me it was a private letter I was just laughing in his face because I thought he was joking at the time and just trying to mess with me which I think only made him more angry. I thought he was just trying to trip me out. I just kept saying Are you joking right now? Theres no way youre serious.. and hes like NO! Thats a private fucking letter. My other friend was kind of worried lol. Even after my Russian friend said whatever and got up and left the dining room my other tripping friend still looked concerned and effected by what had just happened. Meanwhile I was still making fun of my Russian friend/kind of apologizing too and then I get the urge to smoke weed so I just grab the bong and start cracking up as Im hitting it while my other tripping friend across the table is justwell..adjusting to the situation I guess you could say.   

The whole night my Russian friend kept getting in arguments with his mother and he would look so angry and start turning red. All of his emotions looked exaggerated and my other friend after the trip told me the next day about how he seemed so just overly angry that night and he said he felt like our Russian friend was going to literally explode or something because he was so mad and annoyed with his mom and turning red and shit. Almost shaking too. Russian friend kept explaining how her moody bipolarism and constant bitching is the reason he tokes so much weed. I really started to understand their situation more clearly through all of this intuitive based tripping and watching. He explained how she was just fucking off the wall and she would cause a scene just randomly in the middle of the night to yell at him about socks or something.

Something interesting and kind of crazy was happening this night as well. It was a Friday night (of course because we wanted to Fry on Friday) and the girl kind of across the street (a different street) on the right side was having a big party and we all knew her personally for different reasons. I had known her the longest out of all of us, at her house they were seriously turning up and just having the hugest loudest party ever. Me and my friend who is also tripping both kind of want to go over there because it seems sort of cool and wild and were pretty good friends with her but our Russian friend had dated that girl in the past and had a bad break up and they really hated each other. Like aggressively hated each other. She even got him jumped one time right outside his house right there, my Russian friend was just kinda like Fine just go over there if you want to and started acting like whatever forget about me but me and my tripping friend knew this was an unrealistic plan and that we should just stay there and be fair anyways. There was nothing for us at that party. It was probably just full of drunk white supremacists  anyways and my other tripping friend was Mexican so that probably would have been awkward. But this part was just bumping all night like crazy so that kind of became part of our trip in a way. It was still Friday night you know?

This overall feeling I had at this stage of the trip was like this strange perception I had of everything that was really only unique to the tryptamines. An abrasive, alien and hyperreal look at the universe. Like a mindful cleanse. I began to see faces everywhere too, similar to when on mushrooms. It actually reminded me in some ways of my last strong mushroom trip the rushing cleansing feeling and the seeing faces everywhere. And my last strong shroom trip was right across the street from where I was now. A little before this change in perception though the LSD trip became much more profound and seemingly hyperdimensional almost. It felt very cosmic as well and at one point unifying and it felt like I saw and touched the universal consciousness where I invaded its essence and it invaded mine. It was a feeling of oneness. I remember we were listening to classic psychedelic rock music (like we often do) and the Jimi Hendrix song Getting My Heart Back Together (the 5 minute version) we were both so taken away by the sound of the guitar and it was so interesting and satisfying the whole song and thats when I feel we really understood where that Jimi Hendrix guitar sound actually comes from and why its so perfect for acid. So electric and vibrational. Music felt so much more vibrational than it usually does when tripping on shrooms. On shrooms music sounds more distorted and echoey but on acid the music seemed to sound better? More ascetically pleasing and more vibrational. Both are very emotionally touching and deep however. 

Shortly after that song something that I once again never believed was possible happened to both of us. After listening to Jefferson Airplane and Jimi Hendrix we put on the Beatles
We put on the song Across the Universe and holy shit..life changing
I guess this is when we probably peaked (before the real abrasive rush) but I dont know it was weird and I felt like I almost had multiple peaks and things were kind of out of order but I guess that was just the cycles of acid. Even though we both took the Acid at different times we still somehow were experiencing the same effects at the same time and having the same feelings and almost same thoughts about everything and we both experienced a peak experience at this time. So ya I guess we peaked while listening to Across the Universe and it was far too profound and spiritual and meaningful to even begin to put into words and it was just truly life changing and amazing for both of us. It was one of those you had to be there type experiences, you can never know how profound and beautiful and heavenly it was if you have never experienced it yourself this moment felt like everything and like the heavens were raining down and channeling emotional beauty and good energy onto me and my being.

Im listening to that song right now as I type this to write this better ha and it still brings back humbling emotional feelings and memories. 

Before this feeling happened of extreme well being and love though it is important to mention that the music itself slowed waaaay down and began to vibrate intensely. This vibration and what seemed to be a slowing down of time manifested something; the musical vibrations themselves seemed to manifest visualsand I felt like my friend who was tripping saw it and felt it too and we were both speechless just listening to the sounds of the music because it was so vibrational and touching. Im not sure what my Russian friend was doing at the time but probably something in the kitchen. He kept getting in confrontations with his mother and doing random things. Anyways these visuals that somehow only seemed to exist through the vibrations of the song (the chorus of the song to be specific) these visuals seemed to be predominately green with a small amount of blue and an even smaller amount of red. Maybe some faint yellows? I remember it was mostly green though. It was almost like all those colors combined and became a new blended iridescent color combination. This vibratory color field then appeared to look like..holy shit an entityLiterally a fucking hyperdimensional entity like those reportedly seen on DMT and powerful doses of tryptamines. I was so surprised/confused because I thought things like this were only possible on DMT and ridiculously high doses of Mushrooms and Ayahuasca but not a ..synthetic chemical like LSDwell I have gone much farther on mushrooms than on LSD and I still have never had an experience quite like this. This was a real explicit encounter.  And to think that at the beginning of this night I never even thought real LSD even existed let alone that I would be faced with angelic beauty and fucking entity contact that very night while peaking off pure LSD and listening to the Beatles. Well that song has certainly never been the same for either of us since that night to say the least. We even played it multiple times on our next LSD trip to pull us out of a certain gloomy situation. Didnt really work, just made us more emotional but whatever lol thats another story.
But when I perceived and felt this entity and lovely vibrations of the music we felt like we were rained down upon with knowledge and love and cosmic awareness. Felt very alien and yet very heavenly and bright. And of course higher dimensional as well. The experience itself didnt feel like it was alive (like with shrooms) but it felt like I had come in contact with something that was sentient and conscious..and very wise and important. This entity' at least and it looked and felt slightly mantiod but geometric. I feel like it endowed me with indescribable cosmic knowledge and awareness. It had an alien, metaphysical, vibrational geometric vibe and felt sort of Hindu in a way. Much of the trip had this kind of eastern Hindu feeling and clean patterned visual display that was most noticeable when looking at the designs on the small carpets in the living room. They seemed to wrap up and swallow my consciousness at one point. I cant explain that shit. 

Anyways the entity itself was like geometric but very indescribable and like I said vaguely mantoid as oppose to humanoid. Like a geometric vibratory prey mantis God of some sort. It really only showed itself during the chorus of the song when Paul McCartney would say Jai Guru Deva Om'. When the chorus wasnt going it would just be colors but during the chorus and only after this the entity itself would be noticeable and would continue to inject me with universal love and understanding. This is definitely not anywhere close to the average LSD trip which is why Im writing it down. This is an extremely rare experience that probably had largely to do with set and setting and the LSD itself being so pure. Whats crazy is that prior to this night I had never known what Jai Guru Deva Om actually meant and it turns out this phrase is a mantra used in transcendental meditation that is actually supposed to take the mind to higher consciousness. And for me it kind of worked hah or at least appeared to I mean jesus fucking christ.

Im probably failing to explain just how profound and meaningful this all was. Words always fail to explain experiences like this. I think a lot of times people write trip reports and fail to conclude how powerful and profound the most meaningful part of their trip was and sometimes they dont point it out at all but this is me pointing it out. This was the most meaningful and memorable part of the trip and one of the most memorable experiences of my life. 

The Om' itself would slow down extra during the song for me and be even more vibrational than the rest of the mantra sang and this is when the colors and cosmic awareness was the most intense and when these things in my head or perception were brought into existence through this vibration. The vibrations opened my perception up or something. And what do I find out months later? That this om actually represents the vibration of the universe that allows all things to come into existence..this was a real mindfuck.

I remember looking at my iPhone playing the song and it had artwork for the song that wasnt the Let it Be album but instead a colorful portrait of all four Beatles separately and I cant explain it it just looked very trippy and high def and 4 dimensional and the iridescent colors on the edges of everything seemed to overlap while the images themselves popped out more. The picture looked so intriguing and kind of luring and emotional. It was like this sparkly underwater look almost, cant explain it. Everything was very VERY clear but kind of liquidy and it looked emotionally evocative and kind of sad. Really emotional actually and I could see it on the Beatles' faces lol. Especially on Ringo. His nose looked funny and he looked so emotional and random and justthere and George Harrison had what at the time looked like these crazy sacred patterns on his neck that are actually there on the picture. He also had an eye ball on his palm and I got hit with these intense imaginative spiritual feelings and attitudes towards it like my eyes and senses were drawn to specifically that and was just like damn..stop trying to trip me out mind.'

Theres no way I can explain the beauty and how profound this song was but whatever theres no way to truly know unless you experience it too, it was life altering and completely satisfying on so many kinds of levels and for so many reasons and it restored my faith in a lot of things. This night was pure magic.

This experience was also kind of sad too but so sad it was beautiful like listening to a sad but beautiful piece of music that just evokes so much emotion. This kind of gloomy sadness seems to be a characteristic of acid and even loomed over the rest of the experience but in a beautiful profound way. It was like a really profound sadness. Similar to the feelings of extreme humility than can come with mushroom trips especially when you start thinking about all of humanity and its sins. Makes you wonder if sadness is really a negative emotion or not and the feeling of sadness and joy and beauty seemed to mix or be one. 

After this absurdly great and profound experience with what I can only call an entity? I start texting my girlfriend or she started texting me and I somehow or another bring up how I want her to come over here and I want to see her. I didnt realize it was so late though and she was like So you want me to sneak out for the first time? and she was texting me saying OkayIve never snuck out before..here we go.. and then I start getting stressed because I dont want her to get caught or in trouble tonight while Im in this state and Im thinking What?! Never snuck out before? Fuck I cannot manage this right now' and told her forget about it and I told my other friends there what was going on and they were like wtf man no just stay off your phone and they were just telling me how it was just a bad and pointless idea and I agreed it was crazy and wishful thinking. My Russian friend also said he didnt want anyone else Russian there because of the arguments he was having with his mom in Russian. He didnt feel comfortable if someone else who spoke Russian was there. And yes my girlfriend is Russian and speaks it fluently so it made sense that that all around wasnt a good idea.

Anyways sorry about this next part of the trip because it might be mixed up or out of order because this is when I started really losing concept of time. Not just losing concept of time but time got all jumbled together and mixed up and dont worry Ill explain. This also happened a long time ago, almost 2 years now since this trip. This trip happened in July or August of 2014 and it is now April of 2016. So my memory isnt perfect. 

I also forgot to mention that every time me and my tripping friend looked at our phones it looked completely strange and fake just like all other technology. Thats how we could instantly tell if we were tripping or not. Either by looking at your hand or the screen of your cell phone. Eventually we went in his living room. Me and my tripping friend were just watching whatever was on T.V. flipping through channels intrigued by how different and bright and I guess fake and corky everything on T.V. looked. I think that girls party was still booming loudly but anyways this weird trippy way everything on T.V. looked reminded us of our old shroom trips so this was exciting for us and we started just giggling at everything and we were just really happy. My Russian friend was kind of just all over the place calling people on the phone, doing things around the house, arguing with his mom in Russian and doing weed related business. I guess he was buying a pretty big weed sac and it was supposed to be kept secret but I didnt understand why. My other friend kept forgetting this and accidentally kept bringing it up when we were in the dining room before when my Russian friend's mom was still around but still it wasnt something that we were used to because we could usually bring up weed around his mom all the time. 

What me and my tripping friend didnt realize at this point was that this trip would somehow continue to get even stranger. We werent prepared for any of this. The next thing that happened was baffling and it still baffles us to this day. We were flipping around channels on the T.V. surrounded by foreign patterned carpets in this living room and one of the first channels we arrive on is a real life show. As it was real people. I still have NO idea to this day what the hell kind of show this was but it was just this guy, some kind of guy sort of trying to be funny in front of this live studio audience while trying to tell them and inform them about something. And it wasnt like a scam thing or religious thing just pure entertainment and I could tell he wasnt the main runner of the show or the main host because he had this guest' kind of vibe. He was kinda funny looking in a way too, kind of looked like that singer from that song Rude by 'MAGIC! or whatever and he kind of looked distorted and underwater but not really. It just looked funny and dumb once again like on shrooms, and I remember the background behind him was very blue and vivid and all the colors on the screen were more vibrant. It was weird because reality and the real world looked so hyperreal, more real than usual meanwhile anything on the T.V. seemed extra fake and blurry but still colorful so it was very odd seeing high definition real life right next to shitty T.V. picture life only separated by the border of the screen. But the strangest part was what this fucking guy started to talk about and it confused the hell out of me and my tripping friend. 

And we didnt imagine any of this. We both heard and saw everything. Im guessing we just missed the context of a joke or something but goddamn what the fuck.

He started out just stating facts about the Holocaust but had this underlying satirical tone in his voice like he was kind of distracting from the subject and still trying to entertain the audience or build up to something. He looks like hes having some trouble stating the facts normal though. His own subjectivity starts to bleed through his words and attitudes. Well eventually down the line he starts sort of laughingas hes doing it.He starts to look like hes holding back laughter after stating facts about the Holocaust..

I am just completely puzzled and eventually he begins full on laughing and chuckling while explaining how many people died and all this messed up stuff about the Holocaust and then sooner or later the audience starts laughing with him as hes explaining these depressing facts and me and my friend both just look at each other and are so confused. So fucking confused and creeped out. I remember just saying Thats not funny..why are they laughing at this? What is going on? 
Meanwhile my Russian friend and his mom are arguing and bickering at each other in Russian right next to the living room while this confusing messed up situation is happening in front of the T.V. on the couch with me and my tripping friend. My friend starts agreeing with me that none of this makes sense and the fact that theyre laughing at this stuff is just..so confusing and so eventually we just started laughing too lol. We started giggling at this stupid situation while looking at this guys ridiculous face. Its almost like we were laughing in sync with him and he was there with us and my friend just goes haha hes on acid and were both just laughing even the guy on the T.V. is laughing and then my Russian friend tells us to Shut the HELL UP! That is MY mothers message to you guys. 

We werent even talking that loud... we were kind of getting bothered by both of them me and my tripping friend..but it was a house we could be at and trip at so we couldnt be picky. And when he yelled at us it didnt go back to awkward silence or anything everything just continued how it was. And we change the channel because that shit was too fucked up and we eventually land on Family Guy and I remember when we landed on it it was just one joke then commercial, like the end of one joke and then it went straight to commercial and I remember it was the stupidest most unfunny Family Guy joke Id ever seen and my tripping friend was just like That was stupid and my Russian friend right there at the edge of the room was like SHUT UP! and his mom kept telling him in Russian to tell us to shut up and we werent even talking loud at all.
Especially when my tripping friend said that the joke was stupid. My friend was basically just almost talking to himself its like my Russian friend didnt want us to speak at all not even softly. Maybe he wasnt used to us being so talkative? But we werent being that talkative. I mean we were kind of casually and humorously pointing out funny and strange things but being pretty covert and insider about it. I dont know what my Russian friends problem was but since that night hes admitted he was tripping out for no reason and you know his mom is always crazy because shes bipolar. Also it was late and they most likely werent used to people acting so awake and giddy at this hour. It was like the middle of the night. 

The most confusing part of the trip hadnt even come yet. Eventually his mom and him stop bickering in confusing Russian words that only continued to confuse me and my friend and this is the period of time when my Russian friend was gonna buy a half ounce of weed or something but without the dealer actually coming inside I guess and without his mom knowing. He might have been doing other weed related business too because of how all over the place he was but this was happening all right next to us while we were continuing to watch T.V. while completely off our heads on acid. While my Russian friend was doing that this is the time when me and my tripping friend really started to lose concept of linear time. Time seemed to no longer happen in a linear fashion and it literally started moving in circles and repeating itself. Time actually started repeating itself and looping it was so confusing and things that only happened once in real life were beginning to happen over and over again multiple times and my Russian friend was in and out of the front door a lot. Well it seemed like a lot..He only went out probably 3 or 4 times but it felt like he went back and fourth like 8 or 10 times or even over a dozen times it was crazy. I got stuck in a time loop while sitting on the couch, both of us did. 

Time just kept repeating and we saw my Russian friend who only went out a few times go out over and over and over and over and over again..It was all so strange and confusing and my tripping friend said Im so confused or This is so confusing then he said This is a weird night and the colors were just so bright and everything seemed kind of cartoonish or vibrant but surreal and arabesque. All the patterns were popping out and everything was also extremely vivid and alive. He was right though my tripping friend. This wasnt what you would call a super happy trip/night but instead a powerful and profound trip and a 'strange night man'. Not too recreational honestly. But amazing and incredible and incredibly psychedelic.  

So ya this was a new and mind-blowing experience for me and him. The time looping thing that is. In the past on mushrooms I have had time slow down, speed up, stop completely and even cease to exist but this was the first time that time actually repeated..and started looping. Very off putting and confusing. I couldnt understand it. That seemed to be one of the themes of the LSD mindfuck is this melty cyclic out of order mindfuck where everything's just jumbled together and mixed around. It seemed like events happened out of order and its still hard to remember what order things happened in the trip as this mindfuck effect kind of carried out throughout the whole trip and infected the whole thing. It was like that movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas..just with the story being all over the place and out of order and fast and loud but visually appealing. Also colorful and pattered.

I think after this; after the confusing cartoonish cyclic stage or at least when it simmered down a bit is when I think things actually got really visually abrasive. I think I said that earlier but this was the even more clean and abrasive stage where everything was just so clear and this is I believe when I was seeing the faces most clearly and reminded me of my previous mushroom adventures especially the one that was across the street just about 6 months before. I remember it felt like how I would picture Ayahuasca or something to be like even though Ive never had Ayahuasca thats just how I felt it would be like. It was like a very commune cathartic cleansing experience however this LSD cleansing wasnt cathartic at all just squeaky clean and abrasive as can be visually. I think before this trip became more well defined with the faces and cleansing I got this sort of cartoonish serious monty python headfuck type feeling. Cant explain it but felt British or foreign in some way like classic wonky British humor. Very pythonesque. Like something youd see in a Beatles movie. Things at this time were also very melty and everything seemed very far from reality and normal perception visually speaking. 

At this point it is very late like 3 or 4am and my non tripping Russian friend is getting tired while me and my tripping friend are still wide awake and were very understanding and yea..kinda over his house anyways so we head out no problem. I remember right after we pass the 7/11 and start up the hill leading to the suburbs with apartments on the sides we see in one of the cars parked on this always packed road 2 people having sex in the car. But it was confusing and very bizarre because they were essentially humping the shit out of each other and doing all the motions of sex and everything but they had clothes on

They were seriously plowing the shit out of each other right there on that main road in the car. I mean it was the middle of the night and no one was really around but come on cant you find a better place to fuck than that? Youre not even that far from the entrance of 7/11 which is a place that is open 24/7. That was crazy and weird seeing that and we were cracking up hysterically but also confused because we didnt understand what was going on and why they were wearing clothes but still somehow having sex? It was still very dark out and we head up this hill past these apartments and we come by and pass the lake. We were on the same side of the street as the lake even though when walking by we usually arent because that side of the street tends to be sketchy but we just felt so carefree. We were still deep in the trip btw. It may sound like enough things had happened already that we would be sober by now but there would still be HOURS of tripping left. We werent finished by a long shot. Anyways as we pass the lake and walk by we look at it and eventually we come to the middle and have a middle view of the whole lake and can see the docks with the boats on it. And the orange lights shining on the dock were shining and reflecting on the dark black water and it looked soamazing and breathtaking. We had to just stop walking and stare for about 5 minutes it was one of the most beautiful things we had ever seen for some reason and we just kept saying wowwow. It seemed so beautiful and captivating for some reason and the water just looked gorgeous.

Ive taken that same acid at that same lake since then and the water has still never looked as beautiful as it did that night. Once again trying to put this beauty in words is pointless.

Eventually we stop staring at the water and the orange light reflecting off it and trek on into the canyon which is pretty much across the street but the trail we want to take is a little more up the hill. As were walking were joking about how the best way to spot people who are tripping on psychedelics is to notice the people walking around in the middle of the night like its daytime and attempting to do daytime activities at some ungodly hour in the night. This seems to be a theme for psychedelics. It just felt like daytime almost at how well we could see things but it was still dark so its hard to describe. Our attitudes were very awake and happy so thats probably also why. I mean we werent super happy or ecstatic really because the trip was changing gears and it wasnt getting any less serious but we also had energy and other feelings. 

This next part of my trip is hard to explain but let me start off by explaining our walk through this relatively short trail through this open canyon to my lower yard which is like my naturey yard behind my backyard. It was the same place we were sitting at earlier when I told my friend that I wasnt hallucinating. Well this dirt trail we were walking on only takes about 2 or 3 minutes to walk down and I know because I walk down it pretty much everyday but tonight it feels sooo much longer. I remember halfway through the walk which was only like a minute into it it felt like fucking 8 or 10 whole minutes passed by and I laughed because it had felt like forever and I saw we were only halfway and was like This is the longest walk through the canyon ever haha and he started laughing because he felt it too. It felt like the chemical was trying so hard to trip us out and trying to get us to notice strange things. All in all this 2 minute walk felt like a damn 15 or 20 minutes no joke and eventually we get to my lower yard where we were earlier and just sit there in the darkness kind of sad that there are no stars out. However its cloudy and not super dark and black like it usually is so it looks cool in its own right. Gave an almost gloomy kind of european vibe. I also saw monty python-like faces in the trees and things and saw a HUGE very well defined one on a giant pine tree that looked hyperdimensional and very tryptamine like. Things looked and felt very tryptamine-like in this part of the trip and that giant face I still see now every time I go in my lower yard and look at that giant pine tree across the way. It was very eerie and ominous and all the other faces I was seeing was giving off such a funky tryptamine alien vibe similar to mushrooms but a little different. Still almost identical visually to shrooms though in terms of seeing all those ominous faces on all the surfaces. 

When we first started reflecting on what had just happened and all the craziness of the night so far (we thought the experience was over) and my friend starts talking about my Russian friend and he says yeah man..Bad vibes seriously bad vibes over there and we could both really really feel it when he said that and almost could see it. There was so much going on visually and emotionally with each word and thought. I remember this is when the closed eye visuals were really vivid and impressive and since it was dark the closed eye visions were overlaid over everything I looked at. Especially the things that were dark and natural.

When he said bad vibes and he had that weird emotionally striking complaining tone in his voice I saw or perceived orange, red and brown flashes or blotches of color sporadically in my visual field and it made me feel vulnerable and uncomfortable just those words and the phrase bad vibes'.

My friend said that he was freaked out when my Russian friend got angry and tried to punch me and said he felt this unexplainable feeling when it happened that if he actually did hit me that my tripping friend would have punched him back and he didnt know why he felt that. He also started talking about the tweaker kid who introduced me to the dealer and how stupid he thought he was and how people shouldnt hang out with him because hes a tweaker and a dumbass and stuff and my friend makes this weird extraterrestrial noise making fun of him which trips me out and continues to give me weird cosmic closed eye visuals and feelings and so I just laugh.

Its funny now because even though he was a tweaker at this period in time and would use things like meth, speed, heroin and oxycontin after having 2 more solid acid trips of his own (after his first initial one) my tweaker friend stopped everything except weed and made himself go to rehab in the northern part of my state.

I remember this is also the stage in which things got very introspective and reflective. Things also got very emotional again but in a deeper more introspective way I remember just having absolutely no ego or sense of self importance. I was so small even smaller than I was earlier and it felt kind of exotic and very deep. It felt almost avatar and otherworldly like with shrooms but not quite. It was definitely visible mysticism though. For some reason my minds eye visuals were so strong and visual as well but in my head. It was kind of an evocative experience and I started reflecting a lot and thinking about a lot of personal things and things about the world and people I know and just life. This egoless view of life and the whole world was very striking and cut pretty deep down. I remember almost getting kind of flashbacks and extremely vivid almost tactical memories to certain events and people I know. I randomly started thinking about things like the first time I snorted cocaine several months prior to this. 
Actually I think it was my second time doing cocaine that I was thinking of..ya it was my second time and it was when I was sniffing really pure coke at the lake. I imagined in my head or felt like I was there again somehow in THIS acid trip like I began to see or imagine all those tall trees around me again like I was in that certain part of the lake again on that day. It was like I was reliving the experience and feeling like I was in 2 places at one. Since the coke was so pure that day it so absolutely reeked like diesel way more than the average coke and the vivd memory (flashback) of it going up my nose or what it was like to go up my nose was so intense I felt like I could smell it in my nose at that moment quite clearly and feel it so grotesquely and vividly and I didnt like it, it was a disappointed vulgar feeling attached to it and it was all while feeling this really deep complex state of mind where I had no sense of self importance whatsoever and I felt very emotionally vulnerable. I started thinking about how hard drugs like that are so awful and so cringy in this egoless and disclosing psychedelic mindset I was in. I was thinking about how absolutely terrible and disgusting poisonousness drugs like alcohol, cocaine, meth and heroin are and I at the time couldnt understand why people did that stuff in the first place. It all seemed so vulgar and so toxic and unnecessary. It felt like those kinds of fucked up drugs and activities only distracted people from the bigger more beautiful picture and took them farther away from what was actually real.

Looking back on it now I definitely dont have a problem with moderate and responsible use of things like cocaine or alcohol (especially when its pure) but at this moment while tripping when I was thinking about how disgusting and bad these things are it was just because I was in a really virtuous and spiritual headspace with no ego whatsoever. And its mostly ego that allows people to do these toxic dangerous hard drugs like nobodys business. Its also mostly their egos that allow them to do it and have a good time while doing it even though theyre essentially poisoning themselves. I felt like my tripping friend was having deep and similar thoughts, maybe even the same thoughts since he had that same coke too and around the same time I did just a few months before this trip. I dont know it just kept feeling like we were sharing the same headspace. This headspace was very crazy. 

It was incredibly complex but also tranquil and calmlike it was a higher state of consciousness that our normal 3 dimensional minds and consciousness couldnt begin to understand but it was also peaceful and not very intense just there and we were in it fully or had access to it so to speak.

This is when the visuals and visual perceptions were just amazing. Since it was a cloudy night and the sky wasnt totally pitch black we could see the silhouette of the leaves of all the trees and plants sticking out clearly against the sky with the clouds in the background.

It was incredible because me and my friend were also just sitting there looking up at the trees surrounding us right above our heads and how all their branches and leaves overlapped each other and how everything looked soooo vast and complex. If I look at that same area sober or I guess just not on LSD it just looks like some leaves and some branches and thats it and it looks like a pretty relatively small area with not much scenic value to it at all its just so trivial. However when on this trip this small area above us like I said just looked so vast and so big and complex. There was just so much to look at and it was infinitely visually complicated and intriguing. 

We also saw kaleidoscopes for the first time and that was a new experience for both of us. Something we had never experienced on shrooms before just like time repeating itself. Just something new that shrooms hadnt shown us yet. The kaleidoscopes and time loops were a first. By the way I dont mean we saw colorful kaleidoscopic patterns or anything like that I mean solid objects would actually turn into real kaleidoscopes and we would see multiple copies of things right next to each other. It was like everything opened up but multiplied. These were multifaceted visuals that were hard to wrap your head around. I remember seeing a bougainvillea turn into a full kaleidoscope at one point in the light that was somehow shining from somewhere and those flowers have never looked the same for me. This is before we knew what kaleidoscopes actually were and I remember my friend mumbling trying to explain it and since I was seeing it too I was able to understand him and see what he was trying to describe. 

I actually wanted to point it out but he pointed it out first. Weve had this before on mushroom trips where we are mumbling but still able to understand each other because were both thinking about and seeing all the same things anyways. He was saying Its so cool how you can just..look at the all the trees and leaves but.. also.like..look beyond..that.. and it sounds very vague but I knew exactly what he was talking about and he was describing it perfectly. How when you look at the patterns of the leaves on the trees you can look further and further into it like your perception is a microscope/kaleidoscope and you can see even more patterns of leaves inside of those initial real patterns that were there and visible to everyone. So impossible to describe or imagine. I couldnt even wrap my head around it while it was happening. I couldnt NOT see kaleidoscopes, I had no control. My friend also proceeded to say Its crazy how in a few hours we wont feel like this and hes right it was. It felt like I was gonna be like this forever, not stuck or anything I mean maybe stuck ya but it was more just the feeling like wow I couldnt imagine ever not seeing the world this way since this is more real than..wellmore real than normal reality. I cant unlearn or unsee any of this. How will my mind ever return back to how it was and pretend like everythings normal? I felt I plugged so deep in my head it just didnt make sense that I would somehow eventually drift back or come back down to normal 3 dimensional reality and consciousness. 

A lot of newbies to acid often seem to say their first times Will life always be like this? while in the experience because when youre tripping you never think anythings gonna be normal ever again and you dont understand how it ever could be. Your consciousness is too wide open to even conceive of that. Some people get this feeling from strong weed highs too but in a more subliminal conventional way. Like just an idea in the back of their paranoid thoughts. Like they get so stoned and high that they cant understand how they or their head could ever return to normal sobriety or at least they think that returning to normal could be a long struggle and might not happen fully 100%. Of course though it always does happen fully and I do always come back fine no matter how fucked up, tripped out or high I got.

After the acid trip you almost want to thank your sanity and thank being sober and appreciate the fact that your mind always and actively has a pretty solid grip on your perception of reality and the way we creatively see things in our everyday lives. I learn my mind is more strong and powerful than you think and is actually pretty resilient at the end of the day its just that the LSD has temporarily taken the place of my normal serotonin based perception of reality for the next 10 or 12 hours or so. LSD is what helps make my reality and perception instead of serotonin. Because theres no such thing as reality just the reality my mind creates for me, this is one of the functions of serotonin and LSD definitely shows this as well. There is no such thing as the right perception or the right way to look at something. There might be the way I usually look at something but thats just statistically normal not right or proper.

While we were sitting there in what was pretty much just nature and darkness expect for a few houses we started playing Led Zeppelin and weird trippy Jefferson Airplane songs like Chusingura. At one point I think we may have played Across the Universe again I dont know but I remember closing my eyes and feeling and seeing these lovely orbicular colorful vibrating orbs come towards my being and vibrating around my body and doing SOMETHING to me mentally. I dont know what it was it kinda felt like a cleansing and it felt very comfortable and soothing and made me happy and I started to laugh and told my friend because we both closed our eyes at the same time I forgot to say and I was like whoa I feel like that did something to me (closing my eyes) and I thought he would understand but he was like What? What do you mean that did something to you? he sounded kind of worried like it was something bad and I cant remember if I explained it to him or just said nevermind haha but ya I close my eyes again and start seeing angular spikes. I read on Wikipedia one time that a lot of people see 'angular spikes on mescaline so this kind of reminded me of that whole deal. It was also reminiscent of a certain scene in the movie Suspiria. 
These angular spikes which were all very warm shadowy colors red, dark yellow, orange turned into or pulled back into some kind of peacock looking machine creature that was intensely black and gold and seemed robotic and electric. It was (I dont want to say traveling) but existing? Floating or passing by in some kind of other void or dimension.  Maybe a void-like dimension? I dont know.  It was one of the most distinct visuals I had ever seen on a psychedelic with my eyes shut and visually it was impressive but the feelings attached to it were way more awesome is all I can say. Words dont do justice for anything Im describing'. Everything this night was so exaggerated and so much crazier, spiritual, hyperreal and vivid than I could ever put into words. Everything was way more over the top and intense and psychedelic than it sounds here or on paper believe me.

At one point we were walking over to the edge of the creek because we just wanted to get up and look at the canyon and all the palm trees and nature. The trail was right across and the creek is up high so its kind of like youre standing on a cliff when youre standing on the edge of this creek like we were and since Im tripping on acid and my whole perception of everything is so different and alien I get sort of almost a flashback feeling to one of my early dramatic mushroom trips in 2012 where I was stuck on a mountain at night that had very steep and intimidating cliffs. Kind of gave me slight PTSD but its like the cool kind of PTSD much like those good hangovers as oppose to bad hangovers anyways its still kind of an eerie judgmental vibe that started to come back. Just the tryptamine headspace and looking down a deserty California cliff was enough to trigger me and my memories of that fateful night. I went on explaining to my friend about that night and how it was so fucked and dangerous and tried comparing it to this and he was tripping so I think he could see and finally understand maybe a little better how much I was fucked that night. Still though..hell really never know.

One of the most life changing moments of the night was when I was sitting there in the canyon back in the chairs with such an intense feeling of akashic oneness and universal collective oneness. Like I was in and part of the universal awareness but also like I had tapped into something that I had never fully considered or thought of before and it was the Akashic Records or something comparable to that. I never even knew what they were called before this and since this trip Ive always been thinking about them and akasha in general. Even when just smoking weed now I think about it. I felt the overwhelming feeling that I was connected to the essence of and acid trips of everyone who had EVER taken acid ever. I felt strong revolutionary vibes echoed throughout the canyon and felt connected to the hippies and the artists, murderers, psychos, scientists, druggies, philosophers, medical patients, architects etc. Maybe even those in America who were poisoned by Ergot in the 1600s? These were the ones who freaked and saw 'witches' and had troubling hallucinations and delusions from being poisoned by ergot of course. A lot of experts now think ergot induced delusions and hallucinations were likely the most responsible culprit for the Salem Witch Trials. That would explain maybe some of the common and creepy folklorish archetypes of LSD and possibly other egrolines or ergot derivatives. 

Anyways I was just feeling this real crazy deep DEEP connective feelings and the whole canyon took on an even more exotic and eerie vibe. More mystical I guess. That deep akashic revelation or experience somehow really changed weed and alcohol for me too. Especially hash. And ESPECIALLY edibles. During this time I felt like I could feel and almost hear the echoes of all those hippies and acid freaks from the LSD realm infecting and spreading out through the whole canyon and all the trees and plants. Things seemed really cold, dark and mystical.

After tripping and tripping and tripping we finally decide to call it a night. Its about 5:30am and we both head back to our houses; we were pretty much already at my house. As my friend heads back to his home I head inside and plop right down in bed. I honestly feel like I cant sleep not only because Im tripping in another dimension still but I feel like Im like super aware of every organ in my body like every muscle, artery, tissue etc. just I could feel it all like I was just super hyperaware and I didnt like it at all and I couldnt sleep because of it. I recently saw a video trip report on YouTube of a girl from the Netherlands who took LSD and also said she had this same feeling towards the end of the trip where she felt aware of all of her organs and insides. She said getting up and dancing made it not so bad anymore but that wasnt an option for me in my room in the middle of the night.

Sooner or later my cat comes to my room meowing like crazy which she doesnt usually do at this time and she just comes in and goes under my covers and just sits on my chest and starts purring. I start petting her and her purring feels very vibrational and alien. I remember the feeling of having a furry sentient animal on my chest being affectionate and trusting towards me was so strange, especially since everything still felt fairly primal. I remember I closed my eyes and it completely felt like I had this small strange alien life form vibrating on my chest almost felt connected to my chest and thought wtf this is so ridiculous. With my eyes closed I felt like she was this red alien life form with some kind of symbiotic relationship to me and MY alieness both biologically and emotionally. Because I was an alien too or some kind of hybrid. At least when Im in these higher dimensional tryptamine realms I am. Yeah cant explain the tryptamines at all theyre too different and explorative even when compared to other psychedelic drugs. Very emotional and soulful too. I just remember the words 'alien life form kept coming to my mind as this strange animal thing vibrated on my chest.

I end up getting to sleep maybe around 7:30 or 8am finally because being physically aware of all my insides wasnt really helping me get to sleep. I wake up the next day not sure if I had an afterglow or not, I probably did but I remember right after the experience happens before your mind really processes it all and breaks the whole thing down looking back on the LSD trip right after it happened it just feels like it was a crazy and vivd rush of colors and patterns and a feeling of being reborn sort of. Thats pretty much what I hear from most people right after it happens and later down the line theyll really think about the profoundness and the small differences in their everyday life. Looking back on it like a week later or something though it will register in your mind as more of just a funky mystical ride or experience. And the peak looking back still seems very geometric and heavenly. LIKE Vibrational angelic oneness. Looking back the whole experience right after it happened felt like my consciousness became this liquidy vibrating thing that was glowing (not like how you think) and patterned and it just all flowed into a complex world. 

Overall it wasn't a super euphoric or recreational experience more like a really strange night to be honest but also an amazing explorative and profound trip. Very phenomenological and perceptive. A clean exhilarating and patterned rush. 
Not as euphoric and lighthearted or even as revelatory as mushrooms but equally as profound and spiritual. Reading all this it probably just sounds like some kind of crazy drug trip or spacey drugged out experience or maybe just a weird random night but thats just how it comes out in words and seems like if you havent been there. It was not what I expected, it was really kaleidoscopic, clean and mystical. The experience itself even though it was crazy and kind of cartoony and silly at certain points it mostly just opened so many doors for me in my life and Im still integrating what I experienced and learned that night and its already been almost 2 years. Theres many things that have never been the same since this trip. It was a very clean and clear mind opening experience and I mean that quite literally not at all metaphorically. It literally opened up the doors of perception for me.

This report is both an experience report and a report on how the use of LSD has changed and reshaped the workings of my thought process.

I have only dropped about 16 times(I think),usually 2 or 3 hits each time (amber gels, clear gels, various blotters, liquid). Therefore, I am not terribly experienced in acid and might be wrong or be making ignorant statements about tripping.

The following is what I have found acid to do to my thought proces while I am on it:
Once I eat it, it usually takes about an hour or so for me to start to come up. I attribute the come up with a rising feeling in my chest (kind of like when your heart jumps the moment you see someone who you've been nervously waiting for (I think you know what I mean)). I realize that I'm tripping when I feel around the inside of my mouth with my tongue and start to become very conscious about the position of inside of my mouth or my face. Basically, I think this marks the beginning of the debasement of standards in the brain. By that, I mean that I stop making subconscious assumptions regarding how the world(and myself) works. Once this debasement of standards occurs, the trip starts for me. Now I am basically a child looking at my world and life. I judge things from the perspective of an outsider I am basically a child looking at my world and life. I judge things from the perspective of an outsider (that is why I think many people report learning so much from acid). At this point in my trip, there is usually a pattern that starts to show up on everything and continue throughout that trip (the pattern is different every trip). I think that this pattern is a physical manifestation of the patterns of life that I notice while I am tripping. That is to say that every trip (for me at least) has recurring inexplicable themes that only I can understand (If you've tripped a few times, you might know what I mean, but then again it could be me). After usually about five to six hours, the change in perspective starts to subside and my consciousness begins to regain structure. The patterns are still all over everything and my brain feels somewhat drained. This 'aftertrip' for me is a period of reflection where I recall all of the recurring patterns (visual as well as pertaining to life).

This next part is about how my mind functions outside of my trip mentality:
I think the repeated use of acid has given me HPPD (I don't quite remember what it stands for but it means that I have some effects of acid while I'm not tripping). Basically, I see patterns all over lots of things during the day and can see a spirit that stays with me most of the time (the spirit isn't evil, but I'm not sure if it's good either) (I hope I didn't lose credibility with this statement, but it's the truth. There's an orb kind of spirit and we communicate usually at night). Also I have that thing where some things look huge and some things look small (Like I see buildings but they seem like I could crush them with my foot).

Acid has also made me more empathetic and given me the ability to listen to people without any pre-formed notions of what they are trying to say. Acid has also made me more empathetic and given me the ability to listen to people without any pre-formed notions of what they are trying to say. Before I became an acid user, I had a firm grip on good and evil and what was right and wrong (I thought I did). I did not realize the immensity of each and every (fully mentally functioning) human being's thought process. I felt like I was the only person who thinks all of the time and that all of my trains of logic were correct. The debasement of standards that acid gives me caused me to realize that there is a completely different reality in every human being's head. While I kind of knew this before I tripped, I realized what the implications of the idea were through acid. Behind every person's beliefs (even if the viewpoint is opposite of yours) there is a perfectly cogent and logical series of supporting facts, no one holds a belief to be true without knowing in his/her mind that it is true. I realized that I cannot change someone's mind by arguing. This also made me realize that many of the notions that I have in my head may be wrong or may be ill-based because of my biased perspective.

There are also a lot of huge metaphysical/astrophysical theories that I have derived and thought out through acid that I am afraid to put on the internet because of idea-theft.

I do not think I am done using acid and feel like I have only begun to unravel the mysteries of the drug itself and life itself. I will stop using it when I find that the time is right to stop.

I know that the effects of a drug are different for everyone due to the unique brain chemistry of every individual. However, I hope that I have provided you with some insight as to what acid does.

Best Wishes,
Arte the Land Octopus

My companion and I decided to drop during a family reunion of sorts. We had a room to ourselves with a laptop and dropped the acid. I took two tabs and he took two. I began to wonder if the tabs were going to take effect or not after about half an hour. After a few more minutes I noticed that the background of the laptop was beginning to ebb and flow. It was overwhelmingly cool. I began to look at a golf ball that I picked up from the floor, it was incredible. We proceeded to load google earth on the computer. We zoomed into the earth and then zoomed out. As we were zooming out it felt like we were leaving the universe, and we had the most incredible rush of energy and euphoria imagineable. It was so powerful we felt that it should not be allowed. We turned on some music to see what it would sound like. We found Jimi Hendrix and the Mars Volta to be amazing, but then tended to cause me to think in a spiral which began to feel a bit scary, so we switched to the beatles. That was a great decision. As we listened to strawberry fields forever, we were transported to the fields. We breathed in and felt a rush or euphoria. We could smell the fields. All the beatles music created an environment. It was incredible. Not only that, but all of our insights would suddenly make sense at the climax of every song. We noticed that what seemed to us like hours was actually a matter of minutes. We seemed to notice this every eight minutes. Every eight minutes felt like an eternity of thought and realization. It was like being reborn hundreds of times through the night. As if we were given the chance to gain the wisdom of age in a single night. The other thing we began to notice was that time was not only slowed, but we interpreted our senses out of order. Time no longer was relevant. We would process a tiny fraction of a second as minutes, and a few minutes as nothing. We would experience something and then realize it happened before something else we had to have heard after the initial experience. 

Finally we decided to leave the room. It was still dark outside. I took an infinitely long piss and began to notice that the wood floor seemed to be emanating energy. Paintings would move, and plants would go through the seasons. It turned out our uncle and grandparents were already awake. They began to ask us about college admissions being the concerned adults they were. We somehow managed to ramble through the conversation supporting each other when we got stuck on a train of thought. Eventually we decided to go on a walk. We were starting to come down at that point. The moon was incredible, and we couldnt' understand where we were walking, but everything was still amazing. Eventually we returned and took showers. My cousin claimed that his shower was absolutely incredible. I did not have a particularly amazing shower, I had already come down from the trip and was just heavily stoned. I felt disconnected from my body. Everything was distant. I felt like I had lost my soul. Like I had no reason for existing. I pressed on though. At the time I couldnt' piece together what had happened during the trip. As teh day went on I began to go insane from insomnia. I was dead tired and my brain was fried, but I couldnt' go to sleep. I was ready to commit suicide and asked some family for something to help em sleep. They gave me some motion sickness medicine and eventually I crashed. I woke up normal. 

For days afterward I tried to interpret what had happened. In the end I realized it was just a drug. All the amazing realizations I had made could be made without its influence. Nevertheless, I do not regret the experience. On the whole it was definitely an incredible time. I still feel wise from all the eternities I lived in that one night.

Since beginning my relationship with psychedelics about a year ago, Ive become a strong proponent of the mind-opening properties that acid delivers. I feel lucky to say that, after a trip I never thought I would have, I still love this drug.

Three friends and I made the trip to TN for the 2008 Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. We are all reasonably experienced LSD users (T having taken it the least at six times), and had for quite some time been planning on tripping Friday, the second night of the festival.

Evening came and went on Friday, and we grew more and more excited at our campsite. We were all eagerly anticipating trying our new Rolling Stones blotters, which were a significantly higher dose than many previous trips (an estimated 250 micrograms). At 10pm, we each dropped 1 blotter hit (I took very slightly less than one and C took very slightly more), and headed to the festivals center to watch the end of Metallicas show. Joining a massive crowd made me feel uncomfortable before even really coming up, so the four of us walked around a bit. We took a seat on a bench on the side of a locked barn on the grounds, where countless people tried unsuccessfully to get in. About two hours and many Sour Patch Kids after dosing, we headed to a tent to watch MSTRKRFT perform. Two guys sharing a blunt with a crew of dancers waving Canadian flags on either side of them seemed incomprehensibly cool to me, and I imagine, to everyone in attendance. 

I thought the girl dancing next to me looked like Nelly Furtado (with no idea if she actually did), and enjoyed seeing her dance, but the guy she was with appeared to be confused every time I glimpsed over, which for one reason or another unsettled me. I found myself too careless to hold on to anything, so C took my sweatshirt as I gave away my glowstick to a very happy crowd member. Every so often Id glance at people that were leaving the show. They seemed like they couldn't stop dancing, and that unsettled me even more.  Rather quickly, people all around me started to look panicked, and I decided I wanted to leave. C, T and I left the tent and emerged into the rain.

We tried to find a tree to sit at by the Comedy Tent. C had one picked out but it didn't seem like we were getting any closer even as we marched on. I realized I was freaking out and told him I needed to leave, fast.  As confusing as Centeroo was to me, it was impossible to get my bearings in the current state and I quickly entered a panicked mindset. I was hallucinating endless rows of identical trees, and everywhere I turned, the Ferris wheel was in my direct line of sight. Leveling up Plasma Pong-like electronic music was all I could hear. I grabbed Cs hand as tight as I could and spiraled into a place so dark I had no idea my mind was capable of such thought. I also thought I was in the process of ruining the almost two-year relationship between him and me. I repeatedly voiced how scared I was and that I wanted to go home. Everywhere I looked were fractals and various geometric shapes, and I seemed to briefly experience a sense I don't normally have while walking past a wall designed for people to paint graffiti onto. Everywhere I looked were endless rows of camping tents, flags, cars, and vendor tents. It was raining fairly hard at that point (somewhere around 3 hours into the trip), and I thought I was the cause of the inclement weather. I recognized the Bonnaroo arch, aforementioned graffiti wall, and the infamous grilled cheese stand on the way to our campsite, all of which I considered small victories. After some difficulties finding the campsite, the three of us ended up back at the tent, where I entered the worst part of my night. 

I was consumed by mind-numbing fear, the likes of which I can't even really comprehend now, after the fact. At this point I buried my head in Cs lap and thought I was about to die (the feeling can only be described as being at the final step before death, whatever that may be. C later suggested I may have been approaching ego death here). My overwhelming feeling was one of embarrassment and shame, and I knew how embarrassed my parents would be if they knew what I had done. A guy in a scary outfit walked by and I thought he was an alien (I was later informed that a person in a scary costume had actually in fact walked by our campsite at that time). C put on recognizable songs (Transatlantic All of the Above, followed by Porcupine Trees Collapse the Light into Earth and a few more All of the Aboves), and slowly I started to improve. We entered our tent, where I cried and cried and begged him not to tell various people. He was calming and reassuring, and even in my state I knew I was in the best hands I could be in. Walking through endless swarms of women wearing tank tops at the festival, my prominent closed-eye visual pattern is best described as kaleidoscopic boobs. I knew I was compounding my problems through too much circular thinking, though knowing didnt help. Aware that I was the reason C was missing two other acts we had looked forward too was certainly no help either. I felt like a small child, too overwhelmed to even change out of my clothes. 

We talked about things that were particularly bothering me at the time, and he gradually brought me away from a state of panic. Eventually (Around 4 or 5 am) I felt ready to emerge from the tent. It was as though I was emerging from the cocoon I had spent the last few hours in. Time, thankfully, passed very very quickly, but I felt as though a sinister aura was surrounding me for the rest of the night and into the next day (visuals lasted around 8-9 hours, albeit much lighter as time went on). During our first trip to Centeroo of the following afternoon, my strongest urge was to cry, though I curbed that feeling throughout the afternoon. I wondered if I would ever feel normal again. I got my answer later that evening, where my group of four was able to enjoy brilliant performances by Sigur Ros and Ghostland Observatory, and thankfully could enjoy the rest of the festival as though my mind hadnt completely broken from reality the previous night. 	

My Bonnaroo trip was a perfect example of set and setting being so crucial for tripping. Having never had a bad trip (before or after Bonnaroo), I learned that too much overwhelming input in an unfamiliar place can be disastrous. Now, I consider that night a learning experience, but will take precautions to ensure it doesnt happen later on. I am so happy that I still intensely enjoy tripping acid, but now truly understand how powerful it can be.

[Erowid Note: 
The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 

900ug of LSD. Skateboarding  depression.

I had been mentality preparing for this trip for about a month waiting to move into my new house after been staying at my Mums for 3 weeks and not feeling comfortable to trip there.

I had been suffering from depression for about 5 years due to my Dad abandoning me and starting a new family.
Instead of dealing with my emotions I bottled them up. This lead to a lot of drug abuse and I became experienced with high doses of Alcohol, MDMA, Ketamine, MXE, Cannabis, Nitrous Oxide, Cocaine, LSD, 4-ACO-DMT, 2CE, 2CB, DMT, 5-MEO-DMT, Tramadol, Benzos and various other drugs. (A lot of RCs)

I was taking all of these substances to escape life and make existence bearable, this ultimately destroyed my ability to properly feel emotion. I would not ever feel sad and was unable to cry for years even though I was suffering. This caused me to feel really frustrated with every aspect of my life without really knowing why. The inability to feel sadness made me feel inhuman I was studying at university but I was doing the bare minimum and barely scraping by. I wasnt working and paid for my drug binges with my overdraft and by selling drugs. I felt like I didnt care about anything and didnt really want to exist. I started to shut people out and would rather sit in my room all night smoking weed then going out and meeting my friends. I never felt suicidal because I just see it as being selfish towards my loved ones. I had stopped selling drugs a few months before this trip and I was really struggling with money. Ultimately I felt useless and my plan for this trip was to make me feel human again and be happy with myself.

I had bought ten 100ug tabs and I was planning to take all ten, I have quite a large tolerance to most drugs and was excited to try being on a high dose of LSD. My last experience with LSD before this was taking 7 tabs quite quickly and having very overwhelming visuals where all the objects in my room would jump around like I was in a Disney film. Shortly after my peak I took a handful of Valium to knock myself out. I woke up maybe 12-16 hours later. I should not have done this as I personally blackout on high doses of Valium and have no impulse control. There has been times were I have taken anywhere between 200-700mg where I would blackout and do god knows what. Once I lost £1,200 gambling online after taking 700mg, that was all the money I had in the world)

Addressing my issues  I dont remember at what time these all happened so I will describe them together now and then describe my dosage and visual experiences afterwards.

Throughout the night I was smoking tobacco in my joints, using more and more as I started to run out of weed. LSD always gives me the ability to separate feelings and experiences. For example, if I am listening to music I would hear each instrument separately at the same time. So when I was smoking tobacco I would feel the relaxation that it brings me but also I would feel the tar entering my body and clogging up my throat and lungs, I would remember that I hate the taste of tobacco bringing me to the conclusion that it is not worth smoking it.

I thought about my family problems and cried for the first time in years, I cried for a while and this allowed me to not only understand what was making me so miserable but to also let out these emotions like a human being and then be able to move on. I no longer felt frustrated and had a sense of peace. I felt sad but finally human.

I often fidget around by clicking my fingers and dislocating my shoulder and then popping it back in. While doing these things tripping I felt like I was breaking my bones and that my fingers and arm was actually falling off my body. This felt very uncomfortable and I decided that I really shouldnt be doing this at all.

I have always been quite scared of the dark because it is unknown. I would sometimes feel uncomfortable walking around at night often feeling as if someone was following me and that something or someone wanted to harm me. While looking down my garden in the pitch black I started to see loads of wolves running towards me and this was quite unsettling because I knew this was all in my head I tried to embrace it and stay calm and obviously nothing happened to me. Now when I walk around at night I can remain calm, if I look behind me to make sure nothing is following me it will put the thought in my head and the more I react to these thoughts the more I felt like I was being chased. It sometimes would get to the point where I would start running and I would not be able to calm down until I was at home behind a looked door. I realised that if I just dont react to these thoughts they dont increase and they go away.

I realised that the reason I was abusing drugs was to escape from life, I would start getting more and more depressed until I would be smoking weed 99% of the day and then I would eventually start drinking every day and using benzos, opiates and anything available. I would purchase everything online so I had a lot of potent drugs to choose from. When I was tripping I realised that using drugs to black out my emotions was a very bad thing and I needed to stop. I now meditate when I need to clear my mind instead of taking drugs to cloud it. When I was tripping I realised that using drugs to black out my emotions was a very bad thing and I needed to stop. I now meditate when I need to clear my mind instead of taking drugs to cloud it. 

I also realised that I really needed to get my life together by getting a job and working harder on my studies. Setting goals is very important to being happy rather than focusing and worrying about things you have no control over.
Dosage and visuals.

12:00  After waking up a few hours before and eating some breakfast I decided to take my first tab. I knew I was planning to take as high a dose as I could manage so I walked over to a friends house who had two Valium that he said I could have. I smoked a joint with him to thank him and then went home. I was thankful to have these because they are good for reducing trips and relieving anxiety. I felt like they were a sort of safety net encase I had a bad trip.

I knew I was going to be taking a lot of tabs and they normally take almost exactly an hour to take effect. Because of this I wrote down the time on a piece of paper every time I took a tab. I didnt want to take a tab after forgetting I had taken one 20 minutes before. I would often feel like I wanted to take another tab but then I would look at my paper and realise that I was going to come up from a tab in the next 20 minutes for example.

14:34  After coming up from the first tab I was relaxing, smoking a few joints and playing video games in my room. I decided it was time for another tab.

15:40  I started to feel the effects of the second tab and knew that I wanted another, when I started coming up from the third tab I started looking at my curtains, they were netted and let in a lot of sunlight. The light coming in from the sun and the reflection of the sky, clouds and the houses across the road let in a wide variety of colours making my curtains appear to be beautiful stain glass windows.

One of my friends contacted me and asked if I wanted to go skateboarding with him. I really enjoy skateboarding and was excited to try it on acid. He wasnt around for a couple of hours so I continued to enjoy the visuals.

17:06  I took my fourth tab and went out to meet my friend. I arrived at the skate spot about 15 minutes before him. It was absolutely packed with people skateboarding and the visuals were really coming on strong. I was wearing sunglasses to tone down the visuals so I could see where I was going but also to disguise how wrecked I was to the general public.

Skateboarding was very enjoyable on acid. I felt quite wobbly but not like I was drunk, I was just quite distracted by all my thoughts and visuals. Anyone who skateboards will know that doing tricks uses a lot of muscle memory, I had been skating for about seven years so was able to land quite a lot of tricks. Although I would have to put all of my mental energy into doing any tricks, this made it in some ways easier than when I would skate sober because I would not put enough mental energy into it.
My friend decided to come back home with me and wanted to take a tab.

20:08  Me and my friend both took a tab so I was on my fifth. I then went to my bedroom to smoke 20mg of DMT, I think it had lost potency because it had no noticeable effect. I then went outside to look at the trees. I felt very connected with them and it reminded me of the film Avatar.

21:34  I take my sixth tab and then went downstairs to smoke a joint. We were smoking joints regally throughout the night and in total I must have smoked about 15-20 throughout the day and night. I looked out at the moon and it was beautiful, it looked like a bright glowing ball of rock. (I know that is exactly what it is but the shape and colour would change so it looked more like a comet stationary in the sky).  It was also incredible to think about how big the moon actually is. It wasnt completely dark at this point but it was starting to be.

22:00  Even though I was still going to come up from my sixth tab about 20 minutes later I took my seventh because I really wanted to go deep into the visuals. We were sitting outside and it had gotten quite dark. We had set up a phone light pointing up through a water bottle to make a sort of lantern and we ended up staring at it for what felt like hours. We would occasionally say to each other things like man this bottle and its just so good.

I would be looking at the bottle and it would shine so bright that it looked like it had descended from heaven, then within the bottle the light would explode resembling the big bang and it created a universe inside. Time would pass very quickly and life would start to evolve, I would see tiny beings start to create buildings and eventually space crafts. The space crafts would start to fly out of the bottle but before they could leave they seemed to notice me watching them and they would return to the form of a bottle. This happened many times in a cycle and the whole cycle would take about 20 seconds.

23:00  My friend went home as he had to work the next day, I took my eighth tab and the visuals started to get very intense. I was debating taking the Valium I had but then decided that I was able to handle myself fine and didnt want to waste the acid I had by reducing the trip. I would be walking around my house and touching different materials like towels and walls, my hands would start to resemble that texture and appear to sink into it. This was very enjoyable. At one point I wrapped myself in a blanket and felt like I was the blanket.

At one point I wrapped myself in a blanket and felt like I was the blanket. 

23:52  I took my finial tab and sent a one-hour alarm on my phone so I would know when I was starting to come to my peak. I was tripping very hard. The visuals would be creating widely detailed patterns out of anything I would look at and when I closed my eyes and meditation I would have visuals nearly as strong as that from a DMT breakthrough.

01:00  I was tripping pretty hard at this point and decided to finish of my DMT that was probably about 60-80mg and then I was going to try an address the issues in my life that I was planning to.

The DMT had very little effect, it added a sort of curvy visual effect that I normally get from a low dose of DMT but didnt have the breakthrough experience I was hoping for.

02:00  I was starting to come down from the acid and knowing I would not be able to sleep I wanted to trip more. I loaded up my bong with somewhere between 15-25mg of 5-MEO-DMT. I had not taken 5-MEO before but had read up on it. Many people said they were surprised by the intensity so I was expecting a breakthrough experience. As soon as I exhaled the world started to go dark. My body felt like it melted away and I experienced an intense nothingness. I had no body, I existed but I didnt feel connected to this universe. It was like I had died and there was nothing on the other side. As soon as I exhaled the world started to go dark. My body felt like it melted away and I experienced an intense nothingness. I had no body, I existed but I didnt feel connected to this universe. It was like I had died and there was nothing on the other side. For a brief moment I almost felt like death would be preferable but as soon as even a second had passed it felt slightly less intense. The fact that I knew that I would be coming back calmed me down instantly. It was still intense but I knew it would pass. I then started to remember that I had bones and a body. It was like a was reborn.

I then tried to sleep but knew I wouldnt be able to so I just laid in bed with my eyes closed and enjoyed the closed eyed visuals, I could seem to control them. I would think of a pineapple for example and then see one in front of me.

I was also getting sort of thought explosions where I would think of something simple like an object or a decision, I would then develop this thought but after about a second I would go off on a tangent forgetting my original thought and having so many other thoughts in my head that I could no-longer pay attention to any of them so I would then let them float away so my mind wouldnt get cluttered.

I got out of bed at around 7am and then tried to get on with the day, I still felt like I was on one or two tabs throughout the day but I felt sober enough to play video games and then go out for a skate in the evening.

When I got back at around 8PM I planned to take a nap and then go out and buy some dinner but I ended up sleeping for about 14 hours.

All in all, I got exactly what I wanted from my trip. I got to experience intense visuals and also dealt with some of the issues that were ruining my life. Being on acid reminded me that I really enjoy being outside and looking at trees and other plants and made me realise that I dont need drugs to enjoy these things. I have now started going outside regularly to meditate to replace smoking a joint or a bong.

It was a beautiful day and G, R and I had just bought a strip of Dragon Ball Z acid the previous day. We called it this because or plug only sold LSD on sheets with the DBZ logo. Due to the weather, we decided it would be a perfect day to drop and we each took one tab of 200ug strength. We then drove around the city and pulled endless gbs as we waited for the acid to kick in, (dont drive on acid we are stupid). At about 30mins in I began to feel the familiar warm euphoric glow and I knew I was in for a great trip. A another 30mins had passed and we headed back to G & Rs apartment as it was really starting to kick in for them but for me the warmth and euphoria had only grown stronger and I had yet to experience and visual. This was odd as I usually begin to experience visuals early on into the trip.

Overall 2hrs had passes since I had first dropped, the feeling of warmth and euphoria was still steadily building and had become so intense that it was almost overwhelming. It felt like I had taken strong MDMA. Then suddenly while lying on a couch in the living room I felt a pop and it was as if reality went through a paper shredder and those strips of reality were sucked away into the top right of my vision. Those strips were replaced with complete blackness that eventually gave way to a mystical dimension void of space and time. While I was there I lost everything that I had always perceived as me all I was reduced to pure tranquility and I can vaguely remember vibrant reds, yellows, oranges, and purples. I dont remember much about this place other than this. Im not sure how long I was gone but while I was there it felt like eternity. I returned to reality with a wide grin, G and R asked me what happened and it took me a while to gather my thoughts all I could do was just smile and laugh like and insane man. I eventually gathered my thoughts and told them what had happened. They didnt seem to believe me as they had never experienced anything similar on acid. I believe this to be my first ego death experience. Sadly, I have yet to experience anything like this since though, I have tried to return on multiple occasions but to no avail.

After I was able to collect myself I walked over to the mirror in the room and stared at myself for a while. At this point I was tripping sack and was curious what would happen. At first I looked normal, slowly, my skin became pale, eventually grey, my eyes turned a deep black, and my hair was moving as if it was alive. This startled me at first as I was not expecting to morph into a foreign being, but although eerie the being standing before me did not appear to be menacing. Since this first experience I have continually perceived myself as an alien looking entity. As the acid began to slowly ware of I saw fractals of lessening intricacy and vividness as I eventually returned to baseline, and was greeted the next day by a lovely afterglow as well as a feeling of newfound meaning and purpose that persisted for a couple of weeks afterwards.

T. 0:00 6 mm x 5mm tab of teddy bear dead family needlepoint taken sublingually (Expecting roughly 75mcg.) (8:17pm MST)

T. 0:05 Making Angel hair pasta, trying a new sauce.  

T. 0:15 Chewed what remained of tab. I find it terribly inconvenient to hold the paper in my mouth for more than 15 minutes, and as far as I can tell it results in no diminished effects. 

T. 0:20 Likely placebo, but very faint body load detected.

T. 0:27 I can feel the paper in my stomach and a slight tickle in the back of my throat

T.(9:04pm) Dinner ready. Definitely feeling the lightened body and egotistical mindset distinctive of early trips

T. 2:07 Definitely a cleaner feeling trip than the 'fluff' that we got from some 'dead family' in Oregon. Auditory hallucinations and general good feelings. A sense of being open and simply enjoying. Many thoughts come to mind, but I let most pass by with the realization that whatever is now is all that matters and everything else is secondary. Feeling very much at peace with my life and life's decisions. Also feeling extremely competant, however no tests come to mind as of right now. Dinner was okay. I've decided to enjoy a bud-light. Weve been watching the office on netflix. And I will go back to that now. 

Sorry busy chasing the dragons

T. 3:.37 Playing minecraft with the woman I love, chasing the dragons in the chinese mythology mash-up had to make a bottle for our daughter. I've reached the point that is common in my acid use where I feel like I'm thinking of things in an important way, as in I can properly discern answers, but I dont know how to apply these thoughts in my daily life in a manner that would be productive. I can properly discern answers, but I dont know how to apply these thoughts in my daily life in a manner that would be productive. I plan on microdosing on what I have left. 

I'm a great person but a shitty temple

In the bathroom, just popped a pimple

Sat and thought too much why cant I just keep it simple

Its sad I often rush

T. 4:01 I have noticed now that I am an inherently suspicious person. Of myself, my loved ones, of society as a whole, but in this context I've noticed that I'm suspicious of my drugs. I seem to think now that I'm never as high as I am. If I were capable of doing it sober I would say that I think I am not enlightened as I truly am. Even though I am. And thus the loop. Its like I cant allow myself to possibly be happy so I have to create these imagined roadblocks that just slow my processor down. My life being the processor. Back to doing the dishes.

T. 4:32 If I'm ever going to reconcile with my brother I need to do it through his wife. In the last thirty minutes I did the dishes and wrote a heartfelt letter to my brother that I will never show him, but now I KNOW I need to sit down and write his wife a proper letter explaining my feelings, why I'm upset with THEM, and why I wish we could all still be friends. This is Good sid with the teddy bear blotters. I know what I want to be famous for. I know why I want people to remember my name, I believe in myself and yet I still accept all my mistakes and my shame. This is a very good accepting plateau and one of the reasons I keep coming back to this drug. Its unfortunate I havent found a way to achieve this feeling by my own meditative measures. It's late but I'm making coffee. 

T. 5:24 Feels like the trip has mostly subsided by now. I'm happy but still energetic and dont want to wake my wife up so I'm going to play league of legends before bed. I cant even hack into my old league Account. Jeeeeezzz its so weird how different I am today from how I was just 5 years ago .

T. 6:38 Pupils still dilated, counts as tripping in my book. Body load is gone by now but still energetic, not tired etc. Just played the most enthusiastic game of league ever, had some real highlights but overall wasnt too spectacular a performance. Was just a ton of fun. Felt comfortable and confident recording it as well.            

T. 8:00 Pupillary constriction is normal and responsive. Still feel a calm, loving energy, but I'm definitely no longer 'high'. Parts of my body still feel slightly numb, or clammy, or calloused, but other parts like the back of my neck are sensitive. My senses, as in the cardinal 5, all feel refreshed and ready for the day ahead. Have had 2 cups of black coffee by now but I am not feeling at all jittery or unwell. Overall I feel pleasant, and dare I say enlightened of many stresses.

My junior prom was located at the Disneyland Hotel Ballroom in Anaheim, California.  A large group of us got together to take photographs of our formalwear.   My date, E.T. and I, matched well, and were excited for the dance.  I was very excited to go to the prom; having taken LSD on multiple occasions prior to prom, I decided that ingesting some LSD at the prom would be a good idea.  It sounded very fun.  

Everything was going very well.  After dinner, my friend and I walked upstairs to use the restroom.  It was around 9p.m., an opportune time to take the LSD I planned on eating.  At once, I ate all five hits that I had folded in a piece of paper in my pocket.  Was that three? my friend asked.  No, five I said.  

The tabs disintegrated quite well on my tongue.  Never before had any of the paper LSD I had taken dissolved so perfectly; I could feel the acid going into my body.  Within minutes I could feel the stuff working on me.  I came up quick, and within twenty minutes on the dance floor, I was tripping hard.  Little did I know that my trip would intensify for the next three and a half hours.  

The dancing was phenomenal.  The song that best sticks out in my mind is Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen.  The climax of the song is one of the climaxes of my life.     The theme of the prom was Cinderella; so naturally, trippy, fairy tale Disney music was played throughout the ballroom.  While slow dancing with my date to a Disney song (with birds chirping, tin whistles, and the like), the room changed colors from red, to yellow, to purple.  It was a very euphoric and colorful experience, and caused me to giggle and smile a lot.

While waiting in the ballroom lobby for the Limo to pick up our group and drive us to the after party, I remember feeling like I was going to fall over.  I felt so funny I could barely stand.  My pupils were very bold.  I was covered in sweat from dancing energetically and intensely, African style ☺.  Within minutes, I would lose control.  Just minutes longer at the Prom and I would have been completely fucked.     

The first thing that I did subconsciously occurred in the limousine on the way to the afterparty.  The Limo was driving around a roundabout, the centripetal force holding me pressed against my seat.  There were lights flashing on the ground in the Limo, and very loud music was playing.  Everything was crazy, and the intensity of the dancing at Prom was fresh in my mind.  Lots of flashing colors and intense rushes of emotion were flowing through my sight and awareness.  Wooooooooooo!  It wasnt until after everyone in the Limo was looking at me did I realize what I had done.  I had just screamed at the top of my lungs Wooooooooooooo with my right hand/fist clenched, and raised high in the air.  I had no control over screaming; like I said, it wasnt until after I screamed and everyone was laughing at me that I realized I screamed in the first place.  

The second thing that occurred subconsciously took place when we arrived to the after party.  I was sitting in the Limousine, and I looked to my right and realized that everyone in the Limo had exited except for three others and me.  Those who hadnt left the Limo were to my left, and were unable to get out of the Limo because I wouldnt move.  I suppose I was non-responsive because they seemed very irritated and confused as to why I wouldnt exit the Limo.  This was the second time that I had done something that I had no control over.  In both situations, it wasnt until after I did the subconscious action that I realized I even did it.  

I proceeded to walk into the residence with my date.  By this point, I was tripping very hard, but still having an excellent time.  Im tripping so hard I told my date.  I wasnt sure if she knew exactly what that really meant; in fact, I seriously doubt that many others on this planet (with the exception of some, of course) understand the magnitude of an intense acid trip.  

Changing into comfortable linen and bamboo clothing took probably fifteen minutes.  Upon exiting the laundry room in which I changed, I heard someone say Who takes that long to change? 

I desperately needed to smoke some pot.  Everyone at the party was openly drinking bier despite the fact that the Mr. and Mrs. were home.  I figured it wouldnt be a problem if I smoked some grass.  You cant smoke that here, its illegal, and the smell is very obvious, I was told as I packed a bowl.  I couldnt understand why I couldnt smoke some weed.  People allow their children to drink beer and alcohol, but smoking marijuana is frowned upon, and its senseless.  I guess some things Ill never know.  My high was intensifying, engulfing me with positive energies. 

Minutes later, I stood up to walk upstairs on the balcony to smoke some grass, but on the way, I got into a conversation with my friend.  He started talking about parents.  He told me that there were sophomore girls in the group whose parents will be coming to pick them up.  Everything was very fast and crazy, and intense open and closed eye visuals overwhelmed me.  Although I wouldnt realize it for another ten minutes or so, I was already in a delusional and subconscious state. I had a vision of a man running and weaving in and out of people at a Rave I went to in LA. 

Everything was crazy, people are talking about parents, and I had a vision of a man who got out of sight, then BOOM!!!  I took off sprinting through the party, weaved in and out of people extremely fast, and ran out the front door and up the street.  A chain reaction went off in my head, and I subconsciously believed that I had to get out of sight because of parents.  I did not think about it, I just did it.  Ryan, where are you going? my friend Robbie yelled, chasing after me.  

I stopped, turned around, and then slow jogged back down the driveway and into the residence.  The reality is, everyone at the party had just witnessed me sprint through the house as fast as possible for no apparent reason (which, later described by my friend Jeff, was the fastest he had ever seen a human run).  From my perspective, though, the reason I had run was legitimate.  I truly believed that I had to get out of sight (or perhaps I didnt really think about it, for everything was intensely colorful, fast, and euphoric).  I thought that because the reason I took off running was legit, everyone who had witnessed me run was impressed by the will that I had to get out of sight.  I felt like a prophet.  I thought that everyone thought that I was badass for running so unbelievably fast to get out of sight. I refer to these delusions as delusions of grandeur.  The LSD propelled me into an extremely delusional state in which I felt superior and prophetic. The LSD propelled me into an extremely delusional state in which I felt superior and prophetic. 

I remember walking into the kitchen and catching something this beautiful girl from my school said.  She said, Ill never look at him the same.  At that moment, she turned her head and smiled at me, indicating that she was talking about me. She had been discussing my incredible will; it was as if she wanted me. I felt amazing.

Shortly thereafter, I decided to go into the Jacuzzi, but I had no bathing suit.  I took my linen pants off and went into the spa in my boxers.  Two of my friends joined me in the Jacuzzi.  I remember chugging beer very fast.  When I got out of the spa, I was wet, and needed a towel.  Get me a towel, I need a towel, someone get me a fucking towel!  All subconscious.

I was wet and wanted to be dry, so I did the logical thing, and took off my wet boxers.  I walked into the house, completely naked.  Someone yelled, Rs naked!  I am a respectable person, not someone who gets naked in public.  My friends tried to help me but I was completely delusional, unable to sit still or control in any way.  I eventually managed to put clothes on, only after everyone at the party saw me naked from front to back.  

The Mrs. had seen me run upstairs naked.  She commented that I had a cute rear end.  After I clothed myself, I remember talking to her.  What did you take?  She asked.  Blotter, I responded, holding my fingers up indicating five hits.  I could barely speak.  Everything I said throughout the night was awkwardly forced and sounded fucked up.  At one point in the night, The Mrs. brought me into her bedroom and tried talking to me with her husband.  I was unable to sit still, getting up subconsciously every thirty seconds or so.  I was tripping extremely hard.  I could barely get words out, and I couldnt control myself for more than a minute.  I would pace back and forth, and when people asked me if I were ok, Id respond by saying, Im golden.         

Beginning at the time I got to the residence, the following hour and a half or so was characterized by 30-45 seconds of conscious awareness, then 20-30 seconds of subconscious actions.  I would do things uncontrollably, snap out of it, and then fade back into a subconscious and delusional realm.  These subconscious delusions and altered perceptions faded in and out every minute or so for about two hours.  The entire time, I certainly had a heightened sense of awareness; my senses were keen, my memory was clear, and I felt very focused.  In spite of my misperception of true reality, my delusional state was one of clarity.   

I eventually stopped doing things subconsciously, and the delusions changed into the realization of the magnitude of what had just happened.  The harsh realization that I had run around and exposed myself while on high doses of LSD had just dawned on me.  My delusions of grandeur became fallacies, and I immediately felt ashamed for my obnoxious behavior.  Although I was still tripping very hard and getting intense visuals (my hallucinations were both auditory and visual, very colorful and happy), I was able to control my actions.  

Everyone at the party was still drinking and having a good time.  I tried to mingle with everyone, but was unable to.  I felt inclined to apologize to people, but found that bringing up what had happened was a bad idea.  One persons response to my apology was, Yeah, running around naked on acid at a party isnt exactly something you want to be remembered for.  I felt extremely depressed and embarrassed as a result of what I had done. I felt extremely depressed and embarrassed as a result of what I had done.  If I had been at the party and witnessed my behavior, I would have been frightened.  I spent the remainder of the night on the couch watching Varsity Blues.  

I hadnt slept all night, the only person at the party to do so.  Around 5:15 am, rhe Mrs. peeked her head over the couch and looked into my eyes, both of which were wide open.  Youre sweating, she said.  As everyone else woke up, The Mrs. served us an amazing breakfast.  She arranged to have her housekeeper drive me home.  I returned home, and later that day, my mother and I flew to  to visit family.  I never got in trouble for it.  The Prom was on a Thursday evening.  That following Monday, I ran a 10 Kilometer race.  I had not been in peak shape, but managed to run it in one hour.  I felt tired for a few days following the Prom, but shortly thereafter, felt fine.  The aftereffects were minimal.  However, prolonged use of any drug will result in more negative after effects.     

This junior prom was perhaps the most profound life-changing experience Ive ever had.  I never thought that something like that could happen to me.  I have a new respect for the unbelievable capabilities of LSD.

2 Tabs of LSD

This experience is about the time I took two tabs of LSD. This occured April 7, 2017. I feel like sharing my experience for some reason, it was both positive and negative. This was basically what I thought was the last time I was going to be able to hangout with a close friend before attending court for a drug possession with intent to distribute charge so my chances of being on probation was high but I got lucky. Anyways I needed to explain that because it affected my experience going in with that mindset. I planned the day before to hangout with my friend. I planned to buy and consume two tabs. The day came I rode the city bus to the friends residence. Purchased the two tabs and took them right there in friends room. He ended up being with his companion so friends companion was there. This may sound weird but within maybe 20-25 minutes of taking these tabs I started to feel the effects, I pulled my phone out and noticed how the icon apps on my phone screen seemed to be slowly moving I felt this energy.

We planned to take​ a walk to the nearby river. I went outside and felt different I felt this energy feeling, also before we left friends house I smoked some wax(dabs) out of friends vape. I was high on marijuana and acid. We began walking I felt definitely different small but noticable visuals. Best I can describe it is everything was sort of wavy. We planned to stop at the grocery store and on the way there we came across a camera bag sitting at the bus stop and inside was heroin inside of a syringe, friend threw the bag in trash we proceeded to the grocery store because friend wanted to wash his hands after touching that bag. We eventually got inside the grocery store and the effects grew stronger I felt out of it. Visuals were increasing inside this store I could see the glare off the floor from the lights above moving I didn't feel comfortable inside the store but we ended up walking around inside the store looking for drinks and snacks for the trip to the river.

We finally left and proceeded to the river and I felt great just this body high that felt like energy we crossed the bridge over the river and stopped half way on the bridge to look at the water below us and this water looked honestly crazy it looked like the water was morphing into itself I was excited to walk down below into the trees where there are trails you can walk into. We walked down into the trees and now my visuals are at an all time high everything was moving. I could see the trail of my cigarette when I flicked it. I tried to look at my phone screen and it was all over the place the numbers of the time on my home screen were bending so crazy. Being surrounded by trees and nature was beautiful. The trees and plants were bending. The floor was moving. The still water in this puddle were moving. I sat down under a tree and just enjoyed the moment with my eyes closed and my closed eyed visuals were very strong. I had tunnel vision with my eyes closed. I felt like my head was a dark arena with this show of unexplainable designs. I can't explain​ it very well.

The word Kaleidoscope is the only was I can explain what I was seeing with my eyes closed, I was seeing perfect colors and shapes. We then decided to walk towards the river and it was surreal what it looked like the water looked like it was flowing in all directions the sunset behind it made it look even more crazy. This is where my trip began to get dark. I noticed my friends companion looking restless in a way like she wanted to be with my friend alone, I just got this vibe from her and it made me feel weird. We decided to walk back into society and I kept noticing her emotions that she maybe felt like I was a burden and wanted to be alone with my friend and it made me feel unwanted to be around them. I kept manifesting on this thought and it was making my trip difficult. The acid by now made me feel weird like I wanted to get away from them I just stayed quite following them. We stopped at friends highschool and sat at the grass field I remember looking at the field and it seemed like the entire field was waving like water. I still had crazy close eyed visuals. I had these dark thoughts of feeling unwanted by the people around me I tried to use my phone to arrange a Uber but I couldn't understand how to use my phone and this was really frustrating. Finally I just told my friend I wanted to leave and I felt really uneasy by this I wanted to hangout with my friend because I thought this might be the last time for a few months I'd see him. We started walking back to his house where I finally managed to arrange a Uber. I stayed quite still and my phone notified me my ride was here and I just got up and left without saying a word I had this feeling that I wanted to get away from them. My friend came to me and asked if I was alright I said yeah and left in the Uber tripping hard. I couldn't really talk and respond to the question the Uber driver asked me. I was thinking about to many things at once I opened my phone to text my friend to explain why I acted in such a way but I couldn't understand how to use my phone so I gave up on that. Sitting in this Uber I kept spacing out lost in my thoughts and emotions. I felt really out of it I noticed I kept moving around in the back seat and had this weird thought that maybe the Uber driver felt uncomfortable about how I was acting. I tried to sit still and act normal thinking about my every move to make sure I wasn't doing anything weird. I tried to untangle my headphones and failed at that I just couldn't I forget how to use my hands my coordination was all over the place haha. I looked out the window and felt like the driver missed my street and this freaked me out I had this weird thought that he was gonna drive me to the police station because of how odd I was acting. Finally I remembered where I was and we were coming up on my street. Finally I got home and went inside I remember how weird it was trying to open my door with my keys.

I went into my room and kicked my shoes off, took my pants off, laid in my bed and threw the blankets over. My mother was staying with me and I honestly forgot she was and I realized I'm on acid and I came inside without texting her I was coming back or anything and I was like fuck I'm tripping to hard to explain myself I started to panic because of this thought and realized how my clothes looked when I got into my room it looked odd my pants and shoes on the floor just messy it looked like so I got up and tried to clean but for some reason I put my clothes in weird spots around my room and when I realized that I panicked some more. Trying to clean on acid is hard haha. I laid back down and my trip felt stronger. I felt this overwhelming panic that my mom was gonna come into my room and I'd have to explain myself. I felt insane. I kept hearing inside my head these loud and different frequencies of vibrations. I thought I was having a bad trip. I tried to take deep breaths and that helped in a way. I tried to look for my phone in the dark and couldn't this made me feel uneasy. I finally found it and looked at my bed and noticed how tangled I was in my blankets. By this time I felt the panic come back because of the thought that my mother would walk into my room and see me losing my mind. I took more deep breaths and calmed down. Just got on my phone and began messaging my friend about the difficulty I was having and then finally the panic feeling went away and I got up to tell my mom I was back and she didn't care. This made me feel better I went back into my room got on my phone and listened to music for the next hours until the acid finally wore off. This was my trip on 2 tabs.

 It was about 10 p.m when my cousin , sister, and myself put 2 hits of acid under our tounges. At this time , we didn't know what was going to happen.

Between 10:30 p.m. to 10:45 we all began to have the 'giggles' which in 10 minutes , our giggling started to echo. Visuals started to kick in when I looked over at the mural on my wall - a waterfall with many trees , rocks , ect.

11:30p.m. - All of us wanted to get out of the house ,the thing was, my mother was sleeping and we didnt want to get caught tripping on acid. We tryed to formulate a plan but our minds were blank , we would stand in a circle saying one thing and then totally forget what we were even talking about.

12:45a.m - After standing in a circle for an hour and 15 minutes we decided to just sit down and watch ' Alice in Wonderland '. When the movie started we paused it at the begining , when its a picture of the pond with ducks and flowers everywhere - and played some music. It was unbelivable. I love music when I am sober , but there is nothing like listening to it on LSD. I closed my eyes and it felt like I was standing front row at there concert , i could see the music playing in my head. I began to stand up and dance around.

1:30 a.m - Watched some of 'Alice in Wonderland' but could keep our minds focused on it. The rest of the movie played while we once again tryed to figure out how to get out of the house. I remember finally saying ' ok man look , it not like we havent ever snuck out of the house , we have over a 100 times , just remember we are on acid , we are retarted , but lets just go '

2:00 a.m - We got outside! Walking into the apartments across the street we heard screaming, but we ignored it for a while ( im not sure if there was really screaming going on) It got louder and we decided to just go back inside after all the hard work trying to get out.

3:00a.m - Smoked about 2 bowls to trip a bit harder - it worked. I played some more music and said ' im seeing music and hearing colors ' and that right there, is the perfect way you can describe it. The music played for a couple of hours and i never got tired of dancing

5:00 a.m. - Started to calm down a bit , relaxing , laying down, you know. I looked at the clock and it seemed to only be 30 minutes passing when it was really an hour and 20 minutes.

6:30 a.m. - I was sinking in to the bed , falling sound asleep

At 10:50 took 1 blotter of acid. An hour later noticed patterns appearing on carpet. Happier and light is different. Pupils are contracting and dilating a lot. Decide to take another blotter. 5 minutes later decide to take two other blotters. Unlike some people I never regretted this rather impulsive decision. The hallucinations on the carpet intensify and the euphoria increases.

Light continues to change, having neon appearance. Slightly nausoeus/have mild indigestion symptons. Pupils very big even under bright light. Tracers appear and grow stronger. Haven't lost these tracers to this day, when I've been clean for days. Not complaining though, adds an iteresting effect to life.

Music sounds superb. It's like something muffling the muic when you're sober has been peeled away. Music is cleaer sounding, more fluid. Listen to Royksopp, Air, Orbital and FSOL, my favourite music for tripping. Light on people's faces is different. Strong closed eye visuals -  a carnival of light. Mad creative thoughts. My emotional strings were never plucked like with shrooms once. I am happy throughout and never feel depressed.

Loud noises are irratating. Textures are different. Strange colours appear on peoples faces. The floor swirls like liquid, just like on Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I'm content to relax for hours. Woodgrains look amazing - they flow like waterfalls. Looking at people skin, my eyesight is enhanced to the degree that I can clearly see every individual hair follicle on people's skin.

Symptons gradually fade. Patterns on walls and carpets remain for a log tome, the tracers even longer (still have them now as I write this report). I really enjoyed my trip on acid and wouldn't hesitate to do it again.

The Stages of Ego Death A Detailed Analysis

Disclaimer:

All information that is explained here is based on a combination of my own personal experience and accounts of similar experience in others. Ego death is very personal and your own beliefs and knowledge of this incarnation will be expressed outwardly and inwardly. I also find it essential to establish that you, and I, do not know anything. We think and we interpret, but to know is to end. We will not know until we know. As a result, the explanations below are simply interpretations in the infinite search for Truth :) ALSO worth noting is that his experience is LSD specific, I have not experienced ego death on other substances (yet).

Background: (skip if you don't really care about my beliefs going in)

I have experienced this beautiful phenomenon only two times and the first time I was tripping while drunk and on bars so I wrote it off as drug induced psychosis (good story for another time, much more chaos, much less answers). The next time I experienced ego death was on a humble 150ug and in a beautiful place with beautiful people. There was no reason for anything to go 'wrong'. Additionally, I figure it's worth noting that I have been meditating daily for 3ish years and have been studying psychology for the same amount of time. The trip I will specifically mention  was probably my 30-40th if I had to guess.  

Vocab:
The mass of religions around the world use different words and myths to largely explain the exact same concepts. I have my own personal vocab for these metaphysical concepts that I will list below:

The Devil = 'bad' vibes = death = negative = yin = fear
God = one = love = universal consciousness = unity = yang
Ego Death = third eye opening = divine intervention etc.

1. Pre-Death:

Not much worth posting about this because it's simply the start of your trip. At this point, you're probably in that excitatory, mildly-anxious acid come up. You're leaving your sober reality behind and entering the very familiar trip realm. If you're like me, ego death isn't your goal and you're planning on drawing and bonding w/ nature. During my trip, I was following a small stream that slowly trickled around rock formations for about a half mile before reaching a massive waterfall along narrow cliffside. I was with two good friends who I was comfortable with, but I had just met them this year. Both lovely people. Only one of them also decided to trip with me, who we'll call Brice. (The other dude we'll call Tyler).

2. Something Strange / The Mirror

It was at this point in my trip, at the bottom of the waterfall, that I felt an absolutely strange energy emanate throughout the trees, the wind, and my own body. I can literally feel that something very very intense is about to happen. The care-free fun I was having climbing on rocks and running my hands through the water was entirely diminished. Unfortunately, my memory gets hazy at this point and I can't give a flawless account of what I was feeling at the time. What I can tell you is that slowly, or maybe rapidly, every single thought and emotion that I produced was reflected flawlessly by my environment. No slip ups. Perfect synchronization.

On a side note, moments before the claws of insanity took hold, I asked my friend if he could do this thing that I've been able to do anytime I'm tripping. Basically what I do is completely relax my eye muscles and look at nothing in particular. Rather than focus on one specific thing, you relax, breathe, and focus on everything simultaneously. He had no idea what I was talking about.

3. FEAR

For reasons I have yet to uncover, the transition to this 'place' (I like to call it the grey, I'll expand later) is almost always met with terror. I'm talking visceral, life-threatening fear. As I felt the aforementioned strange vibrations echo through my being, a group of fellow college students began to approach. Seeing outsiders on acid is either a warm and loving experience for me or an awkward, flustered, anxiety-induced miscommunication. With the nature of the things going on around me, I was nothing but scared. They had a dog without a leash with them and I strongly prayed it wouldn't approach me so as to avoid communication with these people who would most likely think I was insane. Of course, the dog chose me. It was at this point that I completely lost any illusion of control I had over myself and the external world. As these people walked by with the dog, I looked at the girl who owned it and I swear I had seen her face before. But in a very surreal, unexplainable way. These people were not external entities outside of myself going to see the waterfall. They WERE me. These people were not external entities outside of myself going to see the waterfall. They WERE me. We were all one. It wasn't like I was watching them and thinking about what they were doing, they were acting out my thoughts. And due to my fear of them and the nature of my mirrored reality, they turned on me. One member of the group was a black man with a tight, orange sweater with a completely shaved head, black pants, and black boots. I knew he was gonna kill me. This complete stranger, whom I have never met, stood roughly 10 feet away and looked me directly into my eyes. He had this look that showed he was absolutely gonna kill me if he needed to, and it was his mission, but he really didn't want to.

Whenever I feel anxiety or any other devilish vibrations on acid, my two safety blankets are drawing (Creating) and meditation (Being). As I felt this terror of death and infinity, I suddenly had the idea to draw. To set the scene, my backpack was under a very large withered log that arced over it about 20 feet from the waterfall. As I walked toward my backpack, the orange sweatered man climbed on top of the log and stood over my backpack just staring at me. He wasn't going to let me create. And I knew this. I cannot quite discern how the following transition occurred, but Tyler, the sober one, suggesting we traverse deeper into the woods.

4. The Holy Mountain

At this point, I just wanna say thanks for reading this fucking monolith of a reddit post. I've never explained some shit to this depth online so I hope it's entertaining enough.

Anyhow, I should point out that our sober friend Tyler, had recently gotten out of a very long and intimate relationship with his lady. Due to the nature of acid and potency of the vibrations you can feel when in the trip realm I could tell he was hurting. As we traversed deeper into the woods, for some reason, I got it in my head that the rest of the trip was for him. I imagined us going to a spot we all deemed suitable for kicking it where he would suddenly break down and we would build him up and it would be beautiful and all that jazz. I was fucking wrong. This trip was all me.

We went deeper into the woods and quite literally and metaphorically reached a mountain. Less like a mountain and more like a slightly larger than normal incline to a higher ground. But you get the symbolism.

The mountain was full of trees that had burned and were utterly gnarled. There was ash nearly up to my ankles and it was overall just a complete shit show. Really steep incline too. I should note at this point I had the strong assumption that all of this was leading to my death. I wasn't sure if it was gonna be my death or my enlightenment but I knew it was something along those lines.

We crossed over the top of the mountain and oh-my-fucking-god lemme tell you it was beyond beautiful. It was a field that seemed to go on infinitely and vast clouds that blanketed the entire sky in beauty. Me being naive and having a head full of acid and divine synchronicity, I assumed I had reached heaven. I dropped my backpack and proceeded to run full speed toward the sun (it was about 2 hours before sunset). I had elation that I was gonna merge with the universal consciousness that exists in everything and I would reach the end of suffering. But, as I'm sure you guessed, I was wrong yet again.

5. The Grey

This is the part of the ego death experience where you experience existential dread like never before and supreme fear of the infinite. The Devil is able to access your thoughts just as easy as the Light is. And to be reborn with the knowledge you gain from the experience, you gotta look evil in the face.

After reaching the middle of the field I realized nothing was going to happen if I didn't initiate something. I also ripped my shirt off on the way and threw some pretty dope rings I had into oblivion (I thought god wanted me to remove my material possessions, fuck me right). The most logical explanation was that I needed to meditate. I needed to radiate metta and become truly free of fear to properly reach nirvana. I then proceed to meditate (very poorly might I add, much more forced than usual) only to reach extreme frustration. I was getting close but it wasn't working. I would meditate and ohm and hear a divine echo of the ohm. I can't explain it well in words, but if you imagine a sound echoing infinitely until the echo and the sound become the same frequency, I assumed this was what the God consciousness sounded like. I was literally screaming at one point because I completely thought I was ascending. Only to open my eyes. Every single time. And still be at the same field. And then came fear.

I realized I wasn't ready to ascend because I was far too afraid. I wasn't completely at peace. I was horrified of death. Thoughts are like viruses. And the next thought I had was that, in order to completely remove myself from fear, I had to be brutally killed and be okay with it (think the monk burning in Vietnam in the 70s.) The sun was near setting at this point and I was very cold from having no shirt on. If had to weigh the forces of evil at this I would put the devil at 85% and the light at 15%. He was winning. Viscuously. I had an awful headache and my stomach churned. I was freezing. I was scared. I thought I was going to be stuck in the grey forever. I had images of wild dogs coming out at sun down and ripping me apart. I thought this was an initiation to reach the after life. I began to cycle between good and evil. I would experience intense bliss and love and then descend into fear and hatred for everything. I was a perfect yin yang. Balance. When I looked down at the ground the grass was literally folded around me to form a yin and yang around my body. Additionally I had a near-transparent 'wall' that cut directly down the middle of my body and extended infinitely forward and into the sky. The Devil had had his turn winning, the Light had shown me a proper way, and then I got an answer.

Side note: I think the devil 'wins' in the grey when a person decides to kill themselves. A LOT of imagery and thoughts tried to point me in that direction. But I knew that wasn't the move.

6. Revelation

Somewhere out of the oblivion, out of the infinite matrix of time and space, the answer to all of my suffering found its way into my consciousness. 'I'm gonna be okay'. I literally said it out loud to my friends. 'I'm gonna be okay'. I literally said it out loud to my friends. I said it multiple times with each iteration confirming for me its truth even further. I realized I'm the Devil. And I'm also God. Nothing in the external world had any intention of harming me until I assumed it did. I had fucking POWER at this point. I honestly felt like a God.

Despite the removal of all fear and negativity, the universe was not finished testing me. The Devil recognized a loss of power (I'm probably 95% Light, 5% Evil at this point) and wanted to confirm that I truly understood I was going to be okay. On the way back to the car, Tyler was guiding us and completely getting us lost (sometimes sober people have way worse directions than people tripping tbh). I viewed that as the Devil still trying to convince me I was stuck here forever, but I was stronger than that now. I took charge and forcefully and bluntly told Tyler we need to go to the left and we were going the wrong way (I had a STRONG feeling I knew where the car was and he was getting pissed off that we thought he couldn't get us there).

My suspicions were correct. We weren't stuck there and we did get to the car. But that slimy motherfucking snake (Mr Devil) still wanted to fuck around. As we drove out of the parking lot and headed home (45 min drive) I had the thought (virus) that what if I'm not out? What if they start driving around in the car forever? Literally as I think this my friends in the front seat start laughing hysterically. Straight up out nowhere. As they're doing this I hear them say things like 'yeah we can just drive around FOREVER hhahahahah'. Simultaneously, Tyler, who's driving says 'hey you wanna bet Carry On My Wayward Son is the next song on the radio?' He said it in a very sinister way. Keep in mind I had the only phone that wasn't dead and the dudes car had no aux. You already know the song fucking played next.

6b. The Purge

I'm honestly really fucking tired of writing this post so I'm gonna skip a lot more details (probs should have done that from the start). Basically, I still had the strength of knowledge that I fully going to be okay and I took charge of navigation and directed us home. As the devil was diminishing intensely, I quite literally threw up in the car (in a bag, I aint no rookie) and instantly felt like something horrifying had left my body. I was free. I have only read about this happening in a few trip reports so it's not exactly an essential physical stage.

7. Rebirth

Congratulations. If you're like me, you have wrestled with good and evil and come out with knowledge that will last many lifetimes. You've touched the divine and been allowed to remain and spread positivity and love. You may have some idea of your grand purpose and what it is you feel you were meant to do or something you were meant to change.

Thank you so much for reading my overly long tale of insanity!! I hope it brings you connection to your own experience or some sort of inspiration.

Much love to all.

I have been interested in exploring my consciousness since I refused to accept my Christian indoctrination as a means to an end as a child. Only recently (<2 years) have I seriously considered the use of entheogenic substances as tools to explore not only my consciousness but also the reach of the human mind.

I started doing serious research on psychedelics a few months before the start of 2018, eventually narrowing down on LSD, and eventually spent a week planning out the circumstances and the objectives of my first trip. Knowing the importance of set and setting; the plan was to trip alone at my house, during the day, starting at about six o'clock in the morning. 

Aside from smoking cannabis, this has been my first experience with a psychedelic drug. 


I cleared the entire day for the trip so that there would be no distractions and I would have plenty of time for the trip itself as well as time to recover. I woke up to the sound of my alarm clock at 6:00 in the morning and had initially planned on ingesting the acid on an empty stomach, but was considerably hungry when I woke up so I ate two pieces of toast with blackberry jam. I washed my face, brushed my teeth, and took the initial dose of 105μg LSD on a single tab of blotter paper by 6:23 AM, approximately one hour before sunrise. 

My heart began to race as soon as the paper hit my tongue My heart began to race as soon as the paper hit my tongue--this was more excitement than nerves, but I quickly became very calm as I waited for the acid to dissolve until I swallowed the paper after about 15 minutes had gone by. This was the point of no return, no turning back now.

I just let one hundred and five micrograms of LSD dissolve in my mouth and swallowed the paper. Like unlocking a door and throwing away the key. I let this sink in for a moment, knowing that I was about to be completely at the liberty of my own subconscious or Psychedelic Ego for the next 8-10+ hours. As the late Terence McKenna never tired of pointing out, this guarantee of profound effect, for better or worse, is what separates psychedelics from every other method of spiritual inquiry. 

I spent the next hour waiting anxiously for the effects to become apparent. I began to notice a mild body high and euphoria, but saw no immediate changes in perception or thought. I stepped outside my room and began wandering throughout the house, studying the environment. I noticed the shadow of a light fixture which appeared to be swaying back and forth against the wall, even though the lamp itself was completely still. This was about an hour into the trip and aside from some mild euphoria and hallucinations of shadows swaying and expanding, I otherwise seemed to be thinking clearly and felt somewhat normal. I was observing this environment that I interact with on a daily basis, from the perspective of being on a tour with my mind and the many tricks its capable of as the guide. 

It was a very gentle ascent into the trip, I must have spent the next few hours walking around enjoying the visuals as they became more intense, and was reporting my observations to a friend I was speaking to on a voice call. This part of the trip was almost entirely extrospective, I was engulfed by the senses. I recall listening to On the Beach by Neil Young, running my fingers against the crisp texture of the paint on the walls while I watched as the world around me breathed and changed. 

My mind was quiet. I wasnt worried about anything and I was starting to get the idea that this is what it was all about; being present in the moment. I was starting to get the idea that this is what it was all about; being present in the moment. I wanted to test this idea by creating what I considered to be the perfect moment for myself, and basking in it. So I made some chai, loaded some very potent cannabis into my pipe, turned my music up and stepped outside. I sat down in my favorite chair on my patio and paused for a moment to take it all in. The piercing sun was presenting the most beautiful blue sky I had ever seen, with strips of clouds that looked like they had been painted on by a French impressionist. It was 60°F outside, the 20mph winds were crashing into me with every gust, seemingly in synchronicity with my music. Without a doubt, I was sure I had created the perfect moment, and I was immersed in it. 

Perhaps in a lapse of judgement, I waited for the wind to pause, sparked my lighter and took a long toke on my pipe, followed by another to finish off the bowl. A few moments later I got up from my chair, laid down in the grass and looked up at the sky. I could feel every single blade of grass massaging against my skin. In a single moment I became aware of everything that had led me to this moment. My senses and my consciousness seemed vitally linked. I felt alive and vibrantly awake with everything I had. I was completely unaware of my body yet I was overwhelmed with a euphoric cocktail of sensory and emotion, it brought tears to my eyes. I was crying harder than I ever had before. I was crying harder than I did during the saddest moments of my life, and it was because I was so happy. , because for that moment I think I felt what I could only describe as absolute love and understanding. 

The more extrospective the trip became, the more in tune I was with my senses, the more I was able to be aware of the moment I was in--which is to say the more I became aware of existing. As soon as I caught on to this, my mind was suddenly racing and my blissful moment had ended. I stepped back inside and the extrospection instantaneously turned to seemingly infinite introspection as though someone had flipped a switch. It then dawned on me that what I might be experiencing was akin to what some have described as an Ego-Death. 

This term is troubling to me. It is a linguistic paradox, which in my case induced a terrifying, seemingly endless thought loop upon asking myself the question; Who is it that seeks to destroy the ego? I came to the idea that the ego is something created when we attach a thought, sense, or a memory of an experience to oneself (self meaning a conscious physiological organism). So to say that I had this incredible moment of absolute bliss during which there was no ego present, seemed almost insulting--because if there is no ego, then who just had this experience? 

With that in mind, it would seem to be that the experience itself of having an ego-death is the ultimate reassurance of the existence of an ego, contrary to the linguistic implications of the term. If ego is something we create by attaching a thought, sense or a memory of a moment to oneself, thereby marking the end of that moment; what happens when we try to attach a moment of egolessness to oneself? 

I spent the next 2-3 hours in an endless game of tug-of-war between this state of egolessness and my ego which was trying to process what just happened. I was beginning to think I had lost my mind, which of course caused me to get the idea that I might be having a bad trip which sparked another thought loop over questions such as Who is tripping right now? What makes a good trip vs a bad trip? If there is no ego, then who is going to come down from this trip? 

The loops continued, and I the concern I was having for being in the uncontrollably terrifying state was producing more concern because I was concerned which produced concern that I would never come back from this state which I was concerned about which lead me to ask myself again Who is in this state? and it happened over and over again like that. Which is a definition of insanity, to repeat the same task over and over and again expecting different results.

By a certain point I began to get the idea that each step of this psychedelic experience, each phase of this ego-death was part of a larger process. The initial moment of egolessness I experienced birthed the awareness of this happening and thus the awareness of an ego, as it is the ego that is aware of the happening. 

A series of involuntary thought loops and caused by the paradoxical validation of an ego after experiencing a state of egolessness is what lead to the final dissolution of the external ego and thus the understanding that the polarity between ego and egolessness defines existence itself. As Ramana Maharshi says, the question Who am I? is not really meant to get an answer, the question is meant to dissolve the questioner. 

This I believe is the state often referred to in psychedelic culture as oneness with the universe. Wherein it is possible to reach the understanding and feeling of singularity between the constructed ego and the underlying constant of existence and consciousness which lies beneath.

Once I came to understand this, I was finally able to return to the present moment and quiet my mind again. It was during this time which was the comedown that I was also experiencing the most intense fractal visuals of the entire trip. I was listening to classical music and Alan Watts lectures, whos words brought me peace and comfort as he seemed to be able to explain everything I had been struggling to put into words. 

This experience has changed my perspective of the ego. It has awakened me to the interdependent relationship of consciousness and existence--which was the case before I came to this understanding, and is still the case now that I have come to this understanding. The difference is the awareness of the understanding.

This experience taught me that it wasnt about what I wanted to go in and get from the experience. It was about redefining who I am altogether. This experience taught me to appreciate the high definition that polarity gives to existence. 

I also know now that going into these states is not about recording what I can of them so that I can explain it all to myself when I come back down. Its an awakening of sorts. I come to understand that the ego is something that is birthed from a state of egolessness. So being in the psychedelic moment is to be without the ego. To try to understand is to have the ego present. 

So my objective now, when re-entering this headspace is to be completely present in the moment it provides. The moment of egolessness. In Hinduism, this is called Sacchidānanda, which represents existence, consciousness, and bliss or truth, consciousness, bliss' and is an epithet and description for the subjective experience of the ultimate, unchanging reality, Brahman.

The experiences of lsd had always somewhat interested me, even before Id gotten into psychedelics. I started smoking weed about 3-4 years ago, and a friend of mine suggested we try to get some of that wonderful Sunshine wed heard so much about.
For a good 3 months, we were out of luck; no one we knew had any idea how or where to get any. Then, while hanging out with some buds for a jamming session, we got the newsa friend of a friend of ours had some in their possession, and they were letting us buy 10 hits for $90. Sweet.

So, me, W, C, and J waited for them to get off work and show up with the goodswe waited, and waited, and waited. It was about 9:30 PM when it arrived, and we immediately began splitting up the hits. Since C and J had bought the strip with their money, they got 3 hits each, me and W got 2. We decided to eat only one at a time after extensive research online, which we naively thought prepared us for the effects. Needless to saywe were wrong.

Waiting for 30 minutes was excruciating, but soon we were finding the most mundane tasks hilarious. Lighting a joint was enthralling, and occasionally one of us would drop our lighter, sending us into giggle-fits. Then, we had the brilliant idea to turn off the lights in the apartment, and put on some trippy musicstarting with the Beatles Revolution 9. Once number 9 started repeating in the semi-darkness (because wed also turned on a lava lamp in the corner), it all started.

Thinking back, I really cant remember exactly what color that damn lava lamp was that night. I remember hues of green, red, and purple, but Im not positive. Anyway, after enjoying mild visual distortions for about half an hour, such as watching the ceiling fan lower and raise as it spun, walls breathing, etc. etc., J and I decided to go out on the patio for a cig. Now, Im a reasonably stable-minded guy, but he almost convinced me he was my Tyler Durdenmy alter-ego, as it were. Hey, at the time, I wasnt in much of a state to argue, I just denied.  Heres where the trip really set in.

10:30-ishI was almost done smoking my cig. J had gone back in, and I remained outside trying to straighten my mind out. For some reason, his argument that he was my double seemed reasonable, but I couldnt accept it. I finally got my head straightreasonablyand turned to go back in, when I realized there were people coming over from across the parking lot. Paranoia set in like a ton of bricks. I ran inside, shut the door, and went into the bathroom. Once inside, I completely forgot why Id come back in, and proceeded to take a piss. Coming back out into the living room, I noticed the other guys kinda freaking, and I asked what was up. W told me these people had come in, one chick wearing a weird mask, and he had scared her off by staring and touching the mask to make sure she was real. I had no clue what he was talking about. The people had completely slipped my mind!

We returned to the bedroom to listen to more music. Visuals were getting more and more intense. I couldve sworn there was a strangely-shaped talisman or ornament of some kind suspended directly in front of my face, and I grabbed it and put it away. Now heres where the fun began

C said he had a cd that was really trippy, and he put it in the big, multi-tray stereo J had in his room. Lights out, lava lamp on, music beginningbut this was strange music. It was dark, sinister even, and we immediately felt a cold menace begin to creep into our reality. For the curious, the cd was Delerium Cordia by Fantomas. Shapes began moving and flitting about the dark room. We still had the giddy feeling of coming up, but it was rapidly becoming shadowed over by thisapocalyptic music invading our minds. Deep chants, strange screams and breathing sounds, weird moans and giggles and clangsWe felt like we were in some devils kitchen. The stereo became some kind of boiler, an oven that radiated evil. W began staring at the corners of the room, mumbling from time to time about things coming out of them. By now, wed lost all association with time and the outside world. Our reality was the 9th level of hell. I recall C nonchalantly stepping into the closet on one side of the room and, just because I was feeling ducky, I shut the door behind him.

Dude, no, let me out, seriously, man, open the door I cant stay in here open the door man really OPEN THE DOOR MAN DUDE!

Realizing it wasnt locked or anything, he stepped out with a calm look on his face, which momentarily sent us into peals of giggles again.

Finally, We decided to explore the rest of the apartment. That was quite possibly the most difficult thing we did that night. Opening the door was like opening a door into a different world, a separate universe. Wed forgotten to leave any lights on! Darkness greeted us, and it took quite a while for us to reach the kitchen, where the only light on was located. J, C, and W became fixated on a bubble rising up from the tiles of the floor, but I, for some reason I havent yet figured out, decided to return to the bedroom and finish listening to the music. Heres where I blacked out a little. I do not remember what went on in that dark room where demons pranced about and laughed as they picked at me and flitted from corner to corner. I just sat in a chair, enraptured by the darkness.

Suddenly, W opened the door, and I realized the music had stopped. 
Dude? Dude, why are you in here?? Cmon, were about to go outside.

The idea intrigued me, and we all headed out onto a grassy lawn just outside the apartment. The sky, which should have been black from the night, was a blazing orange punctuated by small, black clouds rushing across its surface. We sat in the grass, captured by the brilliant display. Then, thinking we were coming down, we went back inside to the room, wisely flipping on the lights as we did. W somehow rolled a joint, and we smoked as we debated whether or not to take another tab. W and I were all for it, but C and J were against it, so we smoked the rest of the joint instead. Almost instantly, we peaked again. The next few hours or so are a hazy recollection of running around the apartment, laughing, staring wide-eyed at shapes that werent there, shapes that chased us, eluded us, played tag with us. W and I met up in the bathroom and stared into the mirror for a while, just to check our eyes. As we suspectedbig as dinner plates. I remember distinctly one of the funniest moments of the night. J, C, and W were in the kitchen, I was in the living room. Suddenly, the kitchen light began to strobe, and each time it did, J would cry out in momentary panic. I went in to see what was going on, and found C and W laughing their asses off as J laid on the floor, squealing every time the light flashed. Then, Js roommate, who was across the parking lot with some other friends, walked in the door.

Inoticed my kitchen was flashing
Gales of laughter.

 Finally, wed had enough. C and J went back into the bedroom to chill out to some Led Zeppelin, and W and I stayed in the living room playing a game to ground us. Before long, we realized the sun was shining in through the blinds. It was morning, real morning this time, and we felt ourselves crashing from the nights events.

Although my first and only trip from acid was riddled with fear and darkness, it was also punctuated with mind-opening, euphoric revelations and visions. Ill definitely do it again at any given opportunity, I guess because Ive gotten the bad trip out of the way. Anything else would be a good trip in comparisonor so I thought. A month or two later, I first read others experiences with acid, and I was dumbfounded at the number of trips that were inconceivably worse than mine. This hasnt changed my decisions in the least, however, and lsd still beckons me forward.  I still feel it at the edge of my consciousness, and I cant wait for the next time.

The experience I had was totally antithetic from the usual trip or high.

It was a regular school day, and the day before, I bought some weed from a local dealer and two hits of LSD. I smoked one dime bag before and save the other for the next day. I was anxious. Ive never tried LSD before and I researched assiduously about the substance and its effects two months prior to my trip. I was exited. Ive tried marijuana plenty of times and every high was a spectacular one. I was going with two of my friends. G and J. Both experienced psychonauts. And I was soon added to the crew of this trip.

It was finally lunchtime and I was one of the first ones out side. It was about 11:20 am. The weather was great, seemed unusual for mid winter weather. Especially for the city of New York. Clear sunny skies, cool breeze, warm air, birds chirping, even the nakedness of the trees of winter brought optimism with great avidity. Waiting for my two friends to come out of the school, two minutes later they appeared with smiles on their face. I could tell they were as exited as I was. 

We all got together and started walking to a park not too far from our school. We decided we might as well cut school if were going to get high. One of my fellow friends, J is in grade 11, and the other my closest friend G whom Ive known since 5th grade have been smoking for over a year. J asked me for the blotter tabs I bought the day before. They were about one inch by one-inch squares split in four halves. I decided to take two fourths of the blotter. I gave two to J and the full blotter paper to G who was more experienced. It was then we were getting ready to take off into a realm of consternation. The space of alternate perception that goes beyond all standards of society, the final frontier of the human mind and reality that is filled with galaxies of wonder held together by standards of true psyche. Ready to explore that frontier aboard our ship that is LSD and we are the psychonauts ready to explore this second space.

About 6 minutes after I placed the blotter paper under my tongue, I started to feel light headed. G told me to pass him the bag of weed I had brought. Placing my hand in my pocket to reach for it, I start to feel a little fearful. My heart was pounding. I felt it as if it were banging on my chest trying to get my attention as I try ignoring it to avoid panic. I start to feel something similar to a head rush, like Im going to pass out. I pulled the bag out of my pocket and gave it to G as J started to try to start a conversation with me. Im thinking to myself maybe hes feeling the same way. My trip soon changed when my visual experience changed dramatically.

The people passing us by as we walk seemed different. Not human; warped if you will. I began to notice the little hallucinations taking place. People say its like stepping into a Picasso. I describe it more of a Dali or Barbara Brody painting. The ground twisting and warping around the feet stepping on it as if it were made of play-doh. Tall buildings seemed taller and arched over us as we walked in this new realm, trees twisting and swaying with the vivid emotions worn on the faces of the passing pedestrians like theatre masks. Twisting lampposts, getting taller and taller. I began to slip out of my discomfort and began to enjoy the effects of the LSD that was taking place in my head and before my eyes.

I realized my friend G had already finished rolling up the weed. We took a break in a park that was empty and isolated from the pedestrian freeway we got out of and lit the blunt. I was euphoric when I was passed the blunt and immediately took a hit from it. It was a pretty large hit, felt as if the air was the smoke itself. As I exhaled, I felt an immense pressure was being unloaded off of my lungs. As the smoke left my mouth and filled the air, it looked like it was forming a cloud above my head raining compensation upon me, embracing me and welcoming me into new perception. The marijuana started to take effect almost immediately. I took 5 more hits form the blunt before I was done with it and the substances completely consumed me. 

Then came the euphoria. The euphoric experience was extreme. My well-being was strong and I felt incredible. My mood came out as vivid as the colors I saw. The shadows of the buildings seemed darker and to rise up off the ground creating implausible but incredible new structures. The skys clouds were melting, and seemed liquid like hovering above us. The hallucinations soon began to amplify and the unbelievable became believable. I was sort of freaked out but it was like an emotion tug of war. Every possible emotion pulling me every which way towards it. But happiness won that war because my euphoric state was strong. 

We soon stopped at a mc Donalds to chill. We went upstairs and sat down. There were mirrors on the wall. I looked at myself and saw a stranger. I saw a totally different person staring back at me and wondered what he was thinking, who is this person. I feared the worst. Has LSD slain my ego? I began to think that my soul was replaced with another. That I couldnt return back to the standard world I usually live in. Without all the hallucinations. I feared that I lost my ability to get sober again. Then the hallucinations took a drastic turn for the worst. As the chairs and tables, light bulbs and decorations on the wall looked back at me, taunting me. I tasted the colored tiles on the wall, and they were bitter, stinging my tongue with hostility. 

My friend J looked at me in concern and asked if I was all right. That emotional tug of war came out in my voice. I replied with a two-faced yes then began to sit. I was trembling. The racing train of thoughts in my head and my racing heart seemed to compete against each other to the finish line of my composure limit. I started to think I was having a bad trip. I started viewing LSD as a superior being that I have disobeyed and was waiting to punish me with a horrible trip waiting in its wings. Dysphoria hit me like a bomb. I couldnt take it anymore. I was unconsciously talking to myself. My friend G told me to calm down. I replied with a How could I when death is just around the corner I wanted to yell, but I somehow controlled myself not to. 

J suggested I listen to music. Then I remembered my iPod. I soon began to calm down and feel a spark of hope setting off my blaze of euphoria again. Looking forward to a musical experience on LSD. I took it out and turned it on. The bright screen projected like a hologram. Like the one you would see in star wars. I was then thinking about the perfect song. Then as I was scrolling I stumbled upon Type-O-Negative and played the song Christian Woman. The vocals set off a vibe in me that was powerful. I was elated. The word Euphoria lost its meaning, for what I felt was something ineffable. The experience soon felt dreamy. I saw a gorgeous woman that walked up the stairs. She seemed like a goddess, the fantasy type with light piercing around her figure and wind blowing through her hair. Time was slowed to the tempo of the song and perception seemed movie-like. I was captivated within the mood of the song until it was over. I scrolled to Nirvana and listened to my favorite song. It was Aneurysm. 

The song was different. It sounded robotic. I remember replaying the whole song over and over. Just to keep it as an asylum from bad tripping again but I eventually stopped and joined in a conversation G and J were having about their trips, hot girls in the school they would sleep with, how hungry they were and such. The conversation was of great depth. I saw my friends in a different way. Like two strangers I knew, but didnt quite get at times. It was about two hours and forty-five minutes into the trip/high and I was beginning to come down. Although I still had some visual hallucinations that I once again started to enjoy. 

On the subway ride home, the LSD finally settled down with the sun. I was a bit buzzed by the weed. I felt as if the remaining effects of the weed were sad, all alone because the effects of the LSD were diminishing. That the weed lost its friend and partner in helping themselves at my sanity, but ended up being a battle I won with a little friend called euphoria. This coaster ride was rough but overall amazing. Im definitely tripping again.

So...
I had 3 blotters... Each one was very strong according to what I had been told and the trip reports of others' on the same blotters , around 80-100 each...I took all three at once..Just by the time my they touched my mouth, I felt an overwhelming bitterness..I was sitting on my bed relaxing, having had a long hot shower before,and listened to some ambient. Needless to say I was a bit anxious and thinking about how the experience would be like, and about what I wanted to gain from it. As it was hitting me, at first I was feeling sort of stuck into the bed, trying to focus at the music.. I was feeling as if getting into time... For 1-2 hours it went up and up and up, I was slowly laughing all the time,also feeling some kind of shivering.. 

At certain parts I was feeling as if the substance was PUNISHING me, I suppose that was because it brought me a bit of nausea...after ~4 hours decided to go vomit, I managed to find the target.. :lol: Then I was sort of paranoid that my parents would figure out.. But I eventually managed to clean it.
All senses were intensified, I was hypersensitive to all of them, especially sound...

Furthermore, I felt a bit of ego death.. I didnt know who I am in the universe, confused,startled, -->  :o  :huh:  :blink:  .. I largely wanted to express myself somehow, so I managed to find peace of mind in painting.. Just with a pencil, my hands were doing some sort of fractals, geometrical shapes and I was trying to concetrate and relax, fuel my energy somewhere..
I had the insight of being a much more 'primitive' being, but also using more of my brain in a different way, much more speedy.. I HAD to follow my insticts...
I wanted to become more extroverted...
After around 7-8 hours, in the morning , my mother woke up..
I went close to her, smiled, hugged her, asked her how she was doing..
I was restless but couldn't sleep.. When I was alone I had a shower. My sense of time was different, everything appeared more infinite in a way.

If I stared at objects they were changing,morphing, I believe  these 'hallucinations'  are the result of 1) Focusing,concetrating, 2)Images straight from the subconscious 3)Merging of the senses..

Funny thing is I imagined myself as some sort of elf... The way I was sitting on my bed or the way myself looked in the mirror..

Sometimes everything was just too much, even music so I took short breaks and trying to meditate by focusing on my breath and trying to visualize.. 

+7 hours.. I realize that if I focus too much on certain objects, everything else seemed to dissapear and/or seem more 'liquid' and blurry.. For exampe I would stare at my rooms lamp and I was seeing only it existing, just hanging in the air.

+14 hours after I decided to have a walk and meet some friend to talk..I had a strong urge to communicate. I found one at the moment, we decided to meet in a small park.. He was also startled and was asking me where/how I found the blotters.. I told him to be cautious about lsd and not just take it for 'fun', fun in the 'mainstream' way. I was laughing inside me, smiling , he though I was 'burned' so in the end I just decided to hug him...

It was feeling weird, as if power of gravity was stronger, as if the earth was grabbing me... I decided to have a walk in a [relatively small] forest... All I wanted was to hear the birds sing and feel the trees, the humidity,the air.. I was sitting on the benches...

I was forced, and also tried myself, to reform consciousness and awareness, body and mind awareness, reprogramm myself into something else, a new self emerging.

I was slowly coming down.. My reality had been flipped,decomposed, and I was slowly trying to re-form it, like a puzzle. My reality had been flipped,decomposed, and I was slowly trying to re-form it, like a puzzle. 

Weird enough , finally my memory has become better, more vivid, I learned to focus and channel my energy where I want.. But I've also become even more of a daydreamer, and learned to enjoy everything in life more, even just sitting and breathing.

I was seeing the similarities between things rather than the differencies, everything was ONE in a way.. Even music.. I was into it, every second was perceived as  eternity. I was stunned at Tom Heasley - Desert Triptych , the magic of didgeridoo !!

+20 hours I was there sitting with my father and bros , touching them, hugging them and talking to them.. Relaxed, sitting on the couch.. About their problems, my problems, generally..

+24 hours.. I didnt want to sleep alone.. Decided to sleep in the same bed with my brother.. Trying to calm down and meditate.. Insomnia. I had this fear that I will never return, but I managed to sleep for a few hours I think, having really vivid visuals. I had opened some doors of perception.. What if they never closed again ?? I persuaded myself that it's about which doors you decided to open and which to close ;)  You create your own reality. 

On the other hand I also wanted to remember this experience and integrate in my life, which I've done.. The trip never ends, you have to change yourself, it's pointless to trip and then be exactly the same, making the same mistakes etc etc.
Also I had this insight that ,at least in our society, you'd better not deviate a lot from the normal.. We should always keep a bit of touch with the ground..  Example: Job. No one wants to but unfortunately you HAVE to.. Ideal would be trying to see everything as a game, so that you enjoy it more. Like a child. 

Things seem newer now, I discover more of them, stare at them... 
Intense appreciation for art , and a stronger need to express myself , to be more creative. I am calmer but at the same time more energetic.

I was young at the time, and my parents had gone away for the weekend, so two friends and myself each took one dose (blotter paper) of acid.  We took the stuff in a forest near my house.  It was midsummer, and where I live, it doesn't get fully dark till about eleven.  We sat around for an hour or so, until dusk had set in, but nothing was happening to me and not much to them, so we decided to head back to my house.  Another friend who hadn't taken anything came back too.

Soon after we got back, everything changed.  Mainly, I began to feel nauseous, and I was hungry too, but there wasn't a hope in hell that I could even comtemplate eating anything.  I went to the bathroom and sat down on the toilet and was horrified to see that my manhood had shrunk to about one inch!!!  After that shock, I was very anxious to rid myself of the general feeling of malaise.  Someone had told us that orange juice is an antidote to acid, so I forced myself to drink a small glass of it... it had no effect.  (I've since read that it's also meant to enhance the trip, so I don't know what's true).

Paranoia about being discovered on drugs soon began to set in, so I bundled my tripping friends out of my house and asked my sober friend to stay the night in case I went mental (I thought I would never come back down).  He agreed, but said that he'd need to write a note for his parents, so we walked back to his house so he could leave a note.  At this stage, it was about about 2 am.  I waited outside his house while he wrote the note and it was then that the strangest thing happened me.  I had gotten a few visual effects, such as objects (cars, for example) 'shunting' quickly one way and then straight back, but nothing too impressive.  But I was leaning on a low wall when I heard a man and a woman behind me.  They were talking about me...  The gist of their conversation was how 'awful' it was that I was on drugs and what would his parents think, and so on.  But it didn't just fade away - the conversation continued for minutes!  I know this, because my friend took about five minutes to come back out.  I could hear every word said and two distinct voices saying them.  I was utterly convinced that there were two people behind me engaged in conversation about my trip!  Eventually, I plucked up the courage to look behind me and face them, and when I did, the only thing there were the leaves of a palm tree (or something like it) rustling in the breeze.

After that episode, which I simply couldn't believe, we headed back to my house.  I tried to sleep, but it was after 7 am before I managed to get a couple of hours.  I awoke and looked in the mirror - one of my pupils was dilated, the other wasn't...  That wasn't what I needed to see either...  But it returned to normal an hour or two later.

It's well-known but very true, one's internal state of mind is very important.  Inner fears may be manifested as external stimuli.

I haven't tried acid since.

Ive had experience with opiates before (endone, oxycodone), as well as social marijuana useage, alcohol and tobacco. All my life I had wanted to try LSD, the mysterious drug of hallucinations and wonder, and I finally found some. The guy I was purchasing it off is renowned for having the best of drugs, and he told me this was a new, higher-dosed acid he ordered in for me.

After school (3:30PM), I changed my clothes and drove with a friend to a dealers house. Lets call him V, and my friend C. When we entered I saw several lounges and chairs around a TV with some crappy show on, and about ten people passing around a bong and just generally laughing. I had two bong hits whilst waiting for my acid to arrive.

When the guy arrived, he sold me the little paper tab that would become my misery for the night. I put it on my tongue and swirled it around a little, keeping my chewing gum on the side of my teeth. (4:30PM) The people knew I was taking it and C was eagerly awaiting me to start tripping, himself wanting to try it after I told him what it was like.

About ten or twenty minutes later, my heart started beating immensely. I thought it was just nerves at the time. Everyone then noticed my eyes were massively dilated  they took a photo to show me, and I stared into the black dinner plates with surprise and laughed. I then swallowed the piece of paper.

Another ten minutes later I started shaking, and my mouth turned extremely dry. I felt very odd, and decided to walk outside and get a drink and lay on the grass (backyard).  I got a drink from the tap and then proceeded to lay down on the grass, but Vs wife immediately got me to come in out of concern I might get seen. I sat down, and within five minutes, it began.

I immediately noticed my head getting insanely heavy. I couldnt resist it, and it pulled it down to my shoulder and I felt my brain dipping its toe into the Tripworld. I snapped out of it immediately, noticing the walls covered in crawling fur, but then my head became heavy again and rolled to the other side, and it splashed again, and I mouthed in an exaggerated way woahh.
For the next thirty minutes, I kept slipping in and out of trip in this stifling room, each trip lasting for longer. The return was like being woken up in the morning, and I was unable to talk or walk. Everyone was watching me in horror/amusement (as in, wow, this guy is tripping balls on acid, I hope he doesnt murder us) and they all began to fool around with me. I only knew three or so of them, so they didnt give a shit if I was okay.

They poked me, jabbed me, told me I had snakes in my hair and on my shoulders and that I was going to die etc. I didnt believe any of it, and knew it was all lies, but they continued. When I tried to move closer to someone they would jump away in fear. They were scared of me.

C asked me a few times if I was okay, good or bad. I shrugged before slipping back into trips, hitting my head on the TV. My chewing gum felt like a weird paste/powder in my mouth and was very unpleasant.

V came out and looked at me, and told C to get me out of there. I understand this, but still feel unhappy about being booted out in the state I was in. I tried to explain I was okay and apologise but all that came out was a babys gurgling. I stumbled and fell to Cs car, got in, and had him drive me to my brothers. I for some reason told him directions that took us on a ten minute wild goose chase, slipping in and out of trip, and he got very unhappy at me.

I arrived at my brothers house, and stumbled across the road in half-trip, trying to compose myself. I walked up the 70-something stairs vigorously, trying to stay out of trip, and walked through the door. My brother (a pot smoker) asked me what I took, and I replied in a daze An LSD and he took me to his bedroom and got me a warm glass of water from his en suite. It was very hot in the room. He left and I laid down, and then the trip pulled me in.

Its too much to describe. Its like looking at a kaleidoscope, or a fractal pattern, or a TV on a channel that just registers fuzz, but infinitely more detailed and focused. And each little grain is a complex image, moving, expanding, enveloping, and it takes all of your focus to just observe this image. Time slows to a crawl. Seconds feel like hours. The whole time a vibration was going through my body, shaking me and hurting, and the sound of an engine was in my head unpleasantly. At this point I knew I was in this for the long haul  I just had to go along with the ride.

And I thought. Every second a thousand thoughts each unfolded in my mind, the meaning of life, each little detail about me, all the things wrong and right about me, what I like and what I hate, all unfolded and answered in my head like a debate, all the while this stunning image in front of me. I only slipped out of Tripworld when I heard a noise, or forced myself to, and at this point trips were lasting for around 30 minutes at a time.

My brother re-entered the room to check on me and use the toilet. I replied Mm. Yeah. Ok, To the things he said, unable to form sentences or focus on his words, knowing that the whole time Trip was waiting to pull me back in and envelope me. I slipped in for a second and forced myself out, and in my mind I wasnt sure if I hallucinated my brother or if he actually entered the room. I called out his name, and he replied, and this was concerning to me. It was blurring the lines between reality and fiction.

At the peak, around 8-9PM, I went into a two hour trip. I thought I was going to die. I lived a thousand lives and discovered everything about myself. I had to record all I was thinking. My first thought was a tube of blue paint on his bedside table. I had already removed my shirt due to the intense heat and sweating I was undergoing, and proceeded to try to write with my fingers on my stomach and chest. I also wrote on my jeans. 

At some stages I went through euphoric falling sequences of trip. I felt as if my body was falling towards the ground for minutes at a time, and I had the rollercoaster-type euphoria throughout my whole body during this, but afterwards when I hit the ground my body became immensely sore and tired.

I lost focus easily when trying to complete tasks. For example, when trying to get a sip of water, Id move halfway to the glass and then trip and fall into the bed, come to, and then go for the water again. Now I decided to record my thoughts in text messages by saving them as drafts. I completely forget writing them, but I read them in the morning and they are both full of gibberish and some rather wise sentiments. (The blue writing on my body was just a smear and dots when I checked, haha)

At 10:30PM my brother entered, and I was coming down but still strongly tripping, and told me to go sleep on the lounge because he wanted to go to bed. I obliged in the out-of-trip objective based mentality, where I could only do that one thing, and went and laid on his lounge. When I observed myself in the mirror, I was horrified to observe that I didnt recognise the person looking back at me. My thoughts were, Is this who I have been living as all my life? This isnt the person I know.

Walking while tripping was extremely odd. Whilst on his bed, I noticed my arms moving themselves and hands doing movements above me head without me controlling them, but when I was walking, if I moved my head it would lock into that place, and I forgot my body. I was told I was walking on the spot with my eyes closed and tongue out by one of his roommates when trying to walk there after having my head lock in (it happened several times) which he found amusing.

I was still going in and out of trip, but I was strongly aware that it would be over. I sat out on his balcony, overlooking the beach in a nice breeze, and another of his roommates came out and started playing acoustic guitar. It sounded incredible. The music echoed all around me, and I sat very reflective of my experience, and ate several Doritos. Tastes are all changed around, and everything feels powdery or dry in your mouth.

I finally achieved sleep at about 12:30AM, and in the morning I was still noticing the fractal patterns when looking at anything, as if halfway between my eyes and the world like a filter, and this was off-putting. Walking also gave me the same ghostish feeling, as if I was drifting through and it was all a dream. I walked home that morning and had a shower and slept. My body and mind were both exhausted. For the rest of the day I noticed sparkles and glitter over everything and this was enjoyable to observe.

LSD is incredibly powerful. I had a bad trip, under bad circumstances, with very strong acid. Whilst I do not regret this, it has put me off of drugs for quite a while  I did not realise the strength they actually have and the torment they can inflict on the unprepared user. In summary, I will leave some notes for a potential LSD-user to think about (I will not be held accountable for my words, this is not advice, just what I have learnt).

I am fairly new to LSD, and only a few days ago was my first time doing two tabs of the stuff. I can really only describe this experience as a high five with God himself. After buying 4 tabs for 20 bucks a pop, I figured this stuff had to be good. My friend had told me about how different two tab trips were from the single tab trips I was more familiar with. I was weary of this, but still confident because I had enjoyed the LSD experience so much before.

Now, Id had 5 acid trips prior to this one on single tabs of acid, and each time was really quite amazing for me. But this trip was something different from the moment my girlfriend and I put the tabs on our tongues. We had tripped together twice before, but we both considered this to be a whole new experience afterwards.

S started getting giggly during the onset, sooner than she had the past couple of trips.  We had put the tabs on our tongues in my truck and were walking through a local supermarket for some weird reason; I think it was just to look at all the packages of food.  We saw an old high school buddy there; he thought we were had smoked cannabis at first because we were laughing so much while he was talking to us.

I remember starting back to the parking lot and towards the truck when things got to that point where everything seems a little displaced.

We sat in the bed Ive made out of the back of the vehicle, listening to music and joking around.  We climbed in the back to lie down, and then the shit really hit us.

We were looking at the sky spewing nonsense out of our mouths at first, like the bantering conversations always held when we smoked cannabis. Then things got crazy.  

	We were experiencing ego death.

Most people will go their whole lives without forgetting everything about themselves. I am no longer one of those people.  Every memory I had disappeared into thin air.  I knew nothing about myself Every memory I had disappeared into thin air.  I knew nothing about myself, and nothing about this familiar looking person in the truck with me.  S and I were very scared at several points during the peak, and I remember a few particular parts that probably confused the people that were around us.

While our minds were amongst the gods, our bodies were still doing their usual thing, so eventually we both had to go pee.  It seems like an easy thing to do: walk into the gas station, relieve ourselves, and then leave. At no point should we say a word or stop to look around.

This proved to be the most difficult part of the trip, because apparently it is not very easy to put on and tie a pair of shoes when you are on two tabs of high quality blotter acid. We were jabbering away and jumping around like lunatics in the parking lot while trying to get the shoes on.  Ss emotions were changing at a very rapid pace, from sweet to scared to angry to yelling to cute to sad, and this made it quite difficult.  We got the shoes on eventually.

We entered the gas station. We walked to the bathrooms in back, and things got scary.  S started screaming, You paid for this! You son of a bitch! You bought a trainwreck and youre going to get a fucking trainwreck!  I just wanted to use the bathroom so I went inside the mens room and shut the door. She stood outside yelling at me through it.

I had finally got S into the ladies room after a minute or so of convincing. Even when she was inside, she kept yelling things at me through the door. The store employees probably thought we were drunk from how we were acting and shouting, so the next part was no surprise. I was getting lost in a particular geometric pattern on a coke bottle when the cashier came around the corner to tell us that we had to leave or they were going to call the police. We promptly left. As I walked out the door, I said, Sorry for inconveniencing you, have a good night.  S just screamed at the top of her lungs.

The rest of the peak is hard to remember.  We slowly picked up the pieces of our shattered egos, and started to remember ourselves again.  It was as though we werent even together during the peak.  I do recall a closed eye visual of a sort of alchemical chart arranged in such a way that explained how life on earth worked.  It was some very advanced stuff, tying the setting and rising of our sun in to the beating of the mammalian heart and the slow-furnace nature of the body.  I just wish I remembered what the answer to what life was a little more clearly.

Eventually, the acid started to ease its grip on our minds.  But it was just turned down from 220 amps to 110.  We started getting more visuals after about 6 hours of nonstop tweaking out.  S and I walked over to the local donut shop to use the restroom again and get something to eat.  I bought a small black coffee and a coffee roll.  This was a bad idea.  

There was a group of kids over in the corner, the kids who have seen A Clockwork Orange a few times and try to act crazy, and one of them was saying some very strange things that almost made me violently ill.  He was talking to the other kids, and he said something about opening up the heads of sleeping animals and messing with their brains to see if they would act differently when they woke up. Then he laughed and said he was just kidding.

Nobody on 700 micrograms of LSD should ever have to think of something like that.  Ever.  I know this because I did, and luckily S came out of the bathroom at this point so we left.  I remember staring at that little creep for quite a while on the way out, and this drew uncomfortable glances from himself and his colleagues. 

We walked back to the truck.  Condensation had gathered on the windows and the streetlights shining through made for some interesting visuals.  We reminded ourselves of all the things that make us up; nicknames, interests, thoughts, experiences.  A strange thing to have to do, but not necessarily bad.  It cant hurt to know yourself a little better.  We also started to recall some of the earlier moments, and I came to the conclusion that this was an 8th circuit experience. We transcended the need for a physical body, and because consciousness as a collective.  In essence, we forgot so much that we remembered everything.

Neither S nor I will never forget that trip.  We finally fell asleep at some crazy hour in my truck.  I dropped S off the next morning and we both slept all day.  We both regard it as a life changing experience and as I said earlier, most people will never do something like that.  

It was not a negative thing at all.  Powerful, yes.  At times, almost terrifying because of the sheer energy and insanity flowing through us.  But negative? No. A more accurate description would be unforgettable.

A high five with God is not something that is easily forgotten.

It was close to the end of my second semester of college. I (M) had recently acquired 10 hits of LSD and my friends S and A were driving up to trip with me and my other friend J who had little drug experience at all and certainly never tripped before. The guy who I got the LSD from said that the tabs were advertised as 150ug on a dark web market but who knows what the real dosage was. 

My friends arrive at around noon and we immediately drop this acid. We all head about a quarter mile away into my university's biological sanctuary because we figured that would be the best place to trip. I've only been back there a few times but once you get deep enough there are tons of obstacles for a university class taught back there. 

So we are walking around when we get to a clearing in the middle of the forest and there are really tall wooden poles sticking out of the ground with cables anchoring them to the ground. On the end, the cables have little plastic sheaths. Everyone took turns grabbing them and throwing them as far as the could up the cable to see who could get theirs the farthest. Once we got bored from this we kept walking until we found two wooden poles with wooden slats between them suspended by rope. Not unlike a ladder. The first rung was about 8 or 9 feet off the ground and I wanted to try to climb it. I jumped on the first rung and was hanging when my friend pushes me causing me to fall on the ground. In the process I kneed myself in the nose (this is important later). My nose starts to bleed and hurts pretty bad, but I didn't want it to ruin my trip so I didn't dwell on it.

It was around this time that everyone began to feel the beginning of what would be an insane acid trip...except me. Everyone was saying how colors were becoming more vibrant and everyone started to giggle. Fuck. A was talking about all the fractals he was seeing and thought that he might want to take another hit. I obliged because it gave me a reason to go back and take another one too. I didn't want to be the only one not having an LSD trip. So I run back to my dorm which took about 5 minutes or so and eat another tab and pocket the other. I give it to A and he began telling me he started tripping super hard and was not sure if he should take the second tab. I reassured him that it wouldn't be bad as we had both tripped multiple times in the past. After he eats his tab we rejoin the others in the woods.

I notice that J is being really quiet which was a huge departure from the joy and awe he was feeling just before I went to grab another dose for me and A. I ask him what's wrong and immediately he goes shhhhh! Dude the cops might hear us. I laughed it off and told him not to worry about it we as we were pretty far from anyone in the woods that we were in. Especially far from any cops. However, over the next 5-10 minutes his paranoia and anxiousness started skyrocketing to the point that he announced he wanted to go back to his dorm and be alone. So I decided I could walk J back and meet up with my friends after.

Once I returned we sat down near a sign post and S pulled out a sandwich to eat. We were all just chilling when I got a strange feeling in my stomach. Almost like a vague sense of dread and it was at that moment that I realized that I was in way too deep and that I should have just waited instead of taking the second tab. it was at that moment that I realized that I was in way too deep and that I should have just waited instead of taking the second tab. I try to play it off as my nerves just getting to me and after S finishes his sandwich we are off again. 

We arrive at a small cliff (cliff really isn't the right word because it was only like 20-25 feet tall but it was a steep drop off) and we decide to sit next to it and chill for a little. At this time I'm starting to come up super fast. I keep getting this feeling that I was supposed to be doing something but I couldn't remember what it was. I look over at S and he is so relaxed and taking in all the sights nature had to offer which helped me ground myself and calm down a little. Then I would look at my friend A who was beginning to lose his goddamned mind. He stood up and went, how am I even alive right now??? for some reason I found this hilarious and responded I'm not sure but you've been doing it for 19 years so you're doing something right. A got up and started pacing around and said he was full of energy and just wanted to run. S and I told him that it probably was not a good idea and to try and relax a little. 

I look back at S and he hands me a cigarette and I begin to smoke it but constantly forget that I am smoking it and end up just throwing it out. I look back at A and he has since taken his shirt off and is clenching his throat saying how am I breathing? Then I would start thinking oh shit, how am I breathing? How am I alive? an overwhelming feeling that I am supposed to be doing something would take me over again and I would begin to freak out a little. A would run off for a second and then I would glance back over at S who was still cool as a cucumber and then I would calm down again. This process repeated probably 10 or more times and when I started to feel panicky I remembered how badly my nose hurt and I would grab it. The pain from my nose helped keep me grounded and calm down which might seem odd. A finally goes, guys should I jump off this edge? and we are like no dude that is an awful idea and decide that we should probably walk somewhere else.

We start walking to nowhere in particular when A says I just want to shout and then proceeds to shout the word SHOUT! over and over. S and I find this hilarious but try to get him to stop because we did not want people to come see us in this state. At this point we are pretty deep in the woods and we decide that we are all done coming up so why not smoke some weed. Now I don't know if any of you guys have smoked weed while on acid but it goes from mild visual distortions and bright colors to full on things start to melt. Everything I looked at seemed to have an aura coming off of it, almost like a flame. It was hard to focus on anything in particular because everything became wavy. After a few minutes A loses his mind. He stands up takes off his shirt and starts screaming Thank you! S and I were like for what? Then A starts shouting Shout! again and runs away. 

S and I decide that we should probably figure out how to get out the woods. We tell A to follow us because we need to figure out where we are. We take about 5 steps and then A forgets what we are doing and does the whole SHOUT and THANK YOU routine again and again. Eventually we get far enough that we reach a wall. Just a wall in the middle of the woods and for some reason S and I find this to be the funniest thing ever and we fall into a laughing fit. The top of the wall had a platform/ledge. A noticed this and grabs my arm and starts pulling it towards the direction of the ledge. I say to him, what are you doing? and he just points to the ledge and says up there. 

We are on our way again when we come across a sign. A is still forgetting where we are going every couple steps so we didn't make much progress. While A is off in his own fantasy land S and I try to decipher the map which was way more difficult than we had originally thought. We walk around a bend and sit down to smoke more weed. A is still on the other side of the bend but we can hear him talking to himself, he is no more than 40 feet away. We take a couple hits then we hear A sound super serious and explaining what he is doing. S and I look at each other realizing A has encountered other people and start walking away briskly to avoid being heard. A comes around the bend and we realize that he was still just talking to himself. We are both relieved and find it kinda hilarious. 

S and I continue to try and get A to come with us so we can get out of the woods but he is still too far gone to comprehend what we are trying to do. We decide to leave him where he is because we are really close to the exit. S and I leave the woods and are sitting at a gazebo in a park that is right outside the exit so we can wait for A and relax a little bit. After about 10 minutes we see someone run out of the woods (not the trail exit mind you) and fall down a hill. They stand up and go S! M! Is that you guys? A had finally sobered up a little bit (or so we had thought) and found his way out of the woods. He runs up to us and sits in the gazebo. A little ways away there are two people sitting on a swing set swinging. A looks at his phone, then looks at us and says does this even make noise? S and I look at him with confusion and then A throws his phone which lands near the people swinging. S says dude go get your phone, you're going to regret it later if you don't. A walks up to get his phone then looks at the people on the swing set and says Hey, did you guys say something? They had not and it was then that S and I realized that A was still pretty far gone. I go A come back they aren't talking to you. The people swinging must of thought that we were all insane. 

Headed back to my dorm we are walking up a hill and realize A doesn't have his car keys. We ask him where they are and he takes out his wallet and opens it and money starts falling out. S says dude how are you going to get home? to which A shrugs off as if unimportant. We finally get inside when A begins to come to and realizes that he left his keys in the woods. J joins us in my room because he is beginning to feel better too. They all go out to find A's keys and are trips are effectively over. However, A tells me what happened to him after S and I left the woods, and J tells me his trip after he went back to his dorm.

A's Story
While S and I were waiting for A to come out of the woods, he realizes that we are not in there with him any more. He began to wonder around and soon he finds himself in a cemetery. I cant even imagine what that must have been like for him in the state that he was in. A said that he felt he was in a primal state and all that mattered to him was survival. He went up to one of the graves and saw flowers on it, he picked them up and simply thought eat since that was something people must do to survive. He proceeded to eat the flowers right off the grave and then wondered around until he tripped and fell down a hill. This is when he found S and I.

J's Trip
The night prior to taking LSD, J had gotten very drunk and blacked out. While I was gone getting the second tabs for A and myself, J is having a wonderful time. He questions, why can't I feel like this all the time? to which A replies because it is illegal. Saying this triggered something in J and he began to feel as if he was in a coma because he drank too much alcohol the night before. He thought that we were figments of his imagination and that the police were trying to wake him up to bring him out of his coma. J went into our friends dorm and laid on the floor saying, either nothing is real or I am dying right now. After a couple of hours he realized that it was just the acid and was able to enjoy the rest of his trip.  

That was the last time I have taken acid which was about a year ago. It really put me off wanting to do it again because of the shit show that it turned out to be. While I didn't necessarily have a bad trip, there  were moments when it was almost too intense for me to handle. I plan on doing more again soon but it is not a drug I take lightly.

This is a pretty simple analysis of my trip tonight: A strange and unusual sense of comfortable, yet disturbing and highly disorienting intensity.

Set ~ Been a decent day, work went well and I didn't feel fatigued or depressed from my MDMA roll the night before.

Setting ~ My best friends house on a Sunday night.

8:50 ~ Orally ingested 2 blotter tabs of LSD. I am very experienced with this chemical, and have also tripped on 25i once and 25c two ~ three times. Given these encounters with research chems, I've found a distinct difference in those chemicals vs. LSD, giving me high confidence on determining if the trip was to be LSD, or a research chem such as an nBome.

9:00 ~ The tabs don't taste bitter or metallic like an nbome, providing me relief on whether it would be or not. (Although I have a fairly trusted but newer connection). My friend, his brother and I we're watching American Horror Story during the Murder House season. Horror films/visual stimuli have never spun me into a bad trip before, so I felt pretty confident in my setting - it is also dark in the room, only lit by the television. I tend to enjoy darker environments when I trip.

9:45 - 10:00pm ~ The familiar and comfortable swooning, smooth body high had began. Around this time the visuals began to follow suit, starting very subtly then gaining intensity, as they usually do for me. The television screen seemes drenched in a layer of color, seeming more vibrant than before. Tendrils of various colors like red, green and bright yellow stream along the front of the screen, seeming highly noticeable, fading in and out every few seconds. I glance to the wall that is fully covered with posters, including an old Hendrix poster along with a marilyn monroe poster. They seem to be drenched in color as well, and seeming to wave and breathe up and down while still being on the wall. My friend packs a bong load with some moderate/not great quality shake weed.

He takes a hit then offers me one, to which I accept. Taking three or four long hits each, my body felt a familiar warmth from the bud along with my swooning body high. My friend, only 2 beers deep prior to this smoke sesh, now seems quite stoned and drowsy from the weed. We begin watching some good old It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, which adds a much more humorous vibe between our commentary (which is now more minimal).

10:30 ~ My friend seems sleepy laying in his bean bag infront of the TV, his brother mostly on his phone - we chat every few minutes. I feel very stimulated and awake from the acid, watching the show and enjoying the visuals on the screen and the walls and ceiling. The visuals have begun to heavily gain in intensity. My mind set feels overall good, but strange in the sense that I'm recollecting on a conversation with my girlfriend about pregnancy. This gives my mindset an eerie and rather haunting emotional vibration. We we're worried about it for her from a sexual encounter, and are getting a test in two days. My thoughts on it seem positive yet negative at the same time, some mild fear and loathing accompanied by re - assured positivity and resolve.

10:45 ~ Recollecting now, at 5:48 am, the timeline seems blurry, but I believe it was around 10:45 or 11:00, fuck, perhaps 12:30 I ventured into the colorful and pitch dark hallway to the bathroom - this is where the brief, and memorably intense trip phase/time lapse occurred.

10:45 or 11:00, fuck, perhaps 12:30 ~ Entered the bathroom and flipped on the bright light - the mirror's edges gently wavered, along with the white and dark green tiling on the counter and bath tub. I down my usual perscribed dose of Lamotragine (Mood stabilizer) with water, then take a piss. My hands felt strangely greasy and sweaty (which they never really are) as I did so.

Suddenly, a wave of detaching psychosis pulsed through me. I feel more stimulated and energized than before I entered here, my balance seemed to slightly waver back and forth. Thoughts of confusion and spiraling questioning flooded my mind - feeling like I was almost equally overwhelmed by confusion and questioning. This didn't feel dysphoric/fearful, but seemed very intense and disortienting. Recollecting now, it's hard to describe my exact thought train(s) - I found myself glaring down at the green marbled tile outside of the sink's rim as I wash my hands. The marbled patters seemed to be flowing and moving back and forth fairly rapidly, the light also seemed to yield streaks of color. Questions like 'Why am I in here? Who? What? Or Where?' Came to me seemingly all at once. Then I felt confused and almost paralyzed by my unusually abysmal mind set, seeming manageable - yet heavily disorienting and confusing. I felt partially but not fully detached from myself while comprehending that I was bending over running water over my soapy hands. Awe struck, fairly confused on my thought train, seems hard to focus on one of the many simple questions racing in my head. This feels not dysphoric/uncomfortable, but highly intense.

Looking back, the brief psychosis period that seemed reminiscent of a high-dosed psilocybin experience seemed to last about 5 minutes - overall sending the visual intensity rocketing into hyperdrive, and warping my minds sense of orientation heavily. Since this trip, I've only experienced states of overbearing, stimulating confusion that match this on psilocybin. (Typically at a 6 gram dosage of Cubensis)

My friends used to do acid quite frequently at my house but I was unsure about it and the way it made them act very differently, it was kind of scary because of its unfamiliarity. My best friend N used to do it often and we had a lot in common in the way we think about things, so one Friday night I decided to take it with him at his house and see what all the fuss was about.

I put a hit on my tongue at about 7p.m. and tried to forget about it - I didn't want to worry, just wanted to see what would happen. After about 30 minutes I didn't feel any different, but N assured me it'd come on soon. Sure enough about 15 minutes after that he was like 'Don't things just look a little different to you?' and, looking over at a box of Trix cereal, it did look different and I didn't know in what way, but the rabbit was sort of moving and the lettering started becoming wavy and vivid.

When it kicked in we decided to roll up a blunt on his back patio. The broken up bud was moving all over the plate so it was hard to 'catch it' to begin rolling. Finally after like 30 minutes I finished it and after a few puffs I passed it to N and looked over at his yard. It was autumn so his trees were without leaves and very tall and with skinny branches...and the second I look over at them the acid just hits me and the tree is like waving out of control, its branches swirling and what not. That was the start of the real experience which was around 8:30 and I took the 2 other hits and realized how serious but incredible the drug can be. The weed kind of helped to make it kick in.

I went into his kitchen and looked at the pattern on the floor. It is a kind of random speckling of broken colored fragments on a white tile. As I watched the fragments they seemed to flow together and expand out, kind of like a river. Some of them seemed to pop out of the floor and they all kind of came together in the center and this beautiful blue aura of light was shaded on and around  them. This was around the height of my trip. I went into N's room, of course decorated with glow in the dark stars, black lights, and posters. He had some stars arranged on his ceiling that spelled out the word 'PIMP'. As I watched the stars they all were spinning fast and counterclockwise. The posters of girls looked like they were moving, coming out at me, taunting me even.

We both felt like being around some more people so we invited these 2 girls over to his house. I went outside and looked at the car they arrived in, it was dark and its headlights were on as it rolled up and it looked kind of strange...like it was moving around little when it was parked. When they got out of the car we realized they were falling down drunk, and their ride took off. The one girl wanted my friend N and the other girl was all over me. The two of us went into N's bedroom and at that point I was more interested in the visuals in his room than the girl. I felt very relaxed and like an observer of a spectactle bigger than myself. I felt very relaxed and like an observer of a spectactle bigger than myself. I felt detached from my body, enlightened, very entertained, and gained a better understanding of things around me through this spiritual state of bewilderment.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

At around 4a.m. I drove home and on the way I kept hearing weird noises sounding like they were coming from my car's engine or something but I knew it was all in my head because it was a brand new car.

Overall I was surprised at the amount of control I had over myself even though I was in a totally different, strange, but very intriguing and interesting state of mind at the same time and for the first time. It was a very positive experience since I was around my best friend and in a familiar environment. Hope you enjoyed reading my first experience.

Peace - sm138.

For a while I have harboured the ambition of taking LSD in my own home, a 15 acre property surrounded by lush forest and a large dam. I currently still live with my parents, so this wasn't possible until I explained my reasons to them, having taken mushrooms and smoked pot themselves they understood and it seemed they were even intrigued as to what experiences I might have.

So I and three friends travelled from town to my place, and got comfortable in my small pad a few hundred metres from the house, the day was incredibly windy with scattered clouds. T offered us all a small amount of MDMA powder which we ate, this was around 12 o'clock. We didn't feel much affects from this but it certainly put us all in the right frame of mind for what was about to come. We chatted and riffled over music for a few hours and then at 2 o'clock I produced the goods. 4 tabs of lsd labelled with the cute and cheeky Mr. Felix the cat (a word goes out to whomever made this batch as it held a high reputation as being some of the trippiest acid our collective has ever tried) we all consumed with smiles on our faces.

We left our room shortly after that, wrapped in blankets and using short bursts of our lighters to guide us through the pitch black and on our walk. We crossed a large paddock and took rest on the side of the grassy dam embankment for a cigarette. It was shortly after this that the clouds parted and the full glory of the night sky was revealed, it was then that nature seemed to call forward our coming trip and we all simultaneously lay back in astonishment, mouths open barely believing what was happening. Then we looked at each other and began to laugh, we stood up, the heavy wind took hold of our blankets and it felt like we were taking in everything at high speed, a huge smile was spread across our faces. We walked up the embankment to reveal the huge volume of water that was behind us all along, dully lit by the stars.

I led our little group into the forest stopping on the way to pick up what I thought to be a bone, but turned out to be a stick resembling a short staff with the head of a dragon (still treasure that to this day) As we walked we discussed how the darkness enveloped us in the most comforting way possibly, like we could be anywhere at all hugged by the vastness of infinity. We all hugged and made a den with our blankets, it was wonderful. 

We returned back to the room and listened to music and fell deep into hallucinations. Paintings I had done over the past few years covered the walls and the heater sent a current of warm air up, fluttering the prayer fags and over all giving the feeling of the whole room flying through a vast plane, Id look at my friend and we'd turn to the walls and lay back in wonder. The palette of colour in that room was like nothing Ive ever seen.

After a while we settled down a bit and ventured outside again only to jump back as we realised the sun was about to rise, we once again made the same journey we'd made earlier that night but this time it was nature the surrounded and hugged us. The wind raced by, everything around us, the trees, and the grass was a mass of intense lush green movement. We paused in the middle of the paddock to look deep into the grass and admire it incredible beauty and endlessness. 

Once we reached the top of dam I turned round and leaned back as far as I could without falling over. My vision at that point was vast I could see everything all around my, the wind stretched the tips of the trees off into the distance, everything swirly and moving, alive! At this point I felt no longer human but a part of everything around me, as green and alive as what I was seeing. Then my friend pointed to the sky a humongous cloud was above us, lit red on the edges by the rising sun, suddenly the whole cloud and many of the surrounding clouds became brightly red, shiny, smooth, then soft and organic (we all saw this so Im quite certain this beautiful sight would have been just as amazing if we werent on acid) I concentrated on the cloud as it moved slowly, with grace and purpose. Then to my astonishment a lion cub appeared atop it, proud and facing the wind, he took a giant leap and fell plunging into the green paddock before me; this is a memory that will stick with me forever, a building block of my life I am sure. 

We continued into the forest, everything became increasingly alive, birds, insects, green lush filled every sight. We strayed off the path and into this wonderland, touching, observing and saying to each other how fulfilling it all was. We headed back to the room for the last time and sat and smoked and discussed, all very happy with our adventure. 

This was the only trip Ive had so far that has been completely void of any bad feeling.  Setting was crucial and so were the people I was with.

After setting up my campsite at Bonna 09, I was lying on the grass trying to stay out of the sun when a guy in his mid 20s walked up to me and asked me if I wanted some molly. I said no politely and he proceeded on his way, before he was out of view though I yelled across for him to come back. I asked him if he knew where I could get some acid. He told me to follow him, I did. We walked two tents over from mine to a group of tents under a large green tarp, that I later named tent city. The guy said wait here and walked into the darkness that lurked in tent city, about a minute later he returned with another mid 20s guy.

Mid 20s guy number two walks up to me and we shake hands, the other guy walks away.
what do you need he says
lsd I reply
Is two for 15 alright with you? he asks
I reply with a simple nod of my head and he creeps back into tent city. I wait anxiously for him to return, after about 5 minutes he comes back.
I cut these strips pretty fat, so enjoy
Thanks man, I appreciate it I shake his hand again.

We go our separate ways, I return to my campsite ecstatic to drop for the first time in over 3 months. Upon inspection of the tabs I realize its 3 tabs cut into 2 making them both rectangular shapes rather than squares with a small perforation going through one side. I decided that night will be the night I take it, with no hesitation I pop the first in my mouth. I wait a little while for the second because I dont know the strength of the blotter and I wanted to get a feel for the strength without it hitting me like a train.

Everything is going well and I feel the acid and I see the bands I intended on, so I pop the second. I feel the second everything is a little bit nuts but definitely something I have under control. I go see the last band I wanted to see of the night and me and my friends head back to our campsite. Im having a really good time when I get there so I decide to smoke a joint of this killer weed I had picked up specifically for Bonnaroo. I start to feel odd, unexplainably odd, I get into my tent take off my shoes and lay down onto my back looking up at the ceiling of the tent. I start to see some pretty intense waves on the walls, it starts to storm outside and the whole tent is shaking. Lighting was crashing all around me my heart was pounding and I felt as though I couldnt breathe. I feel myself being pulled away from everything around me very quickly. I tried to tell my friends I was having a bad trip, but they didnt know what to do because they didnt have any experience with psychedelics like I have. All I could do is lay there and take it in, suddenly I couldnt tell if my eyes were opened or closed. My first thoughts is that I was dead balancing between heaven and hell in some kind of purgatory type realm, I figured I ODd. I talked myself down by saying repeatedly to myself you cant OD on lsd. It became like a song in my head, a beat. After what felt like years I realized I wasnt dead and where I was. For a short amount of time I was under control.

I looked about the tent and it became a different place then a tent in Manchester, TN on the Bonnaroo campgrounds. It became an open field of tall grass swaying back and forth with many hills and a light blue sky. Slowly it became the tent again, everything was out of place and nothing felt quite right. I couldnt do anything but close my eyes and try to ignore it, when I closed my eyes though all I could see was a small cube of multicolored lights that said something in the middle, as I kept my eyes closed longer it got larger and larger. As it became larger it was very clear what it said: YOU ARE ON LSD in bold letters. Every time the colors changed I could feel each individual color pour into me but not my body into me, as in my soul. After what felt like years it went away, all I could see was black. I began to transcend  my body, I felt my body dissipating from me. I was my soul out of my body, racing through space, stars shooting past me, free beyond any way of describing it. I then transcended time and space, I reached total inner peace and connection with myself. At this point I believe that I was at a ++++ on the Shulgin Rating Scale. I dont remember anything that happened past this point, I passed out.

The next morning I awoke shaking, I got out of the tent and walked to the bathrooms. On my way a group of people stopped and asked me if I was ok, I said yes and realized I must look like absolute shit from the complete and utter mind fuck that had taken place the night before. I thought I had a bad trip, I now realize thats completely opposite of what happened. I reached who I really am as a person and am forever changed by the first night of Bonnaroo 2009.

We took it about 12 noon on a perfect early autumn day in March.  By 1.30pm the 8 of us were in the sea, splashing about and jumping with joy in and out of surf breakers straight from the Antarctic.  

Things started to morph into serotonergia about half an hour later, just as we settled onto the camp on the top of the cliff.  Gazing out and down onto the paradisical arc of sand and wave, we could see the thousands of little dolphins leaping over each other in their frenetic quest to spill out onto the beach with each new and ever-more sparkling and be-jewelled wave.  At least that's what the foamy water resembled, both visually and energetically.  

As we relaxed into each other's loving acceptance and enjoyed the astonishing vista before us, the sea-floor took on the appearance of the bottom of a vast swimming-pool, with the shades of dark from patches of wea-weed taking on the appearance of differently-coloured tiles on the floor.  

Turning my back for a moment to the sea, I headed into the shade of the trees, into the heart of our camp.  All the bags and other paraphernalia we had deposited there instantly transformed into glowing jewels of ruby red, emerald green, blue sapphire and colours that were radiating their sweet luscious fruity taste with such intensity that I was stunned into an inanely smiling silence.  Incidentally as I stood up to walk, I  could feel my body plunging down into the ground and back up again, like I was suspended on a huge bungee-jump cord.

Three of the group were only using marijuana or alcohol and their conversation seemed to disturb the serenity and tranquillity of the experience.

At about 7pm or so, as the sun was setting beyond a bluff at the end of the beach, we walked along the strand, dipping toes in the waves with trousers rolled up - and we were on an endless infinite landscape, ever-present, primordial, ineffable.  Patterns in the exposed rock of the cliffs became creatures, reminiscent of the sacred patterns on the sides of Uluru.

The feelings of overwhelming (of shamelessly tearful intensity) empathy and love for my partner were impressive.  

The sight of the sunset on the horizon was so universal and timeless that as a group we were transported to anywhere else in the world we wanted to be.

It was a Friday night and it was about 7:00 o'clock that my parents had gone out for the night to see a concert. They wouldn't be home until around 11:30 or midnight I had assumed. It was just my little sister at home, who stays in her room all the time anyway, and my good friend C and my boyfriend of 3 years A. 

The whole day prior to dropping I had a bad stomach ache and hadn't eaten much but some fried food just before we took the acid. I wasn't feeling exactly 100% but I had heard that eating wasn't something you normally do when you trip so I didn't worry about it.

I've tried taking acid twice before. Once it just didn't happen, and the second time I did it by myself and I had a very bad experience, and I'm not sure if it was bad acid or something else entirely. My mind kind of crashed in on itself and I felt like I was trapped on a roller coaster ride of my life. I cried nearly the entire time, and I don't remember how long it lasted. It had very minor visuals and I recovered in the end by smoking some marijuana. I've also tried MDMA three times before and smoke marijuana regularly. 

I've always gotten very nervous right before I've tried a drug for the first time and I was nervous this time too, even though I had tried it before. I've heard the whole 'set and setting' thing and I knew I should stay calm but it was difficult to do and I let my boyfriend take the acid before I did. He took a tab and I started out with half of a tab. My friend C took a few prescription pills of something or other like ritalin and was drinking vodka and rum. I had a feeling our tripping and his high wouldn't mix well but we did it anyway.

We smoked out of my bong and finished about two packs of it when I could tell my boyfriend was feeling something. He had the goofiest smile on his face and looked stoned beyond belief. I started to consider to take my other half so I wouldn't miss out on whatever he was experiencing and waste my tab by only taking half. I put in my other half and accidentally bit down on it, which triggered a terrible taste in my mouth. I tried to drink water partially because of cotton mouth and partially to wash out the taste and like my boyfriend warned, it only intensified the putrid taste. I sat down at my table and began to swivel back and forth in my chair and my boyfriend A and my friend C begin to look somehow 3D as I do this. I tell them and my friend C asks, 'Wait, how many dimensions are we in again?' I begin to laugh and do a cheer my physics teacher taught to remember our four dimensions. I think I'm beginning to come up. 

Eventually we head to my room. I don't exactly remember the exact point that it started to hit me but I remember that I was increasingly giggly and saying ridiculous things. I told my friend C who was supposed to be the designated 'babysitter' of my boyfriend and I to try to keep up to the space ship ride I was on. 

The visuals began to become very intense and I saw my whole room begin to breathe. I started to understand the feeling my boyfriend barely managed to describe, indicating it by doing wave patterns with his arms and hands. However, the visuals also had an adverse effect on me. I became nauseated and dizzy and I had severe stomach cramps. I felt restricted in my clothing and felt very hot. I stripped off of what I could of my clothes while staying decent and complained of how I didn't feel very well. My friend C tried to convince me not to focus on it and my boyfriend insisted on me 'letting go' but I told them they didn't understand how badly my stomach hurt and how terribly this mixed with the visual effects I had. my boyfriend insisted on me 'letting go' but I told them they didn't understand how badly my stomach hurt and how terribly this mixed with the visual effects I had. 

At some point in time I rushed to the bathroom and began to vomit. I was tripping somewhat, but it still hadn't completely taken over yet. It had to have been around 7:30 or so. I went back to my room where my friends were and laid down in my bed again. I still felt absolutely sick. I was overheated and felt weak, and my teeth were grinding against each other. My head felt like it was going with the visuals I saw, going out a thousand dimensions, and with this I got 'face chills', or some sort of chills that only occurred in what felt like the back of my head. I got up, sat down, got up, and sat down, debating on whether I should go throw up again. I didn't want to, but God, I felt so shitty. So I did. This next time around my visuals were coming in full swing. I sat in front of my 'porcelain God' and threw up. I paused and heard my friend in my room telling my boyfriend to 'focus on yourself' and for some reason I found this inspiring as I watched the vomit in my toilet. I got up, recovered myself, and went back to my room. I told C what he said was inspiring and went back to lay down. I kept gagging for quite some time and felt nauseous for another good hour, but it felt much longer. 

During my nausea my boyfriend took my hand and told me that I had to relax, to go with it, to not try to control my trip but let it control me. Time immediately began to slow down immensely and I laughed and exclaimed how he just slowed time down like that. The posters on my walls were all very fascinating. The Beatles watching me trip and gag, which I didn't appreciate much, my map of Paris which swirled together in beautiful ways, a piece of art... mostly though, my hand was subject to stare at as I focused in on it and let the colorful patterns close in around it. I began to regain physical stability as I willed myself to not gag at every thought I had of anything remotely gross or nausea-inducing. My boyfriend and I tripped together as my friend C tried to keep us happy. A and I though were completely somewhere else, laughing at nearly everything, even if it wasn't funny. 

In fact, the only emotional response I think I really felt was giddiness. Besides this, I felt like I wasn't functioning at an emotional level. My friend C tried to talk to me about people or things but I just didn't care about any of it. I was focused on what I was seeing mostly and how my fingertips were swelling with the same energy that was surging off of the walls and ceilings. I didn't feel like myself at all, I had no normal emotions I usually felt. I didn't care about myself or anything else. 

We made our way to my living room and chilled there for a little while. My favorite cat curled herself up to me and I was amazed by her tiny little body and her beautiful, intricate white fur. We talked for some time here, though most of my sentences were never complete because I was either interrupted by my friend C who was beginning to feel his high and he was talking very much, or my mind was interrupted by a whole other thought. This or I just couldn't find it in me to care to finish the sentence. It wasn't worth trying to explain most of the time, I couldn't articulate much of anything. A recurring motif in this trip, however, was my desire for a peanut butter sandwich because of my illness. My boyfriend made me the sandwich and we spoke in a British accent about my breathing sandwich. 

I went back into my room and found myself very displeased with its appearance. I got the urge to begin to clean it. I picked up some papers and headed for my garage. Without turning on the light first, I stepped out into it and felt something on the bottom of my foot squirm around. I screamed bloody murder though I didn't really feel any terror or fear, it was mostly just an automatic response. My boyfriend turned on the light and I swore I saw a cockroach crawl away from under my foot. I began to laugh and yell and demand if what I saw was really a cockroach or if I had just imagined that. My friend C and my boyfriend insisted it wasn't, but they later informed me it was, they didn't want to give me a bad trip though. I don't think this would have bothered me anyway however, I felt so content and detached, it didn't phase me in the slightest. 

I've also heard that you shouldn't look at yourself in the mirror while you trip. I did this anyway, out of curiosity, expecting to see someone who wasn't me. It was me, with pupils as big as saucers, but it was me. I looked up close however, and saw every pore on my face it seemed like. It also looked like I had broken out with a million tiny red pimples. I quickly removed myself from the mirror upon this inspection.

At 10 PM my younger brother who is 15 came home. He knows about my drug use and I immediately told him as he came through the door that I was tripping on acid along with A. I also told him we were probably screwed because mom and dad would be home relatively soon and I was still feeling it, though it had diminished a little. He told me I didn't have to worry, I didn't look like I was tripping on acid, and gave me probably the best part of the trip: magnets. 15 little round magnets captured my attention for the rest of the trip. I swore I could see their magnetic field. My boyfriend and I played with them and giggled incessantly while my friend C tried and tried to talk to us and hold a conversation, but I was hardly interested. I mostly wanted, at this point, to relax my mind and space out for a while. 

My boyfriend A tried to put on a cartoon show on my computer but dissatisfied with this turn of events, I left A and C and laid down on my mother's bed. I laid there for I don't know how long, it felt like 20 minutes, but could have been longer or shorter. I watched the shadows from the TV dance on the wall and my arm hairs tower from me. I relaxed and thought about nothing, really. And I enjoyed not thinking about anything, for usually it's that I have too many thoughts on my mind at all times. I enjoyed not thinking about anything, for usually it's that I have too many thoughts on my mind at all times. 

I returned to my room where C and A were. I was beginning to come down and my boyfriend A informed me he had mostly come down to. I could focus on something and the visuals would return if I gave it a minute, but the physical feelings were completely gone. All I was left with was happiness. I think the trip had mostly resided by midnight. I was in a genuinely good mood, probably from laughing and smiling so much. My friend C was on a whole different high and was irritating me immensely and sleeping in my room that night. I didn't want my boyfriend to leave, but he did and I forced myself to sleep. The next day I felt exhausted in my body and my jaw ached from grinding my teeth.

Acid was an extremely out of this world experience and all I want to do is try it again, when I won't be throwing up or inside. I would love to be outside in the day time the next time I do it. I don't think I ever had much of a panic during the trip, just physical illness that bothered me, and luckily I gathered it in me to overcome this.

Clarity in the Forest - Microdosing LSD

Setting:  regional burning man event in a forested but dry area

I was having kind of an emotionally difficult time (sober) at the regional burn in my area.  I was introduced to someone I sort of knew, but instinctively trusted, and they asked me if I wanted a microdose of LSD, explaining that it was 15 ug, or 1/12 strength of a regular dose diluted in some grain alcohol.   It was in a glass vial, and a small drop was placed on my hand and I licked it off.  

I have been interested in microdosing for a while, along with much of the psychedelic community over the past few years, but have not been too interested in LSD because I have never really had a good relationship with this molecule (I usually prefer mushrooms if I want to trip).  However given the opportunity I was excited to try it.  I was told that in about 90 minutes to 2 hours I will feel increased heart rate, a change in mood, and maybe some stimulation but that I should not feel like I am tripping.  

After about 15 min I felt increased social confidence, more interest in chatting with some people I didn't know that well, and an increased feeling of well-being.  At about the one-hour mark I decided to make my way back to my camp and chill for a bit by myself.  I started to feel happy and thankful to be where I was in the moment, noticing details of my surroundings, the beauty of nature and appreciating the creativity and energy of the other humans around me.  I felt more confidence to say hello to strangers and interact with people.  Back at camp, I felt my energy increase significantly, my heart rate increased and I was noticing patterns in the trees, the sounds of cicadas and birds, and the laughter and singing of people camped around me.  It was beautiful!  I felt thankful and appreciative.  I did a short yoga practice, really feeling and noticing the small details of how my body felt at the time, which muscles needed to be stretched or flexed, and which positions would be beneficial.  

I had a strong urge to make some art and my concentration was on point- I focused in on small details and created a detailed ink drawing partially from my imagination and also based on the patterns I was seeing in the trees and landscape around me.  I felt very content with where I was, and also comfortable with the idea of going and doing something else if the opportunity arose.  

At the 3 hour mark my partner came back to camp and I enjoyed our talk and the process of getting ready to go out for the evening's burn event.  I felt no desire to drink alcohol, smoke cannabis, drink caffeine, or change my mental state in any way.  I had energy to talk with people who came up to say hello (note- I'm usually pretty shy), and was also comfortable enforcing my boundaries when drunk or annoying people wanted to talk for longer than I was comfortable.  I generally enjoyed the evening although nothing really spectacular happened, and nothing horrible either.  It was a nice night in a surreal setting.  The main difference was that I felt very little shyness and I was more comfortable chatting with strangers and gracefully exiting situations that I did not want to be in.  

At the 8 hour mark I started yawning (noticed that I had not yawned at all since taking the microdose) and by 10 hours I was in bed and drifting off to sleep.  I slept well that night even without smoking any cannabis and in the presence of a lot of loud partygoers.  I had some minor stomach upset that day and the day after, but nothing too serious.  Overall it was a nicely enjoyable, yet subtle experience and I would definitely repeat it!

A Day in the Botanical Gardens With Lucy

I and three of my friends (well refer to them as J, H & S throughout the story) decided to spend a long summer day in the Botanical Gardens on LSD. At around 11am we had settled down in a beautiful spot in the gardens. H had just bought an Ehrlichs reagent testing kit. I had met the dealer over Tinder and hence we did not trust him completely and were nervous about being given 25I-NBOMe or another type research chemical we were not familiar with. The kit indicated LSD. I & H took a full tab (sold as 150ug/tab); S & J took half a tab each as it was their first time.

I was the first to come up. As I was coming up on the acid, a large group of 100 primary school children came walking through the gardens on some kind of school excursion. I had fond memories of school excursions to the gardens as a child and found this to be quite a loopy thought  evidently; Lucys effects were starting to kick in. I watched the children roll down the hill with so much energy and light-heartedness. I felt children did not need acid, but I needed acid to get back to mind of a child even for just a few hours.

At that point J who is artistic and had brought a bunch of paint and a canvas with her decided to attempt to paint something. 10 minutes later, I was tripping hard but still had my shit together enough to put the paint away as J completely lost it, pissing herself with laughter and getting the paint everywhere.

At this point I went for a walk. I walked further and further until I stumbled across the Greenhouse I had visited several months ago on a prior trip. An old man of about 60 warned me about the heat and humidity inside, but I was determined to be reunited with the plants once again. When inside, I felt the plants were whispering to me and found incredible peace surrounded by so much life. I felt the plants were whispering to me and found incredible peace surrounded by so much life. I left the Greenhouse only to realise I was completely and utterly lost. After what felt like 30 minutes and after some slight worrying I found the home base and my friend H therapeutically crying.

The next few hours were filled with laughter and joy while watching tourists make ridiculous poses in amongst the trees. I pondered whether the tourists were also on Lucy, or if they were behaving so ridiculously on purpose as to entertain me or if perhaps this was simply their normal behaviour. I then was asked to take a photo for a couple of tourists. The fact that I spoke English and the tourists spoke Chinese make the interaction difficult enough, but the added dimension that I was tripping balls and struggling to hold my shit together made the interaction all the more outrageous. I put a lot of energy into photographing the couple and felt tremendous joy being able to provide this service. Meanwhile J had gone on a walk and had also taken photos of some tourists including a selfie with an old nanny.

We then moved the home base to a more scenic and open spot. I lay down on the grass and listened to Clair de Lune (Claude Debussy) and experienced kaleidoscope vision whilst looking up at the sky. After another four to five hours we left the gardens, leaving behind nothing but the abstract painting J had done earlier in the day for fellow garden users to ponder. 

Despite taking the LSD at 11.30am in the morning, I could feel a funny feeling in my chest and had racing thoughts until I finally fell asleep at 5am in the morning. I believe this was not caused by the LSD per se, but rather by some slight anxiety that I was never going to feel sober again and would be permanently in a psychotic state. 

The following day, I had a rough and unexpected come-down as a result of the acid trip, much like the low feelings one might have after consuming MDMA. I believe this was psychological rather than physical. I believe in some ways, during the trip, I felt more normal, at peace and happy than I had in a long time. This trip has given me some insight into a state of being I would like to aspire to feel while sober. Finally, whilst this trip was overwhelmingly positive and happy, I realised how fragile the day was and how easily the trip could have gone south. I am humbled by the extraordinary power of LSD.

Back in the late 90s I dropped a couple of hits of orange colored blotter. I hadn't dropped any acid in a few weeks and was tripping hard but was loving every minute of it.  We, myself and a friend, decided to go up to his older brother's apartment. When we got there, their was 4 other people we would party with on occassion sitting around drinking and smoking weed. Everyone in the apartment was a few years older than us. I didn't really trust any of them, including my buddies older brother. 

We sat down and started drinking and smoking. They were also tripping hard. One of the people in the apartment passed a spliff my way and said 'look, you're shaking'. I remember looking down at my hands and not being able to tell if I was shaking. I looked at my hands, fully aware of the fact that I have poor vision, and all I saw was a blur. I couldn't tell whether I was shaking or not and whether or not it was just my crappy eyesight. I tried really hard but I couldn't tell. I then became absolutely convinced that he was screwing with me and trying to send me on a bad trip. Sure enough, I started thinking I have to get out of here. I have to leave. I don't know where I want to go, but I have to leave now. I tried telling my buddy that we have to leave. He was like, why do you want to leave? I was like, we have to leave now. I need to get out of this apartment. I don't know if I was telling him we have to leave in front of other people but I eventually convinced him to leave. 

When we left I told him that we had to leave because the people in the apartment were trying to screw with me. As per the normal acid-induced panic I had what felt like a million thoughts and questions flashing through my mind every second. I was feeling overwhelmed by the number of thoughts going through my mind. I felt like I was going crazy and that I was never going to be normal again. I couldn't tell whether my paranoia was justified. I also began trying to figure out whether I was shaking or not and was panicked by the fact that I couldn't figure out if I was actually shaking. After we left, we walked to my buddies house and sat in his basement bedroom. He turned the lights out, flicked on the lava lamp and turned on My Friends by the Red Hot Chilli Peppers. After 15 to 20 minutes of sitting in the dark watching the lava lamp, after having left the apartment about 40 minutes earlier, I began to chill the hell out. 

The moral of the story is the classic truism that set and setting matter. I didn't trust the people we were with. So, I was suspicious of them. When one of them started messing with me mentally it confirmed that I shouldn't trust them. This made me believe that I had to leave. When  I started thinking that I needed to leave the panic set in because I didn't know how I was going to convince my buddy to leave. The more I thought about leaving the more I convinced myself that I absolutely had to leave - that it was necessary for my mental health.

LSD Tabs Double Strength 
 plus Mirror Gazing
 

--------------------------------------------------
In preparation, I sit with and accept my karma. This is the purification ritual. If shown my faces and asked to choose a face, I choose none, and so the rest follows.
--------------------------------------------------

It's a Thursday evening and I've just broken up with my boyfriend of 6 years, which was an immense relief for both of us. We had been trying to do it gracefully for the past year or more and hadn't yet succeeded. I am drinking some wine and decide that the thing I need at that moment is to drop this blotter acid that I've been saving, which is quite strong. A year previously my friends and I each took a half tab of the same on a Tuesday evening at Burning Man. The following trip was intense and lasted the entire night and included a birth and rebirth as well as a very powerful goddess sighting at the temple of Mazu. This dose of a full tab that I've given myself on this night is the strongest psychedelic trip that I've ever signed up for in my entire life. 

That being said, I put off taking this substance this year at the Burning Man Festival, though I did prepare myself as if I were going to trip. I'd better do what I set out to do. 

-The come up-

As I lay on the couch in our dark living room still tipsy from the wine, the room is suddenly so intensely illuminated from nothing but the municipal street lamps that charmingly light our downtown neighborhood at night. At this time my ex-partner walks in the room, and I admit to him what I've just done to myself. He smiles and accepts and goes to bed. Later on in the evening I bother him for some cigarettes which he obliges. 

What follows is several hours of me digesting the swirl of information that has comprised my consciousness for the last few years, work, play, social media, friends, relationships, family. All is unfolded before me. 

The trip washes over me in waves as I sit peacefully, rave to myself quietly, or explore what appears to be the merging of the spiritual world with the very fabric of my reality. I do this for several hours, most of the night in fact. 

At some point I have placed my folded yoga mat in the middle of the kitchen, and I watch as the tiles are transformed with nothing other than the otherworldly mandala that sits at the heart of all things. My little black cat chooses this moment to appear crouched in the middle of the yoga mat as if he too sees the abyss beneath us and has chosen my mat to reside upon as if were a life raft amid the turbulent waters. 

At another point I decide to tear a book recommended to me by a friend straight in half using the old phone-book trick. I guess that served as my critical review of that content. I shared the pictures with him in a text message. I hope he appreciated the humor. I think so, he's very into situationist theater and dadism. He's also a dad. Joke. 

In the early hours of the morning, after using the toilet facilities and nicely cleaning off the crusty gunk on the inside of the toilet bowl, as well, so very nice of me, I decide to embark upon a mirror gazing journey. Yes, because if I'm going to go deep I might as well go that deep. Lucky for me all the work I did in preparation that previous evening, night and the months leading up to the drop left me open to experience what was shown without spiraling into ego-craving meltdown. I'm a dumbass. And reckless. As. FUCK. 

Brave also. Very very brave. 

I sit gazing into the mirror and watch as my face ages into this life and then flashes past all the rest of my lives on this spiral. It is true what they say, I am a very old soul. I have lived many long and full reincarnations on this spirit so my past lives happily look like nothing less than a long procession of very attractive and happy grannies. My name suits me well. 

After a time I was asked to choose a face so I played with this concept a bit, but in the end chose no face. Happily I was gifted with a fleeting sight of what I believe is the Buddha face gazing back at me. I've had a few visions before of Buddhist teachings shown to me, very memorable the Abhaya Mudra amid a swirling cloud as I lay trance meditating something during the period in which my Grandmother passed.

And then, because I think he has been on my mind a lot in these recent days, just about since August 28th, right before I left for Burning Man, I see all my new paramours lives and ancestry as well. I won't reveal a story that is not mine to tell but a few notes:

I didn't know that was a thing. 

I wonder if he is a gemini, and I shall ask him next time we meet. 

It was at first uncomfortable to wear another person's faces all at once, no less a man's faces but then also realizing that it was someone I knew. Very intense. As a result I decided to ask him if he had some time to spend with me over the weekend. I wonder what he will reply. 

After that, it was back to a little cross eyed gazing and symmetry viewing. I should review what the mechanism is that tends to give this impression with LSD specifically. After that I decided that I needed to give my eyeballs a rest and not go heavy on the contact wearing for the next few days, and remain unassisted if at all possible. I think I can do it if I enlist the help of some friends. I am functionally blind without correction so this is a pretty serious request. I think modern optometry is very effective but it can be very jarring and stressful on the eyes if one's vision needs extensive correcting.  

I am very afraid of total vision loss so this is something I should explore more in the future. As a visual artist there are many implications and professional ramifications of this loss of vision. Not all bad. Some great art is achieved by functionally blind artists. 

As I come down I get an e-mail alert that a job that I would very much like to have is matched to me. It seems I've already applied for this job and am stonewalled by the indifference of internet jobs databases. So I do something kind of ballsy and send an email to the founder of the company at which I was just laid off to see if he could assist me with getting an interview. 

More comedown. A little attempts at napping and figuring out what I'm meant to do with myself for the next few days. Good morning to my ex who's happy to be on his way to work and not displeased to see me. We can be friends again and that is a relief after all the fighting because we really are good friends. I'm overcome with the urge to share writing on a platform of my choosing and it appears that the droplet (virtual server host service) with my install of Ghost that I set up about a year ago is still live. I forgot the password though, and I may not have set up my e-mail settings correctly to retrieve lost passwords on the server side of things so I'll have to debug that later when I'm a little less loopy. I'd rather troubleshoot than have to start all over from scratch. It was a pretty big feat to set up in the first place as a first ever Linux server admin project. And now I sit writing and getting ready to make my first ever submission to the Erowid vaults on LSD. 

Good times.

Basically me and a buddy dropped a couple blotters for our first time and tripped our nuts off for 2 days and were unable to crash without sleeping pills after being totally exhausted. The experience was everything from horrid to incredible. Hallucinations like no other that I'm not even going to try to describe. 

Anyway the trip is not the reason I'm writing, but the never-ending after-affects. Its been over two thirds of a year and they are still very intense. From derealization to intense after-imaging and hallucinations. But the only issue this drug has brought me is intense anxiety. I have never been an anxious person until now. I think the anxiety is related to my mind processing too many details in the environment around me like noise and movement. I can't even look at a carpet for too long with out it moving or sparkling. If I focus on a complex design in one specific spot the whole room in my peripherals will go dark and I will be tripping. I can control some of the visuals but the anxiety and weird wonders about reality are always constant. Driving in the night is trippy. Signs multiply and all lights and reflections have intense halos that is very distracting because that are neat to look at sometimes. 

The weirdest part about it is the person I dropped with is a relative and they are feeling the same after effects as myself unlike the rest of my friends who all tell me they came down and out of the trip just fine.  
I'm interested in how many others this drug affected this way. I spoke with my doctor about my condition and we are experimenting with different anxiety medications to help me calm down.

I dont get many opportunities to use psychedelics, so when they arise, I like to take advantage of them. About a month after Id returned from Bonnaroo, my friend Steve announced his parents would be out of state for a week. Without hesitation, he, my girlfriend Jamie, and our friends Rene and Liam made plans to drop acid at Steves place.

Steves house is ideal for tripping. Its located on a dead-end street in a quiet neighborhood surrounded by woods, orchards, farms, and meadows. Its equipped with a hot tub, a sauna, a deck, a porch, a hammock, comfortable furniture, pool and ping-pong tables, and a high-quality sound system with speakers in just about every room.

3:45 PM - Jamie, Rene, and I arrive at Steves on a gorgeous Saturday in mid July, the day before my twentieth birthday. Steve and Liam have been chilling for a couple of hours, awaiting our arrival. We unpack our belongings from my car and make no effort to mask our excitement.

4:00 PM - We ingest the LSD in Steves basement. Steve, Rene, and Liam each take two hits of potent Bonnaroo blotter, while Jamie and I each take a strong Bonnaroo gel tab and a hit of weaker blotter.

4:20 PM - Im beginning to feel the initial effects, that strange sensation of somethings not quite right. Ive taken shrooms three times, but this is to be only my second time on LSD (though my first trip wasnt very powerful). We decide to go for a hike.

4:45 PM - Walking down the street on our way to the trail, my breathing becomes heavy. I can feel happiness mounting from within, and its all I can do to suppress a huge grin. Liam begins laughing hysterically. This will be his first psychedelic experience.

As we make our way further down the street, the countryside becomes more and more picturesque and I can definitely feel the LSD heaviness in my chest and stomach. We see a dog in a yard, who barks at us and looks totally alien. Jamie finishes eating a banana and places the peel in the middle of the road, an act that will take on a strange significance on the return journey.

We turn left at the bottom of the hill. The road here is straight and follows a gentle, up-and-down sloping pattern for about a mile. I notice the colors of the sidewalk and grass, and wonder why they dont always look this varied and pronounced. I also notice the many insects flying in the air and leaping in the grass, they seem foreign and somewhat hostile. Suddenly, I see small, winged creatures zooming frantically over the grasswhich is now a Martian redon the side of the road. My brain cannot decide what they are, so it settles for a cross between a moth, hornet, butterfly, and miniature bird. On second thought, I am not sure these zipping, winged bugs are real or just figments of my imagination. Only when one plows into my bare chest do I realize these things do exist. I shout an expletive and dash into the road to escape these airborne menaces.

Steve laughs and assures me they are just locusts. I am only slightly relieved. Seconds later, a motorcycle appears on the road in the distance, heading towards us. The sound of its engine is comical, it sounds much more like flatulence than anything else. The man riding it is overweight and astonishingly frog-like. When he passes us, Liam erupts in laughter and declares, That man just frumpfucked my soul!

Later, Liam comes up with a senseless bit of wisdom. In the sands of time, he declares, we sit like rocks. That sends the lot of us into a fit of laughter.

We reach a bridge overlooking a shallow river, where we pause and enjoy the wind on our bodies. I feel as though the gentle breeze is embracing me as a human would. It warms me and sends pleasant shivers down my spine. I am now in a definite state of euphoria.

Further along the way, Liam plucks a large yellow lily and hands it to me. Its stamens reach out at me in an explicitly sexual manner. This sends me on a new train of thought, and I turn the flower over in my hand, marveling at its natural, organic sexuality and the way it stains my fingers yellow. When I mention this to my comrades, they just laugh, and Rene jokingly calls me a pervert. I am not upset at my peers for their reaction, but I do begin to dislike speaking in this state. I dislike the sound of my own voice and, occasionally, the sound of others. Throughout the trip, I will frequently recommit myself to vows of silence and request that others keep their voices low.

We pass a sign that reads, ZELDAS VEGETABLES. A woman is working in a garden across the street from the sign, and I think, That must be Zelda. Everyone hushes as we approach the woman, all of us suspecting she must know were tripping. She doesnt look up when we pass. Normally, I would enthusiastically greet her, but under the influence of LSD, I feel most awkward and remain quiet.

Shortly before arriving at the trail, we pass another sign, this one put here by the state. It says, NO PARKING SUNRISE TO SUNSET. I ponder the message and think its profound that, in order for one to understand the simple instructions, one must first understand what a sunrise and sunset are. I am in awe that such a basic traffic sign relies upon the human understanding of two beautiful, cosmic occurrences.

5:30 PM - The five of us reach the entrance to the trail. I set the flower down by the side of the road, perceiving it as a symbol assuring our safe return.

When we pass beneath the trees, I realize Im tripping hard, harder than Ive ever tripped before. Visuals kick in almost instantaneously, every plant continuously radiates copies of itself into the air, and when the wind rustles the leaves, bright green tracers flow in their wakes.

Before we start the hike, we head down a familiar side path to the edge of a lake where wed had a campfire several months earlier. A rusty old barrel sits in the brush just off the trail, and I feel strangely comforted when I look upon it.

The visuals I perceive at the lake are probably the strongest of the whole trip. The surface of a large tree in front of me ripples as if tiny raindrops are disturbing its liquid bark, and the shapes of its trunk spiral and squirm as if they are alive. I feel as though I am seeing sound. Across the lake, the trees blend into one another, there are trunks where the canopy ought to be, and vice versa. I look to the opposite shore of the lake and expect to see a moose at any moment. Everything here is bathed in a golden, peaceful light.

6:00 PM - Soon after we begin hiking down the main trail, I realize I am not enjoying the trek. I feel like I am in a storybook but I have no control over the ending of the tale. The trees and on either side of me quiver and emit emerald vapors, crowding my vision. The Flaming Lips song It Overtakes Me comes to mind. I hum it for a while and it boosts my morale, but claustrophobia sets in when I notice how narrow the path is. Furthermore, I realize that every step I take I will have to retrace on the way back, since there is not enough daylight left to make the full loop around the lake.

As it turns out, I am not the only one with qualms about this hike. Everyone seems to be expressing their dislike for heading deeper into the woods, and were all tripping so hard were having great difficulty communicating simple sentences to one another. With great difficulty, I suggest we agree on a time to turn back, and we settle on 7:00 PM.

We continue moving forward. The group is talking incessantly, and to me it sounds like a bunch of shouts and screams. Then I realize that everyone really is shouting and screaming. I can feel a headache coming on, and Im starting to sweat. The mosquitoes are relentless. All I want is to turn back and get out of these damned woods, but I know that breaking our groups unity will only make things worse. 

The yelling escalates and so does my headache. There is still a great deal of disagreement about what to do. Should we leave the woods or continue hiking? All I know is that the chaos and confusion are mounting, and the trees are making me feel claustrophobic. Our group cant make it fifty feet without stopping, splitting up, and going bonkers. At one point, Liam leaps off the path and perches himself on a rock. Another time, wanders off to find a tree he can climb. Further along, Jamie runs ahead on the trail and I fear she is lost. Steve is relatively silent the whole time, but I can tell hes tripping just as hard as I am. The shouting continues and my head throbs. I sense that Im teetering on the edge of a bad trip, and I pray I dont start to panic. I am about to consider ditching everyone and getting the hell out of the woods, when somehow we come to a unanimous decision. We will turn around and head back. Hallelujah.

7:00 PM - We had probably only traveled a hundred yards in the span of an hour. Thankfully, going back is much quicker than going forward. My bad mood dissolves within moments, and I cheer up with every step I take. Liam and I walk ahead of the other three and express our relief at overcoming such a trying situation. I comment on how dynamic the trip has been, and resolve to think twice before going for another hike on LSD.

We return to the lake, and I am overcome with the same sense of peace and security as when I was first there. We relax and eat some food. I have some difficulty bringing myself to bite into an apple, it looks much more appealing whole. Eventually, though, I take a bite out of it, and Im amazed at how carnivorous I feel. Words like consume and devour play through my mind. I feel like I am killing the apple, like I am tearing it apart, but I dont feel any sympathy for it (which is good, because I am very hungry).

When Im through, I toss the apple into the lake and read the first page of a book Steve brought along. I have a hard time doing so, because the words are moving too much for me to focus on them. I put the book down and take out a Magic Eye book. The images are astounding. Liam finds them hilarious, and laughs until he cries. Rene wants to order a pizza. Steve is fascinated by tiny holes in the log upon which we are sitting. Jamie squeals in lysergic bliss.

7:30 PM - At last, we pack up and head back to Steves house. On the way out of the woods, we pass a small group of kids about our age. Only a few minutes ago, I had jokingly asked my friends, Whats the proper etiquette if you pass another hiker and youre on acid? I greet the kids, but my words feel empty and awkward. None of us speaks for a minute after passing the other group, then, when we are out of earshot, all of us burst out laughing. I hope I dont have to encounter any more strangers.

Upon reaching the road, I spot the yellow lily I had placed on the side of the pavement. A frown crosses my face when I see its been flattened.

The rest of the walk is great. Now that were out of the woods entirely, my mood elevates considerably. I feel much more sociable, and there is much laughter among my companions and I. At one point, I spot a tractor ahead, coming towards us down the street, except in my current state I cannot tell that its a tractor. In fact, I have no idea what it is, just like what happened to me earlier with the locusts. My brain seems to be trying simultaneously to classify the red machine as a robot, ostrich, and police officer. Though the tractor is many yards ahead, I cower until it turns off the road.

A friend of ours calls one of our phones to see how were doing. I have great difficulty using a phone, so I give up and hand it to someone else.

At a four-way intersection, the unthinkable happens. A man stops his car next to us and politely asks for directions. We stare blankly at him, our jaws hanging. The mans face is horribly disfigured. A few of us snicker. I try to take control of the situation and blurt out, Uh, Im sorry, Im not from around here. My voice sounds thin, awkward, and childlike. He waves in response, says Thanks anyway, and drives away. Well, most of him drives away. While his car and body speed forward down the road, his head reminds behind, suspended in midair, transparent and still dreadfully disproportionate. I blink, and then the head seems to realize it has been left behind and whizzes to catch up with its body.

The remainder of the walk back to Steves, while relatively uneventful, is full of beauty and companionship. I take in the full splendor of the countryside and we watch the sun on its descent to the horizon.

8:15 - We arrive back at Steves just as the daylight is beginning to decline. A realm of new possibilities opens, and suddenly there is so much to do. Weve been tripping for about four hours now, and I want to make the best of the time I have left.

For the next hour or two, the five of us listen to music (primarily Jaco Pastorius self-titled album), relax in Steves hot tub, and sit on his back porch admiring nature. At one point, after smoking a Djarum, Steve turns pale and becomes ill. Though I know it isnt his fault, his nausea and general feelings of sickness bring my mood down tremendously. For a while, I develop a new sensitivity to other persons voices, and I find myself seeking solitude. Eventually, Steve vomits and feels much better. After that, my good mood returns and my irritability vanishes.

I recall what a friend of mine had advised me to do if I take LSD. He suggested I lock myself in a bathroom and turn out the lights, promising me that I would be transported. I follow his advice. Hes right, as soon as the lights go out, the bathroom walls jettison away and I find myself on a vast, cold, empty plane surrounded by robots breathing heavily in my ears. Spirals and waves of spheres and colors fly around my vision, and I can make out prehistoric creatures roaming about in the distance. I emerge from the bathroom minutes later in a state of profound awe. I urge my friends to try what Ive just experienced. They do, and theyre all amazed.

9:30 - Rene has been pestering us for almost an hour to invite two of our other friends to join us. Initially, all of us are opposed to the idea, as we had agreed earlier to limit the number of people to five. As time goes by, though, Renes insistence becomes unbearable and we agree to hang out with our other friends Tom and Seth. They arrive stoned out of their minds, and their arrival brings about a more sociable atmosphere.

For the rest of the night, as the trip mellows out, we sit around Steves table on his patio and smoke cigars, drink a beer or two (no one gets drunk), and engage in good conversation. We go for walks and talk about the day, sharing our experiences and introspections.

12:00 - I turn twenty years old. The seven of us celebrate by smoking two bowls of sour diesel. With the exceptions of Tom and Seth, who didnt take LSD, all of our trips are boosted significantly. We freestyle, experiment with words and phrases, and dance around to Snooks Eaglin.

2:30 - Were inside now, making food and listening to music. We lounge around Steves great room in darkness and listen to the entirety of Dark Side of the Moon. Boards of Canada, Incubus, and the Grateful Dead also find their way into our ears. To conclude the night, we watch Disneys Fantasia.

Around 4:00 in the morning, the true enormity of the trip settles in, and I conclude without a trace of doubt that today I had the most intense experience of my entire life. And, now that my mind has finally slowed down enough, I close my eyes and fall asleep next to Jamie.

(blotter / tab)





BODY WEIGHT:
69 kg





Setting: An outdoor dance party on top of a hill, about an hour away from home.

People: Two close friends, also on substances (not LSD) Friendly ravers, hippies who were also very friendly.

The rave I attended (Stardust) was known for it's friendly people, tending to be under the influence of substances. Just about everyone there was on substances, whether it be mushrooms, LSD, BZP pills or whatever, Everyone was a mess. A good, friendly, natural mess.

(T+0:00) Approximately 9:30pm. Ate my apricot I had obtained the day before. It was tried, and the friend I had obtained it from had stated he had it in his car for a week.

(Please note: I am experienced with LSD myself, and have dosed several times, with various blotters consumed of different potentcy levels)

(T+00:45) I felt the gradual up-coming I had previously experienced on LSD. I felt very happy, as it had been a while since I had taken a trip, and was feeling quite good about it. The night before, I had little sleep though, as the same two friends that are attending this rave with me and I had taken a prescription drug by the name of DHC (Not 100% sure on this), and spent most the night awake in hysterical laughter.

(T+01:30) (Note, after this, complete loss of time co-ordination) I was feeling the trip, and very intensely. I had never had acid like this, I felt very good though, and was laughing at everything. One of my friends and I had ventured to the 'Chill-out Tent' and sat in there for a while, laughing our ass off at the funny patterns on the floor, the people around us talking about what seemed completely stupid, yet they were probably in the same state of mind as us. When they dimmed the light in this tent, we proceeded to leave as quickly as possible. We greeted our other friend who was still in the car. He was querying over the fact that a parked car with it's hazard lights on near us was not in fact a car, it was a spaceship. All three of us came to the general conclusion it was a spaceship, as near it we saw several people walk past with glow-sticks covering their body. This was a very laughing matter to us, as it concluded how fucked up we really were. We decided to venture to the other musical zones at the rave, as the drum and bass stage was only playing shitty breaks music, which none of us enjoyed. 

We made it to the psytrance zone. We sat on a fence, and laughed at the what we called 'Mushroom Heads' who were attempting to dance to psytrance, but looked more like they were just swinging their arms slowly. Usually, I enjoy psytrance when I am sober, but the state of mind I was in, I would rather of taken the piss out of everything and anything not related to drum and bass.

At one point of the night, stupidly, my friend Pat spent $5 of my friends money on a glowstick. Alan and I were EXTREMELY hungry, so I thought as a joke to attempt to refund the glowstick to the mini-shop they had set up at the rave. I went to the shop and promptly stated: 'Yeah, Hi, Ahh, My friend took a shitload of acid, and hes fucking out, and he kinda took my wallet and spent my last $5 on buying this glowstick which I really dont want, and the money was to buy my tea.' The lady running the stall was so wasted herself she actually refunded it. I hadn't laughed so hard for ages, this was so funny to me.

At around midnight, we heard the breaks DJ come off, and a mile of clapping. I was un-sure if this was appreciaton that the DJ did a good set, or more the fact that all the drum and bass fiends were stoked he was leaving and a decent DJ came on. I ran full speed to the dancefloor, so I wasn't to miss the openeing track. Lucky I did.

Subfocus - Special Place

Oh what a track. How brilliant. What more of an intro to a drum and bass set than...

'Most of us have a special place we like to visit, because we actually feel good being there. What we hear in that place, has alot to do with it. If the sounds are soothing, our muscles relax, our pulse rate drops. We feel at peace. All too often though, when we listen to great music, we settle for sound thats only... average. What music needs, is full deep bass to give it warmth.'

This made my night. This one track opening the set. I loved the track since Ram Records released it. A brilliant job, I knew this DJ was going to be hot.

After an hour or so of good dancing with some other friends from another town I had met to great songs I knew very well (that always makes my night) I ventured back to the car, thinking I was hovering over the long wet grass, as I could not see my feet moving beneath it.

We decided to go for a drive. Usually, I don't drive at all. I don't have my license, or anything. I can't drive a manual at all. Until tonight. What thought overcame my two friends to actually let me drive his manual car, on acid, up a very dangerous gravel road with a cliff on one side. This was one of the most fun experiences of my life.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

We drove every now and then for the rest of the night, sometimes with me standing on the roof. Even though we were only moving at around 10kph, I still knew this was a silly and immature idea, but it was still amazingly fun. My friend at one stage also lost my ipod in the middle of a massive grass paddock, and then found it (Don't ask me how). I proceeded to drive back to the rave, steering the car with my teeth. We laughed at how stupid this was, yet fun.

But anyway, back at the rave, my friend Pat (He was on BZP himself) decided he wasnt leaving the car, so we left him there. I persuaded my other friend (Alan) to join me on the dance-floor, and after much persuasion, he joined me. At this stage, I was having very vivd hallucinations, and hysterical laughter followed every stupid story I told.

The laser light on the dance floor was amazing, and my friend Alan, opposite to what he thought, was having the time of his life. He couldn't stop dancing, like myself. We danced for hours.

Daylight came, and the music stopped. The DJ walked out and shook my hand, and asked my name. He said he was amazed at my stamina to dance for so long. I was myself also. I am a smoker, and half the time was dancing with a cigarette in my hand. The comments from fellow raved made me feel very good about myself like: 'Woah, these kids are insane! Look at those two!' and 'Fuck, I wish I could dance like that'. I was a very happy chappy.

After this, we drove home, and prompted to sleep. I woke up at 7am on monday morning, ready for school, feeling good about myself and refreshed. Great acid, great raves, and great people surrounding me. A good weekend indeed.

This is on acid. 

Vibrating. 

Shifting.

Waiting for something,


I have to write.

Im trying to leave this for your records.

There is a lot of chaos. 

____ 


Translation and reflection into the morning. 

Im still seeing the sickly glow. Im ignoring the ache telling me to stop this writing. Its a ball of insecurities and personal inhibitions. A monster whispering I am just going to fail and fail. This is getting me no where. This is all hopeless and fruitless. 

We dropped acid, Friday, October 31st, Halloween. Did nothing all that day, doting and floating around, adrift, avoiding that meaningful place, although, I found it for a moment, peddling and paddling on a iphone, determined to finish a simple ball and hole game I felt had accumulated the existence of life in one simple meaningful truth; persevere. 

There is an understanding I have with the universe now. There are users and there are sobers. I seem to have found an identity with being a user. But just like a religion, Im picking and choosing of the culture what I actually want to integrate. 

Its my personal interpretation. And Ive finally realized that is ok. Sacrificing my health and time for a larger purpose; contributing my small part in driving to the answer well never get to. But its all about the journey. 

Breaking out of that ugliness I see in my physical self. Thats what this night has been trying to drive to. Breaking free, waiting and running into a loop. 

I need to try harder to record concrete events. All of my thoughts and disconnected from any form of driving events. 

Yes, yes, I agree. I am most likely going to turn into a user, but it makes sense. Its the truth I was trying to hide from, but something I knew was going to inevitably occur. 

The start of the rest of my life? That started a long time ago. Im just punching in the time card. 

I found a new place, Im not sure if I want to come back. It seems as if I can perpetually run from this space, at least I can write from here. I just have to lock in this frame of mind; where it really doesnt matter, and thats the truth. And so we ask this fundamental question; why the hell not?

Ok, so at first, it was extremely uncomfortable. I wasnt sure what to expect. Just mainly hallucinating, bazaar visuals, and goofy tripping for a long set of hours, ticking away. Didnt realize the sudden enveloping, quickening suffocation of psychological babble that would soon ensue. I was hesitant to make the jump. I was already on the boat and I could see the land, and near enough to jump off and swim to the shore, but the water was wet and cold and I was going to ride out the tide. 

The first thing I noticed, my cheeks were burning and throbbing. My first realization: I smile too much. I smile too much to please, only because I knew my face was most attractive when I smiled. It was always for other people and the muscles in my face were pumped full of the guilt of it. I kept pressing it in, trying to force my expression into seriousness. Throughout my journey, there was an ache to try and take it seriously, but that grip on reality was elusive, beyond capturing. I entered into a phase of just chasing, like a dog fascinated by his tail. The evening was just small circles, pooling in and out. 

I was quickly becoming aware of people. This is like the process of writing and recording a dream Ive only just woken up from and now Im trying to interpret and recall the details. We were hovering on the porch, inside in the living room, up into the acid lounge. Lacy dressed as something humorous, as Shake from ATHF. It was cute, and I began to intently focus on her as a person. I was acknowledging my interest and attraction to her. I was feeling as if I was studying her in the same light as I feel like E studies me sometimes. The feeling that was the exact thing that I was trying to capture into the group, yet simultaneously trying to desperately escape from. Unsettling. I grew self-conscious, I hope I wasnt making her uncomfortable. Well, I had the excuse, I was on acid. 

We had followed a group down to a party, or to the house of where a party might be taking place. It was dead, but we had such a large group, we were our own small insta-party. I went in and Lacy and I danced in circles, I blew bubbles. There was a particular collage on one of the walls. They looked like childrens drawings, but had clearly been contrived by intelligence too far matured to truly try and capture the child-like mind process behind the construction of a work of art. We can only remember and pretend. 

This night was just one of remembering, all of my memories compressing and folding to the existence I was, the being that was following this aimless string like path into the mountains. 

I knew if I looked at a picture for too long, it would change, tremblingly hopefully into the third dimension, curious and unsuccessful except within my own imagination. Everything was vibrating anyway, and it was only accentuated in matter of visual representation, mostly artwork. I could see each layer of the drawing filtering and flittering in and out. The way I had felt on the serge of a pot wave, being stoned beyond my capacity to accept this existence. This was just less fuzzy, and yet more subtle. But the funny aesthetics were not something I was intent on focusing on, so they were quickly ignored and lost, or overlooked. There were visual, residual memories from other drug induced experiences, ghosting in and out, reminding, like physical sensational memories.

I recall looking at my iphone, the icons were shifting and shaking and there was a sticky pressure gently tugging at my irises. I couldnt focus on the screen; lines were floating disconnected like refrigerator magnet poetry. Writing on my laptop wasnt meant to happen. It was probably going to distract me from the experience anyway, so I feel like it was telling me, coaching me along to another place, another fragile frame of mind that is so easily influenced by the outside environment. 

What next? We were walking, we could have just kept walking. Lacy was distracting. Im going to be using that term a lot, because every moment was hung on trying to escape it. This is going to be jarred and unlinear, but this is the only available method I have at this time. We were sitting in the front. Lacy struck me as so peculiar to watch. Adorable in her simple cute childlike manor, charming in her catlike apathy and indifference, yet still fundamentally insecure, struggling inside, turbulent just as the rest of us. Unsure, moment by moment, perspectives changing and rearranging; only following confirmed acknowledgements, we have agreed to carry day to day. 

There is much we tend to carry; burdens weve compiled on ourselves, unknowingly, perversely. 

She was yelling out at people. I was wondering how her thoughts were being constructed inside of her head. What were the accumulative little decisions she was making motivating each of her small behaviors. What was the process behind yelling out at people, sitting in the middle of the lawn, looking at strange objects, belching randomly, swaying around, shortly clinging and unclinging when self realized that she had been clinging. For fun, for herself, for attention, for that personality she had constructed and was extroverting? It was amusing and strange to watch her, and yet try and interact with her. In fact all human interaction was becoming bizarrely trivial and meaningless and unsettling. When I started to feel the burn and drive to be by myself, I wasnt sure, but it quickly consumed the rest of my trip. 

There was a swing, and I sat there with her for a small eternity, in simple fluffy bliss and infatuated euphoria. She laughed and swung and swayed in that alluring childish way that Ive learned to love, and I was happy to be sharing this existence with her in that significant moment; watching other costumed creatures haunt and stalk the streets in search of a buzz, a peak, and serge. All waiting and wanting and pushing to chaos under the black moon, a sliver in the sky. 

It was warm most of the night, mostly hot, thick like sweat in the air. There was a rock in the ground shaped like a heart. I had seen it before I thought, I had been in this moment before, but it was the optical illusion of the circular spinning motion of the drug, of all the  times my perception has been altered and shifted away and into else. An else mangled with nostalgia and déjà vu, the keys into understanding the current of life itself. A place I manage to explore each time these doors are opened, and information overflows, streaming through me like static electricity. She pointed the rock out and said This is how I feel about you M.J. I heart you. I wasnt sure what she exactly meant. I wondered and doubted whether or not she meant it the way I suddenly felt it reflecting toward her. I heart you too Lacy. Metaphorically and literally. I lingered around her as much as I could that night. I wish she had been with me, but I also understood that it was probably better that she eventually fade into the other bedlam of festive activities magnetically pulling people in, in relation to location and susceptibility. Im not sure if she had the greatest Halloween. She seemed greatly disappointed in something, reflecting that into herself. 

On that seat, swinging from the arms of blacked out trees and missing stars, I was content to linger there, stuck and numb in between. Looking back, I felt like the sky was full of missing teeth, pulled loose from the toxic light pollution, inevitable evidence of our clotting of the mother stream. 

Where was the decision to move? To go back to Arrakis, our base, our home ground; the place we were investing our hopes of security and enclosement from the outside sobers, and yet the chaos outside invaded and raped our surroundings until there was no small corner left to escape. I had the blinding itch to escape, to be away. 

We were back. They were watching Fear and Loathing in Los Vegas on the television. My time had suddenly become finite and precious. I wanted to find quality things to spend it on, and loosing myself in a movie wasnt exactly what I had been searching for, although, now I realize how important that movie is soon to become to me. I was sitting in the corner of the couch. Lacy was sitting there with me momentarily, but left in an effort to redirect her energies to what she was meaning to do for the night. It was still early. I could hardly believe it had only been a few hours. What was I waiting for? I was nervous and anxious. Tightly winding up my springs inside, not sure of the involuntary motions that would shortly ensue, but aware that it would be something in the shape of a toy music monkey clapping and snapping cymbals like a clown. 

Moments were being lost, anxiety, unable to stay still unless sitting, and even then relentless questioning of where and when and why I should be sitting. I kept making a motion to move and halfway going and suddenly stopping, going back. Hesitant to actually do anything. What actually needs to be done anyhow? The same messages repeated over and over again, I needed it not to matter, so I could be set to work, there was work to be done, and I had to find it by myself. 

In that constant fluid of wondering and waiting, there was a moment I grew incredibly constricted with my costume. I had made up my mind to change, but it seemed to take extraneous effort to move there, to get to my room. It took several hours, picking up on different distractions. Things were occurring all around me. I was thinking too much, studying too much. People were too peculiar. This thought process had been borrowed from a memory before. I had located it and installed it into my mind, like changing out the filter in a lens, so I could just dwell and explore. I felt like I had the freedom to explore, explore this issue that I could not construct into meaningful words, a loose concept I couldnt tie down. It was the answer. I was glimmering full faced into the truth. I understood that it was fleeting and momentary. That I would never be able to capture it completely into words, and yet it would stay with my and perpetually drive me to try. I would never really get it, the epiphany I was expecting really didnt exist. I kept running over in my mind, waiting, waiting for the inevitable. 

Outside of myself, but yet still only of myself. I grew weary and annoyed that I was exploring that same loops and circles I was always. I suddenly realize it was one of the things holding me back. It seemed so easy to dismiss it then, but when I tried, I realized how little control I actually had over it. Outside. How else can I really express it? The sensation of flatness and material time vibrating this existence I had during an earlier ripe high, was clearer here. I failed then to gather the words I wanted to use. I feel like I have to carefully sketch it out, filling in the space gradually. Human interaction was warped and twisted. I was finding it hard to naturally predict reactions, a method I used unconsciously everyday modulating and altering how I choose to behave. It made little sense to me then, I was questioning everyones motivation. I was concentrating on trying to enter their mind, trying to perceive their reflection of the event we were all witnessing. 

The circle was shrinking. Object permeance was a nuisance, so it was quickly discarded. I only needed to acknowledge what I could see presently around me. What existence was occurring outside of this space mattered little to me. I was here, existing here. I was choosing and controlling, or at least under the illusion of control; trying to influence the environment around me, constructing until I felt comfortable, yet never reaching that security. I was thrown out to sea now, there was no going back. 

I was liberated; there was nothing I absolutely had to do. I could do whatever I wanted. But then what? I struggled to shake that lingering nag that I was being irresponsible, spinning out of control, loosing my self in a world of mind altering drug trips that I would never recover from. It was permanently damaging. What was I doing to my body?  I asked myself this several times.

Clothes, I was in my room, I had decided to change. Charles was with me, he had agreed to take me downstairs and stand outside my door while I changed. I was looking for his camera. I was wanting to find a means to record the night, it was important to me to find other means of post marking passing though this particular bent slice and section in time, memory proved repeatedly unreliable. I couldnt capture all of it, I knew, I would have to accept that most would be lost and washed away. All of it sensory, short-term, long term connections decaying. 

He took my hand and we left downstairs. There were a few things distracting me. I was nervous and pacing, my feet refused to stay still, legs stretching up like a cats. Somehow we made it to my room. I lingered there; waddling in all of my wasteful material things I had condition to be a part of my identity. This was where I existed, and moved, and breathed and was. A place I had complete control to move, to change. I was suddenly tied down and suffocating underneath the weight of it, tired of the sight of having seen and worn and worked and handled so many of the same things, tediously everyday. Savagely trying to contain it, balancing it like a tottering ball of garbage on the small point of a tumbling incline. Why were these things important to me? Why did I have so many things? I had to fight the idea of cleaning it out, burning it all down, fully de-toxing the soul of this consumer junk I kept accumulating. I knew that would take up the rest of the night, and would be a waste and regret in the morning. These things werent really me, why was I trying to define myself against them. They were a poor representation, something I was trying to construct just for the sake of others to see. 

I ran in circles about clothes. Nothing satisfied me or pulled my attention to wear. This was a purely arbitrary task, something easily and effortlessness done in everyday. But I was nowhere near everyday. I had been pushed into something else. This was a different world, it had just been reconstructed, just as on salvia, clipped and cut up and turned upside down. The world was inside and out, and I could imagine feeling up the seems. I was extending my motion in time from beginning to end and all I could feel was from the time I ate and to the time I knew would soon arrive, but was unsure how or when. It was separate, unworldly, inconsistent and in a dream. 

People began to crowd, following in curiosity, I felt guilty having strung these people along. Why were they here? They werent just for me; I had to force myself to realize this. They werent here for me, they were wondering around just like me, locked inside their own heads. Lost souls communicating, trying to reach out and understand. I realize now how far removed from consistent reality I was. It was my vanity speaking to me, I was plagued by the pressing responsibility of the feeling that I had to entertain all of them somehow, bring out the person they came to see, to perform. It was vain to think they had come to see me, that they were focused on me; they were only focused on themselves, just like I was. Different perspectives were fighting a brutal war in my head. It was self-absorbed to think that just I was lending them some sense of meaning I was finding from my own point of view. I refused to let myself try and be a magnet. I was just driven to want to be alone, relinquishing and rebuking attention. I was wanting to get rid of it together. Attention, but the more I fought getting it, the more I seemed to make as if I wanted it, and the more I seemed to get. It was an anti-pull to my push. It was increasingly difficult to try and find myself alone. I shut my closet, and listened until they left. There was a small relief, yet, sullen in confirmation from another looped and repeated realization, they were not here for me, I was here for me; they were there for themselves and only themselves. I took up very little space in their minds, I was a fleeting tracer, briefly illuminating their landscape, distraction, introspection, and I was gone. They were making small notes of me, just as I was making of small note of them, all in relation to themselves. I was alone. It hit me hard and true. I had already known, it wasnt anything new, but under the veil of this crazed insane drug, it was making itself blindingly aware. Alone, but I was there, comfortably alone. 

I finally used the bathroom, something normal on all accounts, silly to think procedural. A normal habitual act. I finished and went to the sink to wash my hands, and then looked up into the mirror. Well, there I was looking back at myself. There I was. Suddenly it gripped me. I needed t be alone. I had to be alone with this person I saw there in the mirror. Was I feeding my pet vanity? Had it become some beast, conscious and looming and disconnecting from myself? There was the me that I saw normally. Ugly and flawed and loosing control. I looked at myself and said Where have you taken us now Jennifer? Smiling, eyes deforming into slits. Laughing nervously at some small joke to myself. The sensation and running argument I had been churning in the back of my brain about intolerance of personal ticks washed in for a moment and briefly washed out again. It was funny to be talking to myself in the mirror. I had done it before. For a brief moment I wondered if other people also shared this private habit of acknowledging themselves in the mirror. But my attention quickly shifted again and then it wasnt me speaking in the mirror. It was wearing my face and using my expressions, but the sheer joking act of referring to myself in third person had summoned something. 

It was in the eyes, glimmering like soundless music. I could see it there, intelligence beyond and separate of my own, devising working from the shadows. It was something I had been numbly aware of throughout the passage of time. It had lingered there like white noise. In the background all along running as consistent as I. Then there was a sharp awareness, like noticing a trivial detail that had always been hidden in the obvious. There it was; I was bringing attention to it. 

It was she. I had acknowledged her before. I had played pretend with the idea, wrote about her, imagining her there in those moments so lonely and lost, they rose to the brink of overpowering consumption. She would squeeze my waist as I glided on my scooter into the dark some chilled solitary nights, and whisper in my ear the words I heard rarely meaningfully from anyone, I love you. No matter what you do, I will always be here, I will always love you. It was just a fantasy. Short and simple and private. It was for me, just me alone. Something to compensate for the disassociation of the social world I grew and fed and burned forward while in my isolation. It seemed silly, but it was only for me. No one else was ever to know. I forgot about her quickly, when other detracting social opportunities finally and forcefully opened. 

But there she was now. Looking strait into me and through me, like I was transparent. Now I understood what Luke had meant when he told me that every once in a while, he caught a glimpse of a person, intelligent and fierce, that scared the shit out of him. That person could see right through him, right into his core, seeing him ugly and exposed, beyond his carefully constructed fronts meant to cover his darker truths. He tried to drive that person out of me once; he wanted me to answer his questions. He wanted the hard and true reality, what I truly and exactly saw of him, unbent by polite and conventional reservations. I knew what I saw; I could see his blemishes as clear as the spread of acne infecting the entire area of his face. It was there, his motivations, drivers and reasoning, buried under a turbulent push and pull of frustration and giving in. But I couldnt pull it out of me, I couldnt form it into words and articulate it into constructive meaningful criticism. I was also held back by the urge not to acknowledge that I knew, to hide that I had this kind of sight. I was telling myself that it was just a wish, that I couldnt give into the wish because it wasnt real. I also wanted to keep him ignorant. If there was some gift in me as he described, he didnt deserve access to it. It was easier to make people underestimate you, and so his comment was interpreted as pointless flattery I shouldnt let get to my head. 

Yet, as I stood looking there, strait into the mirror, locked pupils gazing, a fear gripped my stomach like a cold hand. I was afraid of that person there looking back at me. I suddenly felt a raging serge of an instant collection of emotions I had directed toward myself overtime. I hated and loved myself equally. My expressions were changing involuntarily. I wasnt entirely sure I was controlling the face I was seeing front of me. She was rising and falling, emerging in and out. I could tell when it was her and it was me. When I saw just me, my face was ugly, but when she was there, she was beautiful, a goddess. 

I was starting to feel guilty for being vain enough to think that I was beautiful. Who was I to think I was beautiful. That was for other people to decide. I couldnt change this face, I was born stuck solid in the jelly of my genetic cesspool. Yet, here in the mirror, when I tilted ever so slightly, when I looked in too closely, I was amazed to find that my the way I saw my face was morphing and changing. As if the physical features where actually shifting subtly, slightly, just enough to look different. I recall distinctly watching the bridge of my nose shrink and dilate, from just enough to be hideous to just enough to be perfect. It was almost like the way pictures would sometimes slightly moved when I looked too hard at them. Especially the eyes. When I could I beheld her, I held her there, and she smiled at me, teasingly, knowingly. 

My face was sickly, and had that pale green electrical glow, that I later associated with what I thought the soul might look like, or the process of thought and mood changing. It covered my entire face like bad makeup. I hate your nails. And I hate your hair. she said. I know, me too. I laughed nervously. Thats ok though, she replied. I knew what she meant, it wasnt insulting, it was the truth. You know who I am, she said, Ive been here all along, dont you remember? 

I had confronted this issue earlier, outside of any drug, just through daily observations. I looked at myself in the mirror too much. Not because I thought I was beautiful, perhaps if I thought that, there would be no need for mirrors. So then quite the opposite; I was constantly looking at myself out of a vacuum-like necessity for reassurance. It was like an inner black hole suffocating any buildup of self security I had built up for myself. The effort was futile. But I had been doing this for a long time now, not really recognizing it until I understood it didnt quite fit into the social norm. Perhaps it does, perhaps everyone or at least a lot of people have a predilection for mirrors, but on the surface skin of customary expectations, vanity, or the image of vanity is frowned upon. Yet, was this vanity? 

How many hours had I spent here, locked up in my bathroom? Countless unnecessary hours. A little child, discovering mirrors, thereby discovering myself. There was a big shower mirror door next to the toilet. I was recalling sitting down and being quickly distracted by my reflection. Was I enamored? Im not sure. I just remember being completely fascinated and held in captivity. Watching as I run my little hands over my flesh, watching while simultaneously feeling what it looked like to feel from outside myself, in a reflection. Seeing my body there, acknowledging it, trying to understand it. What a peculiar habit I now realize. More often then not, I would linger in there, and eventually I would start to peel off my clothes. I would stare at myself, there in the mirror for perhaps hours, I wasnt sure. What was I looking for? Why had I felt the drive to behave that way? A lack of social conditioning? The apparent sinful neglect of my parents? Why was I driven to be isolated alone, locked away in the bathroom, stark naked staring at myself, still in the bloom of innocence? Why did that habit linger, private and unannounced to myself until now? It was something I simply did, something that if I imagined being exposed would bring down a destructive wave of shame and embarrassment. It was exactly like masturbating. I felt guilty for it. And yet, now it made sense. Now it all came together and it was demanding that I give a name to it, demanding my sole undivided attention. 

It bothered me though; it was distracting and consuming my time. It made me aggravated and highly strung. I spent so much time on it, looking at myself, trying to readjust, readjust, readjust, getting no where differently. I still do it, every time I catch glimpse in passing, I get an uncontrollable urge to linger and look. I do and minutes upon minutes are spent dawdling in the mirror. Such wasted time! Its like entering a daydream state, its difficult to break out of it, to startle myself awake, become self aware that I have been looking at myself. Its vanity, inappropriate unhealthy vanity. 

It was disturbing to me. Was it because I was on acid? Can I use this as an excuse? I looked at myself, there tripping intensely, rumbling inside like an earthquake, and she said, You do know Im in love with you. I laughed and acted nervous. It was silly, and yet, there was something there. I was in love with myself? How is that possible? But it made sense, somehow, in my extraordinarily demented frame of mind. Sometimes I have felt magnetic, involuntarily magnetic, attracting and pulling and a leading around. Not intentionally, but suddenly, like in the moments I realize Im daydreaming, I become frightfully aware of the effect I have on people. Im making it up, Im making it to be more than it is, I cant acknowledge something like that.

I suddenly realized, I had been talking to myself all these years, as long as I could remember, as long as I could study those big brown lucid eyes staring back at me. I found her. I had known all along she was there, I just hadnt realized. 

Panic and uncertainty. This was big, at least to me. I was trying to tune out all the small voices putting what I emphasize as meaningful into perspective. I was trying to fervently disconnect myself from the pressure of peoples judgments. It was tedious, laborious, a choir to keep trying maintain an opinion of existence, or of common situations, or cordiality and mannerisms and proper habits, concurrent with everyone elses. I no longer wanted to think along the same zone as everyone else. I just wanted this to matter to me, and to me this was immense, this was something worth exploring. The prospect of a split personality. I could almost feel that layer of myself dividing like the peeling of sunburned skin. I knew that if I had talked to anyone else about it, they would think I was being silly. It was silly, I wasnt crazy. I was normal, I kept insisting it. And yet, well, I was on acid! As I had so vehemently exclaimed over and over again, to all the sobers drifting and swarming like wasps around me, ready to drain this experience away like vampires. It was strange to be surrounded by so many not nearly anywhere where I was, I was in the else and they were outside, out there, invading my circle. I had to get away from them. I had to escape.  

What was I doing? I was liberated. I had this entire night; I could do whatever I damn well pleased. It was mine and mine alone. What did it matter? At this point, my perspective on the personal relationships I had built around me had radically altered. Everyone I knew was binding me, holding my taught, stringing me along. It wasnt important, they werent important any longer to me. I could live forever without anyone; I was completely content in being alone. 

I suddenly realized that someone might be checking on me, someone might be listening. What if they had caught that I was talking to myself? What if they had heard what I was saying? The thought stuffed my lungs, it was suffocating. I had to be released from any prospective or accidental observers, from any type of opinion. I had to protect my self from their opinions. It would spoil everything if they learned. It would ruin the whole bit. I would never be able to get back to that place if they found me now. 

Good old Garrett. I was still questioning why he was here. Just as friends? Did he have some kind of crush on me? I didnt actually know him all that well. There was something odd about him. Something small and buried. Was he getting a kick out of this? Was he just lingering around just to fuck around with us? Was he doing this to look like a nice guy? What was he expecting in return for this? I could feel the wheels turning in his head, wondering why he had done this, if there was actually anything going to happen with this chick, who the fuck was she, did he like her? Did she actually like him, or was it platonic? Was she just using him? Insecurity rumbled in him like an empty stomach, but it was masked so well with a well developed sense of humor, the greatest self defense mechanism. There was something deeper there, but I couldnt reach into it, it was beyond what I could actually imagine, but I was finally getting to the point where I was able to feel the dwindling shifts in consciousness incurably asking and asking, the meat behind the mask. The part of me that was of myself, that I interjected everyone had also. The moment by moment gentle and subtle changes in perspective. I was at first only able to hear my own internal dialog, but here, on this plane of divine and cosmic understanding, I was able to hear it clinking around in other skulls like loose coins. I had to stop thinking about it. I really didnt care. I didnt care about any of these petty friendships. It struck me that it was odd that I was devoting so much time in developing them, wasting energy and effort and precious time. It wasnt what mattered. What mattered most then was this person I had discovered, this creature I wanted to get to know, to talk to further. What was it? I was bewildered and vibrating with a concept, the concept of you. 

I had to escape Garrett. I wanted him to watch everyone else, to let me alone and be by myself.  He watched me as I shifted around, fluttering like a dying butterfly, sticking and stuck. I was nervous about these dratted nails I told him. I hated them. He seemed to smile at them. They made me fell he implemented fake? Yes, fake. And youre not fake, he said. I wasnt sure what he meant, honestly or sarcastically. I just marched away, saying at least I hope Im not fake. I wanted to clip them at first. I rummaged around, getting riled up over how much junk I owned. This is where I spend my mornings, every morning, here I am, using all these useless things. Why do I have so many useless things? Why do I need all these things? I finally found them. Aha! I walked over to the door where he was casually leaning and watching me. I didnt like his watching. Why was he watching me, what was he taking notes on? I surrendered to the idea that they were just more or less notes in relation to himself, because that is the way all people think, and so it mattered little to me again. I may need your help with theses. I could almost feel the relief, like breaking the nut of a shell. My cuticles were taking off their sweaters. I held them against my thumb nail and as I looked at the nail, the white tip was slipping down into the red. I wasnt going to cut them right like this. I wasnt going to let Garrett cut them off either. That was invading, Id have to let him touch my hands. Oh, and then I realized, I had come up with a solution earlier. I was going to find some gloves. I ran into my closet, I was asking Garrett something to get him away from observing me. I was asking something about himself, I wasnt actually listening to what he was saying, it didnt matter, I just pretended to sound interested. His relationship to me was inconsequential. These people were just there. They didnt matter. They had become like shadows and ghosts, phantoms in the wallpaper.

I didnt have my camera. My phone was unworthy and distracting and I wanted to be released from my obligation of keeping on touch with the outside world. The worth of the outside world was gradually disintegrating. We were somewhere, we were in else. But it was absolutely imperative that I find some means of recording this. Writing had proved nearly impossible. The keys were swishing around on the key board and the words werent forming fast enough in my head for me to write them down. My thoughts were scattered like loose leaf paper. I felt terrible that I had nothing meaningful to say. I couldnt decide what I wanted to write anyway and my laptop became dysfunctional in plain true obstinacy as I had elaborated before. Solutions. I had my tape recorder. There it was on the bookshelf, ready with three fresh tapes. This was going to be interesting. Garret was there, and at first I gave it to him, not trusting myself. He slid the tape in, and teased about when he would start recording. He put my extra tapes in his pocket. 

Then I wanted to stay in the bathroom. But I wanted to record it. I asked him to let me stay in there, that I wanted to be by myself for a while, and I took the tape recorder from him. I felt like he might spy on me though, or perhaps worry about me and loiter around the door, eavesdropping. I couldnt stand for that. The thought that someone would hear me with myself was completely unbearable. I insisted that he go upstairs, that he promised he wasnt going to listen. And even though I watched him walk down the hall, I still felt that at any moment, someone might barge in and interrupt. Even worse, they might catch me awkwardly scrambling to seem like I was doing something else other than what I was doing. I was in no condition for acting, covering up. My sense of humor was dry, and this would be a raw completely naked moment that would be exposed if they walked in. 

I couldnt focus here. I couldnt stay in that bathroom. The decision to leave came quickly. I was accountable for myself; I could be free from them whenever I wanted. I was free. I stuffed my feet into my favorite converse, forgoing the socks. Socks were arbitrary. I fled into my room, grabbed my jacket, and then realized, it wouldnt work if I didnt have a mirror. I looked for my gloomy bear hand mirror. No good, too small. Then I remembered the larger one on the desk. Here. Perfect. I wrapped it in my jacket, checked my tape recorder, checked suspiciously out the door, peaking down the hall and waltzing out the back door. 

I was exhilarated. I was happy to be escaping this mad house, and here I was happy, here by myself. I had found you after all, she was all I was ever going to need again. But I looked down toward the way to the park. Void. Loud crashing and yelling noises. Anyone could find me there. There was chaos and anarchy all around. Gaggles of manically cackling monsters were stalking the streets. The world had turned into one mad circus spinning on the flat of a top. We were about to topple over. Beyond what I could see around me, there was only mayhem. People were everywhere in every direction. No good. Trapped. Would I be able to handle them by myself? I realized this was probably unwise. Where was I going? I was heavily depressed by the thought that I had no where to run away to, no place to go. There was no escape. Inside the house was mad, outside the house was mad. I would have to stay here, but I didnt want to go inside. 

I crawled in the ally beside the house. I had been here a dozen times before. It seemed to me to have been one of those places. I liked these tiny nooks that seemed to stand out from reality. The energy was magnified here. I found a place to sit, set my mirror down. Damn, the lighting was bad. I was making notes into my tape recorder, unknown to me that it hadnt actually been set to record, and I spilled away notes Ive now lost into thin air. 

It wasnt comfortable. I tried a little here. Had to move over. I set it up. I felt like I was being watched. I couldnt shake that other people were eventually going to be looking for me, that other people were going to be worrying about where I was, and annoyed at their having to worry. I didnt want them to stumbling in on my babbling into a tape recorder staring into a mirror. How was I going to explain what I was doing? How was I going to explain her? I had to go inside. I had to reset and restraiten and search for somewhere else. I had to find another place. 

I would have sat there a little while longer, trying to communicate with her, flirting with the idea, that she was there, that this was more than a trick of the acid. I was cued when the lights of my bedroom shot on. Shit. They know Im gone, I have to go back.

As soon as I walked in, there they were. The big group, all tripping. Anytime we were together, I always felt like someone was still missing. Garrett was relieved, everyone was peering at me. What was she clutching? It must be a notebook. I let them assume what they wanted. No one was going to know. It was for me. 

Garrett took a hold of the tape recorder and pointed out that it had been set on play.  Felt a hot wave of humiliation and embarrassment wrap over me. Everything lost. I would have to try again. There were such precious moments there, and now, because of my own stoned folly, they were forever unthreaded into the record. He reset the tape. The others made me feel nervous about recording. They made it seem pointless. Perhaps it was. This was crazy, but everything was crazy here. What did it matter to them anyway? I was going to do what I wanted. 

Im not sure, I think we all decided on a walk. I was still wanting to creep away from everyone. I wanted to spend all my time with this new being, I had her here with my tucked under my jacket. There was the small rational voice typing in the back of my head, making commentary. It was really silly of me to be carrying this mirror around. I didnt let it go though. I couldnt bring myself from letting it go. No one was to know. It was all for me.

We were walking. Outside was bright and surreal. I felt as if we were walking forever. We past a party on the way there and out on the front yard drunk witches and drunken vampires were flirting and fucking and stumbling around. I abhorred them. I abhorred everyone. 

I had become picky. There were only a select few I would allow near me. I had to be exposed to them for a while before I would feel comfortable with them there. I didnt like people at all anymore. I was filled with contempt and loathing, and took a great deal of effort to mask and hide my reproach to them. There were so many too. Too many. Crawling, slithering, slimy creatures, like ants, painfully molesting every crevice of the house. Deplorable. I wanted to have nothing to do with any of them. I was sick of the way they thought. I could feel their thoughts forming in heads, their self serving drives disgusting me. Space was being ravaged by pure unadulterated chaos, rolling us up into oblivion. 

Joe and Chelsea were leading us somewhere. As we started out, I had no knowledge of where we were going. I wanted to stop. I felt like we were being herded around like sheep. We had been reduce to dopy imbecilic livestock the sobers were just catering and occasionally fucking around with. I didnt want to be a sheep. I wasnt going to follow a bunch of aimless lost boys. But they had a purpose, so I went along. I forgave them. My mind was in a very high strung state. My temper had been stretched out like piano strings, and things kept flicking the strings  .

Points to cover 
	Repeated emphasis on wanting to get away and be by myself.
	Walking toward, collage, team zissou at the atm, to the turtle pound, finding it pointless, walking back, meaningful but meaningless conversations, returning, the atm destroyed, reaffirming chaos, trying to find a place, going into ryans room, steve walks in, says something rude I run away, locking myself into the second floor bathroom, displaced, taking too long to settle, finally settling, getting there, naked, breasts exposed, interruption, outside world drawing me in, upstairs study closet, good moment, realizing that I still wasnt really getting somewhere, mixed sensations of salvia and extreme high, leaving, sitting on the stairs, complete chaos erupting around, in between, not sure whether I wanted to join others and have company or continue to be by myself, ryan letting me use his room, again, hesitant nervous dancing, anticipating for them to leave, them, never leaving, eventually settling into feeling comfortable, recording random useless conversations, inability to capture thoughts, finding myself with the group, partially, acknowledging that they were the only one I truly care for, finding my existence so alone, but secure in my isolation, peering at them from my perched viewpoint, tracking them through time and space, focuses and allotting time for them, sharing, happy to be with them, finally comfortable and content, able to be around people again, writing until sunrise, decided to watch fear and loathing, completely understanding the movie, still wrapped up in my quirks, a different person, hiding secretive, the onto coffee shop, writing, French toast, finding this self. The writers self. Sleep for now, back later I hope. If I stop this may be lost, there is a mocking laugh in my head, but I hope I can return at least finish it, driving it to the end and closing the journey. 

Note: lost soul to another lost soul. 

Smaller moments, remembering. I was standing outside, looking at how sad the plants looked, wondering if I should try and water them while on acid. I took too long to make up my mind, and presently forgot about them. I was hoping for more synesthesia. I had a small amount of tracers, a little in the bathroom in the mirror. It was more like snap flashes and clicks of colors. I didnt focus on it too long, I had other things to attend to. I forgot to mention that Ryan Van Hee had stopped by, he hugged me and tried to grab my ass, I pushed him off and pack slapped him angrily and stormed inside. It was affirming to stand up for myself. 

It is unfortunate to me that I will not be able to place and stitch all the small pieces of this trip together into one cohesive picture, but so it goes with this type of ordeal. So it goes with life. At the times we can escape the larger machine, we allow ourselves to record the brief and fleeting moments of self reflection, stapling them into the concrete, like a post-it note that no one reads. 

A chip just stabbed the top of my mouth, I think thats telling me to stop eating for a while food, the necessity of eating, just another formal distraction. 

Release, when youre here, the rest of the world, responsibilities, and accountability, doesnt matter. This is what weve learned, when Im here in the flow, I have to remember to forget the rest of the world. All my tasks and to-do lists are tying me down and pulling me loose. 

Getting distracted by conventional responsibilities. Remember, it doesnt really matter. I get distracted by the thought, the inhibitions that arise from vanity. The carefully and hopelessly composed images of ourselves that we try and maintain in the minds of others, as the people around us are just reminders of ourselves. Realizing, they too are trapped from their own personal view point as well. They are looking to escape it just as much as you are. 

Yet again, it doesnt really matter. Just to me and myself, that is all. It is later, when the work is for others, after Ive gone within and back out, will I have to come to terms with subjecting myself to the mass agreement of criticism and judgment, composed of uncountable amounts of points blindly defining its self, like a blind man sitting in the dark. 

Ive sucked too long on that damn unlit cigarette and now the fucking thing is moist and broke. 

In small doses, every passing moment, I can feel bits of it floating away and revealing the entrapping normalcy I have to contend with. 

Distractions and daily routine are pulling me once again away from the key board. Its unfortunate that I have to maintain this physical prison, that I can not meld my mind and life into a printed set of paper and words and binding and glue and a hard cover case. If my life was in essence a simple book. Sitting on a shelf, peculiar and obscure, collecting dust and just hoping one day to be noticed and appreciated. Some books are just louder then others. Some are just more profound. And yet others are just lucky enough to be filed in the correct alphabetical section. 

Im letting go of that cigarette. Its like letting go of the mirror, setting it down, learning I can not cling to it forever. If I did, it would mutate into a terrible misrepresentation of who I am. Just like these nails I continued to be tortured by. 

A brief walk to the bookstore, picking up Fear and Loathing, Ryan did at least, I will have to find my own copy later, but for now Ill borrow and read through it in half hour intervals. Today I only care about writing. I do feel like the momentum of my serge is slowly ebbing away into the mist of consistency and reality, the self rejoining assigned to the place I had been before. Will it reflect in my writing? Assuredly so. Ill not be able to cling to this much longer, but lets see how long I can serf this wave.

My words are slowed, my articulation is vaporizing, inhibitions settling in like rigamortis. Will I be able to finish? Will I be able remember that lesson I learned? Persevere. Nothing else matters. Persevere to the end. Until you reach the end, it is left unfinished. Unfinished things are lost. We have to finish, even if this is getting sloppy and sour, I have to keep pressing on, otherwise, this will be lost, and this lesson wont settle in my bones and take hold in the constant growing person I am and will be. This trip wont become nearly as meaningful if I dont finish. It doesnt matter what you write, just write, persevere.  

I walked into the kitchen to make more tea. Im still locked into that place I realized, Im still tripping, perhaps, maybe, Im not sure. I cant help it if I am right? Its probably psychological, Im just keeping myself there because my head is still there remembering, pondering, studying. Its not intense, but just faint enough. I can slightly see the sick pale glow on certain people, but I feel like its more of my imagination. Am I pretending to be tripping? Perhaps, but lets just keep pretending until the end, just long enough to finish this, so much more to go. 

It is startling to me to realize that this has been my perfect happy day. Not everyday can be as so, I wouldnt be happy if everyday was like this, but Im writing the whole day, everything being poured out and formed up into young amateur shapes. This is finally the place where I have been searching for, the place where I can write perpetually, until my head aches and my eyes burn, from morning until the late evening sun gives way into the dark. I am here typing away, forgetting everything else. Its difficult to fight it back, to fight off the nagging call from all the things I need to do. This time wasnt planned, wasnt expected, how am I going to make up for it later? But I hear a whisper inside me, just go, it doesnt matter. Persevere. Your still there, Im keeping you there until the end. 

The more time I invest in this, the louder the voice growls, This is worthless, youre wasting your day, this is meaningless, you should stop, this isnt getting you anywhere, give up and move on, this is worth nothing Its getting harder to fight off, harder to ignore. Im trying hard to grip onto framing into my mind, it doesnt matter, I need just to let it flow, what will happen will happen. I have to sit here until its done. I have to keep persevering. 

I am troubled by my juvenile vocabulary and amateur writing style. I know I have to start at the bottom, but I hate this suffering of trying to get better. Im extremely cliché all the time and its painful. 

Things said in loop. Too many loops, but symbolic somehow. I was able to understand symbolism in that moment, but now that understanding is lost. 

I hate my nails. Catie had painted my nails in uniform for my costume. They were red with white tips. I had never had French tips before. I had never had a manicure before. It seemed worthless. But my hands werent properly representing me. I told myself This is not the way my hands should look. They were fake, it made me feel fake and of something I didnt need or want. I was natural, and this was so artificial. They were inhibiting me, I wanted to cover them up and I even tried gloves, but the gloves didnt fit either, they were not what I needed. They had to remind me again and again, they had just been part of the costume. 

I forgot, Im sick. I knew I was going to forget. My voice was altered and different, gray and soft and thick. Like made of scruffy cotton balls. Sometimes, I could remember and cough, or sometimes I would cough and remember. But it happened over and over again, just in a loop. I said it at least a dozen times over the night.

Im not crazy, I am a normal person just right now, Im on acid. I was afraid of the person I had found there in the bathroom with me. I was struggling with the thought that perhaps I was crazy, I had just been suppressing it all along. I wanted to know if other people noticing my existence actually also thought I was regularly normal. I was so far gone, the feelings I had toward the relationships I had built around me conditionally changing moment by moment, I wanted to be reassured, that off of it, I had at least appeared normal to them, that I wasnt showing, that I at least had the excuse right now of acting insane, because I was on acid. 

I am so far gone. The only way I could describe where I was. Just remove from reality, still there, but warped. I cant emphasize enough, this incredible driving sense of urgency. All urgently waiting for something. Waiting for Godot. Waiting to move, waiting to settle, waiting to organize, waiting to go somewhere. Feeling urgency of transporting elsewhere, and hesitant force holding us back, keeping us in the same self found spot.

[Erowid Note: This report was submitted as a 5-MeO-AMT report, however the writer does not provide any reasoning for the deviation.  In the reviewer's opinion, the effects described below are reasonably consistent with LSD.] 

Since one of my friends tried it last year, I'd wanted to get my hands on some LSD badly.  But it wasn't until a girl at work had told me that she had some. She said that her dealer had sold her good acid, and that she trusted him. That was good enough for her.

She gave me the little pieces of paper, and I kept them cold and in the darkness like I'd been told to. Today it was decided amongst me and a friend that today was the right day to do it. We took the paper out, and each took two hits (I took a little more).

+00 That entire day I'd been smoking hash and very potent marijuana, so I was already pretty blazed. But once it hit, I really started to experience everything strangely. 

+2:00  I'm really trying to put the effects into words, but it's tough. I feel, out of body, and thinking about everything rapidly. And I feel hot, beginning to drink lots of water. Due to an unforseen circumstance, my friend had to leave early so I was completely alone with only some online friends to keep me grounded. My whole body felt strange. Typing becomes difficult and strained. Yet I have incredible energy too.

+4:00 I've forgotten what spelt words look like.

+4:30 I'm beginning to see faces in the darkness of my room. I feel strangely at peace with the world, and somewhat safe, although this emotion comes and goes. Seconds later I feel sad and scared, almost like a little baby, helpless. I begin to think about my father, and how much he cares about me, and I'm able to accept it and cry for the first time in a year. 

+5:00 I'm drinking insane amounts of water. I can never seem to get enough.

+11:30 I'm a pretty big stoner, and I tried DXM once, but I've never felt anything like this. It's so close to soberness at times that I even question if I'm really on a drug at all, then shifts into boundless thoughts and ideas. The entire idea of reality begins to melt away and I realize that nothing is real. That is what I love about this drug! My sense of time is completely gone. It's been almost 12 hours since I took the dose. And I'm still feeling strange. I can remember taking the dose, and it seems so amazingly far, and yet close.

Okay, well the experience is over (after 15 hours). During the peak, I became uncontrollably emotional, crying into my pillow for minutes at a time. Music was also really interesting: I was able to listen to it forever, and if my mind didn't like what was being played, it simply switched it off. Sometimes I didn't hear anything, when I realized I did. 

I truly cannot describe what this drug is like. I had an absolute blast, although I would have liked to have had more marijuana and some friends along for the ride. Oh well.

Tips: This drug made me VERY VERY thirsty, although at first I did not want water, it was a very very good idea to have a lot nearby. I drank close to 5 gallons in a period of 12 hours with no stopping. I want more water!

The trip can be scary. But I reminded myself that it's only a drug. I did 2 hits alone, on my first time. It was stupid. Be smarter then I am and get a sitter. And don't fucking take too much.

Have fun and be safe!

I first moved into my college dorm room not knowing what to expect. I had transferred to a new school, with my girlfriend and another friend. The campus seemed, well dull and dry as could be. So all we had to keep ourselves entertained was the local liquor store that did not id. From the looks of most of the other students I wouldnt be finding anything to smoke until I returned home. I had no idea that a drug dealer lived only a few rooms down the hall!

Eventually this came to my attention, as the familiar smell of cannabis filled the hallway. Being that this was a freshman/transfer student dorm building I figured hey they are probably looking to make a few friends who also smoke. So I gave his door a knock, and nothing. Somewhat depressed I headed back to my room mentioning what I had smelled to my girlfriend. Fortunately the next day I saw him in the hallway, so I decided to start a conversation with him. Eventually finding out he sold weed, acid, shrooms and other various drugs. At first I just stuck to good old weed. After about a month of knowing him, and becoming fairly good friends with him, he offered me acid for $10 a hit. So we (my girlfriend, friend and I) decided to try it.

The first 45 minutes went by and absolutely no effects were noticed. After about an hour and a half after taking the acid I began to intensely feel the effects. I began to question the nature of things for some odd reason. This led me to my 30 gallon fish tank, which I had recently purchased. I began rambling on about how these fish should be free, and what a shitty life they must be living now. This conversation brought my friend and girlfriend to the tank. They began gazing, and my girlfriend agreed with my comment. I began to hate the people that must have captured them and sent them to the pet store ultimately doomed to swim in my rectangular tank for the remainder of their lives.

I suddenly realized someone was knocking on my door. I was relieved to find out it was just the kid from down the hall. He instantly knew we were on acid and began to smile. We invited him to spend the night with us and he took 2 hits. Seeing this I decided to get each of us another hit. So after taking that we decided to go outside. Little did we know there was a rather large amount of snow falling in our area, which made the experience wonderful. Everything was blanketed with snow, and glistening. At first I wanted to run back upstairs to grab my jacket because it happened to be a fairly cold night. However, we began walking towards this large parking lot on the campus and the longer I walked the warmer I became. Eventually I felt perfectly fine wearing a t-shirt and jeans.

Once at the parking lot, we were in for a hilarious experience. While walking around we all managed to end up on a sheet of ice that built up on the blacktop of the parking lot. For some reason I felt like ice-skating in my sneakers, and my girlfriend began to follow my lead. She fell backwards and we all started laughing so hard. I slipped and fell to the ground from laughing and that only made everyone laugh harder. After a few minutes everyone was on the ground laughing. Eventually we all regained our balance and headed back into the dorm.

Before I met them in my room I went to one of the many shared bathrooms in my building. My school had these already trippy looking floor tiles that we all used to joke around about on the bathroom floors and walls. They now began to swirl but only when I concentrated on the toilet bowl. It was one of those out of the corner of my eye kinda things. Every time I looked at the tiles they stopped, and began swirling every time I looked back at the toilet. This kept me entertained for what seemed like 10 minutes but what was probably only 1 or 2 minutes.

I decided to head back to my room and meet back up with my friends. After only half an hour I decided to go for a drive.  [Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]   It had to be 11 pm and because of the snow storm nobody was traveling on the roads. Also I figured I swerved slightly because of the effects of the acid I could blame it on the snow. It wasnt really that bad at first. I really tried to concentrate only on driving and that wasnt all too difficult. I began to feel connected through the car somehow while driving along. Especially so when I pressed the breaks, I could feel the pulsation of the anti-lock breaks. It seemed to shoot up through my entire body and it almost felt like a pain. Similar to that sort of pain associated with nails on a chalk board.

In any event we arrived at the 7eleven and purchased random snacks, although the acid didnt give me the munchies at all. We decided to smoke when we arrived back at the dorm so we grabbed some cigars and snacks for the expected munchies. We began to watch The Butterfly Effect, and I almost shit myself. I love the movie straight or even while smoking weed, but definitely not on acid. Everyone unanimously wanted to stop watching it, so we turned on some techno and Winamp visualizations. I normally dont listen to much techno, unless high, but its excellent while on acid.

Eventually the night came to an end, everyone left except my girlfriend and I, so we tried to sleep. Unfortunately this didnt seem possible, as we laid there for half an hour with no progress. So we talked the night away, about every subject that came to mind. Overall an amazing experience and I have taken acid several times after this first time.

Prior to the time I took LSD I was strongly anti-drugs. This was no doubt because of all the people around me telling me that all drugs were bad. Of course I believed them and whenever Id hear someone around me doing drugs, I would truely be disgusted. I then found out one of my close friends was doing a few drugs. I knew he was a cool guy so I let him explain to me what he had to say, which is when he started telling me about this drug called 'LSD'. He assured me that it was one of the safest drugs known to man in terms of adverse damage to the body. He then told me that the amount of LSD required to make you trip was less toxic than Vitamin C in an Orange, I was listening. These are the things that Im not told by the people who tell me all drugs are 'bad'. I then went on the web and read hours and hours worth of info regarding LSD. At this point I had realised that LSD was not in fact a 'bad' drug and I knew I was stable enough not to worry about psychosis.

I then told my friend that I wanted to try some. He said we could no doubt score some at a psytrance party so I went along. It was a Saturday night so it was crowded. We were in this place with loud music, wasn't my kind of scene but I bared with it knowing that I was about to score some LSD. My friend tried a few people who looked like they may be selling but was unsuccessful. We were about to give up and try another party when I saw this teen walk in. He looked like a modern day hippy so I immediately told my friend to ask him. He went, a few minutes passed so I knew we had something. I went up to them talking and started listening. My friend turned to me and told me he had LSD but it wasn't at the price he expected it to be. My friend had only done LSD once before so he wasn't sure about the price himself.

We bought 2 tabs as it was expensive. The guy handed me the 2 tabs, he put it straight into my hand. At the time I was quite hot so I was sweating, my palms were moist. I remembered Albert Hofmanns first accidental trip, so I quickly gave it to my friend who put it in his wallet. We departed from the party. I told my friend that we should go to his house and do it there. At this point the time was around 10-11pm Saturday night. He agreed.

We went to his house and on the way we got a lot of snacks. When we arrived at his house, my friend told his parents that Id me staying round that night. All was going well until his parents said 'ABSOLUTELY NOT! YOU HAVE TO BE UP EARLY TOMORROW MORNING AND AT YOUR AUNTIES HOUSE'. As I heard this it felt as though for a split second the whole world collapsed on me. We agreed that I should look after the tabs before deciding when to do it. I went home, very excited to have LSD for the first time, very excited to have my first ever drug.

The following day was a Sunday. I share a room with my brother so I don't have much privacy. At around 9pm he said he was going to his friends house and that he wouldn't be home until something like 4am. When he left I saw this as an opportunity to take the acid, so I dropped one hit at around 9pm on a Sunday night. Bad idea right? As I have school the next morning. I wasn't 100% sure of how long the effects lasted.

Anyway, it took 1 hour and 45 minutes before I felt anything so I was wondering if we'd been sold blotter paper with no acid on it. When I started feeling something I was relieved. At around 11pm I started tripping hard. At the time I was on MSN trying to type. The keyboard was becoming increasingly difficult to see as it was pulsing and dancing around, like a boat on sea.

Around this time I called my friend to notify him that Id taken my share. He told me that if I was having fun it'd be OK if I had his one too. WOW, what a great friend! At around T+2.00 I dropped the second hit. My trip for the first few hours was really fun. I didn't know what to expect but I remember laughing and giggling a lot. I was really having fun.

At about 1pm my sister needed my help so she called me. I went into her room and she asked me to unplug and re-plug her TV in. Very simple task, yet so difficult to do when on LSD. I must have been there for 15-20 minutes laughing around, as I usually do when Im around her so she didn't suspect a thing. When I wasn't able to do this simple task, I promised her Id do it tomorrow. When she agreed I felt very relieved. 

I went back into my room and put 'Break on Through' by The Doors on. I must have had this song on repeat for about 3-4 hours straight! At around 2-3am, with Break on Through playing loud on my headphones I started worrying that my brother would come home and walk right in and find me on this class A drug. I started to worry. Because of this, every 10 minutes I would have auditory hallucinations. I would hear the door creaking at the joints signifying that someone had just walked in, i.e my brother. I kept hearing the door maybe 12 times over a short period of time. I then let it get to head. I heard my mom and many more voices in my left ear, all shouting. I couldn't make out anything they were saying but it scared me a lot. I suddenly took my headphones off and looked round, only to see no one. I was relieved again and straight away there was this huge smile on my face.

At around 4-5am I decided that I should climb into bed as my brother would be home anytime. I turned the PC off and climbed into bed. I now know NEVER to sit or lie down without music on or any other thing to distract me as I start thinking about negative things. As I was laying there in bed, I started thinking about my life, where I was going, what I was currently doing etc etc. I felt like shit, I realised that I should be taking education seriously as that should be the most important thing currently in my life. But I was failing in school, so I felt very depressed, I was failing in life. I just wanted to sleep, to escape these thoughts. But I couldn't sleep, not after only 8 hours of dropping the acid. I was getting really upset that I couldn't run or hide from myself, my own thoughts, my own state of mind.

I then decided to do something about it, I climbed out of bed and picked up my guitar and iPod. I put on Orion by Metallica and started playing along with the solo (after the bass riff kicks in). The solo is very melodic so I suddenly felt great playing it. I was on top of the world, so happy, so incredibly happy. At this point I realised that if I have a son, he has to try this, to be in the state that I am in right now. I felt like I was in heaven, I was so happy. After about half an hour I realised that it was getting late and I had school the next day so I climbed back into bed.

My brother came home shortly after, I was pretending to be alseep, it worked and he climbed into bed without bothering me. I was very hot, sweating. I couldn't sleep and I kept looking at the time. I was lying there concentrating on falling sleep. I kept looking at the time every 5 minutes. Each 5 minutes that past felt like 15 minutes so I was lying in bed for what felt like eternity. It was now coming towards 6 and I kept on thinking, 'Omg, I have school tomorrow and I havent had any sleep yet. Let me at least get 1 hour of sleep'.

That didn't happen, I hadn't fallen asleep and the time now was 7.30am. I climbed out of bed and got changed for school. I was still tripping, not the hard 5 hours but the post hardcore trip which lasts around 10 hours. I was very tired and very confused. I left my house and needed to get a weekly travel ticket for the bus. I went into the store and also got a large bottle of water along with my ticket. When the guy asked for the money of the ticket + water I got very confused as I had forgotten to calculate the water bottle. I asked him why it was more expensive than usual. When I asked this he told me I was also buying the water bottle. I then felt as though he knew that I was on drugs. I kept saying to myself, 'Oh no, he probably thinks Im one of those common drug addict thugs'.

I felt as though he was judging me. I had to get out of there. I payed him and got on the bus. There were no spaces to sit so I was standing. The whole journey I kept on thinking, 'Everyone is staring at me, judging me in a bad way'. I felt like shit. After my first bus journey ended, I got onto the second bus. I found a seat and sat down. After a few minutes someone sat right next to me staring at me. I looked and it was my good friend. He is religous and thinks highly of me so I didn't want him to find out I was on drugs. The whole time he was talking to me, I was trying not to look him in the eyes because I was very paranoid that he'd see my dilated pupils.

I soon arrived at school and sat down in class. I was relieved to see my friend who uses soft drugs as I felt connected with him at that point. I then told him to look into my eyes, which were still dilated. I told him I was still tripping. At this point I got very scared that Id get caught on a Schedule 1 drug in school by my teachers. I avoided all eye contact. I now realised that I must have been acting a little weird but at the time, I was concentrating on not looking at anyone directly in the eye.

2 hours passed and I went into my second lesson. I was now EXTREMELY tired, just barely able to keep my eye lids open. I was tripping on the keyboard in front of me, which was quite fun.

I then realised that I couldn't take it anymore so I stood up, told my teacher that I felt very 'ill' and that I was going. She told me it was OK to step outside and get some fresh air. I then told her that I was not coming back and that I was going home. I picked up all my stuff and as I was about to leave someone in class made a joke. He said something along the lines of 'You smoked too much crack last night'. When I heard this I suddenly thought 'Oh my god, they're very close to finding out the truth'. With this in my mind I laughed in a very uneasy way to pretend like that was absolutely not the case. 

I left class. I was very relieved to be heading home. I started thinking about my bed and sleeping which made me feel very happy. The 45 minute bus journey home was hell for me as I was barely able to stay awake. I made it home, jumped into bed and had the best sleep Ive ever had.

What an experience! I took two tabs on my first go not knowing what to expect and my lack of knowledge caused me to take it at a very bad time, just hours before school.

Well I made a big mistake the other day that, luckily for me it turned out astonishingly well. I just acquired 6 hits of quite good acid that I was going to split and share with my girlfriend on a nice day. I woke up on Thursday morning and realised my mom - who was the one who could always tell I was on drugs - was in NJ and my dad was at work. We drop at 1:00 pm.

T+30 minutes: My brother, who is quite young still and I wasn't worried about, tells me that my dad is coming home at 3:00 so that he can be there when the COP comes to talk to my brother about why not to do fireworks (he was caught setting off fireworks at a school). Wow so this is awesome news to me, not only are we going to peak when my dad comes home but also we are going to be peaking with a cop in my house!!! Now the first time I did acid it literally took 2 hours to kick in and another hour to come up. Not this time though, it literally kicked in at a nice strength in under an hour. So we're like alright let's go outside! Cos it was a beautiful day outside.

T+1 hour: The walk was awesome, the clouds were swirling everywhere and everything was just beautiful. I, unfortunately had terrible anxiety and nervousness. I know though, that acid does this so I kind of disregarded it and tried to go with it. We walked around my block as the acid slowly crept up on us.

T+1.5 hours: We were already beginning to peak. At this point the clouds were thousands of swirling puffs and the sun was making everything shimmer in gold. The street was getting windy (visually) and narrower and the woods were much more accented and dense. It literally got to the intensity where I was starting to get a bit scared to walk in the street. I would get SO amazed by something that I would just wander off into the middle of the road and I sure as hell didn't want to get hit by a car. So I began walking on the grass. Naturally being in the grass of course makes it so that the hair on my arms begins to increase and I begin to acquire cat-like attributes. I am rolling in the grass very happily, yet kind of scared to go anywhere as now I am tripping balls.

T+2 hours: I touch my sunglasses as I'm holding them in my hand and close my eyes. Reality begins to unfold and I swear I was able to enter other dimensions and if I had stayed longer then experience time travel (that's what I figured out in my acid-head). Finally we realise we are kind of dehydrated as it's like 3:00 and about 95 degrees. I'm scared to go back to my house though because of my dad and the cop but we just wing it and start walking.

T+2.5 hours: This is where I really begin to lose it. I am being very over-stimulated by how bright everything is and also how hot it is and am naturally, starting to freak out a bit. The walk is very strenuous and I swear I am being pulled to the right, now entering a faster speed road by foot I am even more scared. Finally we get to my devious 300 foot long driveway surrounded by dark woods. I skeptically make it down the driveway and we go into my house. Everything is patterns and waving back and forth and nothing is how it was when I left it. Sweating like a fucking dog I slowly stumbled up the stairs into my room with my girlfriend. I am completely incoherent and can't make complete sentences or any decisions. I check the clock, it's 3:30. My dad isn't home and neither has the cop come. So I'm semi-relieved. All of a sudden, my dad knocks on the door. Now lucky for me he is a very naive man when it comes to me on drugs so he didn't even realise the fact my pupils were enormous and I was stumbling all over the place.

T+3 hours: We don't know where to go so we hide in my basement, I still feel overheated and terrified as shit. We venture back up to my room and all of a sudden I throw up in my hands. It was actually a very spiritual purge it was like throwing up my soul and then having it enter back into me again. Within about 20 minutes after I threw up things got even worse, I was not only filthy and dirty from vomit, but my dad was home and my girlfriend is freaking out too and since we were in my house she couldn't make any real decisions. We tried calling like 10 people in my phone because I really wanted to leave my house to get away from my dad, brother, and the this cop that was supposed to be here. Finally I got a hold of the girl who sold me the acid, a friend from a few towns over, I told her the story as best I could and she said she'd be right over with her girlfriend. After the phone call I actually begin to cool down and also calm down. The visuals are intense and I still am semi-incoherent but I am calm and have calmed my girlfriend down a bit, even though I give her TONS of credit for trying to calm me down the majority of the time.

T+3.5 hours: At about the time my friend and her girlfriend arrive we've actually went past the peak and plateaued at a VERY nice medium. The visuals were excellent but we were totally in control, it was as if the acid wasn't even altering are thoughts and we were just happy as hell. We chilled out in my room with my friends and she was telling the most intense stories. She was flailing her arms around and it made the most amazing tracers as anyone who's done acid knows, the tracers with your hands are just awesome. We had an awesome time with them, and we hung outside a bit later. The ants and bugs were awesome to watch as you'd see butterflys and there would be multiple ones (tracers) or ants walking with trails behind them.

T+? (at this point time was irrelevant and fairly dilated so I don't have accurate times measurement: My girlfriend and I went back to my room and just hung out and listened to the doors greatest hits really loud. I have an awesomely comfortable room with trippy posters everywhere. One of them had tons of faces in it and they all popped out at me. I have this spirally thing on my computer and if I stare at it for 30 seconds and look at something else, that something starts warping and moving. So we put that on and it literally brought the trip to a new level.

Another thing, associated with that, that I witnessed was that when I kept it on, it created a vortex around my computer in which colors from around my room and my computer wallpaper were being sucked into it and thrown out around my room. I vividly remember my girlfriend being enveloped in the colors from my wallpaper (purple, green, red, blue) being thrown across the room and changing the color of her hair. Another awesome and funny thing I witnessed was urinating. Every time I would pee I would watch as urine would come in a stream out of my belly button, penis, and knees. Urine would also flow (visually) over the sides of the toilet and down the walls. When I splashed water on everything, water started pouring down the walls.

T+?: My friend had bought us bubbles a few nights prior so we decided to play with them. The bubbles are incredibly beautiful and shine their colors and patters over everything. When one pops on me, I feel it all over my body. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Between the doors playing and my girlfriend and I so happy and having so much fun with everything it was just a marvelous experience. I was so relaxed and content and everything was just SO awesome. I wish I could have drawn what I saw but it was such an experience.

Overall: The experience turned out awesome. We even ended up going to see the new Willy Wonka movie at the tail end of our trip which brought the movie up to a new level. The only problem was our timing, it sucked, never do acid just on a whim. That was so unlike me as usually I plan out drugs very far in advance. Lucky for us the cop never showed and we calmed down fairly quick, but there was a little while where we were in pure terror. Scared shitless. I have had an experience with a hospital before so now whenever something goes awry on psychedelics death is always the first thing that comes into my mind. I was fortunate enough this time that everything worked out almost majestically but not always will I be so lucky. I just thought I'd share this experience as maybe people will be able to relate.

This was my third (maybe second? can't really remember) time to drop acid, however it was my first time to really trip hard.  My previous trips had been off no more than 1.5 hits, this time I went all out and took four.  I was feeling really good when I took the pills; We (myself and a friend) took them at another friend's house.  His parents were out for the night so we knew that we could really cut loose.  His house is really fun, he has a big backyard with tennis courts and a small forest type area.  There were two other nontripping friends that we designated as our 'babysitters' just in case.  

The first effects started about 20 minutes after I ingested the pills.  It was a mild euphoria, but growing greater every minute.  I was feeling so happy that I could not help but give all my friends a big hug.  

The acid was really starting to kick in, I was getting black flashes much like a strobe light, and I was feeling quite euphoric.  We decided to go out into the back yard.  My other two friends were laughing at us as we got accustomed to our new acid world.  I found it very difficult to walk, and my perceptions were getting altered, when I tried to move a limb it was extremely exaggerated.  For example, I remember once I was holding a cigarette, and moved my arm to take a drag.  I could not judge how much I was moving my arm and I swung the cig into the air and it fell on the ground next to me.  When I reached down to pick it up, my hand slammed into the ground.  This 'transitory stage' only lasted about 10 minutes (I think).  However the exageration of everything lasted throughout the night.

Anyway, we got outside and that's when things really started getting groovy.  We walked out to the tennis courts, and my friend was messing with us.  He saw my tripping partner Nick outstretching his hands to the sky and said 'Hey John (that's me), I need you to find me the moon.'  Though I knew he was just messing around, I felt compelled to find the moon and I delightfully skipped around until I found a pine cone, which I decided must be a moon dropping.  I then reported back with what I had found, proud of myself.  

We went back inside after about 15 minutes?  My sense of time was starting to get really out of whack.  Anyway, we got back into his room.  Nick's face was flushing and he had a mild case of the sweats, but given my state of mind, I thought he was about to explode.  I thought that he must not be breathing.  I told my non-tripping friend what I thought, and he played along.  I kept telling him, 'Nick's not breathing, Nick's not breathing,' (I thought I was whispering but was really talking quite loudly) until I convinced Nick himself that he was not breathing.  Surprisingly enough, neither of us really got freaked out, especially since I was comforted by the fact that if someone stopped breathing, they would go unconscious and would begin breathing again.  

After about 30 minutes I think, my two non-tripping friends were getting really bored of babysitting and wanted to go out to eat.  They assured us that we were acting normal enough to not screw up, so Nick and I agreed that it would be ok since they left.  They told us that we could crank up the guitars and the music.  We started peaking right about the time they left.  I felt like I was sharing thoughts with Nick - if he said he was seeing or feeling something, I would almost always see or feel it too.  I don't remember a lot, but there are lots of separate parts I do remember.

I remember playing the guitar, and everything I played sounded awesome even though I was playing awful sounding chords with tons of distortion and delay.  While I was playing, I noticed that I was twitching my eye.  It wasn't just a normal twitch - my whole face was scrunching with every note I played, and my eyes were going wild.  The uncontrollable eye twitch continued throughout the night.  I started to listen to music, and when I finally came to later that night I realized that I had gone through about 20 CDs.  I must have not listened to all of them because I was only listening to music for about an hour total.  

The coolest and most memorable part of the trip was while listening to Pink Floyd's 'Atom Heart Mother.'  Me and Nick were convinced that we were tribal leaders, took our shirts off, and wrapped them around our heads like turbans.  We ran all over the room, and made faces at each other in the bathroom.  Nick's face looked like a Picasso painting.  We made up an elaborate dance that included banging pillows on the bed as hard as possible.  When my other two friends returned they were greeted to two shirtless men with turbans on shooting them with guitars.

After that things started to settle back down, but neither me or Nick could sleep that night.  The eye twitch continued until the next evening, and the intense trip made me stay away from acid for a while.  It was not a bad experience, don't get me wrong, it was probably the most fun thing I have ever done, but the crash afterward was just a little too much and I had to step back and recover.  There is a lot more that I could tell you, but I don't remember the sequence much and I am tired of writing so I hope you have enjoyed my story.

Time passes hazily
(Time.

Gravity's

blazing leaf geommetry riding
the ripples of collision,

Answer at once, shine dances penetrating
through your little dome of ecstasy
Laughter flows upwards
bathing heavy brain with joy.
Eyes close. 
Patterns frolic seamlessly across eyelids,
emerging from the breathing migration of patterns are 
bright beams bursting into the mind.
Eyes wide.
Sun's final secrets ride 
the sky red 
kissing the trees
standing quietly.
I stand.
Walking...
towards some unknown future.
Still riding the blissful seafoam of an acid brain.

I wish I had a better idea of how much I actually took which is partially why I'm writing this report.  I had not used acid in approximately six months, and the dried up end of a vial was given to me as a gift.  The giver reported a very weak experience from the liquid squeezed from the dropper, and he assumed what remained was even less concentrated.  No preparations were made in advance, and thankfully I was at home where my roommate also was. 

At eight pm I bit the top off the dropper and chewed on it while I reconstituted the dropper with water and drank it all.  I repeated this twice more to be sure nothing was left behind, and then went about some household chores.  One half hour later I felt abruptly disoriented, with a perceived loss of balance.  For fear of falling over and hurting myself I sat down on my couch as the room started to spin out.  Within a half hour of the onset I had reached what I would later realize to be the peak.  I was sweating so profusely that it was pouring off of my face and I could collect it in pools in the palms of my hands. I experienced intense visual, and auditory hallucinations.  Mentally speaking the only uncomforting thing was that I didnt know how deep I was going to be going until I had began to come down.  Because this was my first and only encounter of this magnitude I felt a good deal of anxiety in the sense of not knowing at the time if I was going to be alright afterwards.  These feelings along with the intense perspiration subsided with the most intense part of the trip in about one hour.  Even then I wouldnt call it a bad trip.  (I can imagine feeling similar anxiety if I were to try skydiving for the first time. In that sense I see it as a potential personal fear of radically knew experiences. Although I might have felt scared at the time I would consider it one of the most enjoyable experiences I have ever had.) 

Being veterans day I watched a war movie with my roommate which was mentally very intense in terms of how vivid and lifelike it was, but I experienced no feeling of terror.  I found it difficult to sleep at about one a.m. as I was still experiencing visuals.  I layed there in my bed for another hour or so tossing and turning before I fell asleep.  Unfortunately I had to work bright and early the next morning, and with my alarm at five a.m. sharp I awoke to find I was still experiencing full visuals.  My only point of reference is that I was still tripping harder than I had on any other trip.  At work I experienced feelings of disorientation, and confusion along with difficulty concentrating. Visuals had subsided by nine a.m. and my body still felt lifted until aproximately noon.  I was told the type of acid I had was called silver surfer, but I cant verify this.  I appologize for any unuseful information included. If possible I would be interested in finding out approximately how much I had.  

Thank you for this opportunity to relate my experiences, and have a nice day.

So, I have taken LSD in the past, and had good and bad trips.  I hadn't taken it in two years.  Then, this summer I decided to drop one hit, which was supposedly pretty strong.  I didn't trip that hard, but I had some visuals, and I smoked pot and I drank too.  

The trip ended after about 8 hours.  That night, I smoked pot again, and I noticed, no visuals, but everything that was close up looked really blurry.  I couldn't even read a book.  I looked in the mirror and my pupils were very dialated, so I thought maybe the acid was like coming back, since I smoked.  No big deal.  

Then, the next day, when I smoked pot it happened again.  Now, I was getting kind of worried.  I also noticed that when I wasn't high, I could not see close up very well.  My pupils looked to be a normal size.  I thought, maybe I have permanently damaged my vision and I was really worried.  

I told my mom about it, not that I took acid, but that I could not see close up, and she said that I might need bifocals.  Bifocals at nineteen years old.  I felt really bad.  This went on for a few weeks.  

Luckily, my vision got better, and now I can see close up just fine.  

Thank God, because I was really worried that I did something to my eyes.  I will be more careful from now on!

When I was 16, my best friend suggested that I take a trip with her. I had never tripped before, but I was open to anything, and so I said sure. About 11pm, she came over to my house and we snuck back to my room. We dissolved maybe like 1/8th of the paper each into paper cups of water, and drank it down.

Soon thereafter I began to feel excited and nervous and antsy all at the same time. Suddenly I was skeptical that she'd brought acid as I'd heard trips were different than this. 'Wait a few minutes, you'll see.' she said. School had just started up again and we were taking about how the year was beginning at our different schools when suddenly everything just seemed to change all around me. Everything was like a dream in that it never looked the same way twice.

I collapsed back onto my bed and was simply mesmorized by the spinning ceiling fan, seeing shapes and faces inside the spinning blades. The trip hit her too right around this time, and after being mesmorized by my 'UFO lamp' (A 50s-flying-saucer shaped lamp with approximately 100 fibre-optic wires coming out of the top in a fanned-out pattern, with a spinning, multicolored translucent disk inside so the fibre-optic wires glow every colour imaginable), we decided to fuck. 

I had never felt anything so amazing as that sex on acid, so we took another trip of about the same size at maybe 1:30-2:00am. We entertained each other for a little while talking in funny voices (she talked in a twangy southern accent and called herself 'Kentucky Pete', etc.) and then I got into a deep intellictual discussion with my stereo, whose tape deck was its face. And she and I fucked again.

The moon was waning at this point and as I recall it was maybe 2:30-3:30am and the moon was just rising, so we opened my blinds and let the moonlight be the sole illimunation of the room. As I recall I tried to read a book in the moonlight but couldn't make out the letters, and she decided to read my handhelt CD player and got something really deep out of it.

By now it was approximately 4am, maybe later, and I decided I'd trip again. Cheryl advised against it, but I took about 1/4 of the paper's original size, and just dissolved it directly on my tongue. We then turned on the TV and were transfixed on a Madame Cleo Psychic Hotline infomercial (or maybe travel packages to Jamaica??)

The next thing I remember it's third period at school the next morning (9:15am or so). I'm sitting in art class at my small Christian school trying to draw a still life. I look at the drawing in my book and the stick figure I drew is magically come to life and is dancing around on the page. I slammed my book shut and stared at the still life on the table in the center of the room. A small desk lamp has come to life, and alternately 'stares' at me or jumps around smashing other items on the still life. I rub my eyes and everything is in its normal place but is slowly changing colours! This time I smack myself thinking it will get my head in line and a miniature stuffed version of the school's mascot (an eagle) is laying on the table talking to me.

'You need to shut up.' I told the stuffed eagle. 'What did you say?!' my art teacher responds back. Now my art teacher wasn't exactly athletic, but she still liked to wear somewhat tight outfits, and for some reason I suddenly see her head backwards on the body of a turtle standing up. She didn't understand when I explained that the stuffed eagle on the table was talking to me. Then I looked back at the stuffed eagle, and it was my art teacher! My art teacher had been shrunk by the eagle and the eagle was now her size!! Oh no! I next remember my art teacher having me sit outside where I closed my eyes and pretended to be asleep as strange figures and faces danced in front of my closed eyes.

Suddenly it's lunch (11:30am). And I just want to microwave my mathbook to eat and some doofus can't understand that simple fact and is opening the book and explaining to me that the book is inedible. The words and pictures are slowly meandering about the page so I walk off still transfixed by the mathbook.

Then I'm sitting in my study hall and am beginning to come down off the trip. My head aches and every sound seems to be amplifyed. (It was different than a booze hangover, felt kinda like reality was making up for lost time, if I can describe it like that.) It's 1:35pm and I have a notebook full of what I had thought was really awesome drawings but now just looks like random squiggles on the pages. I really had to piss, so I went to the mens room. Then I realized the condom from almost 11 hours earlier is STILL ON ME!! That was lovely as you can imagine.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

During my history class, I began to wonder what had happened earlier on that day, how I'd gotten dressed and gotten to school. As I went to leave, I realized that I'd DRIVEN to school!! I shouldn't have even been able to FIND that car let alone drive it. The local PD should have seen me wandering in the thick of morning traffic with a car key in my hand and a perplexed look on my face! Sure enough though, the car was there, it was parked kinda funny and the windows were down, but it was there. So at this point I realized I was really hungry, got myself a greasy lunch/dinner and went home and to bed.

I've tripped only twice more since then and never as much as I did that time. Sorry I can't be more verbose with the dosages

Ok here goes...

It was another one of those nights where me and a few friends were gonig to smoke weed because we had nothing better to do in our junky little town. I had recently acquired two tabs of acid from a friend who was gonig to try his hand at selling some. The paper the acid was on was rather small and wraped in tin foil.

I suppose that before I go on, I should detail my experiences with mushrooms. I have always had a very high tolerance for mush. It got to the point where I would average 5 grams per dosage. One time me and my friends bought alot of mush and after I was done dividing it up I was left with a huge amount for just myself. I think it looked like about 9 grams. I ate it all and was pretty messed but wanted more (as always). When high on mush, everything agrees with me (EXCEPT people asking me if I am high, how high I am, etc.). Everything is more intense. Music is enjoyable, cigarettes are like candy and video games are like disneyland.

Anyways, I thought that since I didnt have to work till the next day in the late afternoon I would try my acid. I did it alone. I took the acid after me and a few friends had quite a big session of weed smoking. One of my friends there gave me two pieces of advice since he had already tried acid. For one, he said to not look in the mirror because you will think you just look fucked and all cracked out. The second thing he told me was to experience nature. I took his advice to heart, took one of the blotters of acid I had, and proceeded to wait for it to hit me.

About 1 and a half hours had past when I decided to take the other blotter because nothing was happeneing. We then went to this guys house and watched skate videos and played tony hawks skateboarding, both of which proved less than entertaining, especially since I was supposed to be getting messed. We went to smoke a join which I had rolled (it was very difficult although I was not very high yet) The joint got me baked but nothing else. All I felt was a feeling like I was lighter when I walked, I kind of bobbed when I walked as well. Also I felt kind of shitty too, a kind of uncomfortable feeling. We got back to the guys house after smoking the joint and watched more skate videos and still I had nothing but the junky feeling. All I noticed before I left was that the lights were really twinkly. I had to pee before I left so I went to the bathroom. I looked in the mirror. 'oh shit!' I said. I looked very very fucked. I almost looked like a girl. I had a twinkle in my eye and my hair looked like it had a female flair. I thought this was strange because when I am on mush I fall in love with myself in the mirror for long periods of time. I put this aside as me and my friends left the guys house. As we were driving home the clouds looked as though they were dancing, which was kind of cool but still nothing too spectacular.

As I arrived home I had some trouble unlocking my door and the grain of my wood door was, once again, dancing. I got inside and proceeded to my games room to play video games. The games were no more intense or difficult than had I been playing them normally. I beat one of the games and, dissapointingly, I decided to go to sleep.

I left the games room and had my first big hallucination. Everything around me took on a red color. I thought, 'hmm thats kind of neat.' as I walked down the hall to my red room. I walked in and closed the door and my King Kong doll yelled at me. But not the yell that it makes when you squeeze its hand. It made a realistic monkey noise. This scared me a little. Soon after this I decided that I wanted to listen to a cd that was downstairs. I also heard a tapping at my door. It was my cat. My cat is orange, very playful and very stupid and cute. It is the most harmless cat you have ever seen and honestly it looks so stupid and cute it makes me laugh. Well on acid, my cat turns into a demonical beast. It looked as though it had grown a mane and was a proud lion. This scared me alot so I decided to spare myself the mind fuck and went back to my room to listen to a different cd. Music wasn't really anymore intense than normal. The only difference was that every time it played a certain sound I was get kind of freaked out and every time it played another certain sound a white flash would come from nowhere.

Overall, acid and mushrooms simply do not compare. They are two very different drugs. With mush, everything agrees. With acid, it seems everything is up in the air. With mushrooms you can just chill and it can be fun. With acid, you need to be moving, seeing new things, thinking new thoughts, for it to really work out well.

If I were ever to do acid again, it would be with at least 2 friends and it would be out on the town with lots of weed. Every time I told someone I was on acid, they asked me who else was on it, to which I replied nobody and everyone thought this was a little fucked. Just a little warning to mushroomers everywhre that if you are looking for something like mush but more intense, acid is not what you are looking for. They are very different drugs.

Some experienced substance users may find this idiotic, but I have taken LSD alone on two occasions.  I have heard from numerous sources to always have a sitter while tripping.  Believe me, I would have loved to have someone keep an eye on me, but in my world that's not possible.  All my good friends are staunch Christians and sneer at me if I even mention Cannabis, never mind LSD. I had bought 3 hits a few months ago. Due to LSD's long duration I had difficulty finding a time to trip, as I was scared shitless of a night trip turning bad. Anyway, I dropped a blotter at around 2100 one night and had a rather disappointing 20 hour trip with none of the visuals I expected, although I enjoyed my music much like a Cannabis high. My other trip was rather different.

I had planned it for months.  My parents were going away for the weekend with my sister. I was rather relaxed and in a positive mood. My final year exams lay ahead but it did not bother me.  I had recently read Graham Hancocks 'Supernatural'(a brilliant read indeed!!!) and Dr. Rick Strassmans 'DMT- The spirit molecule' that opened up my 
interest in psychedelics and entheogens. So I thought that taking psychedelics for the correct reasons(spirituality, enlightenment and consciousness exploration)could only yield positive results. I did not know how to prepare for the trip, but I knew preparation was crucial in the experience.  So I listened to some Terence McKenna lectures, starting a week before the trip, to create the needed mindset. 

I dropped 1.25 blotter at around 0800 am.  By 0850 I was in the garden but feeling nothing, and thought I could just as well take the rest, so I dropped the remaining 3/4 hit.  By 0900, back in the garden, I noticed birds were moving comically faster, as if in a 1920's movie, and soon began seeing tracers.  By 0930 I was sitting by our fishpond delving into my own thoughts.  Suddenly I heard a disturbing and unnerving 
wail!  I would describe it as a wail of a dying Banshee.  It was long, shrill and painful and sounded, I would imagine, like a witch being burned at the stake.  This startled but also fascinated me, and I was not at all scared but rather perplexed.  I always have auditory hallucinations on Cannabis, which I use alone to boost my creativity and philosophical thinking, so maybe I was just used to trippy noises.

A number of minor events occurred, such as me hallucinating doors opening and closing, and patterns in the ceiling.  One major realisation was that my tubby ginger cat was with me throughout the trip, which was startling as he never even sits by me usually.  His ears were pointing towards all my auditory hallucinatios and it was as if he was protecting me in some way, and guiding me throughout the trip.  He could hear everything I heard and could even sense my emotions, as he always started comforting me as I started feeling the trip was too much.

I went to my room and popped in some Infected Mushroom (Classical Mushroom), which is an amazing CD on Weed, but was dissapointing on Acid.  I also listened to some Spectrum (it's Hardstyle Techno from my country, South Africa) which was interesting indeed.  I danced like a bell-end alone in the dark to freaky robot sounds, while laughing my ass off about life and all its little shits.  I moved to the television to watch anything that would take my mind off my excruciating headache I developed.  I watched 
everything from whacky cartoons to Fashion TV, which was amazingly freaky to realise the true beauty of a woman.  The Simpsons proved to be sickly funny and so reflective of modern day society, so it provoked thought and amused!

The moment that made the trip worthwhile was the movie 'Closer' with Jude Law and Natalie Portman.  I remember feeling sad and touched by the opening scene and the sad Damien Rice tune that lingered in the background.  I soon fell unconscious and awoke the next morning feeling relatively normal.  As I descended the stairs to make myself some coffee, I started crying.  I don't know why, but just thinking about that 
'Closer' opening scene made me cry like Keith Richards without his dealer.  I started thinking about my (currently vacant) love life, nature and the way that we humans are (using Terence's words) raping the planet. Although I was sad, my new emotional sensitivity was a welcome change to my normal masculine thought pattern. 

Overall this trip was interesting enough, but that one moment, the emotional impact, is what made all the difference.  It is not something I would try again soon because of the duration, but certainly in the future.

After Tripping a handful of times on Mushrooms, I had become increasingly curious as to what exactly an LSD trip was like, and when I stumbled across some potent gel caps through a friend of a friend, I almost had no choice but to buy them. The night after buying them, I got off of work and headed directly to my buddy Bonzi's house. We had tripped off of shrooms together many times prior, and had near identical experiences each time, so we both knew our levels of tolerance were virtually the same. We didnt end up dropping the cid until 9:15 PM. We sat in his gazebo for a good half-hour, waiting for his 'rents to go to sleep and for the trip to kick in.

By 10, we found ourselves slightly giggly and abnormally amused by sources of light (lighters, cell phones, street lamps), but nothing too intense. We headed inside to watch the idiot box. It is at this moment that we realize the futility of watching TV in a plain, unadorned room while tripping, and we both declare ourselves nearly stone-cold sober 2 hours into it. After 2-and-a-half, we declare the LSD bunk as hell. Both of us are dry on herbs, and after unsucessfully trying to mooch off of friends, we resort to the ultimate act of stoner desperation; we grab the dirtiest piece we can find and head out for a bowl cruise of straight res hits.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

By the time we're on our way it's Midnight. As I torch the living hell out of Bonzi's bowl for the third time, it becomes apparent that I am very unsober indeed, and I'm not just buzzing off of the very familiar THC coursing through my veins. The world outside of Bonzi's truck becomes growingly multi-dimesnional, and Disc 2 of the Gratfeul Dead's 'Without A Net', an album which I've listened to hundreds of times, gains a new potency. We crank the music up, melt into the instrumental interplay, and finally become aware of the magic of LSD. Next comes the night's biggest lapse of judgement.

On our way back to Bonzi's we notice a jeep is keeping perfect pace with us the entire time. When we glance back we notice it's two pretty-damn-cute girls. We slow down a notch, and they acellerate in front of us. When we notice the phish stickers on the back of their ride, we safely assume they're stoners like us, so we catch up. Before we know it, we're in the next town, and just as fast we're in the next county, only a few good miles out from getting into bumblefuck nowhere territory at the pace we're going. We find ourselves confused over whether it's us keeping pace with them or them keeping up with us. By the time we think of something cheesy to say, they veer off, and we it dawns on us that we have just followed two girls we didn't even know into the next county without even realizing it, and we conclude that we are in fact tripping.

We start to peak by the time we get back to Bonzi's. We're now listening to Disc 2 of Melon Collie and The Infinite Sadness by the Smashing Pumpkins in his driveway. I notice that when I stare at my reflection in the rearview mirror, The outside world begins to gradually dim, and then get increasingly lighter, just like when the clouds momentarily block the sun during the daytime, only it's about 1 in the morning now. I stare at the trees, and the tiny gaps between leaves and braches form faces, some of which turn blue and begin to fly away. The treelines in the distance begin to radiate a bright gold light, and the horizon slowly changes colors in a manner that seems almost completely natural. I look down at my knees, and an odd pattern of light, almost like real-life pixellation, follows as I slowly move my head.

Feeling almost confined, we decide to take a walk around Bonzi's extremely suburban, American-dream, upper-middle class neighborhood. We both decide that we could just as easily be roaming the Amazon rainforest, the Hidalayan mountains, or the surface of Jupiter. We find ourselves enamored with things as ordinary as bug zappers and streetlights. I get a sudden urge to learn the formula for LSD, and hand it out door to door. This is the peak of the trip, and therefore the most memorable moment. 

We watch the twisted anti-meth film 'Spun', which officially becomes the most hilarious movie-watching experience of my life, and it isn't a comedy. We smoke some more res hits as the sun rises, and the daylight adds a completely new element to the trip, which is now beginning to lessen. We take a morning drive, and find ourselves captivated by a large family of geese, camped by a pond. Even as I become sober, I have an increased awareness and appreciation of every precious breathe I take, and every thing around me, good or bad, trivial or significant, beautiful or ugly. LSD, unlike so many other drugs, is not a social lubricant, or even a way to escape harsh realities. It's a full-blown confrontation of those realities, only with a brand-new, previously hidden light casted onto them.

I saw something about Snow White the other day and it got me to thinking about my first acid trip. I was 16, and had recently just begun my venture into the world of drugs. Of course it all started with that horrible 'gateway' drug, marijuana. I always scoff any time I hear someone say that, but that's pretty much how it went down for me. I'd been smoking the dope for awhile and was ready to try something new. 

My friend Kevin and I were getting ready to go to a Cavs basketball game with my dad, and he had a couple hits in his pocket, and suggested I try one. This was in the days before pyramids and geltabs, microdots and every other kind of acid technology would later come up with. Those forms were supposed to be 'cleaner' but never seemed to pack the punch that I got from paper. Good ol' fashioned white blotters. Best 5 bucks you'd ever spend. And to think, all these kids are going crazy today over X, spending as much as $30 a hit to get one tenth the buzz.

I didn't know much about acid or what to expect. That was probably for the best. Kevin just said it would make me laugh and I would see some cool stuff. Sounded good to me. What could possibly go wrong? He said it would take about 30 minutes to an hour to kick in. It was about a 40 minute ride to the arena, so I figured we'd arrive, find our seats with my dad and then Kevin and I could wander around the arena just as it was kicking in. No big deal, right? I had no idea what was in store. 

Much to my surprise, my dad decided to stop off on the way for dinner at a local restaurant. Unexpected. This meant I was going to be sitting at a table right across from my unsuspecting father right as this awful drug was kicking in. We rode to the restaurant in complete silence, my dad driving and myself in the passenger seat. About half way there I began feeling cold and my leg started to shake. This overwhelming feeling of 'I know something you don't know' came over me. I dared not turn around and look at Kevin in the back seat. Just try and stay focused. Finally we arrived at the restaurant. We got out of the car. I looked at Kevin and he looked at me, at which point the silence was broken when Kevin said with a straight face 'pretty fuckin' funny, huh?' We both broke out into hysterical laughter. 

We somehow managed to make it through dinner, trying as best as we could to conceal that fact that our brains were tainted by psychotropic hallucinogens. Not an easy thing to do. Ever seen Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas when Johnny Depp tries to act normal while talking to the desk clerk in the hotel lobby? I can only imagine what my dad was thinking. We arrived at the game to see the sloppiest first quarter of basketball I've ever seen. The Cavs were playing the Orlando Magic, and it was like watching the Washington Generals vs the Washington Generals.

Several minutes went by without either team even getting a shot off. Turning the ball over, players falling down and tripping over each other, throwing the ball out of bounds. This was pure torture. I wanted to laugh so bad tears were coming down my face but seeing as there was nothing that a normal person would consider funny about the situation I had to hold back. My dad kept asking me if I was all right. I could only hunch over and pretend to have a stomachache. This was simply too much. It was time for Kevin and I to get out of there before my dad started to think something was up. 

We began to walk around the concourse. As we walked we both saw a strange boy, probably a few years older than us. Not sure if he was tripping too or if he had before and could tell we were under the influence and wanted to mess with our heads, but he stared directly at us with his beady little eyes and stuck his tongue out. Now what we saw was one of those big lizard kinds with the forked tongue. That was the first part of this experience that really freaked me out. I can only assume that he actually existed since we both saw him. A bit stunned, we continued on our way. 

We decided to stop and get some ice cream cones. The ice cream at the arena is soft serve, so we decided to get 2 large cones, chocolate and vanilla swirl. The cones were always fairly large, but on this particular day, who knows, maybe it was the drugs, but they seemed to be about 2 feet tall. We walked down the concourse with our ridiculously large ice cream cones, when suddenly we hear a voice from above - 'STOP!'

We froze dead in our tracks. Had someone somehow found us out??? We awaited our fate breathlessly. Then the voice spoke again. 'Everybody Limbo!!!' Suddenly we realized it was the public address announcer and limbo music began playing throughout the arena. Here we were, doing the limbo on acid while carrying 2 feet tall ice cream cones. Once again we broke into hysterical laughter. We decided to saunter upstairs and see what the world was like up there.

As we got to the top of the escalator, I noticed a balding fat man wearing a trench coat. This character was suspicious to say the least. He headed straight for us. He inched our way until he was standing about a couple feet away from me against the wall. He slowly turned his head and said 'pssssssst' Now this time I thought surely someone has found us out for real. This guy knows what we're up to and he wants to either expose us or join in the fun. Now I'm not sure if this guy was just slow but what he said next left me momentarily speechless. In an eerie whisper he leaned over and said 'where'd you guys get the icecream cones?' Not sure what the big secret was, or why he felt that he needed to whisper, but once again we broke into hysterical laughter. 

We got back to our seats just in time for the half time show. It was the Cavs wheel chair basketball team. Now there is nothing funny about disabled people, but under the circumstances this was almost too much. Just when I thought I couldn't take any more and was about to lose it another voice came over the loudspeaker. It was an advertisement for Disney on Ice and a tiny sounding Disney voice said at what seemed like a million miles an hour 'sleepyhappydopeygrumpysneezybashfuldoc!!!!' What I heard was more like 'stumpy lumpy dumpy grumpy wheezy trash-ho cock' I choked back my laughter. My dad turned and looked at me and again asked if I was ok. I again hunched over and pretended to moan in pain. The rest of the game/trip was more of the same. 

All in all it was fairly pleasant for a first trip. Probably best that I didn't know too much about the drug going in. Otherwise I might have been a bit paranoid. My second trip did not go nearly as well. Not knowing much about acid I of course didn't know about acid hang over either, and I was able to parlay it into a sick day from school the following morning. I slept like a baby.

It was summertime, and a few friends and myself were at a music festival in the appalachian mountains. I had used lsd and mushrooms several times in the past, and enjoyed the experiences. We found a campsite, set up our tents, and proceeded to make a few puchases. I found a ten-strip of what the girl described to be really good hits. I walked back to the campsite, and ingested three of them. I sat back and relaxed, as was my normal pre-trip ritual.

The effects came on much stonger than ever before, the effects were more potent than any other trip in about one hour. I became really anxious and started to fidget with the dried up pine needles on the ground. My one friend asked me if I was feeling alright, I told him I was thirsty. We walked up to the check-in/store, it was really crowded in there. My face began to tingle, and my hands became cold and sweaty. The number of people in there made me nervous, so I was relived to walk out of there with my soda.

We got back, and decided to walk the trails with three other friends. When we started to walk I became much happier, and the visuals were unbeliveable. After what seemed to be and hour or two of intense laughter and distortions we arrived back at the site. I then walked down to this swampy pond to listen to the echos of these bullfrogs calling with another person. I think it is there that I totally lost contact with reallity.

He later told me that I ate another hit down there started to shake a tree, and walked off. The next thing I remember was arriving at these peoples campsite saying hello, and sitting down at the perimeter. I then began to think about how limited I was by my three dimensions of physical movement. Proceeded by trying each and every combination back then forth at different speeds.

After that the strangers there became nothing more than symbols of my emotions. I became fixated on the fire, then stuck my face very close to the burning wood. My emotions then proceeded to pull me away, I then began to try to get past them using every movement I could think. I would get past one then another would stop me. I cant remember how long I tried for, but I eventually ended up in this circular parking lot with many people.

I began to look at the licence plates on the back of the cars, and every single car was from a different state. I wonder how I made the the licence plates appear all diferent, because I know that it was not likely that they were all from different states. I looked up and saw and heard three different scenes, one of a back tire of a dirtbike kicking dirt up, another of firecrackers poping, and the third of different groups of people walking around.

This excitment made me very paranoid, and then began to distrust every single peson in the area. They were there for me, and I had to keep them away. I kept them away with a geometrical game of equations, which makes no sense to me now but did at that moment. I made a mistake and they all began to close in very fast. I became very afraid more afraid than I can remember being since I was a child. I blacked out, and ended up on some trail flat on my stomach.

I was diging into the ground with my bare hands, the smell of the moist black dirt was beautiful. Someone picked me up, and put me on thier shoulder. I couldn't speak so I just kicked, I feel bad now cause I did hit someone. They dropped me and I belived for some reason that I was 'doomed', I reached in my pocket without thought. I pulled out my keys and slid them across my throat. Luckily they didn't even scratch.

I thought about what I just did, and was able to gather my thoughts. I then realized that it was pitch dark out, and I needed to get back to my campsite which I had no idea how to get to. I walked up to these guys camping, and asked one if he could show me back to the store he did, which wasn't too far. I found a couple friends standing near my car, whom I was very glad to see. They told me I had been gone for eight hours, and they had been looking for a bit.

I was still off for an hour or two, which I spent listening to music in my tent.

It was fairly late one night in the early summer. At around 11:30 my friend Matt and I decided to stay up late and partake in an LSD experience. What I had was actually one really large square on the plain kind of blotter without pre-sized squares, and it was about 2 large hits' worth. Anyway, we decided to go for a walk to compliment the onset of the experience.  The setting was a pleasant residential area.

Walking on the sidewalks was great.  We talked the whole time, but I don't remember any of the subjects now.  Both of us kept forgetting what we were talking about. It was really funny in the beginning, but after about the 4th or 5th time you could say it was kind of getting to us.  It was strange how it kept happening to both of us. The conversations shifted towards our memories, long-term and short term.  Matt had the notion that we should carry notepads from then on and constantly write down thoughts that we wouldn't want to forget, so that we would have a lot of information to review when we were older, most of which we would have forgotten by then.  Seems like an okay idea, right?

After that moment, there was a long period of time when we both kept forgetting what we were talking about.  It was a loop, we kept finding ourselves with no memory of the entire hours-long conversation.  'What were we talking about, seriously?  Something about memory... uh...?'  and then we would both laugh about how we kept forgetting about forgetting.  It was a very bizarre thing to be happening to both of us at the same time.  I've wondered if Matt was just messing with me, but now for some reason I don't believe it's true. Hopefully that'll make more sense when you're done reading.

Well we came to the conclusion that all the frustration was coming from our grasping at our memories.  We were thinking that we somehow could and should improve the memory parts of our brains and get some benefit to our knowledge, or wisdom.

Something we learned that night was that we shouldn't try to control our own memories. They'll naturally fade away, which is okay.  Everything that is natural is ultimately okay.

On a deeper level, we learned how to let go.  Our memories aren't the only part of us that come and go naturally and spontaneously. Actually, I believe every aspect of our lives occurs somehow spontaneously and beyond 'our' control.  Basically, when we become self-conscious and grasp at ourselves and try to somehow control our natural processes, we go against the course of nature. We seem to do it because we want to make our minds more trustworthy.

Months after our trip around the merry-go-round, I read The Way of Zen, by Alan Watts.  In it, Watts describes the liberated person basically as someone who has seen the fruitlessness of grasping at oneself and stops trying as a result.  According to Watts, that's what's called Nirvana.  The opposite of frustrating self-consciousness.  Of course many thinkers have attached other ideas to Nirvana but mainly the idea is liberation from the whirlwind of trying to figure everything out.  

That was the state we were in when we finally said 'Forget it!' and relaxed. We figured, 'you just forget it, but don't TRY to forget it'. We didn't even discuss it or think about it much.  We didn't have to TRY to relax, we just let go. It was perhaps the greatest, most peaceful moment of my life.

Our nerves were calmed, and I noticed the glow in the sky that comes before the sunrise.  I realized we had been in Matt's bedroom most of the night, so we decided to go outside and experience the twilight.  It was magical.  With the knots in our minds blissfully unraveled, we immediately discovered an appreciation for the Here and Now.  A strong focus on the present actually turns out to be a common type of mystical experience. We'd never heard of anything about that before this time.  It just came naturally.  We both had an enormous sense of being present and purely, clearly aware.  It was an amazing experience beyond words. Just for fun, I'll say it was rather like sharpening a fuzzy picture, or wiping the dust off a mirror and feeling like 'oh yeah, that's how it's supposed to look'.  It was a very brilliant, glowing state of consciousness that still lingers today.

I could feel the LSD in my system again now that I was fully aware. I suggested to Matt that we get up off the porch and explore.  We went to his backyard and by then the sun had been up for a while, so everything was glistening with the dew. 

It was marvelous.  We observed the nature there... bugs and birds, all kinds of plants around us, and the smell, the feeling, taste of the fresh morning air.  Everything we could sense simply came to us naturally, just like it's supposed to. We didn't have to listen for sounds or look to see.  Just being aware and present in the Here and Now, a most fundamental part of life, became ecstatic and without any certain drive to do so for some meaningful purpose.  It was a lot like dancing.  For the first time since we were children, we were alive.  Brightly, blissfully, being.

Some friends and I had just moved into an apartment straight outta high school and were reaping the rewards of an independent and free lifestyle. We had dropped acid twice before, but on the third trip of our apartment, it was all about the setting. 

A friend brought 10 hits of acid over to the apartment around 5:00 pm and the three of us cut out a few doses to eat. I ate 2 and sat back to let it soak. After we had all finished, we put the rest in the freezer and walked up to the store. Effects first began as we bought our food and walked back to the apartment. There were some odd body sensations coupled with the excitement of the onset of our trip. We got back, took some bong rips and watched the tell-tale tracers begin with the burning ends of smoked cigarettes. We decided to take a walk...

Our apartment is located right near a University campus, giving us plenty to walk to. There is a specific science building that is structurally insane to look at, even completely straight. All the walls are unparallel, with brick side bulging out, seemingly defying all sorts of natural laws. Facing this building is a park of sorts, with large grassy hills, a fountain, winding paths and artwork scattered throughout. 

We laid at a 45 degree angle on a grassy hill and stared into the enormity of the white, cloudless sky above us. Almost immediately the colors began to swirl and pattern on the gigantic clear canvas of the sky like a Windows Media Player design. The trees began with their own swirls of color and the city light began to come on with the fading of nightfall. The moon had light halos dancing around it as it became visible. We quickly realized that unless we really focused, we would never leave this place, and so with our combined force, we began walking back. As we did this, we discovered a whole other side of this park with diagonal trails through flowers and the such. It took all the willpower we could muster to turn away and head back.

Upon arrival at the apartment, several other roommates had made their way back from their daily activities, and joined in the trip by eating the rest of the acid. It was by now 10:30 pm and we got comfortable in our living room. Another bong was packed and the marijuana went down smooth as ever. Whenever I smoked any marijuana at all during this trip, it seemed to kick the trip into overdrive. We turned out the lights and set candles under a houseplant on the table. The light from the candles flickered the leaves' shadows across the ceiling, making a show that danced with the music and could be manipulated by someone's movement. But the fun was being able to travel from room to room to explore endless environments for the trip. 

I spend a good portion of the evening sitting on a couch in my room and staring at the sharp, stucco textured walls. Small paths of electrical color were shooting between each ridge on the wall and the texture became very pronounced and then receded back, almost like breathing. A pattern that looked very much like a snowflake or frost would wallpaper across my entire vision, on the ground, on the walls, on my arm or anywhere I looked. My hand had gotten a circuit board look to it and upon looking at my face in a mirror, I saw my features would distort and melt around my face. I experienced countless other visuals that I could describe forever, but another good part of the trip were the mentals, the ideas that crossed my mind. I have been reading The Electric KoolAid Acid Tests recently, which is a background of the acid scene of the 60's. That book greatly influenced some of the ideas that shot across my mind faster than I could keep up. 

No sleep was to be had this evening so a roommate and I went back to the park. We found a corner with benches that was in sand. We began to trace the patterns that we were seeing into the sand. We covered an entire area with these patterns, then moved onto larger sculptures. We spent about an hour creating a tree figure with a face and branches that ran out in all directions. It felt great to channel some of the creative energy of the acid trip into a physical manifestation of that creativity. The entire thing was about 7 feet long and was worth every second we spent on it. It was approximately 2:30 am when we made it back to the apartment again. The rest of my morning was spent relaxing and watching the fading signs of my trip appearing on walls. 

My wonderful experience on this trip was due mainly to the setting of the trip.

Set: mentally relaxed, having abstained from LSD and other psychedelic use for several months following a period of sustained heavy use. In a period of slight uneasiness trying to figure out career goals and options. Mentally tossing around the idea of pursuing a minor in religious studies at school to supplement my psychology degree.

Setting: my apartment, the surrounding area. This is in a small city in upstate New York famous for two of its colleges. The immediate neighborhood is zoned as heavy commercial (grocery store, auto shop, etc.) but it is within 5 minutes of woods, 20 of a waterfall.

T + 0: Having obtained some 'pink pyramids' which turned out to be good blotters, I ingest my first along with my girlfriend and roommate. This is my girlfriend's (called A for the sake of this story) first trip. My roommate (call him N) has tripped twice before, both with me after hearing about some of my experiences with psychedelics. So, I end up being the 'wise old man' when it comes to drug/psychology questions. This role is partially flattering and partially uncomfortable. 

T + 1hr.: We begin by telling light hearted stories, listening to music, making jokes, and smoking a prodigious amount of good outdoors cannabis. This particular strain is very smooth and good tasting, and we end up consuming a LOT over the course of the evening. 

T + 2.5hr: The peak of the first hit occurs around 6:30pm or so. We decide to go on a walk at this point after smoking a couple more bowls. Walking along the street we all comment on the sensation of being dissociated from our legs as we walk... we seemingly glide across the pavement on a back road towards the waterfalls.

T + 3hr: We spend some time at the base of a large waterfall. This is part of a state park, which is closed since it is after dark. At one point we hear voices and see figures across the water on the other side, coming down a trail. Assuming them to be park rangers we try to blend into the darkness. Eventually, the figures get into a car and leave. We leave soon thereafter and walk back to the apartment.

T + 4hr: Upon return we smoke several bong loads. Me and N take another hit each, A takes a half. We become engaged in a rather abstract and freewheeling conversation about a variety of topics. 

T + 5hr: During the course of this extended conversation my first visual disturbances appear. These consist of faces in the carpet, fluid movement in the wood grain of our walls, and some minor halo or aura effects. My visuals never become very pronounced during the trip despite the heroic amount of marijuana smoking we did.

T + 6.5hr: We decide to put in a movie, and I ask A to select one that she wants to see. She decides on the anime Akira, which I had recommended to her another time. We watch it, completely blown away by the storyline and visual effects, which seem perfectly suited for an acid trip. 

T + 10hr.: We decide to go on another walk to smoke a joint on a bridge near our apartment. The walk is much colder than the last as the night has become quite chilly. We come to the bridge, only to find a new fence around it. This especially upsets N, who gets very scared and wants to leave. We do end up going to a park nearby to smoke. 

T + 11hr.: Back at the apartment I set into drinking a six pack of Sam Adams Ocktoberfest. N has some Molsons and A abstains. I tell her drinking a little might help with possible insomnia, but she has no problem with that... she drifts off to sleep as we watch Cartoon Network.

T + 13hr.: It is the early hours of the next morning, sometime around 6am or so when I finally carry A up to bed and we pass out. Sleep comes quickly, but is accompanied by an odd dream where I am a street hot dog vendor who is serving little people in my buns rather than hot dogs. I wake up after sleeping almost 11 hours and feel extremely refreshed.

In the aftermath of this experience we spent the rest of the weekend in quiet contemplation, cleaning and studying for school. We decided to lay off marijuana for a few days because the smoking gave us all sore throats. All of us feel very much refreshed and renewed by the experience.

Some themes that came up during the trip for me were the paralells between Akira and the current U.S. military situation (deals with weapons of mass destruction, armed revolt, etc.), my ever growing love and dependence on A, my future career as a psychologist and the place of religion within that, and a contemplation of the multi-layered reality of existence. We coined a new phrase to explain away inconsistencies: 'It's all layers.' This, I think, gives me a sense of satisfaction in that I don't have to attempt to fit everything in my mind into one united scheme, it all operates on different layers for different times...

I had been trying to get LSD for a very long time where I live. Even though its a college town, its hard to find acid. I've done mushrooms many times, roughly 20. I've taken 2c-i twice, as well as 2c-e. The trip I am reporting about is my third LSD experience. My first being 5 or 6 days prior to my third. I love psychedelics, so I had to buy as much acid as I could, WHILE I could.

I watched my friend drop the LSD onto 2 sugar cubes. 1 hit on each cube. I ate the acid 2 days later, around 2pm. 30-45 minutes after taking the acid, I had a wonderful body high. My face was somewhat numb which was awesome. My body felt very strange. Similar to mushrooms, but different. The first visual change was color getting very bright along with tracers. I would look at my friends face and it would melt right in front me of. Now when I say melt, it was like his face was liquid and it was moving around. I was watching TV, and I remember something popping out like it was in 3D. We went over to my friend B's girlfriends house. I had never met her or been to her house, so it was strange when I got there. Her room was in the basement of her parents house, but we go in through the back, the ceiling was about 7 ft, if even that. I walk in and look up, I couldnt tell if the ceiling was really that low, or if it was just me tripping, so I reach up and touch it to make sure. The walls of her room are pink, which made everything else sort of pink. By this time everything im looking at is melting and im just sitting in this chair laughing my ass off because its so fucking crazy and weird. 

My friend A let me use his iPod. He put it on some crazy trance/house music, and I just went outside, and sat down turned up the volume all the way, and looked at all these trees and shit in her back yard. I was looking at the trees and I could see the branches growing and moving, like the tree had a mind of its own and it was trying to grab something. I couldnt stop looking at the iPod screen. The letters in the words would grow and shrink and the spaces between the letters and the words would expand and shrink. I was so amazed by this. I saw kaleidescope patterns almost everywhere. Evrything was surrounded by a rainbow colored aura. It was pretty much like a prism. I felt completely out of reality. Never once was I scared, I didnt have a bad trip. I was having so much fun trying to comprehend my visual field. That, and the weird body high that I had was fucking amazing. I ended up driving my car even though I was tripping. My friend A is a pretty hefty guy. Bout 250 maybe im not sure. Anyway, he was in the passenger seat,and as I was driving, I could FEEL his body weight. I could feel the car leaning to the right side, like it was sinking. I melted through my seatbelt a couple of times. It felt like I wasnt even in the car a lot of the time.

LSD is an amazing substance. Its very strong and very intense. Psychedelics are something I will never stop doing. Psilocybin and LSD have changed my life in a wonderful way.

As a sort of flip side to my submission titled:'God or Insanity', in which I describe an LSD experience with my father, I felt compelled to share another experience which is an example of what can happen when (through my interpretation),ego and arrogance decide that they are more powerful than the drug.

In the months following the experience described in the other submission, I felt a presence, a sort of new found wisdom, clarity, and happiness toward life... However, gradually, my ego began to become dangerously intertwined with the experience; it slowly crept in and began a kind of claiming of responsibility for this new gift, twisting it in a way that was not honest. I don't recall if, in the back of my mind, I was aware of this or not at the time, but if so, that crafty ego was successful at pushing it far enough back so as to be ignored.

At any rate, the 3 months that followed were the best of my life. My relationship with my father was incredible and I felt at peace and genuinely happy. Paragraphs full of wisdom would come from my mouth, coming without any thought at all, surprising all who knew me, including myself. This, I thought, was something that had to be shared with my brother.

My brother has always been a tormented person. He has great difficulty letting go of pain. His relationship with Dad was always rocky at best. So when I mentioned to Dad the idea of including Bro in our gift, he thought it was a good idea, and plans began. Apparently we were now Gods and would take it upon ourselves to make decisions for my brother; in his own best interest of course.

We informed my bro of the plan, which was to go into the mountains, rent a cabin and reproduce the experience shared by dad and I. Bro was very resistant to the idea of the LSD, but didn't want to pass up the chance to do some bonding with Dad.  (I feel it necessary here to defend dad on this whole thing. There was nothing in the world he wanted more than to have a relationship with his son. As wrong as this whole thing was, it was born out of love. (As for me, I was just pretty much selfish and hoped to expand on the gift I had been given.)

Once at the cabin, we all partook in a tab and a half and began talking about life. After an hour or so I didn't feel 'high' enough so I ate another tab and a half. 

The conversation was good for a while, but eventually I began to talk without a breath for what seemed like forever. When Dad asked if he could get a word in, I said, 'Just overpower me,' ego full throttle now. Dad snapped back, 'listen to yourself....' Well these three words triggered a hellishly abusive, psychologically damaging, introspective character assassination on myself which I in fact still battle with at times to this day. All of the clarity and joy that had been present since the previous experience, was suddenly replaced with insanity, fear, and a despair that can only be understood by those who have experienced the abyss of darkness induced by a catastrophic trip. Would I ever recover from this? I deserved it didn't I? Who the hell did I think I was? God? ....Well God sure put me in my place that day. The rebuilding, I knew, could take a lifetime.

Surprisingly (or maybe not), my brother was actually the dominant figure that evening. He was the only one who went in without any disillusioned ideas of what would occur that evening. He, for a change, was the pillar of strength. He didn't have any mystical experiences, but I think he actually gained some confidence seeing his 'stronger,' older brother reduced to a babbling moron, and his father struggling to explain himself. As to exactly what happened between he and Dad that night I don't know deatails due to my being trapped in my own hell, but from what dad told me, it was the worst night of his life. Suffice to say, our desired effect was far from realized. He described his nightmare that evening to me months later, once we had enough distance from the night to actually discuss what happened. He was enclosed in a capsule, slightly larger than the size of his body, the capsule permanently sealed by the hand of God, and floating through space for eternity,,,, in total darkness,,,, alone.

While the whole thing was indeed a setback, there was no choice but to look it in the eyeballs, and learn everything possible from the experience. In fact it has only deepened my respect for the drug, rather than instill any sort of fear of it. Using the drug the way that we did here was a recipe for disaster. When I began to think that I was more powerful than the drug I should have backed off for a while and gotten a grip. BEWARE OF EGO.

I am far enough away from that experience now that I think I have a pretty good handle on what happened and why. At first, it was sort of like surviving a violent hurricane, then climbing a nearbye mountain and looking down upon the wreckage to better assess the damage. Now the view of the landscape looks even better than it did before the hurricane, though there are still some areas which remain under construction.

I was clinically diagnosed with Bipolar disorder about 2 months before I had tried acid the first time, and was fearful since I was taking MAOI's, but curiosity got the best of me. My first acid trip was off of one blotter square, and I didn't really think that I was tripping. This was average acid [my experienced friends who took the same stuff said so], but I didn't get any large scale hallucinations, just saw a wave or two on the floor. I noticed that my thought process was a little different. It let me observe my actions and the actions/reactions of others from many different perspectives. This mild trip led me to trying it again.

The second time we got the same stuff again and I decided to take two hits. What a difference it made, but my friends told me that the second time you trip is always more intense than the first [unless you get weak acid]. I had great hallucinations and in great numbers. I would sometimes see skulls and weird faces when I would look at things, which might be perceived as scary, but I have a strong mind and realized it was just a drug. I then began to have extremely deep thoughts about the beginning of time, the creator of this world ['The unmoved mover'], and the many discrepancies pertaining to the real world. These mystical/religious thoughts made me think about my depression and the reasons for it. I realized that my depression had come from my mind thinking downly upon myself, and then it became so strong that it actually became a physical problem. With this in mind I figured that if my mind could create a physical problem, that it respectively can take it away. I took each insignificant bad thought that had built up to my depression and analyzed it, until I realized that life is just one big journey/experiment, or trip as you may call it, and told myself why each painful memory wasn't bad enough to cause myself this mental pain.

After a long meditative cleansing of my mind and soul I felt rejuvenated, as if I had been reborn. I then received one of the greatest feelings in my life I had mentally destroyed my physical depression! The rest of the trip became extremely wonderful, I saw 'happy colors' everywhere, and I even started to geek out for about 15 minutes or so [not exactly sure how long, my concept of time was severely altered]. This made acid become my favorite drug of choice, not including marijuana. My friends told me about the dangers of bad trips and I believe that bad trips can be easily prevented if you have a strong mind/will.

Okay, this happened a while ago so the info might not be exactly correct but here is what happened to the best of my memory. I had taken acid about 5 times before this and I feel that I was not a novice but I was certainly not prepared for what was to unfold.

I was around 17 and my friend 'Wally' and I had planned an adventure unlike any other we had experienced before. Our friend 'Jim' had gotten the acid for us and would be joining us on the trip. I work at K-Mart and got off work at 4:30, Jim came to K-Mart as soon as I got off and from there we proceeded to Wally's house.

Around 4:45 we were all together in Jim's car driving along. He gives us each 2 sweet tarts with acid dropped on them and he took 3 himself. I can safely say that by 5:30 we were all tripping VERY HARD. Jim was sick of driving so we went back to K-Mart's parking lot (where my car was) and I started driving around. 

*DO NOT DRIVE WHILE ON ACID, I'VE WRECKED MY CAR ON A LATER TRIP* 

So I'm driving around and we decide to stop and get hats for our adventure. Where do we go? A gas station of course. We were so out of it that for at least 5 minutes we looked in the cooler where the sodas were thinking that hats were there. We then looked at each other and said 'there's no hats in a cooler' and laughed like crazy. I'm sure everyone thought we were nuts, and we were.  

We then drove around the country listening to Ween, The Mollusk. Very trippy. We see this scary tree and pull over at the side of the road to investigate. Jim and Wally cross the street (I never did, I was afraid of getting run over) and go completely crazy. Wally was walking around like an ape and Jim was nowhere to be seen. It was fairly dark outside and I couldn't see very well. I called for Wally and Jim to come back to the car cause I was starting to lose it. Wally came back laughing like a loon. Jim didn't respond at all.

I think Wally began to get scared too and he started to call out for Jim too. I began to think that we would have to leave him in the tree forever -Suddenly a cry of pain came out. Jim had jumped out of the tree thinking it was only a few feet but it was really a lot more than that. Thank God I thought, we can leave now.

We all got in the car and drove back into town. This is where I think I've heard the most utterly insane thing ever spoken. Jim was in the back seat and said 'Hey guys, I have something really important to say.' Wally and I turn around to hear what he will say. Jim says 'Scooby Doo makes me cry' with a totally straight face. Wally and I crack up for the longest time. Jim didn't even know he said it. He told us what he meant to say but it was never remembered.

We're back into town now, and I decide I would like to visit my friends party for a few minutes. Jim and Wally aren't really up to it but fuck them, I'm driving. It was a couple of days before Halloween so of course this was a Halloween Party. I park and the others decide they want to walk around while I'm at the party. That was cool with me so we parted ways for a second.

I don't know what happened to them, but I sure as hell had one crazy ass time. As I climb up the stairs to Eric's apartment I had a good scare. The UGLIEST girl I thought I've ever seen said my name. Thank God it turned out to be Eric in a costume

When I got inside all I wanted to do was escape all of the scary people in their costumes. There is thankfully a smoking room in the apartment with a ton of black lights and I ran up there. I was the only one in the room and I saw all the walls spin around me. It was so cool. I was lost in thought when I suddenly remember the other two and began to worry about them. I left quickly to find them.

The parking lot showed no sign of them and quite honestly I was scared shitless. As I walked in a circle not knowing what to do I kept hearing voices from all directions whispering gibberish in my ear. I was so scared the only thing I could think about was leaving them to wonder the town with a head full of acid as I drove to the safety of my home. But I couldn't, I knew that would be a very bad idea. All of a sudden I see them walking up to the parking lot laughing and having a good time - boy was I relieved.

They told me something about them rolling down a hill but I couldn't understand, I wish just so happy to see them. I'm not exactly sure what time it was then so I'll have to guess around 8:00. We were all ready for a short break so we drove to a grocery store to get something to eat. (It made sense at the time okay.) Jim was the only one with any money at all so we walked around telling Jim what was good to buy. It was so bright and weird inside, we finally decided to get caramel apples to eat and we got in line to purchase them. 

All things fell apart in the line. We tried to keep a straight face, but I honestly believe that was impossible for us in the state that we were in. As soon as it was our turn to pay we started laughing very loudly. The lady at the cash register gave us a look like she was going to kill us. (She was very pissed off.) We somehow got out of the store and into my car. We ate the apples in my car in the parking lot. We sat there for at least 10 minutes, it must have looked very strange.

At this time I began to get a very large surge of fear and I wanted to go home, so I told everyone that I had to go home. They were both pissed off, they just couldn't understand what I was feeling. I dropped Jim off at one of his friends house. It was just Wally and myself now. Not quite knowing what to do I drove back to the grocery store parking lot. I was scared to go home because I was a total mess and I thought my mom would have a huge fit.

As we were sitting in the parking lot I tried to explain to Wally what I was feeling but he was pretty much out of it. I told him that all the beer bottles in my car and the fact that I was dirty as hell with pupils the size of quarters was making me worry. He told me to relax and that we could go to his house for a little while. This sounded like a very good idea so that's where we went.

When we got there we went down to his basement quickly to avoid his parents. Of course as soon as we got down there what do we see but his mom. Thankfully so was drunk so she didn't bother us. We played ping pong for a couple of minutes and I gathered up enough nerve to go home and face my mom whom I thought would yell at me like no tomorrow.

When I got home I was much relieved to find that my mom only was a little bit mad that I missed Saturday evening church. The weird part was that she gave me a chocolate chip cookie that she baked that day. Holy Crap, I felt so good to know that I got away with going insane for the 5 hours. I was home and everything was going to be okay.

I later found out that Jim took an 1/8 ounce of shrooms later that night. Damn, he must have fried hard. I've had many more trips since then but that one was special because it was the first real adventure where I went around totally crazy. All in all, I had a very positive experience. Sorry about how long this is, but I feel I needed to use some detail. Peace Out!

I had just turned 17 and was at a jungle party. Time was not really something I kept track of that evening and you'll probably understand why. I had dropped about 18 hits of liquid on my tongue around 10 pm. It was supposed to be just another routine acid trip where I'd dance around to some jungle music and possibly eat a grape fruit. I was happily dancing around until midnight and then I was summoned by my bf H. The 16 year old, G, who I'd recently met was in the handicap stall of the womens bathroom. She most obviously drunk by the look of her. She normally looks like she's been mistaken for a clapboard fence and been white washed. It all looked like a movie I'd seen on Lifetime, Television for Women with my mom when I was around 12. Her face was turning a little blue, but that might have been the LSD, I was seeing intense swirly bobs. Her body was shaking and she just looked confused. I couldn't stand to look at her.

Her boyfriend, J was laying near her and H was just standing there, knowing that all was lost. That was when it hit me or when I heard H tell me what had happened. It seems G was pregnant and she had just told J she'd had an abortion while I was jumping around like a giddy Homer Simpson. I looked back up at her and an incredible force to the back of my body and I was flying down some black hole where people played bongo drums and G's little fetus was playing other fetus's in a wading pool. They looked so happy. It is as though the little fetus was trying to tell me something. Or G was. I fell down into this little white room hearing everything G had ever said to me. It just echoed and echoed and then it fell away and I was floating in the atmosphere, and what felt like back down to my body.

I got my sight back and looked at her again. My curiosity was moving at rapid speeds. I felt like a tour guide on a safari bus that was making its way through all of this. The room began to move like the gravitron ride at county fairs. I ran over to the trash can and threw up. H tried to comfort J or at least get him off of that disgusting ground, but he wasn't having it. He wouldn't cry either, he just laid there, he looked like a bitter old man. For some reason A, who I don't think has ever smoked pot appears. He's tall and quaky looking. He's 6'4 and sort of big. H takes off his sweatshirt and pulls it over G's head. A flips her over his shoulder and she looks like she's very drunk. The hood is covering her face. We exit the party very quickly, and for every reason I've ever been called a madwoman I wanted to lift up G's jeans and see if her legs are discolored for any some such reason. G doesn't say anything. She's silent, almost catatonic.

As the situation wore on, I became almost accustomed to it, as though it wasn't real. I was just tripping on acid and I had walked into a movie on Sundance or something. This was not happening to me. I most certainly did not know anyone who could ever get pregnant. God no. Children are delivered by storks. The world was looking bright and things were growing in size and I was taking little field trips in my mind to places like Alice and Wonderland and the Brady Bunch. Hell I was trying on Marcia's clothes. And then I'd make my way back to the generic movie channel and I'd be there.

H drives a 2-door sardine can and it is very funny to watch A inside of it because he has to stick his head out the window or put his head out the sunroof, but for some reason, I'm the one who's driving. Because H almost ran down two pedestrians while driving on MDMA at 4 am. A is too preoccupied and I don't think that J or G are in any condition to operate a vehicle. As H is getting into the back seat in a car that defines compact, I stop to watch the scene going on in the backseat. A silent girl who has just lost her fetus is sitting next to one very small window and in the middle is her bf who has finally given into crying and is clutching her like he is the oyster and she is the pearl. I imagine God to be a pearl hunter trying to take him away from her.

I begin to drive and I feel like I'm some race car driver on TV and I start running through the channels again, which while operating an automobile is never a good idea. I get to Animal Planet and I'm running from a wolf into a Home Depot commercial. For some horrible reason and only a mechanic can tell me exactly why, but the car started smoking. H got out and tinkered around. A, G, and J didn't even notice that the car had stopped. I began to drive again, but the car humped and jumped and A asked why. H responded that the power steering was gone. I turned around while still operating the vehicle to yell at him 'You Drive!' He said let us live and watch the road. I could at that point only wonder what the hell sort of God creates situations such as these?

I continued to drive on, completing my task was imperative to the survival of my team members, or at least that was how I thought of it. I suddenly knew what it was like to be a soldier, a crusader for a cause. Don't ask me why. I was cut off by some asshole in a silver Taurus and finally noticed that there were other cars on the road. I began frantically yelling out the window, 'Go home! It's not Tuesday!' In LA, the traffic is at its worst on Tuesdays and this was an early Saturday morning, these people had no right to be out of their homes. None whatsoever. H warned me that a militia from Montana was going to lynch my Jewish ass if I didn't shut the hell up and at the time I believed him. I imagined angry rednecks coming at me with beer bottles, shot guns, pitch forks and I suddenly really wanted to know how Timothy McVeigh was doing.

The next thing I knew H's car was in my driveway and we were quietly walking up the path. I stood outside looking at my neighborhood, which at that time of year had trees blooming pink flowers everywhere. The trees were folding into each other and waving good night to us. I must have stood out there for a while because when I went into the house (H had my keys) A was in my room watching Bob Vila and someone had put out a blow up bed where J and G appeared to be sleeping. H was reading a Seventeen magazine left over from 1996. My visuals were dwindling at that point so I wandered down stairs to get myself some orange juice. Along the way were pictures of my family and I stopped to look them. That is when the evenings events truly hit me. I felt my own mortality. For a moment I had felt a being die inside of me. It was the acid, but still. As I looked at the pictures of my family I wondered what would have happened if I'd never been born.

A very frightened me ran back up the stairs and started pounding on my parents door, seeing trails of everything I ran past. My dad groggily answered the door in his plaid PJ's and asked what the fuck was I doing and was I on drugs? I very solemnly answered yes and told him I loved him. We went down stairs to talk. I informed him of the evenings events and being his usual self he laughed at me and told me stories about his own acid trips, including my favorite. A very funny one about a Japanese guy with an Oklahoman accent. He was a hitch hike to Woodstock kind of hippie.

Afterwards I went out and bought 10 boxes of condoms and wandered around distributing them. I'll always wonder what the hell became of that little fetus that I never got to talk to and if I didn't know it before, I do now, that everyone is mortal, there is no escaping that. Also if you enjoy the idiot box do not travel through it. It will never be the same again. Peter Jennings has my deepest sympathies for reasons that would make a grown man piss in his pants out of fear.

The event was inspired by a previous tripping experience we had. Here is a brief background that led up to the day.

This was the second time I'd had lsd, the first time was a couple of months before and I loved it. 5 out of 8 of my friends had gone completely crazy the first time, their minds got stuck in personal hells and vowed never to do it again. The first time, one of my friends who flipped out couldn't say anything except 'key to the zoo' and was obsessed, ringing random numbers on his phone asking people about the key. He was acting kind of like a monkey and trying to trade various objects of no value (like his socks) with anyone. At some point in the night, we decided that perhaps it would be cool to trip at the zoo, so 2 months later that's what we did.

I was looking forward to this day for weeks due to the fact that the first trip I had was such an uplifting and positive experience. I'd heard that setting was important, and a relaxing environment was necessary but the first time we had gone to see the fireworks in vast crowds and I didn't mind. About 10 of us went to the zoo but only 4 had the blotter (myself, C and 2 friends of C I'd never met that hadn't had it before, lets call them S and R). It is good to have a couple of co-pilots around if things turn sour. I'd eaten only a small meal for breakfast and drove round to a friends to meet up with the other people.

10am -
Pile up in 2 cars, 5 people in each. 4 of us in 1 car drop our tab on the way to zoo, the other car detours and takes another 30 minutes or so to get to the zoo.

10.50am-
The other guys finally get to the zoo, we'd just been sitting at a bench waiting for it to kick in. In the mean time I'd been to a shop and almost forgot to pay for my oj, or had thought it unnecessary. By the time the other guys got here, me and C had started seeing the woodwork move in the normal breathing-like fashion. The other 2 guys were unconvinced that it would affect them.

11am-12pm
We visited various exhibits, first a bird sanctuary, all of us that were tripping were in mouth-gaping awe at the beauty of it all, the tranquility and pleasantness of the experience. This experience was often interrupted by a non-tripper making small talk. This slowly got on my nerves but I ignored the person making the comment, feeling on a higher plane to them. Everyone that was tripping was feeling it now, the 2 guys I didn't know were a little freaked as they didn't really know what to expect. I already felt more at ease and closer to these 2 guys than I did with my other friends who I'd known for over 10 years. Myself and the other 3 elected to do a detour through a botanical garden which was probably my best choice of the day. A light mist coming from overhead sprinklers was so pleasant, and my friend made me put my hand through some spiderweb, it felt smooth and pliable. I guess when you're tripping solid objects feel a bit more web-like in any case: movable but still firm. I could of stayed in the garden forever.

12pm-1pm
After the garden detour, S became very freaked and said he couldn't go on, we alerted the group to this fact and said we needed a chill-out point. We sat on the grass for a few moments but I still felt on top of the world, a little freaked by S, I guess I thought it could happen to me shortly too. During the next half hour I walked with all non-trippers to several other exhibitions. Some animals I felt a strong connection with, such as the elephants. Several exhibited a coloured glow and I thought how pleasant this primeval existence would be. I trailed the group and reflected on several things regarding our behavior to animals. Somewhere around this point I decided I really have to visit africa at some stage in my life. A forced people to visit the african exhibit with me and the meer cats were wonderous. Their behavioural patterns changed so quickly and they seemed as content as I. They quickly moved from digging to play fighting, to sleeping. The ground around them and everywhere was starting to swirl quite vigorously at this point, it was getting very intense. I could feel my senses starting to merge, light, sound, touch, hearing, smell and for all of them starting to intensify. I tried to follow people through the nocturnal house but after 5 steps I became terrified and fell to the floor. I couldn't see anything at all, everywhere was black and it felt like I was stuck in a box full of mirrors. My friend had to lead me crawling out, I felt like a bit of a fool seeing other visitors coming in the entrance. Things were definitely starting to heat up.

1pm - 2.30pm
We returned to the grass and one of the girls we were with (the only one I didn't know besides S and R) possessed a mobile phone and seemed like she was constantly on it. I became paranoid, convinced she was some sort of spy, telling the authories about us. At this point in time, time distortion became so strong and time loops so common I couldn't communicate with anyone properly. I tried to tell her to get off the phone but it obviously didn't work. I could feel the universe was seperated into layers and they were a fundamental concept in our understanding of it. I exclaimed that I could see in all directions at once, and I believed i could do so. People's small characteristic actions were magnified and repeated to a point that drove me crazy. I must of seen one of my friends push the glasses back on his face about 500 times in a row. At this point I could do nothing but lie on by back and look at the sky, hoping that my body would instinctively remember how to breathe as I felt I couldn't do so. The sky dimmed and lightened several times, it felt as if many days had passed. Casino numbers rolled through the sped up clouds, and card suits followed after them. It was interesting, confusing and scary at the same time. It is easy to have opposite emotions at the same time on lsd.

3am(guess)
One of my friends came running back to us, he was shouting that another of our friends had fallen in the polar bear exhibit and was being mauled to death by the polar bear. I was in unimaginable fear, wanting to escape this place but unable to use my limbs. Shortly after this we departed, I cant remember most of the trip home, parts of it sped past so fast and some of it took forever. I was convinced god was punishing me (and I dont even believe in god in the conventional sense) for taking too much of this drug and entering too far into the 'real world'. For the next hour or so I had no control over my body, it seems that my actions were pre-determined and the future was set, I could do nothing but follow my bodies basic instincts. One of the more unusal things that happened on the way home was I heard a song - star69 being played loudly on the radio. Later I learnt that we hadn't listen to anything on the way home but I had chosen that song when we got to my friends house 40 minutes later. My senses were so muddled I wasn't sure I was going to escape this madness.

4pm
I had to deal with my friends parents, he told them I was sick. I couldn't converse with them, the images of them talking was muddled with sound from events in a different time. I tried to drink water, hoping it would calm me down, I must have drunk about 7 glasses. The strange thing was I couldn't feel myself drinking the water until later when I was lying face down on a bed. Time was going very slowly, not one minute had passed on my friends bedside clock since I went to lie down. I walked the corridors of his house, shadows were intimidating, almost hellish and then lay outside for what felt like 30 minutes, came inside, got another drink, checked the clock and it was 2 minutes later than when I last checked it. I was in hysterics, I thought I was trapped in this distorted time forever. I went to see what my friend was doing, he was watching stigmata: this did not help my experience. At some point I snapped out of my auto-pilot like state the drug had given me and suggested we go to the beach.

5.30pm-2pm
It was so cool and refreshing in the sand, and the sea breeze was amazing, the intensity level had dropped back to a level I really enjoyed. For the remainder of the evening we went to a black tie party, I chose some funky multi-coloured bow tie because it looked so cool and wore totally inappropriate clothes. I couldn't converse with people very well and enjoyed more to sit and observe everyone's reactions at the party. Shadows dancing on the walls captured my interest as did the wall-vines ability to keep in time to the music being played.

4pm (18 hours after dropping)
I arrived home and was still getting strong visuals but could feel it calming down. I was shaken by the experience and it took forever to get to sleep, my heart pounding, my head full of images when I closed my eyes. Finally I did get to sleep at around 7am.

Although it was frightening at the time and I was shaken for several weeks afterwards, I am keen to do it again in a smaller dose and a calmer environment. This blotter was so soaked you could see the stain marks on it. It lasted far longer than the first time when I'd had double. It is an excellent way to learn more about yourself and what you believe life and the bigger things are really about.

I used to be a heroin 'junkie', an 'addict'.  That was how I defined myself.  I was the classic, tortured artist junkie.  I didn't know any other way drugs would be used other than to just feel good and to create an image for oneself.  I later quit and swore off all drugs all together.  That was the next way I defined myself, a preacher of the gospel of dangerous drugs.  After some time, talking with my roommate and friend Eric, and some thought I realized it was not drugs that abused me, it was I that had abused them.  I was the one that needed to change. I began experimenting once again, this time I listened to my experiences, in an attempt to not only have a good time, but to better myself.  

A few months later me, my roommate and my friend Lee decided to take 8 hits of LSD.  We'd all done it before, but never more that 3-4 hits, this was something new to all of us.  We all woke up early that day, Lee and I both took 8, and Eric decided his mood was off so took 2.  We all made our way to brunch, talked to people and headed back to our rooms.  I was having a cigarette so I was finishing it outside when the initial body rush hit.  I went upstairs and saw Lee and Eric experiencing more or less the same thing.  We decided to go for a walk, so we all bundled up.  It was a warm winter day, but a winter day none the less.  While walking we all realized that we had become walking machines, our bodies whole existence became walking, and with my body, my mind became a walking machine as well.  I scanned for all possible paths, chose the one that would be the path of least resistance, and contracted the appropriate leg muscles to make that happen.  Suddenly my walking machines processor was shattered by a sight so unexpected that I shrieked (at least I think I did).  A llama farm.  Three llamas standing tall, one staring at each of us.  They where mirrors of us.  And if they where mirrors of us, we where mirrors of them, so we must be llamas.  With that dilemma solved we proceeded down the road.  

Our bodies remained walking machines, but our brains took in the sights of the day.  Towering trees and houses that dwarfed us all.  We realized how insignificant we where.  Just roaming bags of water and carbon.  Then, another earth shattering experience, someone flew past in one of those machines that allow you to sit and move at the same time.  A person hung out the window and screamed something.  It was just Even and Ace getting stoned, no worries.  we then reached a steel bridge that spanned over the most incredible stream I had ever seen, the snow was melting, and the stream was babbling.  We climbed through the bridge and discussed the probability of the chap stick I had was made in some guys basement.  

After a full day of such exploits we returned to the campus.  We stopped at the athletic center and our friend Karl was working.  He made us ham sandwiches.  We went back to our rooms, and Eric had to work.  So me and Lee decided to go with him.  There was some sort of concert, so Eric, Lee, and I became speaker moving machines.  After the night was done we returned to our rooms, and attempted to sleep, but sleep would not come.  So we watched movies until class.

That was one of the most pleasant days of my life.  We didn't climb Mount Everest, or go over Niagara Falls.  We didn't have sex with super models or party with Motley Crue.  We just had a nice time and learned a lot about ourselves in the process.  This was what I was missing before.  Drugs aren't some sordid little toy, there something that should be shared, with family and friends.  Like a picnic at the park, or a summer BBQ there a way to have a nice time and learn about yourself and loved ones.

I remember the day, in the middle of July or so. My friend obtained some very potent liquid LSD. I was experienced with low to medium doses and was excited to try it in liquid form. I asked him for a drop or too, so he took out the small dropper bottle. It was his first time even squeezing the small bottle, and dropped a little too much on my tongue. I tried to rub some off with my fingers, but it may have just absorbed into my skin. When we looked at the hundred dollar bottle, about a quarter of it was gone. He apologized, and I realized all I could do was hold on and let it hit me. 

It was obviously the strongest acid trip I ever had. The come up was VERY intense. My emotions were swinging uncomfortably. When I began peaking, the visuals were so incredibly intense that I couldnt even worry anymore. I was just a vapor floating through different colors and patterns. Reality was non-existent, while I sat in one spot for about 5 hours. One visual I can describe was seeing a river rise 10 times over my head, and crashing into lasers in colors I never saw. Eventually I was able to name things I was looking at, and I tried to enjoy the hallucinations. My friend who was watching me would melt into a puddle of color and slowly build into his original shape. I looked at my hand, but it would just spiral away into many colors. 

After the trip, I was very shocked and silent for many days. I couldnt even have a bad trip because I really couldnt even think. I just wanted to post this to warn all of you to be careful with liquid LSD. It changed the way that I interpret my sense of sight.

I have been a fairly common user of almost every drug available for the past 2 years.  I have used mushrooms, ecstacy, dxm, cocaine, crystal meth, various uppers and downers all about 10 times apiece. I have also been a daily pot smoker for roughly 4 years.

LSD was never really available to me though it recently has.  I have only used it a few times and on my fourth use I took a single hit that was of moderate strength and then another approxamitely three hours later.  After tripping for a very long time and eventually coming down and passing out, I awoke to find that I still had visual 'trails'.  It is very similar to the effect that the mouse pointer is capable of doing.

It has been roughly 4 weeks and I have ceased all drug use in an attempt to see if it would cause the trails to dissipate.  It has seemed to have little effect as I still see them on any fast moving objects.

HPPD has not interfered with my living but it becomes very hard to look 'hand talkers' in the eye.  My focus tends to drift to the visuals that occur.

I previously have been prescribed to xanax (used for recreational purposes only) and I will be attempting to use it as a treatment as I've read that the benzo catagories may have an effect. I hope that the benzo will have a dampering effect or that this problem will go away with time.  

Since the other visual-inducing drugs never caused this condition despite excessive dosing and use, I would warn that lsd was most certainly the drug that caused this and that one might consider using other psychedelics if one feels the need to use them.

I would first like to mention that I strongly urge people to not try this on their own. Now that that's aside, I shall reveal how I changed my perspective on LSD, and gained much respect for it. 

It was the end of April, and a friend and I were working security at a rave in northern La. We start the day off with several bowls from the glass pipe and our ounce bought the day before, and have several more on the 3 hour drive to the venue. By the time we get to the venue, down to 3/4 ounce, very high, and full of positive energy about the evening ahead. Three hits hidden behind my drivers licence wrapped in foil, but not until I work the door a bit first. Not really caring about what people bring into the party, just watchin for weapons and all, I get to check out most of the people coming in. An hour later I dose, it's 10:00, the party's just starting, and the line slims down for a bit. A peculiar looking guy walks in, who we'll call legos for the remainder of the story, because his facial features and skin tones looked very similair to those on Lego men. Anyways, I pat legos down like everyone else, and his pockets bulge from every angle. 

I pull him aside, and say whats in your pockets man? I dont mind whatever it is as long as its not a gun, but your pockets are bulging. So he leans close to me and says 'I have a bible dropped out in my pockets, let me sell tonight hassle free and you're fed all night'. I said 'deal'. He hands me 3 sweet tarts and says 'be careful, they're triple dripped'. I hand him a bracelet, say ok, no problem, and eat all 3. Where I'm from, we only get LSD thats been cut by one or two or forty people, so I'm used to weak stuff. 

T+30mins: already starting to trip quite nicely. Decide to say goodbye to the security job (I only had to work as long as I wanted to) and wander the party lookin for fun. My 2 buddies (also tripping on some of the same paper I had before and Lego's liquid) and I move around from place to place, plotting between us who we want to run up to and strobe our microlights at and dance for. Give several lightshows, head to VIP room for some refreshments. 

T+60mins: sitting in the VIP room on the couch, staring at the ceiling. A hole appears in the 20 ft. High ceiling about 3 feet in diameter, and huge spider legs start coming through it. I dont like this at all. I get up to find a weapon to hit it with incase it gets through, and Legos appears out of nowhere and I see his lips moving, but his words were mute for a few seconds until I thought about listening to him and then I could hear him, and he was asking if I wanted some more sweet tarts. (here begins the series of events leading to the bad trip) I say sure. He hands me 4 more and leaves. I eat them. I then seek out my friend and we stand in the middle of the dance floor surveying the crowd around us. We watch as Legos circulates through the crowd of 200 kids and I see him dosing everyone. Even cops. He's walking up to police officers in the parking lot and offers them candy, and they accept! Back inside, the dj starts spinning some crazy track with sirens, cop sirens. Constant cop sirens. 

You know that feeling in the back of your mind when you know somethings going wrong? It begins here. I hear the sirens constantly and I think, the party's getting busted! I run to the door and look outside and the cops are there..but they're not coming in, they're sitting in their cars talking to each other laughing. I don't get this. I go back in and realize that I am tripping really hard. I start looking for my friend and when I find him I tell him of my condition. 'It's ok, just remember that you took acid and everything will be ok'. I try to party more but the sirens keep bothering me to a point of heated panic. Im running aorund the party, person to person, (by this point I'm pretty sure all of the poeple attending were tripping somewhat, including some dj's) trying to convince people that we should all go somewhere else besides the party. After about 20 minutes of this, I have a crowd of about 20 people following me out the door, and Legos stops me. Asks me where I'm going, hands me some candy. Before I think about it I eat it. 

T+2.5 hours: losing my mind. People are changing shades of purple and violet. When people talk to me, their words form visible letters that float from their mouths as they speak them, floating through the air around them and me.  I can see their words, I can feel the words that float and bounce off of me, I can taste the words that I inhale. This is all very confusing to me, so I head outside. ..blank...

T+?: (what I think is happening): snap out of blackout, standing in parking lot of venue, next to a police car, with the rear door open, and man who looks like a police officer standing next to me. My vision is only about 50% right now because when I try to focus on his face it melts and slides off his chin. I hear him say 'get in the car'. I say 'am I under arrest'. I hear 'yes, get in'. WE HAVE JUST LOST CABIN PRESSURE. Here begins a nightmare of old bad dreams and embarrasing moments when I felt most vulnerable, all of these come floating back to me at once at blinding speed, each with sharp clarity. I'm riding in the back of a police car, talking to my mom on a cell phone the officer gave me. For some reason, I feel it necessary to repeat over and over again my vital information (name, birthdate, address, phone number, etc.) Into the cell  phone. ..black out.. Wake up, I'm at home on my couch, my friends are passed out on my floor and bed, and I feel like total dogshit.

(what really happened): after my friends notice that I really shouldnt be at the party anymore (somewhere around 3am) they try to get me out to the car. After 20 minutes of convincing me that I wouldnt sink into the pavement if I walked on it, I trudge to my ride's car. He opens the back door and says get in. I say am I under arrest? He (wanting me to just get in so we can leave) says yes. I roll around the backseat for the next few hours in my little nightmare while my friends try to navigate the car while tripping themselves (they too had been visited by Legos, and our driver was on a quarter sheet). 

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

After a few near-accidents, my friends decide to stop on the side of the road and let it die down a bit before continuing. After a few minutes of disc jockeying, they decide to get out and look at the stars (interstate, middle of nowhere, 5am, no cars). They let me out and we all walk around on the interstate looking at the stars and at strange patterns made by the tar stains on the road. 

Then a diesel truck comes over a hill about a quarter mile back. I dive into the 4 foot tall dripping wet weeds on the side of the road to hide from the bright lights heading our way. My friends fish me out of the weeds and throw me back in the backseat and take off again. Then they threw on Incubus - SCIENCE. By about track 9 I've settled down in the backseat. The end of that album is all acid jazz. We loved it of course. An hour and a half later we arrive at my house and crash after smoking a come down bowl.

I awoke the next day with a startlingly clear memory of my version of the events of the night, yet when my friends told me what really happened, it was as if I already knew what they were going to say, but didnt know why. After a day or two of contemplation I managed to put the stories together and got what you just read. Altogether I learned to greatly appreciate and respect LSD. I learned that it will do with my mind whatever it wants to. Respect acid. Dont get sloppy with it, or it will rule you.

Four or five of us were skipping school and hanging out at a favorite local tripping spot, a small woodsey area at the base of a hill on a local semi-private golf course.  It was a weekday morning on a warm spring day and the course wasn't open.  We were all peaking pretty good, joking and strumming guitars, just goofing around.  But we were kinda quiet, too; we were not suppose to be on the golf course and we didn't want to be confronted and shooed away by the groundskeeper.  Suddenly we noticed a young man, maybe late-20s, about 75 yards away, walking past us from our right to left.  He was white, sandy hair, casual dressed with a light jacket and was toting a green fabric daypack.  We really quieted down, but he didn't glance over, he just kept marching along right down a fareway.  When he got directly in front of us he suddenly made a 90 degree turn and without missing a step he started walking directly toward us.  

I must emphasize that in making the turn, he did a fast half-twist in mid-stride, very amplified, sort of like player in a marching band, and it was in extreme contrast to the normalcy of his gait.  Also, we had been watching him walk for at least two minutes before he turned toward us, and when he did turn, he created a right angle with his new direction.  This seemed significant, too, probably because he wasted many steps by not turning in our direction earlier.  Again, he had not once looked directly at us from the moment we noticed him.  Nor did he look at us even once while he walked that 75 yards straight toward our suddenly silent group.  He was looking down at the ground in front of him the whole time.  As he approached the last 10 yards, he had to walk down and back up a small dry conctrete creek bed.  Two steps out of the creek bed and right in front of our group he stopped and raised his head.  He looked slowly around our group, and softly said....

'Acid tears holes in the fabric that seperates this and the next world.  If you're not careful you can get caught on the other side.'

Then he turned around, walked directly away from us for about 75 yards, made a perfect 90 degree turn to the left and resumed on his initial way.  While he was doing that walk away, we sat stunned, giggling and freaked out.  It wasn't till he was out of sight that we lost it, all started talking at once and rolled around with the wierdness of it all.  

It's now 20+ years later, and my friends and I will all still swear this is a true story.  I told it a while back to a shaman who simply said, 'It was a spirit sent to warn you about fooling around with LSD.'  I also learned, years later, that in those days, one of our group, John, had been taking 4 hits of acid for every single hit the rest of us took.   I think I did 2 hits that day, so John may have done 6-8 hits.  John kept his habits extreme, and a few years later he REALLY totally fucked up his life with cocaine, so maybe he was the intended audience.  I don't have a reason for the story, it just happened.

Skating on Thin Ice

This is a rewrite of a dream labeled 'Lousy Dream Lived Out with LSD' posted elsewhere.  I choose to rewrite it because that report was written approximately five hours after the dream ended, and was my attempt to solidify the events of the night, it does not focus on what I learned that night. At that point, I had no idea just what I'd learned that night. Of course. 

At approximately 9:00 PM I injested 3 microdots. I had taken two of the same distribution on a previous night. Call it the magical wheel of dosage, I chose to take three. :) Me and a friend who was not on anything at the time travelled over to a friends house and I parked and locked up my car, putting a note on my steering wheel reminding me not to drive until 5AM the next day. I have never had to read this type of note to avoid doing something stupid, but I write them to make myself feel better. 

We sat comfortably in the basement as I began my space-out. About an hour and a half later, the people I was with decided they were going to visit someone else who lived outside of the town we were in. I decided I would be better off going along with those I knew than walking around town looking for someone else I knew to spend my time with. It can be a long night by yourself if you're not comfortable and at home. 

I hitched a ride with two people I did not know, and I spent the ride mostly watching the interior lights of the car. When we arrived, I had not realized how many people who I had never seen before would be there. They all seemed friendly enough and after sitting at the kitchen table for a while I went into the basement to have a look at the musical equipment that was down there. A complicated system with a large stereo being monitored, sampled and equalized by a computer. I sat for quite a while in a chair tuned into the music. It was almost hypnotic, I can not describe it and I wonder if I would recognize it if I ever heard it again. I can not remember a single thought from this period that was not related to what was going on around me. I kept reaching for my pack of cigarettes but didn't manage to make it all the way to smoking one for quite a while. I was sitting there simply blown away. After a while people started to go upstairs and I chose to go with rather than sitting in the dark basement in a house owned by people I didn't know. 

Before I went upstairs, I spoke to a group of people I didn't know who were sitting in another lighted section of the basement. I said hello and they replied in kind and asked how it was going. It was an effort to say 'I took three microdots at nine oclock and I have no idea what's going on.'. It felt to me like someone was rapidly pushing a reset button in the back of my head. Thoughts came and went, trying to hold on to them was totally useless. A young man sitting at the table replied 'That's ok, you don't have to know what's going on.'. I laughed, said thank you and went upstairs. I appreciated and appreciate that very much. 

We sat at the kitchen table some more, and a friend rolled a huge joint. I smoked it with them, just because it was what I would usually do. I talked with drunk people I didn't know. I told everyone that I had a personal conversation with that I was on LSD, and to please excuse me if I was acting strangely. I am sure I was managing to act fairly normal, the energy buzzing beneath my skin was amazing. It was a concious act to keep from gritting my teeth and tightening every muscle in my body. 

People went out on the back porch and played some hack. Normally I'm able to play well enough but didn't quite feel up to it. :) I followed because most of the people I knew went that way. A friend kept urging me to play but I didn't quite feel up to taking my feet off the ground. A few minutes later the people in the room stopped making sense. They would talk almost constantly but with disconnected words or short phrases, I must admit it was all fairly stupid and I can only assume reflects upon my thoughts on those people. 

While I knew I was tripping, I had never before hallucinated in this manner. All my hallucinations had been gentle and interesting and had not included people at all. I decided that everyone was playing a trick on me. (Great idea right?) I had an idea that it had something to do with the people that had been playing music in the basement. I waited for a while for them to give it up, said 'you people are crazy' (hehehe) and walked into the kitchen. People continued to talk nonsensically and someone in the kitchen said a rhyme about Jesus Christ (Christian religious figure) to the purpose of him being blessed with the spirit of god, coming down to earth and having nothing to do but 'piddle de ding dong dingus'... 

At this point I was starting to get a little scared. I went down a hall looking for the door, and talked to a young lady who I did not know. I told her about my problem, but she did not understand. I did not use the correct words, because there are no words to explain the manner in which people were talking. She asked me if I needed help, needed to talk to someone, and I replied that I did not because I had the strong feeling that she was talking about police. I decided I needed to leave the house, go outside and chill out. 

I believed that everyone was playing a trick on me. I was displeased about it (I was rather disconnected from emotion at this point.) and decided to walk down the street in the direction I guessed was home. I had never had problems deciphering reality from hallucination while dreaming of LSD and chose to stick to my guns. I began walking down the street in the direction I guessed was home but then walked back, deciding that I was not going to let anyone trick me into getting myself arrested on the long walk back to the town my car was in. I sat on the porch waiting for them to come outside and end the game. I began to wonder if I wasn't passed out somewhere and all this going on inside my head. (Another bright idea.) A short time after, my friends going back to the town my car was in came out of the house. Too short I thought.. 

Unfortunately, they were still talking garbage. People got into their cars and I asked one of my friends where we were going. He urged me to get into the car I had come in. I decided this was a good idea and did so. I thought that they would just drive me back to this house after driving around the block a few times. I asked them to stop the car so that I could get out. The driver said 'ok he has 15 seconds to get out or I'm taking off again'. 

This was a critical choice: A thought that just kept on recurring to me was: 'If I stay here, nothing ever happens...'. 

I got out and began walking home without another word. I had never been to this house before. I had no real idea of where I was. As I walked I thought of the two possible explanations I had thought of before the people came out of the house. One being that I was tripping and that people had played a cruel trick on me, the other that this going on inside my head. That I would live forever in this strange world where everyone talked garbage and went no where. My hell for a mistake. I had yelled loudly in the driveway when this thought occured to me. 

I believed that one of these two things could be happening and that my choosing the correct path back to the town in which my car was parked was connected with my returning to my reality. Believe it or not, I followed the roads that seemed more lighted, even after I had left the residential areas and there were no street lights. I followed the path that occured to me first. I decided that I would simply walk until I came down, and ask directions then. Or if I got lucky and got home, so be it. 

As I walked, I worried about what was actually going on. I thought for a while that I should stop and spend the night in a grove of trees. I had to be home sometime the next day and so I decided I had to get to my car that night. I thought I would go (?) insane if I did not keep moving. I decided to rid myself of my paraphenalia, and to put my drivers license under the insole of my shoe. 

I decided that I had decided what I was going to do, so I had better just stop worrying about it or I was going have bigger problems. I decided to count 1,2,3,4loop as a way of keeping my mind occupied. After a while I noticed that I had timed my counting to my breathing, a short while later I noticed that I had timed my steps to my breathing. After that it became much easier to walk. I later learned that this is a Buddhist practice: walking meditation. A good book on walking meditation is 'The Long Road Turns to Joy', written by Thich Nhat Hanh. 

I had many thoughts over this period of time, but I let them flow by me. I held onto the only rock I had, which was not to think at all. The unfortunate result: many of these thoughts are buried deep in my memory. Every day new thoughts from that experience return to me. Over this period of time, my reality and who I was faded till it was just a memory. I did not think of my name at any time during this trip, so I do not know whether I knew it or not. I believed that if I forget my reality, I would not go back to it at all, that I would be stuck in the nonreality that I was in for the rest of my life. 

After a long period of the walking in this manner, I experienced a blip. My everything was ripped away for a split second. I recognized that reality was more my creation than I had ever realized before, I saw the death rebirth process. Everything was quiet, and I looked about the void. I saw nothing around me, and thought 'Well... What now?'. I saw a point of light in the unimaginable distance, it moved towards me with immeasurable speed. As it approached I recognized that it was immeasurably large. It approached till it engulfed me and I was slammed back to reality. 

At the time, I did not know or did not choose to think about what had just happened. I felt only relief. I knew I was coming down, that I would be ok. I spent the rest of the walk thinking as little as possible. All this happened on my way to the freeway, I did not know if I was north or south of where I was trying to get and went the wrong way up the freeway for a good long time. I stopped at a populated exit and asked directions. I hitched a ride from a trucker just before daylight. I appreciate that immensely, the warmth of that cab was extacy after my walk in the cold. To this day I pick up hitchhikers, just to give back a little. 

When I got back home, I went to sleep shortly after writing a report of this and posting it to another website. Four hours later, a friend who lived in the area dropped by and walked into my bedroom. I looked up and he said something I didn't catch. He seemed to move a little too quickly into the room. I jerked up and awake and drop kicked the young man out of my house. :) I followed him outside and told him that it was NOT a good time and not to call me, I would call him later. 

All in all, I tripped for approximately 9 hours. I have a crystal clear memory of everything that went on, although I imagine that I will be piecing together my memory of my thoughts for the rest of this life. As closely as I can calculate I walked 25 miles that night, the soles of my shoes are almost completely flat. For approximately 2 hours I exhibited the sensory input and thought patterns of a paranoid psychotic. At no time during the trip did I lose control of what I was doing, the fight was to control my thoughts. The trip was at no time bad or good, it just was. I spent every moment after I left that room in emergency mode, thinking only of what I needed to do to be as safe as I could. 

The reality fracture that I had that night is as real as anything I have ever experienced. I was forced to choose a direction, but didn't really know it at the time. In the end I chose a very unique path. All through the time that I was at the house and with the others I felt the strong presense of other higher beings. They spoke to me through the movements and words of those around me and through my thoughts. Occasionally, I would get a reoccuring thought that was usually a statement. 'If I don't go, nothing ever happens.' etc. It seems to me that I thought clearly throughout, but that the problems remained. I am not implying that the silly and incorrect thoughts I had that night were placed in my head, but that I was able to choose to think above them... Or not. 

For about two weeks after that experience, I could see any situation from an infinite number of points of view. One was not any more or less real than any other. Some were plausible, some were not. I had only to choose from the ones that seemed most correct, the ones that I wanted. At the time that I am writing this report, things have solidified. 

A lot of my problems with people have simply dissapeared. I am left with the habits of my old thought. I have a long way to go before I complete what I started that night: the raising of my conciousness. It is a constant battle for me not to slip back into my old ways of thinking. 

As of the writing of this report, my ego has reattached itself stronger than ever. It has started to overshadow the surety that I had. Fortunately, it now yells and screams so loud that I can often recognize it for what it is. It's going to take a long time to break down the imprinting of a life time and return to balance. 

I stood on the edge of my world and looked off. Every choice I had that night corresponds to a way of thought, and I believe that I chose the only one that would let me see correctly. One thing I know, if I had chosen differently, I would never have known that I had chosen incorrectly. Whichever way you go, you 'know' it's the right way. 

My life is changed, I am changed. I am unbelieveably lucky, in that the change was for the better. I'd like to thank everyone who helped me to see the experience correctly. They have opened up many doors for me, gently and persistantly helping me to see the only way to deal with this experience. Things still might have gone badly for me in the end, had I not had help. As it stands, I have no worries. 

There is a lesson in this for everyone who has not learned it already. LSD IS NOT A TOY! I have only taken LSD five times in my life, each months or years apart, and this dream has shaken me to my core. It doesn't take much, it's entirely unpredictable. LSD dreams can be used to remove clouds from your eyes, and they can be used to reinforce ways of thought, and they can be used to build huge new clouds in front of your eyes. If you use it in a setting that causes you to think in a certain way, you will create thought habits that keep you thinking that way. You can not escape being changed by an LSD dream unless you know exactly what you're doing, so make sure that you change for the better. 

'If you should go skating,
on the thin ice of modern life,
dragging behind you the silent reproach,
of a million tear stained eyes,
don't be surprised when a crack in the ice,
appears under your feet.
You slip out of your depth,
and out of your mind,
your fear flowing out behind you,
as you claw the thin ice.'


Alright, I couldn't help the quote. I've always been into Floyd, and all the meanings in Floyd's albums have flip flopped since I dreamed this up.

Happy trails folks!

I started taking LSD on 1999 and I used to consume it in blotter form every weekend (found that LSD tolerance was almost 7 days on my organism) till 2000. That was a whole year of LSD consumption almost every weekend. I started with doses of 1 blotter and after that year and a half my latest doses were about 5-6 blotters. I can say I never had a bad trip, and I decided to quit acid when the nasty after effects no longer had a positive relationship with the good effects.

On those days I read a lot of information about flashback experiences but never really believed in them. 

After that acid marathon I got a magor depression that lasted aprox 6 months where I was heavily medicated with a lot of antidepresants like fluoxetine, prozac, haloperidol and mutabon D. Then I recovered and started living a normal life without drug consumption except tobacco.

After 2 years of my last acid trip, while on vacation in a very nice wilderness place I was sitting on a rock and then I experienced a clear acid high. I was looking at a very steep hill and suddently it started moving in nice patterns, exactly as one sees patterns while on acid. It wasn't something uncomfortable. In fact it was really pleasant and there was absolutely no trace of the nasty anxiousness after effects common to LSD. It lasted aproximately 2 minutes and I enjoyed it very much.

After that experience I never had any other flashback. But if they came again I'm sure I will enjoy them every much!

On Feb. 23rd, 2004, I ingested one hit of LSD. After an hour, I started to feel like  my 'soul' wanted to tear out of my body, this felt pretty chaotic, so I sat down to meditate and clear my mind. I stayed meditating for five hours straight. It was an extremely deep meditation, it is even possible that I could have fallen asleep, but I did open my eyes about every thirty minutes just to reassure myself that I was still sitting there. In this deep meditative state, this is what I saw...


(This is just a brief sample of the overall concepts that will need further explanation.)


I saw the entire history of humanity--from beginning, to the present, like as history textbook visually depicted throughout my sight.  

I experienced the birth and fall of countries,

I experienced the pain and suffering of humanity throughout time,

I pondered and imagined the future--what is the highest evolution of humanity?

I realized how this body and all of its maintenance/ methologics/ procedures/ and mechanical processes--such as eating, pissing, drinking, sex, washing, and shitting, chain down the psyche and pollute and corrupt pure thought. Once we are free from this body, only thought will exist. Pure thought without the chains of the body and all its weight, just may be the highest evolution of humanity. 


What is pure thought?

Pure thought has no inhibitions (mental or physical), no negativity/pessimism (these are disruptive and vexatious to the 'spirit', they cause frustration and unnecessary conflicts).

Pure thought is just, humane, and has a well-balance of birth and death.


Pure thought is also being disconnected from this crude and ugly body, which is currently mere encapsulation and transportation for the beholder of pure psychic energy(a synonym for pure thought).


Pure thought is also disrupted and inhibited by drinking and smoking--which are petty little escapes that only get one by temporarily until the next time.


I have realized:

I need to take life more seriously.

I am now more humane (in realization of weights of the body).

I am now more optimistic (pessimism and negativity are weights of the psyche). Pessimism is necessary in keeping one from being naive, but it should only be considered, and weighed appropriately with optimism. 

Only those who are weak, fail to allow optimism to succeed in their lives. Why be so negative when life is so short? Where will it get you? Like I said, pessimism keeps you from being naive, but you can simply be aware of the dark side to keep you from harm. I say 10-20% pessimism, 80-90% optimism. This will aid you in thought of the highest levels.

* This all seems ideal, but it has been emotionally charged by my unconsciousness for the benefit of at least myself, if no one else will listen. *

* Listen to your unconsciousness, do not fight it or block it out, it is only trying to help. *

   Once on an LSD trip I invented non-linear text that interconnected at multiple points. This was created on loose-leaf paper but it functioned exactly like standard hypertext. Keep in mind that this took place in 1992, the same year the World-Wide Web was released by CERN and HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language) was first put in place around the same time. But like most people, I was completely unaware that the internet (and HTML) existed.

   I was having a surge of revelations about metaphysical/psychological/natural/creative matters and was writing furiously. I soon realized that my thoughts could not be expressed from beginning to end. As I extrapolated on any given subject, I found myself underlining words and phrases (that I intended to elaborate upon on a different page) and placing symbols after them. This basically worked like footnotes, but I was using non-sequential symbols like *, @, #, $, %, etc. These symbols would prompt the reader (if he or she wished to read further about the underlined word or phrase) to go to the page with the corresponding symbol at the top. 

   So I would write a page on body energy (for example) and would make a brief mention of the third eye. The Key Words third eye would be underlined and there was a symbol like * after it. You could continue to read bout body energy or find the page headed with * and read about the third eye. This page would of course contain many underlined words and phrases. Each page was connected to some or all of the other pages on many points. I was a little frustrated that I could not figure out any linear way to arrange these pages from beginning to end, or any order whatsoever. After sometime I put aside the pen and paper and indulged in other activities (music, art books, etc.) and continued to enjoy a mild LSD trip.

    The next day I again tried to put the pages in some sort of order. After some time I realized that this was impossible. I started hanging the pages from my ceiling using thread and tape. I placed them a few feet apart from each other and began to connect each underlined word or phrase with its respective page using lengths of thread and tape. Soon this became impossible to complete. My room was so full of criss-crossed threads that I could not crawl over, under or though them. It was like shoe-string Indras Net, a room-wide web of tape and thread. This project was abandoned for practical reasons and the pages given to various friends who were impressed (even if somewhat confused).  

   It was not until this year that I suddenly realized that what I had made functioned as low-tech hypertext!

I haven't experimented with LSD since I was 14 years old, now, ten years later I have reached a point in my life where I feel that am in an enlightened state. I recall the experiences I had when I was a teenager, and I felt that I could delve deeper into myself in a drug induced state. I recently read some articles written by doctors who had administered LSD to patients and my curiosity was piqued. I regularly do yoga and educate myself on the teachings of other individuals that are also enlightened. 

So, at home, by myself, I took one tab of LSD, several hours later I was feeling relaxed and had a sense of being high but not to the level that I wanted to be at, so I took a second tab. An hour later I felt high. I made myself comfortable in my bedroom and relaxed in my bed. I felt some tension in my muscles and decided to get some lotion and give myself a body rub, I started at my feet. As I was rubbing my hands and fingers became tired so I started using the backs of my hands, my wrists, forearms and elbows as I worked my way up my legs. 

Then, the weirdest sensations came over me. It is sort of difficult to explain. 

At first my legs didn't seem like mine, I could feel myself rubbing my legs but if I didn't concentrate on them they looked like someone elses. I also had the feeling of a mirror image as I sat with my legs straight out in front of me and rubbed with each hand on each leg from my knee down to my ankle. I rubbed with different parts of my hands and arms, I felt like I was stretching out my whole body. I was working in circular motions the whole time. It seemed like, for example; when I was using my elbows on my legs that the friction was giving my muscles more energy and I could focus that energy on different parts of my body, like my face, which would then become more sensitive. I would fan my fingers in front of my face as see/sense trails, like when you wave your fingers in front of a tv screen. I started rubbing my face lightly with my fingers then more deeply with my knuckles and the back of my hand. 

I closed my eyes and relaxed and let my hands do as they wished, I was struck with the vision of a child waking up and rubbing his eyes. Then the vision of being in darkness and rubbing my face, head and body without hands, like I was trying to wake my body up, to sensitize it. Or rather like my body was trying to wake my body up because at this point my body felt seperate from my mind, my mind was quiet. As I started thinking again about what my body was doing, I thought that if I was not a human (and the thought of a cellular organism came into my head) I would have worked myself into loops, with the circular motions, and infact I became comfortably twisted up, to where no part of my body could rub upon itself.  I was quivering with the energy and I directed that energy to different parts of my body which became very sensitive. My mind took a sort of snapshot of the position I was in and it seemed that the position could be taken as a sexual position where I was bound up, but I had nothing binding me. It seemed as though all my body wanted was to energize itself but the mind could twist that fact into many different ideas. 

I relaxed and untwisted myself, with my eyes closed I could see one of those spiral shapes (I forget what they are called) which are very intricate and colorful. I had the feeling that the body would spiral upon itself, inwards or outwards, forever, but the fact that I have internal organs and muscle tightness, keeps it from doing so. 

Also I had a sense of knowing that the body likes to work, it likes to be touched, skin is your biggest organ and it likes to move. It's the mind that can keep it from doing so. I felt very comfortable, relaxed and beautiful throughout the whole session. I realized many things. After the massage I went to my piano and played for awhile. I could feel the vibration of the notes in different parts of my body, some parts ached while I played, so I did some yoga to strech myself out. 

All in all it was a very cool experience, I didn't hallucinate but saw wiggellies when I concentrated on looking at something.

It was my 18th birthday, I was not planning on tripping or doing anything besides smoking a few buds and going to my kegger. My friends had set up a party for me about a half an hour from the town we live in, in a very small town I had hardly ever been to, in a house I had never been to. We were just getting ready to roll on out when I decided to stop by one of my friends houses to make sure she was still coming to my party and see if she needed a ride. when I walked in her house she was just hanging up the phone and she turned to me and said 'guess what birthday boy, some dose just rolled into town!' Well I had thought acid was my all time favorite drug, I had tripped about eight of nine times before and thought I had this tripping thing down, I was wrong.

Let me tell you something really fast, in my town, 5000 people 60 miles away from any other 'populated' town, you get a pretty good idea of anything that comes around, what I mean by that is the speed, coke, weed, and acid are almost always the same quality as the last time give or take a little bit. The acid that came to town went like this: 1 hit= body high, 2 hits= mild trip, 3 hits= heavy trip and  4 hits= not fun anymore. This is how it had been for years, this is the way it is now. But on that fateful day, the exception that proved the rule came into play.

I went to the dealer's house and he knew me pretty good, everyone knows everyone in a town of 5000. He had heard it was my birthday so he dumped out about 30 or 40 dark brown geltabs sifted threw them and pulled out one of the biggest in the group for a birthday hit. I thanked him and started to leave then thought, I didnt want to do this by myself so I bought two more to share with a few choice friends. I gave one hit to the girl that told me it was in town, now let me tell you now, she would always write me poems and shit about how much fun we had tripping together and how we were tripping partners and shit, the other I gave to me best friend that was a real straight shooter, smoked pot a few times, but never really got into the drug scene. He was one of those guys that everyone would see us and wonder how someone that was such a straight guy could be best bros with such a druggie. Well me and my buddy took our hits about 15 minutes before we left town and I gave the other hit to the girl when we were leaving.

Most acid usually takes about 45 minutes to start getting the 'acid jitters' then I'm tripping an hour after dosing. We got the jitters and the 'seeing the glue behind the wall paper' type feelings when we were leaving, 15 minutes after dosing, thats when I knew something was wrong, after all, we only took 1 hit. By the time we were pulling into the town of my party, 45 minutes after dosing, my friend kept saying there was no roof on the car. Sure enough I looked up and I saw the roof ripping away molocule by molocule, I could see the stars outside and feel and hear the wind blowing like crazy, I looked over to my side and the entire side of the car ripped away in the same way as the roof, I could ACTUALLY SEE the plants alongside the road and the pavement we were driving over! Keep in mind this is when most acid would normally just be taking effect.

Well we got to the party and all my friends were there, I walked in and looked at one of my buddys sitting on a chair with ty-dyed flowers sprouting out of the walls and chair he was sitting on, then I looked at him and his face morphed onto an evil looking frog. By now things were getting insane. I tried to calm myself and sit down for awhile, thats when I looked into the kitchen and saw a very cool tile pattern layed into the floor. Now this was a real pattern, it was all kinds of squares, rectangles, triangles, octagons, of all different color. I was looking at this when I noticed my heartbeat, then I saw that with every beat, a wave went out from my body and hit this pattern and blew all the little tiles up into the air, flipping all over the place, then falling back into position, this went along the intire length of the pattern, in one wave after another. That was the last good feeling I felt for almost 4 months. 

Now here is where my story will stop going in a line and just go from one weird thing to another, sorry for this, but I had thousands of thoughts ripping through my mind at the same time and I cannot tell you exactly what all happened in the right order.

I remember looking into a part of the house that was not completely finished it had plywood against the walls, ceiling and floor. I made the mistake of stumbling into this room... I thought I was in a stall of some sort, I found the door and escaped but it was to late, the stall was already in my mind, buried for the moment, but soon to come rising up with a horrible vengance. I went and sat on the couch, and thats when I started noticing that my friends kept doing the same thing over and over again. I mean they kept doing the SAME thing! I knew what they would do before they did it. And I started to become convinced that they were all trying to brainwash me except my buddy who dosed with me... Wait a sec, my buddy.. he's in trouble! I knew this, I had forgot all about him since we got to the house, then I went on a frantic hunt to find him. Find him I did, the guy I was responsible for, I gave him the drugs, he never tried anything like this before. He was curled up in the corner of a dark, dirty room with no furniture in it, he had his coat hood pulled up around his head and he was just layeing there in the fetal position, shaking and crying like a child. 

I went to find the girl I had givein the dose to, and she did the worse thing she could ever do to a person. She looked me right in the eye and said 'I'm not tripping, I dont know why' this was when I was trying to gain a little sanity and my buddy was reliving some childhood trauma, and this girl was saying the acid wasnt any good. Turns out she had just got a new jealous boyfriend that she didnt want to do drugs without so she hadnt taken the hit and had saved it for him. I hate her. I lost my friend again and went into the trip deeper than I ever thought possible. I remember seeing a sentance floating in the air in front of me, I would read it but the end of the sentance was just the begining again, but I couldnt catch on, I just kept reading it faster and faster until it was a whirl of white letters in the air that sucked my mind into a very very very scary trip. I thought that I was stuck in a joke, the joke had 4 parts to it but the end was just the start again, and I relived the joke hundreds of times, just barely catching it at the start, but not knowing if me catching it was part of the cycle. I felt like it was some sort of sick sitcom for a higher being, that I had no control over, and I was never suppose to find out about.

Now this got to a point where my mind could no longer stand the pure terror I was going threw, all of a sudden my mind was sucked out of the joke and I could watch it from a distance. It was total blackness except for something that looked like one of those 'shoe box managers' or little set ups you had to build in grade school, but each side of the box had a different part of the joke in it. I watched this for a few minutes until I lost all idea of where I was, it was like I fell out of the joke and stayed there, outside, watching it for a few minutes, then I fell. 

When I snapped out of it I was in a huge line of people in a whirl-like pattern. Everyone was walking towards the center of it, towards a black hole, with mindless looks on their faces; and I knew it was the souls of everyone on Earth here, shoulder to shoulder, line after line. When the people got to the center and stepped into the hole they would fall out of the hole at the end of the line and start the walk again! I remember stepping right up to the hole, then getting a notion of what was happening and freaking out! I pushed my way through about 5 of these mindless people before the system got me again and I had to resume walking with no choice; but I was out of place in line, and in return, I knew I had lost my place in life.

This is the worst part of it all. Do you remember when I was talking about the stall? Well I was still completely gone from reality and I saw myself turn into a cartoon. I watched cartoon trees grow up out of nowhere in a very dark carton forest. I knew something was in the darkness and soon I found out what.. the trees grew up one after another until they formed a wall the same color of the plywood, the same color as the stall, then the stall turned into a maze and I know this sounds so fucked up but it is the gods honest truth, I felt myself turning into a deer, I felt hair growing out of my face and my face growing longer, then I could feel my mind reverting back into some VERY primal state. Now as if being a little baby deer in a maze wasnt bad enough, I knew there was something in there with me, hunting me. Soon it found me, it was a GIANT cartoon buck, but it had human eyes and looked more like one of those christmas animation shows they use to show on FOX in the late eightys. (stop laughing, it was fucking scary) To tell you the truth, I dont know how I got out of that. 

Finally I pulled myself together, only because I knew my friend needed help, if I hadnt been there for him, I dont know if I would have ever got out of that trip. I managed to find him after we started coming down, but we were still REALLY fucking high, we walked outside and both said we had to get out of this house, both of us could feel a VERY evil presence in the center core  of that old home. My friend looked up at a tree and pointed to it noshalantly and said, hey, it's spinning.  I looked up and the tree turned into like dandyline branches spinning like there was no tommorow.  I found out that the acid I took made many other people go crazy, the guys that had the stuff destroyed a house they were at and flushed all there shit down the toilet.  I also found out that the 'one hit' I took turned out to be more like 15 hits.  Well I'm about tired of writing this now so I will try to sum it up.

I couldnt smoke pot anymore because every time I did I got sucked back into this trip, and this was a MAJOR lifestyle change because smoke pot was all I did for about 6 years.

After this trip I was really going crazy, I had to quit my job because I was convinced there was someone behind the wall watching everything I did, just to make sure I didnt let on to their secret, finally after about 4 months of getting worse and worse, I pulled together four of my best friends and asked for there help, we went and bought some really pure LSD went to a place we all knew and felt good at, and we reprogrammed my mind, this was with my buddy that I got into that situation. Things werent better the next day but instead of slowly getting worse every day, they started getting better every day. Exactly one year to the day of that trip I woke up in my bed in a cold sweat and everything was flashing brown and black, then I layed back and I could feel something draining out of me, I smiled to myself and said out loud, it's over, then fell right back to sleep. I have had a few bad things since then but only when I beg for them, like getting spun out for 3 days then drinking and smoking dope, even then it is just very mild flachbacks that I can control.

So thats my story, I hope someone learns something from it.

I'm writing this report to make aware to people who are considering taking acid or have experimented with acid before to remember one very important thing, all acid comes in different strengths that can only be known after taking the drug. Unlike a bottle of scotch which has the alcohol content on the side of the bottle, acid comes in many different strengths.

I had experimented a few times with acid and had only mild visuals that lasted for a couple of hours. I remember the first one which was a blotter and had a picture of a key with wings on it. I had a couple of other different ones with little effect and pretty much thought that I was a seasoned tripper who could take any tab of acid and be alright. Thats until I had my 6th trip.

It was a friday night and me and my friend, lets call him G, had decided to go and buy some acid from a guy we had met a couple of times at local death metal concerts we used to frequent. This guy used to scare the shit out of me, he had a massive inverted cross tattooed on his back along with other scary tats and scars from self mutilation all over his arms. We paid him only half the price we had paid for acid we had purchased previously from other people and I was a little sceptical. The acid he gave us was a blank blotter which he reffered to as a 'White Tile'. I thought sure mate you probibly cut it from note paper about ten minutes ago, but I wasn't going to argue with him.

So anyway, me and G got back into our car and dropped the acid, roughly 8 pm at night, and drove back to his place. We sat down in his room and played some music for a bit waiting for the effects to kick in, the whole time which I spent complaining about how I thought we got ripped off. After 30 mins had passed nothing. So I suggested we smoke some skunkweed I had to help bring on the effects. Whilst on my second joint the trip kicked in. The first thing I can remember is that it felt like one second I wasn't tripping and then the next second I was tripping stronger then I had previuosly before. It was really funny at first because me and G both started tripping at the same time. We decided to walk to another friends house about 3 kilometers away. Whilst walking there the entire time the trip was getting stronger. I would stare at parked cars and see them breathing in and out. Looking at my friend it seemed that his shaved head had now grown dreadlocks and all the trees had faces which were all looking at me. 

I told my friend what I was seeing and we both laughed about it, he told me that my face looked pale green and that I had fangs and large weeping sores all over it. By the time we got to our friends house I was tripping harder then ever.

We sat in a small shed, lets call our other friend D, had in his backyard. We used to sit out there so his parents wouldn't bother us. It had three chairs around a small table covered in grafiti with a bucket of water on it which we used to smoke marijuana from using a cut coca cola bottle. G pulled out his weed and started to smoke some while I stared at the table, I was mesmarised by it, I could see faces which seemed to be only inches from my face smiling at me then withdrawing back to the table only to come back at me. I looked up at G at this point, roughly 11pm, and told him I was fucked up and tripping too hard. He offered me some weed and I said noway, in fact I decided to give my remaining skunkweed to D because I said I would never smoke it again (this turned out to be an acid induced lie). My visuals were overwelming, I found it hard to look at people because of the shit that I was seeing. And I had this overwelming thought that the shed I was sitting in was a small shed in the middle of a vast shanty town on which leaving the shed would mean that I was lost in a labyrinth of slums.

G and D eventually convinced me that I would be alright and we left his house to go to the local 24 hour shop to buy some munchies. When I was walking in I couldn't stop looking at things. Everything was swirling and melting into each other then going back to normal then melting again. At one point the man behind the counter came up too me and asked me if I could close the door to the fridge which had the coca cola in it because I was standing there looking at it with the door open for about 15 minutes. This seemed like only a minute or so. I eventually grabbed a snickers bar and a coke and went to the counter. All I could do was stare at the man, because he was staring at me. It felt like I was staring at him for about 5 minutes or so before I reached into my pocket and grabbed a ten dollar note out which I promptly spent another 5 minutes staring at. I'm not actually sure if this was the actual time spent but my time perception was completely out the door. 

I eventually gave the man the money and walked out without waiting to receive the change and met D and G outside. They spent the next couple of minutes laughing at me because I was so wasted, which I had a little laugh at too. 

I think the the trip was still kicking in because things started to get even more different. I became aware of how unbeleivably small I was in the universe and felt a depression coming on due to the fact of how insignificant I was. I could feel the valves in my arteries opening and closing, and could feel the blood circulating through my whole body. I was able to look down at my chin which appeared to be stretched down to my waist, and was able to run my hand down it. I found at this point I was grinding my teeth alot and clenching my fists so hard that all the blood seemed to be squeezed out of them. At this point I wanted to go home. I threw my unopened chocolate bar and can of coke away because I didn't know what to do with them and started walking home with G. I remember walking past traffic lights which would change colour and give the entire night sky the same colour.

By now it was about 2am. I got home and decided to sit and watch a little tv. I was all alone because my mother was out and felt shit scared something was going to happen to me. Everything was still spinning and there was a small green dragon next to the tv which wouldn't let me past to get to my room, so I thought I would wait on the couch until either it went away or the acid wore off. This is the time when my mother came walking through the door (I hadn't heard her car pull into the driveway), she asked me how I was and how my night was which I remember replying by saying with my eyes extremely wide open 'fine, just fine....I'm off to bed now, goodbye'. I remember her looking at me with this weird look, you know the 'what the hell is this guy on' look. Lucky for me she didn't follow to investigate. I pretty much spent the rest of the night lying in bed unable to sleep staring at a poster of a band called Obituary. The band members faces would come out of the poster to me and stare at me, which scared me alot, so I closed my eyes and could see a myriad of shapes and colours swirling into uniform patterns shapeshifting into different shapes marching accross my mind and could here a bubbling sound which I was convinced was my brain desolving in my skull......pretty cool huh?

At about 7 am I was able to sleep. I awoke at about 9am in a sort of dopey hangover zombie like state. My brother drove us to McDonalds to get a burger and on the way back was nearly in a serious car accident, I remember the car skidding for about 10 metres at which I put the burger up to my mouth and had a bite, the car kept skidding and narrowly missed and oncoming car which was at that point I thought 'holy fuck what just happened', Needless to say by brain wasn't quite all there yet.

From that experience I pretty much learnt that It was a huge risk taking the drug. I thought it was going to be a walk in the park but it turned out to be a ride to hell and back. I think that I couldn't have got through the night without my friends being with me and I would never take LSD again without someone with me to help lookout for me. 

So you want to know if I have ever done LSD again? yes, several times, but always with a trusted friend with me. I beleive that LSD opens up a part of your mind that allows you to see things new and unseen, much like a small child wondering and amazed at seeing something he or she has never seen before. 

Goodluck.

Pre-Babble: This was to be one of many experiences with LSD, the first being 6 months beforehand, at the age of 15. This particular story I choose to dwell upon as I felt it left numerous festering loose-ends in the intricate channelling of my brain. Since being noted 14 Ive been smoking the greenery consistently and have downed various substances (Ketamine, Noss, Meth): I know the density of emotion/vacancy that drugs tend to evoke and am therefore less susceptible to fabricated paranoia etc  which relates to the below tale as it was composed mostly of fear and negativity. 

The Acid: acquired from a friend of a friend, around 30 tabs,  apparantly White Fluff, Doubly dipped etc. Imprinted on each tab was a voluptuous set of lips, with an out-poked tongue.

No intentional preparation although I hadnt eaten that day

9:00 pm - 4 blotter tab orally

9:30 pm -  Dexedrine orally (unknown amount nor how I got it)

9:30 to 10:00  6 pack of ale/J worth of Greens

Tale:  A few mates and myself set off for a party in a neighbouring suburb. I didnt intend to take acid on the night as Id downed too many in local times, and I could feel the fry seeping into my frontal lobe, if you take my meaning. 9:00 pm fell from the sky, (wed arrived at the party half hour before, socialised etc ) and sure enough my mate suggests we perpetuate this night -with his impeccable insight into this language of ours- so we both took 4 tabs each. After an unknown hiatus of Absent-mindedly strolling around the perimeters I start to notice the preliminaries: speedy heart, rushing senses, physically uplifting electrics, confused visuals. Alls well at this point, Im contented roaching, drinking a fine ale and conducting anthropology. My mate catches up with me, informs me of; chronological presence, him being off his nut, the novelty of drunken behaviour. Herein I must of fallen deeply into intoxicated limbo, as I only recall events in an incoherent fashion with no indentifiable connective string. 

I remember ingesting some amount of Dexedrine, which is thoroughly baffling as to how I came across. I recall working myself into a frenzy - induced by some trivial train of thought  and running into the  fading eye, which, in common reality, translated as a passing bus. Next thing Im sitting at a bus stop profusely bleeding from the cranium, my brain spiralling at light speed, analysing the scenery in a blandly cynical manner; fucking bobbing houses inhabited by pointlessly productive 9-5 citizens, thoroughly enlightened watching the idiot-box.uni-directional stimulimotivated by food etc. I must of become bored with myself and the clinical taste now becoming apparent in my mouth as I decided to walk back to the party, not as if I had any sense of geometry or spatial perception for that matter. 

Anyhow, I managed to arrive back to the now densely populated party, where someone must have noticed me and attended my wound as the bleeding seemed to have stopped with the application of a bandage whence next my memory shot into my current consciousness. The night waned and I remember being in different rooms greeted by blotted masses of black and blue visualisations which I didnt find disturbing although now I do. I seemingly possessed an ability to make objects transparent, which I found aesthetically pleasing. Retrospectively, most of my visuals/thoughts/sensations were of a negative nature, which seemed to be what my seat of consciousness was solely composed of on that occasion. Which, I might add, is not my true self as I tend to be a light-hearted, mellow strawberry field fellow with no interest in the ill. We, w being I and the e being my mate, left at around 2:00 for my mates house. I told him of my goings-on, and vice versa, mutually still tripping it was permissible to converse our then epic revelations etc. 

We arrived at the destination around 2:30, half way through the 5th hour of the trip. I was starting to come down at that stage or grow more numb as I like to say and just did. My mate just wanted to chillout with music and his tranquil state. I on the other hand, was in a deep struggle with my brain for some sense of mellowness, which since following the fading eye Id been at a loss to find. It was at this point that I regained my connection with my eyes I suppose, and I started to create evil, blackened images around the room. Even though I was sliding off the timeless merry-go-round LSD provides, I was still aware of intense visual distortion. My vision then suddenly felt as if it were splintering into a numberless amount of different dimensions, or states of consciousness. 

Then, like a picture forming, my immediate view began to transmogrify into a thousand interlacing eyes peering intently with their piercing pupils upon my retarded, simplistic insignificant self. At this I stood and stared, with glazed eyes as my mate informed me later, trying to comprehend the meaning behind such a depiction, whilst I felt a flurry of emotion engulf my soul from interest to apathy, curiousity to fear as if each had no reasoning nor meaning behind, just a different aspect of constant motion. At fear, unfortunately, I lost myself to and all that it entails followed. As fear is one of the most integral, primal emotions or reaction that any intelligeable being posseses, its easy to lose ones self to such and when it is a result of some vision or something that is not an immediate threat to mortality, like the fear of death or whatever, flowing emotion is rendered perishable or susceptible to all things ill. 

If all that shit made sense to you, the reader, then you can understand how I was frozen, laying on the floor with my left eye folding into my right, cross-eyed, perplexed, rendered utterly useless. Eventually I guess I passed out or something but I woke the next day feeling so fucked up and I found it hard to think, with an overwhelming feeling that I had done myself some permanent damage, which will perpetually reside in my subconscious, in other words, not easy to explain.

Ok, I'll be describing two different absolute wonderful acid trips in this report...I'll try to keep in short and sweet--if I can  *LOL*

trip #1:  I just recently, about two months ago, went on my first acid trip....I had smoked pot occasionally, but that's about it until that first time.  My fiance and I recieve two hits from a friend, two tiny little purple squares that completely changed my life.  We each took them at about 1 in the morning.  At 3ish we began our long, glorious journey with constant, hilarious giggling...then about 4 the visuals started.....  I was afraid at first, but I immediately calmed myself not wanting to start the trip off bad.  After a few minutes we went outside onto the deck, and were feeling extremely randy so we attempted sex, which was hilarious, because about halfway through, I looked up at the sycamore tree growing in our back yard and it started to 'grow'...I immediately lost all interest in the task at hand...and actually sat there so long, that brent said that when we snapped out of it my skin was cold..... so that was the main theme of our trip...that big, beautiful, growing tree, that would start to be 'pulled' into the sky by the 'wind', while growing in spiraling vines, each leaf shimmying independantly.  

The best part of the trip was how it opened my eyes to the world around me...and I felt the goddess in everything, including myself, and I saw the god in my fiance, he WAS the god, and I WAS the goddess.... it was like playing make believe... I was, for the first time since childhood, filled with complete awe and wonder.... everything went well until my stomach started to feel kind of cramped so I went and got a bath... and the walls started to melt and it kind of freaked me out... being inside really got me down.... we spent the rest of the trip laying in bed, watching the ceiling, trying to go to sleep... he came down about 10 in the morning, but I wasn't back to relative normalcy until about 24 hour after I took the acid.....


Trip#2:  our second acid trip took place the night before last.... completely by surpise we came across someone selling acid, and along with a friend bought a few hits... we all took our hits at about 10:30pm, and the effects came on extremely quick, at about 11:30, I was steadily climbing into euphoria.  We watched the cartoon Spirited Away, and it was even more enjoyable that usual.  It was our friend's first time, and he was hilarious, pacing around speaking in a various accents (when he could force himself to speak) and puffing on a cigar.  This trip wasn't nearly as intense as the last, but that was good. it was easy to control, and alot mellower.  It was raining outside, but I went out and visited the tree anyways. it was beautiful, being pulled by the high winds of the storm..... my fiance and I had a serious god/goddess theme again this time, and it was very religious, and opened my eyes even further....  spent most of the night in the bedroom, which has been completely redone in natural decor so it was far more pleasant, and candle lit...  we painted each other with various religious symbols and laid around chilling out having a wonderful time.  

my fiance and I ended the trip with some very intense sex, and we both had our first orgasms while on acid, and it was fuckin awesome.... It was so intense, feeling the goddess and god in us... the sex was so primal, like a story, or like a part of a legend or something, I wouldn't have been suprised if I looked behind me at him and he had grown antlers. 

Suprisingly enough we actually got tired at about 5 in the morning and fell asleep....I was sober enough by 5 o'clock to go in to work, so basically, it was different than the first one, but still excellent.

A note on Acid in general:

I highly recommend doing this with someone you love, I have never loved Brent as much as I do when I'm on acid...it's brought us closer together....  Also, it has made me do some serious soul searching,and has made me completely rethink religion....everyone needs to try it at least once!

I've never tried any drugs other than weed, so when my friend suggested that a group of us trip, I was interested.  Of course, being the paranoid nerd that I am, I went online and did my research.  Had to make sure I wasn't in danger of dying off of two hits of acid...yeah I am paranoid.  Probably why acid wasn't such a good choice of drugs for me.  

About 8pm, my cousin and two friends and I each took 2 geltabs of acid.  I remember saying, 'wow these things look so little, are you sure they are going to work?'.  One of my friends that had taken acid before just laughed at me.  A half hour went by, and I was a bit annoyed because I felt the same.  I wanted to take another one, but my friend assured me that it wouldn't be long before it kicked in.  20 minutes later, I was starting to feel a little strange.  I suggested we all go outside and sit on the porch to get some air.  An hour later, we were two miles from my house running through the woods.  Now I'm pretty much a lazy person, it's an effort just to walk outside to my mail box :-).  But I felt so great, like I could walk anywhere!  We killed another hour walking back, it was a lot of laughing and good feelings all around.  

When we got back to my house, that's when things started getting weird.  I had forgotten that we had set up black lights and posters all over my living room to celebrate the occasion.  So when I walked into the house, I was completely weirded out.  The colors from the posters were swirling around and moving all over the ceiling and floor.  I started to get scared, and had this thought in my head that my two friends were going to kill  my cousin and I.  I guess the power of suggestion was enough to freak her out as well, because we both ended up in the bedroom trying to climb out the window.  I have never felt so terrified in my life.  At that moment, I truely belived my own insane thoughts.  My friends came in and freaked when they saw me dangling half out the window.  After fighting with them briefly, I agreed to go back out and sit in the living room.  The black lights and posters were more vivid than ever...I remember looking at one and seeing a plane flying towards me.  I got all emotional and started crying.  

My friends told me the next day that I was talking about the plane and all the 'people trying to escape the city' in the poster for like 2 hours. I don't remember what time we ended up passing out but it was starting to get light out so I know it was early morning.  The first thing I looked at was that poster.  It was of a bunch of mushrooms.  And all I could think of was how the hell I ever saw a plane.  Over all, I'd say I had a good experience. Except for the brief period I thought my friends were going to murder me.  Like I said though...I'm a naturally paranoid person.

My second experience with acid has been, to date, my most signifigant and was a transformative event in my life.  Before that point I had a healthy respect for the drug but perhaps not to the extent I should have. At the time I was doing relatively well financially so taking a pharmacopia of drugs into a rave wasn't unusual for me.  I would bring some for myself and enough to resell at cost to several dozen of my friends.  I wasn't interested in making a profit, just in buying affection.

My previous acid trip had been in a low-key environment but I had no qualms about trying it in the frenetic atmosphere of a party for some reason.  I intended to drop and take ecstacy later on. I took 2 hits of a large sheet and then proceeded to deal out a score of caps of E waiting for the effects to kick in.  The building was quite familiar to me; in my area there are few venues available to rave promoters.  Every time I went to a party there it seemed smaller.  

Around this point my memory becomes rather vague.  I remember being hungry and eating something but not what that something was.  My friends tell me they remember seeing me munching on some paper and subsequent investigations revealed that in my delerium, I had eaten the entirety of the rest of my acid. Time ceased to move forward of its own accord.  Events would only proceed through a conscious excercise of will.  Additionally, I no longer chose to do things, I chose the alternate reality in which I did the things I wanted myself to do - an fine distinction. I gradually lost touch with my fundamental understanding of who and what I was.  I had the strange fear that I had seen a deeper layer of reality and, having done so, I would never be able to regain a normal viewpoint; never be able to pull the wool back over my eyes. Out of the whirling ball of paranoia that I had become, one thought concept finally cut through and calmed me.  I realized that no matter what straits I found myself in, whatever trials I faced, just by concentrating on the moment and living for that instant alone I could always be perfectly content.  

It was a new idea for me although not new to the world as I later found out.  Further reading revealed that many schools of thought had advanced such a conclusion and had developed it much further including Buddhism, Gnosticism and a few varieties of shamanism.

After that trip I gained new appreciation for the Buddhist practices of my mother and I now attend meditations with her and I have never been happier.  All in all a very welcome lesson.

After reading countless reports of LSD induced trauma and mind warping, I feel obligated to recount MY experiences with LSD. 

Back in around grade 11 (17 years old) I started becoming more interested in drugs other than weed and alcohol. Most of my friends had tried acid and seemed fine. Despite the horror stories (people clawing out their eyes or scratching their arms off etc) I decided to get my hands on some. 

So, I went to my long term friend, had a chat with him and ended up leaving his house with a sheet of 250 hits of acid. I got a sheet because this way, each hit cost 50 cents and I could sell each one for 5 dollars. Anyways, on with the experiences. 

I first tried half a hit at school. I did it without telling anybody. I met up with my friend after school (I went to a private school so we always met up after) and told him how I felt. I felt fine. A little edgy, pupils dilated, and slightly sick. The sick feeling was 'gut-rot' that people sometimes get after taking acid -- and it wasn't that bad at all. 

Soon enough, I was doing acid at school, by myself, each day. My dose would increase throughout the week so that I always had the same buzz. It seemed that if I did half a tab on Monday, that on Tuesday, I would need a full tab to experience what I felt on Monday. By Friday I would be up to 3 or 4 tabs at most. I wouldn't do it on Sundays and rarely did it on Saturdays. This went on for about 5 months. You can do the math, but, despite the way you look at it, that is a hell of allot of acid! 

Now, I wasn't doing this to get high. My grades shot WAY up and I was able to pay attention in class much more effectively. Each day I would wake up, eat breakfeat, and with my mug of coffee, wash down a hit or two of acid. At lunch, I would go to the library and study and eat my sandwiches in an isolated cublicle. My mind was so clear and learning was much much easier. 

Most days, I felt fine. However, occasionally, I would come to school feeling absolutely horrible. And I mean horrible. My digestive system would be in absolute turmoil and I had no mental or physical capacity to do anything. I just felt totally burnt out: my eyes would be bloodshot and my skin would be very pale. 

At about the 5 month mark, I fell ill with pneumonia. I was extremely sick and bedridden for almost a month. I attribute this to being run down by the effects of the LSD. Essentially, my mind was in over-drive for 5 months. I decided to quite acid. Once I had returned to school, my marks dropped and I went back to my usual bored self. Teachers were concerned as were my parents. It is funny that they only became concerned after all this had happened. To this day however, I still have not touched any illegal substance. 

Throughout this time, I never once saw anything --- only 'tracers' like when you had looked at a bright light and closed your eyes. Years later (well not too many), I am doing fine. I graduated from a top university in economics and am now going to start my masters in finance. So obviously my little experience hasn't had any effects on my brain.

I think that the effects of using this drug are overated and blown out of proportion. Hope this is usefull to somebody.

-We kept notes the entire night as our experience went on and on. We dropped at like 9pm. For the remainder of the experience, I will be known as tad, and my two friends will be known as chad and dave. We each went through our own bad trips, but we also went through good ones as the night progressed.

one may live for as long as a human can live, perhaps forver, and their life may seem at the instant that they obtain 'standstillesness' perfect, but the next thing to happen may appear as the fire coming from the center of the earth, but for this one eternal man, it will not harm him, what may in the beginning seem as walls of 'fire' coming in from every directions may in time subside, and what seems so extreme at one point, when time is extended it is merely a disruption on the surface, a ripple in another pond, the flame wavering in someone elses wind we can do as many reality checks as we want, but the truth as it may be, is that all things are eternal, and in one sense, every event is intertwined, as to how is beyond this document, it can not be explained in any document, as it can be taken on any tangent, any possible explanation can be explored, but there is always some where furhter.

water gives live, blue is all comforting, white light is so inviting red repels us, flames scare, black and darkness try to send us away 
for now it is 11:26, and i am supposed to be going, as my explanation can not be fully expanded upon even in person, with my simple demonstrations with a strobe and a blue cup of water and a flame, with my hypotheses about the man who finds the perfect drop of water to give him eternal life and sees the rest of the world buring in flames, eventually his life becomes so long that these ripples become only minor molecules in the true ocean, the true ripple.
the atlantic ocean? it is the largest ocean. it is immense. but....the earth? it is almost entirely water! but you know what, this earth, is it not part of a solar system? a larger arrangements of planets that revolve around a sun? this sun is our center of life, all existance on earth, comes from the heat and power of this star, and our planets are revolving around this star...
but then, isnt this one 'all life giving' star known as the sun, part of another grouping of stars? and infinite amount of stars all bunched together in the most tremendous thing known to man:

the galazy.
think about the sheer size of a galaxy - an infinite amount of stars all bunched together, but pick and choose at random any one of these stars, and around this star is a 'solar system' a system of various bodies all circliing around a star, which in itself is part of a large group of stars
revolving around some larger entitiy, in a universe. i have lost my train of thought, distracted by a smaller more direct matter, at about 11:34 but this train of thought, in the large scheme of things, is nothing. another man may be having thoughts 1000 fold the insightfullness as mine, but this will subisde, all that is gained, is lost. all that is lost is in some form regained. the peaks and valleys of a ripple. the ripple in the ocean. the ocean on the earth. the earth in the solar system. the solar system in the galaxy. the galaxy in the universe. the universe in the ?.
this, i as a human, cannot go further than this, as it is at the fullest of human capacity, that the universe is known to not be the largest body. the human can prove beyond reasonable doubt that the galxy exists as a container of stars, the stars contain the worlds, the world contain the oceans, the oceans contain the ripples. the ripples contain much more in them self, but also in the lowely way that a human can descrive, are symbols for the peaks and valleys, that are only in essence parts of a larger ripple, and on for infinadum.

11:40
Dave feels that the lsd may be bringing out his grandmothers schizophrenia in him, but in reality, does it really matter? he may go crazy, but isnt there an entire human race to care about? but in that same mindset, isnt there all of life in its entirety to care about? but when we try to to to to to to 11:43 (off on another tangent, trying to elaborate to tad and dave, but they cant comprehend, what does it matter if they cant cpomprehend? there are always those that will, but for everyone that will, thre will be someone who wont. and maybe at one point, those that understand are in the larger percentage, it will always happen that at a later time those that dont will be in the larger percentage. it is all back an forth, wobbling, too and fro, teetering here and tilting there, and ALL FOR WHAT?
HUMANS WILL NEVER KNOW! I HAVE JUST HIT THE CAPS LOCK BUTTON, A SIGN OF ANGER? NO, IT MAY SEEM THAT WAY FOR SOMEONE WHO IS FOND OF THE INTERNET, BUT ARENT THESE 'CAPITAOL LETTERS' AND 'SCREAMING TEXT' JUST DOTS ON A SCREEN?HUNDREDS OF TINY BOTS THAT DEFINE WHAT THE HUMAN INTERPRETS AS A LETTER ON A SCREEN, THAT THE AMERICAN MIND INTERPRETS ARE ITS NATIVEALPHEBET, ONE WHICH IT CAN MAKE SENSE OF THE LITTLE DOTS AND FLASHES OF LIGHTS, WITH A LANGUAGE THAT THE HUMANS CAN UNDERSTND, BUT REALLY CAN THEY?

11:47 - DAVE BROUGHT TADS TREE UPSTAIRS
DAVE SAYS IT WAS NELLY THE ELEPHANT
THIS NELLY, IS A PIECE OF DAVES MIND, ONE WHICH HE CREATED TO TRY TO EXPLAIN HIS FEELINGS. HE HAS A 'FRIEND'... DAVE FEELS THAT PLANTS MAKE THE ROOM MORE ORGANIC, HE MAY GET US CAUGHT WITH HIS MINDLESS RUNNING AROUND PERHAPS HE IS MAKING BETTER USE OF HIS TIME LIKE THIS BY FULLY EXPERIEMTNING WITH WHAT HE SEES, BUT IN REALIZTY, HUMANS HAVE HAD EXPERIENCES LIKE THIS A MILLION TIMES BEFORE. DAVE IS HAVING A BAD TRIP. I MAY BE THE ONE WITH THE SENSE NOW T
I HAVE TO GO, THINGS ARE GETTING TOO INTENSE

11:51, DAVE IS OVER MY SHOULDER, BEING WEIRD, TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF ALL THIS, DAVE NEEDS HIS PLANT TO KEEP HIM SANE
I AM LEAVING, DAVE IS VIOPLENT

11:51 CHAD APRIL 13 2001

-it took him awhile to get back to normal, but he learned much about himself from this somewhat bad trip.

-Chad started typing
this is chad, i am here, dave has left the room, it is now 12.03

-Tad:

12:11AM
it means nothing... because all this is is the drug telling us what to think. But the drug says that my cells betray me. My cells tell me what to do. My cells all so bent on self-preservation that they cause me pain. They are me, and i am them. So how, when the world is all we have, can we kill eachother? How can we say that there is something good for us? Everything has an end, and every end starts a new beginning. There is no true beginning, no true end, no ANYTHING. nothing exists? nothing is real? What the hell?

-I don't think I was even understanding this as I was writing it.

-Chad started typing again

this is chad 12:13 dave acutally has schizophrenia. for a long period of time, he acutally 'became somone else' 

1220
dave says 'over schizophrenia, putting down red piull, pickign up blue, dave accepts his schizophrenia he says 'if i want to come out, dont let me' tad recites the matrix, and using as a metaphor for daves realization of his disease'

1222 dave goes into closet to think this over
12224 dave comes out says he is down after rethinkinh he says he just lost himself again, and has once again regained himself dave is coming to grips
*note this honeslty seemed like 10 minutes to tad and i, 30 seconds to dave dave wishes to type his thougta at  1225

-we kinda goofed around for a while and watched TV, then, it was my turn for the bad trip as chad just came out of his.

-TAD:

2:28AM
i saw chad in the mirror, and his eyes just stayed om place as his face and felsh and muscile all melted away all at once. And he just becaused a skeliton right there. He was standing in the mirror with his eyes, looking right at me, and he was just dead. His eyes scared the hell out of me. Then i saw dave, as chad wasw aalready there, and dave did the same. It sounded like an atom bomb in my head. and i came over to lay down. And i closed my wtyes and then i just saw the whole world, everyone, every face and person eradicated. I was then standing alone on a red star shaped platform, with blacknesss and nothingness everywhere. And then, eyes, everywhere, looked at me. Some jokingly, some laugingly, some to accuse... I was immortal, there, DAMMED FOREVER TO SEE THE EYES THAT MOCK ME.

-I was truly scared, I remember myself just lying on the floor motionless for almost an hour, dave almost called an ambulance

-I started having a conversation with chad and dave by typing my responses

448
go away chad, get off my back you homo

-All and all, a great experience, one which we will more than likely repeat. After this, weed and other smokables seemed so dirty. Every time I've smoked weed since this though, it's been more than a high, but less than a trip. Acid is truly the drug that keeps on giving.

I have taken LSD many times. There are only a precious few trips that really stick out in my mind as an EXPIERIENCE, this is a letter about one of them. I was with my best friend/trip buddy Meg, and we decided to go to a party and take some acid. My other friend Nikki and her date (a guy i never met before) decided to come to the party with us, and trip also. This was fine because i love Nikki and this guy she was with was cool and had a positive attitude. On the flipside, the party we were going to was going to be intense. A lot of my ex-girlfriends were going to be there along with people i didnt like and a lot of strangers. The party was at a 2 floor apt. in a bad city. During recent acid trips my best friend Meg and I had we became bonded with this ceramic garden Gnome that i had in my room. For reasons i cant explain he was our tripping buddy and we named him BILL THE TRIP GNOME. He has a wise smile on his bearded face and seems to have brought us peace and comfort during our recent acid trips. We knew it was gonna be a crazy nite, so we all decided to bring Bill the Gnome to the party with us. I put him in my backpack along with other things to prepare me for the nite. I alwasy have certain things with me if im doing acid away from home, the things i brought that nite besides Bill the Gnome were, some beer because i like to drink a little when i trip. I also brought a change of clothes in case i did something stupid and got dirty or sweaty. I also had my glow toys which included a squishy glow ball(red) and green glow sticks. I also have asprin just in case of a headache. So I was prepared physically and mentally for a good trip... 

Knowing Bill would be there gave me a really good vibe for the nite. We dropped in the car on the way to the party at about 9pm. The blotters were named MAGIC, which i liked because i wanted it to be a magical evening. It kicked it quick for us, we all took 2 and 1/2 hits at the same time. Meg gave everyone vitamin C drops to help out our colors and visuals. I never really thought it did much but this nite it all seemed to flow so well. We get to the party, and there are so many people there, at this time the acid is starting to take effect and when we walk in we stayed in our little trip group and found a spot in the house where we could have our 'comfort zone'. We all decided to just sit for a bit and take in our surroundings before anything else. We were on the floor in a 4 person circle when i opened my bag and took out Bill. Everyone else at the party was drunk and smoking pot, we were the only ones on LSD. When i took Bill out and placed him in the center of our circle we all smiled and giggled because Bill started to smile with us, and gave us strength that the nite would go smoothly. This little 10inch ceramic Gnome became the center of our 'comfort zone' and many of the drunks were already making fun of us, but we all looked at eachother and nobody cared because Bill was giving us courage and strength. He knew us and they did not. 

About 30 min. after we got to the party the acid started to kick us full on. It was about 1 hour into the trip. Everyone was standing and smoking and we were all still sitting. As we looked up the smoke at the top of the room looked amazing. I asked Nikkis date if he was ok, because he really only knew Nikki. He just smiled and laughed and said 'im lost!'. I knew he would be ok and i let him take in his own trip. My gay guy friend Al came over to us to talk and just laughed when he saw Bill. Al had a shirt on it with a wonderful abstract pattern and we all noticed it at the same time. He found it amusing that we were so fasinated with his shirt. He had never done acid and asked us what was so special about his shirt. I told him that ' it looks like your wearing liquid clothing, its not a shirt its liquid armor!'. For the next hour we just sat in our circle and watched everyone. People didnt really talk to us, and it felt like we were flys on the wall just watching and waiting. About 2 hours into the trip we decided to take a walk upstairs. We left our circle and Bill to hold the fort(even though he was an inatimate object) we knew he would keep our comfort zone safe. 

Going upstairs was like going to another world, and we all agreed on this. Things were so different upstairs because the whole scene had changed. Different people, and different music. It wasnt bad, but it wasnt as good as being downstairs. All four of us sat on a bed huddled toghether and just started to crack up for no reason. The laughing fit seemed to last forever until the girl who lived there gave us a HUGE sticker book with all kinds of sticker like fuzzy ones, glitter, squishy, big, small, and very colorful. The stickers are just what we needed at that point in the trip. They were amazing and the color was just popping out of the pages of the book. Every kind of image was in that book on a sticker. I started to worry about my Gnome,Bill. So Meg and i took the journey down the stairs into the place we started our trip. It seemed like we were only upstairs for like half an hour but it was actually close to an hour and a half. So we were reaching the end of our peak and we all knew it. 

I told Nikki and her date that they had to come and bond with Bill the trip Gnome. We went to our comfort zone which was untouched thanks to Bill. He had a little satisfied smile on his face, and just looked at us with his blue eyes. We all agreed he was special, and magical. We were all glad I decided to bring him to the party. Most of the people had left, and the others that were still there gave us a nice vibe and we were all very comfortable. I drank some beer and took some asprin and just relaxed the rest of the nite. I said my goodbyes and went home with my friends. That nite or should I say early morning, cause it was like 4am when i got home, well I sat Bill down on the table next to my bed and just stared at him until I fell asleep. He seemed to sooth my brain and sing me to sleep. 

That was one of the best trips ive ever had, and i really owe it all to a ceramic garden gnome. I know it sounds crazy, but he was a good friend and although i dont have him anymore, i do miss having him with me. 'BILL THE TRIP GNOME' I will always love that guy. I wish all of you acid lovers could meet him. I do think LSD is a great drug, and a wonderful way to find yourself. That nite i learned that you can love anything. Even if his reality only exists in my own head.

I've been telling this story for awhile now. I think i want to write it down too.

It was a hot Friday night in July, and my friend Victor had a connection for good acid. I had tripped more than four times prior to this, and Victor and our other friends were fairly experienced as well. It was me, Victor, and a third friend, Benny, with 11 sugarcubes of acid in front of us. This was the beginning of a night that was amazing and yet very unnerving.

I recommend using far more caution with large amounts of unknown-potency acid than we did. Yet it was one of the most profound, life-altering experiences i've ever had.

At about 8.30pm or so we ate our cubes. I ate 3. Benny ate 2. Victor ate four (victor, please note, was also on anti-depressants at the time of this trip. zoloft, i think). We decided to go to a friend's graduation party. We picked up Victor's girlfriend and another female acquaintance and headed out. 

At T+30 min. Benny ate another sugarcube. I, on the other hand, was already feeling effects of the acid. Whoever dripped these cubes must have had no idea what they were doing, becuase these things had to have been soaked. Anyway, i was driving, which was stupid to begin with, so i had to pull over and let Victor's girlfriend drive. When we arrived at the party it felt neat to get up and walk around. I looked over the fence and some hedges and saw a huge property with an olympic swimming pool and horses. 'Look at the horses', i said to everyone. wow. When i entered the yard, it was nothing more than an inground pool surrounded by concrete:) and this after not even an hour! The party, unfortunately, was terrible. There were parents there and a terrible band was playing dave matthews songs and old friends from high school whom i didn't want to see were there. i was 20 and my friends were in their mid teens. It was terrible. 

i stumbled back to the car and waited for the others. When everyone came out of the party i demanded that Victor's girlfriend (Donna) drive us back to Victor's place. I proceeded to crawl into the passengers seat and lock my seatbelt. That party had scared me, and i was very small and afraid. As everyone piled into the car it was so hot that i rolled down the window and leaned out babbling 'we have to go, we have to go'. So Donna puts the car in reverse, and instead of backing out, slams on the gas and plows into a huge bush, which smacks me in the face. I cannot describe the terror i felt. I began to cry. i was so lost and afraid. I balled while Benny and Victor laughed and Donna apologized. Later on, in the car, Victor was describing how as a child he couldn't pronounce the letter R. I immediately began to laugh hysterically, completely coming out of the hole i was in. We decided that the other girl, Kim, would stay with us for the duration of the trip. We had no idea what we were getting into.

When we arrived at Victor's house i sat on his back porch. Spotlights were shining down from the sky and i could see monsters and spirits in the leaves in the trees. I was still afraid. When i entered the house the tiles in the foyer shifted and gave way beneathe me. I did not regain my composure until i was upstairs on the couch, Mark Farina on the stereo. This is where the most amazing experience began for me, a complete 180 from what had just occured. 

Kim was laying on the floor, and as i stared at her (she was very attractive, young with incredible breasts) she morphed into a little girl sitting in her room, who shifted into a black girl with an afro listening to a record player. The entire room around her shifted right along with her through different time periods. She had an incredibly tight shirt on and it had a picture of a ninja turtle on it. Victor and i laughed for at least twenty minutes, because the turle seemed to bulge and dance on her shirt. 'God i love being a turtle!' we screamed:) I stood in a corner of the room, and found that by pressing down with my foot i could bend the room. I made dust levitate with my hands and spun it around in mid-air. I lay down on the floor, and i found myself instead lying on a creek bed, looking up through the water at the sky. There were clouds and blue sky and a bright sun, no ceiling at all. I could see reeds jutting out from the river bank. Fish swam by. Kim threw her leg over the edge of a chair to my right, and the chair morphed into a long wooden dock, with kim dangling her legs down into the water. I felt so cool and relaxed. i felt at peace there underwater. i could breathe normally and watch everything without the least bit of fear. i began to play with kim's feet, rubbing and massaging them. I began to see planets orbiting around her toes, tiny meteors and stars and her feet became the universe and i got closer and closer and closer.

I began to feel as though i needed to be alone. so after convincing everyone that it was fine i went out onto the second floor porch. I looked over the railing and saw a hole dug into the garden below, a body in a sack curled up next to it. At first i was afraid, but then i realized what was going on. That was my old self, my old body before this amazing trip. I had reached a new level of awareness and this old self was being cast back to the earth. it was a very beautiful moment for me. I watched the body enter the grave and plants grew up over it. A river appeared before me and i washed my hands in the river. AS i had experienced this, a shaft of light had flashed in the sky repeatedly. I am not religious, but i reached an inner peace with part of myself because of that vision.

After retreating to the computer room and chatting online for a bit, i found a pen and began to write. i was still touched by my experiences outside, and i began to write 'thank you' all over the desk with a purple marker. Soon i could see tiny fuzz balls spinning on a grid inside the ink, and i flew down close and close as the ink swirled and formed patterns. I cut up a board game, producing a piece of cardboard that read 'the original memory game'. Kim came to visit me and after flirting with her for a bit we went back to join the other two. I hung my sign on the wall, where it remains to this day. Victor and Kim went off and Benny was watching Fantasia, so i sat down on the floor with Benny and we started to analyze the film. I have never seen anything more amazing than 'fantasia'. Never. 'A night on bald mountain' blew my mind. Benny and i bonded and began to get philosophical.

I should mention at this point that time had no meaning. I know the experience began about 9pm and only truly ended at 2pm the next day. We were lost in a globe out in space, our experience was completely detached from human convention. I really believe that now. 

It was then that we learned from Kim that Victor had taken a fifth sugarcube (remember that extra one?)while we were outside smoking. Its amazing how little impact that had on us. we figured that he was having as good a time as us. Benny went into Victor's room with Kim while i squeezed myself behind a chair and began to fantasize as 'some things come from nothing' began to play. The music that entire night became a perfect soundtrack, following our moods to the letter. It is a beautiful song and i saw tiny people on the tops of the chair throwing things down to me on the floor. Benny came out and laughed, then changed the cd to medeski martin and wood (combustication). 

Victor emerged from the room and sat down with a cig while we bugged him about taking the last cube. He was acting weird. Apparently he had been in his room with the light off, headphones on, and the door shut. He had been trying to hook up with Kim as well. He would only say 'oh'. we couldn't get him to say anything but 'oh'.

yes, this is where it got bad. Benny began flipping out, demanding that we tell him in detail what had happened during the night. I was completely cool by contrast, saying everything was fine. I didn't trust Kim. I was convinced she had taken some acid. I was fucked up but had convinced myself i was rationale. I told kim to take benny out of the room to talk. Meanwhile, Victor had curled up at my feet (i was sitting) and was stroking himself through his pants, chanting 'oh' in rhythmic patterns. i couldn't help but laugh. it was repulsive yet so brutally stupid that i had to laugh. Then the worst thing happened. Victor raised his head and plunged his hand into his mouth up to his wrist. i pulled it out quickly, but to this day i still don't know if that really happened. he says he was trying to kill himself because he thought he was insane.

Victor had a true bad trip. We had to call his brother, who arrived and brought us all down to his house five minutes away. We watched 'the big lebowski' and gradually Victor came back to us. He grabbed my leg and said 'douglas is that you? are you really there, right now?' i assured him that i was and he laughed out of sheer relief. we stayed  for a little longer and then made our way back to Victor's house to collapse from fatigue. At 12.30pm saturday i awoke and went home still in a daze. I went back to sleep.

There are two things i will say about this experience. 
1/ BE RESPONSIBLE!!! despite my good times, alot of bad shit happened. best to be prepared. Have a COMPETENT sober aid if the trip is a big one. Have an emergency plan, like someone you can call (luckily we did). and above all PLACE YOURSELF IN SAFE, COMFORTABLE SURROUUNDINGS. also....if you are taking an unknown amount of acid, try a small does first or ask around about the hit you got. I have never had sugar cubes as completely potent and saturated with LSD as those. I had tripped at least four times prior to this experience. had i known better i might not have taken all three at once.

2/EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE ON SUCH A HUGE TRIP AT LEAST ONCE. with the right environment and support you can completely expose your soul and rearrange your life in a positive and real way. i became much more sure of myself and socialable than i had been. many of my burdens from the past were lifted from my shoulders and thrown away.
While i was tripping on that back porch i had believed that i would never come down and that i had reached a new and permanent level of conciousness that would stay with me forever. Sometimes i really do believe that is true.

Thanks for reading.

Now, I had tripped once before in my life but it was probably real weak acid, I had 1 1/2 hits and felt nothing but a light headed feel, a real base-line effect. My friend jack had gotten hold of three microdots for the weekend and he invited myself and our friend dave to trip with him (me and dave had both shared our rather weak first experience). Jack was a tad more experienced in the ways of class a drugs than us although we all are regular pot heads and not shy of popping pills when the chance arises. 

Anyway, we had got hold of our trips and decided to go to our mates house (pete) to ingest them. Jack told us that it wouldn't be wise to drop so early in the evening (it was 4.00pm) cos we would be flying when the rest of civilisation was still active. I thought 'fuck that, I wanna trip!' and dave agreed so we ended up taking them about 5.00pm. Now I thought that if the first trip was anything to go by I would be able to handle everyday situations quite easily (I had made arrangements to see my girlfriend that evening) so I thought we would drop, go round my girlfriends house, come up and be back at petes house before it started peaking and get out of hand. Pete and his flatmates, who I wasn't too familiar with, started their evening of getting heavily stoned so I thought it would be rude to leave so early after getting there so I stayed for a few spliffs. 5.20pm (20 minutes after dropping) I felt strangely inhibited but I couldnt tell if I was just stoned or if I was coming up. 

About 10 minutes later I found myself to be staring at a rug in the corner of the room, it seemed to be 'breathing' as if it had a life of its own, this facinated me and it took me a while to come to terms why I was looking at a rug, pete was looking at me smiling (they know all about acid) about 5.40pm we all decided to go down the chippy and get dinner, although I was in no mood for eating, we left the house and walked down the high street by this time I was for lack of a better word fucked, I felt as if I had dropped a couple of pills I had the energetic feel of beans and I noticed that my visuals were distorting, lampposts were swaying very gently as if hanging in the breeze and the pavement in front of me was a myriad of weaving lines that threatened to trip me up if I wasn't careful, goddamn! These dots are nothing like the shitty blotters I had before, this was madness and I had to take the drivers seat..by the time we got to the chippy me and dave we jabbering about getting some mdma, this was the best idea in the world and no one could tell us otherwise, 'snap out of it, you've taken microdots, you dont know whats gonna happen, give it time'.

Pete and co. Went in the chippy while me jack and dave waited outside, jack started staring at a nokia mobile advertisment on the wall, the one with the ketchup seemingly sprayed all round the edges of it. The first thing I thought was 'fuck me theres a girl in that wall and shes covered in sauce, no it cant be it is! Its actual sauce on that there wall' I went in close and had a real good look, nope its just and advertisement but the light its emmiting is the dopest thing I've ever seen. By this time pete had been in the chip shop for what seemed like hours and was cracking up at our antics outside, we left eventually and made our way back to the house, by this time I felt the acid getting stronger and stronger, I found myself on a sofa in the house attempting to get a cigarette from my packet, it took goddamn hours and I wondered if I was just stupid, this was the simplest task ever and I found myself to be incapable of performing it! This sent me off on tangents, did I do well at school? Did my mum bring me up well enough? Why cant I do this? Whats wrong with me? Oh shit...reality flashback, I had to tell myself that I felt like this because of the drugs I had ingested, then everything became a hellava lot clearer. 'Hold on, I dont have to worry about this, I can control whats happning, I just have to realise it' this got me thinking about how the drug was working in my brain, 

I closed my eyes and eye could visualise my thought patterns flowing freely from thought to thought, I could see if anything bad happened it would make a blockage in my flow of thought and it would keep building up and building up and cause me to get bogged down on that individual bad thought, I just had to learn to 'let it all go' so to speak. I felt as if I had a major break-through and I was just about to tell everybody about it but had to restrain myself 'what the hell would everyone think if I blurted out all the shit thats been going through my head for the last god-knows-how-long, ill be a goddamn laughing stock, well maybe..eh? Who are these people? I cant remember any of petes flatmates names..' looked over at dave at man, he was having a real bad one, shit, he looked so down I couldn't believe it..hmm he would be the one that I would save, by passing on my new found knowledge of LSD I would turn his bad trip to a good one just like I did, time to talk... 'Err we are going out for a bit, umm come on...jack and d..dd..ave' 
Pete: 'where you going' 
Me: 'uhh to get my bag' (I had left it round jacks house)
Jack: 'why?'
Dave: '....flahgshblah'

When we got out of the house I had no idea where I was in relationship to anything, I knew the road but where the fuck did it lead??!! Which way is north?? Godammit... I went blank and we walked towards jacks house we went in silence before I remembered what the hell I had came out here for, right time to let dave know the truth..
Me: 'right, the thoughts in your head, they build up like stacks and stacks and keep building and they could be bad but let em go'
Dave: 'wot??...
He had a point what the fuck was that? I made no sense and seemed to be confusing myself and dave so much more than we originally were.

I would leave it at that and I would try to explain later when I didn't feel so fried, 'how long does this shit last anyway?'
Jack: 'bout 12 hours'
'How longs it been? 
Jack; 'err 6'
Bloody hell I feel as if I've been tripping for days this stuff is insane, keep going, ride the trip out, remember what you've learned before...let it all go, yeah, thats right.

11.00pm the prospect of being out at this time when the pubs were being turned out was terrifying we couldnt get my bag from jacks house because he wouldn't let us go back for fear of his parents we decided to go back to petes after a very pointless walk,still, the tracers were interesting. It was at this point when dave decided to talk for the first time it was quite relieving to hear his voice cos I was beginning to think he was braindead he said he was having a real bad trip and I told him to remember that it was only down to the drugs why he felt like this I told him to let it all go again (sounding like a damn broken lp) and he simply just looked confused there was no getting through to this boy, although someone on acid trying to explain their thoughts to another person on acid is the most futile thing ever. We ended up at petes house again after walking what felt like miles and miles (actual distance - 1/2 mile)

Back at petes house I was incapable of speech although I crafted a very fine spliff which I was incredibly proud of..then the bombshell hit, I was supposed to see my girlfriend hours ago!! This was bad, shes gonna dump me, im unreliable, im a bad person etc...more acidy thoughts blowing things out of all proportion, calm. Think. Forget thats better.. The rest of my trip was incredibly pleasant after I finally managed to handle myself and things were quite good really.

My ideas of a few things if your gonna trip
1. Location - v.important, find a free house for a couple of days, giving enough time to trip and comedown, parents coming home while tripping is a recipe for disaster
2. Know who you trip with - things can get real sketchy if your not sure about the people you are hanging around with it can turn a normal situation into a real surreal experience
3. For the comedown have lots of pot to smoke or alcohol, sleep is good after an acid trip I hate just sitting around, exhausted after the drug has ebbed away
4. Remember anything that happens is only down to the drug remember that you are in the driving seat, you just have to realise it.
Have fun!!

Me and some friends of mine went to ekoostik Hookah's 10th anniversary concerts, and being hippies, we thought acid would probably be the thing to do. We had all tried it before, but none of us were really experienced. We were camping beforehand, so we'd smoked a lot of marijuana earlier, and a couple some of my friends had drank some beer, but we were all fairly sober by the time we got the concert.

First step, find some acid. No problem! We asked a couple people, and got directed to the right person. He told us 2 hits would have us seeing visuals within an hour. I took 2 hits at $5/hit, as did most of my friends, 2 of them took 1. This was apporximately 9:15 or 9:30, I'm not real sure of the time. A couple minutes later, I heard the guy we bought it from telling someone else about it '2 hits will send you to the cosmos.' Wait a minutes, didn't I just take 2 hits?

About 10 minutes later, I could feel the acid starting to work. I started to feel jittery and anxious and had problems keeping still. Fortunately, the music started not too long thereafter, and I got up to dance. 

I had been daning for about 10 minutes or so, a song or 2 into the first set, when a hippie chick who had put a sticker on my face earlier walked up to me. I spent almost the entire first set making out with her, and didn't find out anything more about her than her name. I must say, that was probably the best way to come on to acid that I could ever imagine. It's difficult to say how much the LSD was really affecting me at this point, as I was rather busy, there was something odd happening. Things were starting to get WIERD.

During the break, I met back up with my friends who had dissappeared. After talking to them, I realized a good portion of the audience was tripping on the same stuff. This is when I realized how hard I was tripping. Talking in coherent sentences was extremely difficult, I could see trails off of almost everything. When I went into a different section of the music hall, the light was a more yellow color, and everything looked dirty all of a sudden, and everyone's eyes were red (probably from pot) and everyone looked sickly. So we got out of there and went upstairs to the back where we could relax.

The setbreak seems to last forever (so did the first set) and it was almost agonizing the way it dragged on. I gave up looking for the chick because I was just tripping too hard. Finally, Hookah came back out. I realized not long thereafter, that one of my friends wasn't having that good a time. He was usually weary of crowds and I think it was just too much for him. Almost everyone else in the group was around dancing and having a good time, but I sat with him through most of it. He was really quiet most of the time, but would occasionally say something about him being dead and asking for answers. He had 5 or 6 sentences he more or less kept repeating. I knew it would be really difficult to get him out of there, so I just kept hoping that the set would last longer. By the time they got to the encore, all I could see of the band members were giant blurs when they played their instruments or otherwise moved. It felt like everything and everyone in the plus was wired in, even the band and the music. 

At about 2:00, 2:30 in the morning the show ended. We managed to get my friend who was having the bad trip outsite, although it took a lot of work. We hung outside the music hall with a big group of hippies until we found my other two friends. One of them had started having a bad trip and they had left before the show ended, but she had been talked down by my other friend. 

At this point, we piled into our cars, we had 2 drivers, both of whom took 1 hit. I don't advocate driving on LSD, it was probably pretty dumb, don't do it, but we had no choice, it was that or hang out by the car and risk getting arrested. The guy who was freaking out went in the other car, while I went with 2 of my other friends. I tried to get up back to the campsite, because I was the only one who knew the area, but I just couldn't find it. So we made it back to my house, I had to wake my dad up unfortunately, but he was so tired, I don't think he noticed. From there we called my friend's at the campsite. The guy who freaked out was coming around, so we hung around for an hour so we could come down a little. At about 5:00 AM we left for the campsite, we arranged a meeting with someone who knew where we were going and he led us back to the site. We stayed up and talked past dawn. The visuals were still with us, but our thought patterns had returned to normal. If I thought about it I could still see some mild trails and other faint visuals until about 7:00 or 8:00 the next day. 

A very interesting time. The most intense trip I could ever imagine having. I had a good time, despite my friend, who returned to reality shortly after returning to the camp, though I don't think he will ever try LSD again. I'm sure I will, but it's gonna be a while, this trip had given me a lot to think about, especially musically and about the connections between band audience, and other things of that nature. It reminded me very much of what I'm imagining the acid tests were like in the '60s. Always check to make sure you know the potency of the acid you're taking, this stuff was amazingly strong, and really did send us to the cosmos. I almost lost control a couple times and my friend did. Never ever ever underestimate acid, that's the only advice I can give to anyone. 

Peace

This is one experience that taught me to take all things in moderation. This was not a bad trip, but had some negative aftereffects that put me in my place as far as drugs go.

It was new years. All of my friends were on Christmas break and had some free time. My friend was living in a house her family owned, and over the two week span that we had off, It had become a fairly well known party house. But on new year's eve, we wanted to have a private party. There had suddenly been a large flow of acid into my small town, and a group of us (6) wanted to get some. We all had two cubes, exept for two people, who had 1 and 1/2 by sharing.

We had all decided to take them at midnight, after going to another actual new years party. This means that none of us had slept in about 13 hours or so when we took them. We had spent a large portion of the day setting up shiny things (glowsticks tied to a rotating fan, shattered glowsticks in the shower stall, etc), and there were 2 or 3 trip sitters there just hanging out. We didn't really do anything at first, just kind of sat around sucking up that 'MAN OH MAN, WOW, THIS IS GONNA BE INTENSE' feeling that vibrates up my spine when I take something like acid. We did stuff in preparation. Eating a bunch of vitamin C pills and buying red bull for when we started to peak, mainly. 

Eventually, it started to kick in. We smoked some pot about then, but we smoked it in the closet, as it seemed like a good idea at the time. The next few hours mainly consisted of the six of us rolling around my friends house, soaking up color and bizarre thought patterns. I remember that we had a bright orange boa, some 'juice' (highlighter and glowstick fluid put into a full water bottle) next to the small blacklight. We also took full advantage of the previously mentioned shower. Now, to a person not fucked up, the shower was still pretty neat: Multicolored glowstick innards sprayed around, giving the impression of a small nebula. However, the 6 of us were not even prepared for the shower when we were on acid. We grabbed all of the neat stuff we had in the living room, and made a druggie caravan into the bathroom. 

We al stood in awe at the little universe in the shower, all huddled together holding a blacklight, a strobelight and each other very close to it. We had experimented with having a person go in the shower, and it was quite an experience. We wer not satisfied yet, though. It was only a brief time before the shower was turned on, and the strobelight hung in 'Ben's' hand, only inches away from the water. Luckily, Craig had a sudden thought, 'shiny + shiny = BAD!', and as messed up as it sounds, it's what saved us from being electrocuted. 

This is where my story turns from an adolescent ranting about how messed up he and his friends were, to a story of the maddening comedown.

There was a lot of neat stuff happening, but then we all realized the sun was coming up. I wasn't sure about everyone else, but I was still tripping hard. I had had enough. I wanted to come back to reality, or as I put it at the time, I wanted 'my lefts, rights, ups and downs back.' Everyone else decided to go for a walk to see the sun rise, but I was not ready to go out in public like I was, so I told them I was going to stay at the house. They weren't thrilled with the though of me being left to my own devices at this stage, but they left anyways. 

I was alone.

All of the trip sitters had long since fallen asleep. For at least an hour, I kept moving. First, I tore down all of the shiny things we had set up, because I didn't ever want to see them again. I turned off the music we had been playing all night, cleaned the shower, and turned all of the lights off. There was a dim natural light throughout the entire house, so turning the lights off made things a lot more serene in the house. 

There was absolute silence.

I kept trying to sleep, and ended up lying on every bed and couch in the entire house. I kept getting lost in thought; a horrible circular logic. I would close my eyes to try and sleep, but my mind was buzzing. There was no more hallucination, only an intense stupification. I felt really dirty. The entire time my friends were on their walk, all I could think was 'I hope they get back soon', over and over. As terrible as this sounds, I'm still glad that I didn't leave the house with them, I couldn't have handled it. 

When they all got back, it was probably about 8:00 am. Throughout the day, some people left, and the rest of us were just trying to deal with what we had all experienced. Strange recollections of gibberish we had spouted earlier haunted us all ('What the hell is a beafterthat?'). 

Through the following week, I felt that I was changed. Different in some inconceivable way; and on some nights of that first week, I would go into the bathroom and cry for no reason. Craig said the same thing, even the crying thing. It was a lifechanging experience. Definitely for the better, but there are negative shadows hanging over me now. Acid was fun, wild and philosophical, but I don't think I could handle taking it more than once every two or three years, if even that.

*By the way, a beafterthat is when you can't get out of a thought. The circular logic thing. This may not make sense to anyone, but it's fun to share   :)

I consider this the first time I REALLY tripped. I had taken LSD three times before: 2 paper hits twice, and one yellow geltab once, but all three of those experiences are blown away in comparison to this one.

Mike, a well-seasoned tripper, got some yellow geltabs from his housemates. They had done it during the day and had basically asserted that they weren't all that potent. The one yellow tab I had done a couple of weeks before had pretty much only given me a slight mindfuck and no visuals, so I wasn't intimidated. So, Mike and I decided to trip that Saturday night.

We each took one tab and left my house at 8:00 pm, in separate cars (big mistake), and went to go rent some good tripping. When we got to the video store, Mike joked 'R u feeling anything?' But the truth was, I was already starting to feel a little funny, and only maybe ten minutes had gone by.

We left the store and headed to Mike's house. I followed him, Crystal Method pounding inside my car. I was a little uncoordinated when it came to getting on the expressway, and I kind of almost got in an accident, but I managed to get on the ramp OK. The ramp lifted me high up, or so it seemed, and I could see the city lights ahead like millions of little stars. There was construction on the expressway, so there were miles of flashing barricades set up. I wasn't having visuals yet, but it seemed like there were a hundred cars behind me, and what with the soundtrack, I felt like I was doing warp speed in a spaceship.

After a slightly panicky ride of twenty minutes or so, we arrived at Mike's deserted house, at which point we took the second hit. I just felt weird for about a half hour or so. I could tell when it kicked in, because I had been dancing with glostix and Mike left the room, and I told him he didn't want to hang with the glostick reject and then I burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter. I can still feel that cold ass tile floor against my back, and there I was, just cracking up. I finally managed to get up and go into the guest bathroom. The counter was moving in all sorts of awesome patterns, and for the longest time I just stared at it in marvel, occasionally laughing nervously. 

When I managed to tear myself away from that scene, Mike and I went into his housemate's room, which had a ton of psychedelic posters and tie-dyed stuff in it. The posters looked incredible and almost three-dimensional. I then got on the bed, which was a waterbed, and lay on my back, staring at the ceiling. Above me, a huge black-and-orange tie-dyed sheet was draped across the ceiling. This was when the tie-dye lines started coming alive, slowly at first, and then they started hauling ass, going crazy. Mike had put some weird trippy electronic music on earlier, and I screamed for him to turn it off. It sounded menacing.

There was an awful point in time where I thought I was going to go crazy. Mike came over to me and asked if I was going to be OK. I remember looking kind of over his shoulder, and through my peripheral vision a second, translucent face came out of his face, so it looked like he had two heads. I shoved my face into a mercifully dark pillow and moaned. I wasn't exactly sure. The only thing that kept me from falling apart was Mike telling me that he'd tripped so hard before, he had to touch the trees to make sure they were real. So if he had survived, then perhaps I would as well.

Mike convinced me to go for a walk in the neighborhood. It was nighttime, but I have never seen so many colors in the dark before. Everything had its own distinct pattern: the sidewalk was done up in wavy stripes, the sky had some other psychedelic 60's looking pattern, etc. Dozens of metallic colors were all over the place. Everything had zillions of trails outlining it; my own body had so many trails dancing around it that I felt like I was wearing a thick astronaut suit. Thus, I was walking with my legs apart and arms out.
The walk consisted of many colors and trails, and me thinking there were people where there weren't, and finally, me totally forgetting where the hell we were. I was happy when we reentered the safety of the house. For a while we lied down in Mike's room and I became engrossed in a lava lamp. I had a strange urge to take a warm bath. Also, it felt like my foot was on the verge of cramping up. It stayed that way for hours.

Moments later, the rest of housemates got home. They were loud and happy, which boosted my experience. I looked thru the patio door to see one of them pulling little sticky seeds from his feet; to me, they looked like millions of little green baby grasshoppers. This wigged me out, so I went back in.

We watched one of those psychedelic videos, and it looked so amazing. The screen showed a kaleidoscope of colors that kept morphing and morphing, and they looked razor sharp with detail. I remember being awed at how the mind could keep up with that speed. We popped in Fear and Loathing and laughed till we couldn't take it anymore. We even rewound some parts. When it was over, we watched it again with similar results. I was starving and was eating anything I could get my hands on. I ate some kind of party mix, and sugar cones, like the kind for ice cream. I found that eating very crunchy things was delightful while tripping.

We finally put in The Matrix, and while it had good visual effects, it wasn't a comedy like the previous movie, and I began to wind down. Outside, I saw the sun was coming up. My eyes ached, like I had been straining them for a long time. About a quarter of the way thru the movie, we decided to go to bed.

In bed, I felt like I had sunk about six inches into the mattress. It felt very soft, and the comforter felt as though I had swaddled myself in clouds. It was eerily quiet, like that static quiet you hear when u finally come out a loud club and you're partially deafened. I can't remember when, but I finally fell into a deep sleep.

If that sounds like a pleasant experience, well, it was. I didn't really mean to ingest that much, and it was pretty freaky at first. I can't stress enough the importance of having a friend with you when you trip, preferably a friend who's done it plenty of times before at much higher doses, so that when u think the world and your mind are going to shatter into a million prismatic pieces, someone's there to convince you otherwise.

PLURR

Last night was new year's eve, and now it is 2001. I had recently purchased two hits of the yellow/orange sun design of paper acid.

The evening commenced at a pool party outside in a heated pool, with a bubble tent thing over it all. About 15 people were there but I was most interested in one. A girl I've known for awhile, but for unclear reasons we never seem to hook up. Anyways, the night was going well, it was already awesome just to be with her, especially on such a night as new year's eve. 

Halfway through this her ex-boyfriend showed up and almost ruined everything. I debated on whether or not to take the acid, but everything turned out awesome. After midnight I went over to another party so that I could ingest the dose in semi-peace, that way she didn't know what I was doing. I dropped it and smoked a joint and a bowl and headed back to her friend's house where she was staying. About 5 people were there, but they were half asleep. 

I started to feel it a little before I went over there. I think they knew what was going on, or at least that I was on something. They probably just thought I was high. Anyways, the gitteryness had already passed at the other person's house...I mean, it was still there but I was into the other things, just feeling enhancment. What we did that night I don't know, but it was like our minds and souls were melded together. Time didn't exist...I kept drifting off into this weird dream world. But at the same time I was still wired and awake with her, cuddling and doing whatnot. We didn't have sex, or any other alternatives to sex, but the whole experience was better than sex can ever be normally. It was heaven...what I felt couldn't be described. This was my first acid trip, it is too hard to explain.

After I left there at 4 am (dropped the acid at 12:30), I was peaking I think. Walls looked like they were just kind of rippling slowly, breathing, doorcracks would breathe. I left and went back to my buddy's house. My other friend had tripped too that night, but I didn't see him. At his house I lit up and saw tracers galore. It was amazing...the whole experience. I didn't get to sleep 'til 8 this morning and that was after I smoked 4 more bowls by myself.

I was 16 at the time of this experience. I had my friend Pete over to my house for a night of tripping on acid. In the morning we picked up 2 microdots, which we were told contained 500ug of LSD. This number didn't mean much to us, and we had had previous experiences with a weaker strength of microdot orally. Tonight, we decided that we would like to heighten the trip by insufflating the microdots.

At 7:00, we each crushed our microdots and got two straws to snort with. We were in my brother's bedroom, both feeling in a positive mood. I went first and snorted my microdot. Instantly, I felt an insane rush of evil come over my body. The taste of the powder was like sucking on a Tylenol and it was dripping down the back of my throat. I suddenly felt like I was going to vomit, so I rushed to the washroom and hovered over the toilet for 5 minutes.

When I returned to the room, Pete had snorted his and was sitting in the corner grinning mischievously. I laid down on the couch and tried to calm myself. All of a sudden, objects in the room started shifting and walls started breathing. I looked over at a painting on the wall and a light mist in the shape of a person began to shift off the wall.

At 30 minutes after insufflation, I was getting mad visuals. Textures were infinitely complex and beautiful. The early nausea had faded away, perhaps because I was involved in what was happening around me. I looked over at Pete and he continued to smile and stare at everything he could, trying to absorb all there was around us.

We never moved from our positions for 4 hours, because the happenings around us were sufficient to more than amuse us for that time. At about 5 hours after ingestion, the visuals began to weaken but were still very nice and slow. At this time, we ventured out of the room we were in and watched the Pantera home video, also snacking on chips and pop, which felt amazing gracing my stomach. By 6 hours after ingestion,
we were down completely. A beautiful experience except for the first 10 minutes of coming up, which were physically burdening.

It was the New Year's celebration of 1995, and I found myself at my first rave, with my first hit of acid in my hand.  It was an experience that was long overdue, and one which I highly looked forward to.  I consulted just about every friend I knew who tried that wonderful drug which I was holding onto with immense anticipation.  I knew all about the LSD experience, for preparation was my safety harness against bad trips.  Finally, as I put the tiny white paper in my mouth, my stomach quenched with nervousness and fear.

'Was I really prepared to experience this?' I thought.  But as the wonderful sounds of Trance filled my ears with bliss, the fear quickly diminished.

After about 45 minutes I was thinking to myself, either one of my best friends ripped me off, or I must be immune to this compound.  Then, in that very second, fantasy merged with reality, as a cartoon train literally came out of one of the television sets which I was viewing.  It circled the room and returned back to the world it came from.  From that moment, everything around me was surreal.  Colors were so intense that I was in awe of how limiting visual perception is in our everyday lives.  Music acquired a life of its own, and it was a part of me.  People around me became fellow explorers in a quest to reach ultimate bliss and fulfillment.  Life was so full and wonderful at that moment, that my only wish was immortality in this beautiful state.

The trip was a wonderful journey, one which had an immense impact on my life.  Since being introduced to this divine world, my outlook on life changed.  Beauty of everyday life made its presence know to me long after the trip was over.  I learned to see the extraordinary in the ordinary.  In other words, LSD was my window to a heavenly bliss, which in many forms persisted and embodied itself in life as I know it.

I have not had a lot of experience with hallucinogens; the number of times I've tripped can be counted on one hand.  In an effort to keep from scaring myself, I've tried to keep my doses relatively low--but I've found myself to be somewhat hardheaded when it comes to the effectiveness of drugs in general, so for this experience, I decided to up my dose a bit.

At an outdoor party I went to in August, I bought myself three hits of acid for $12 and dropped at exactly 2:03 AM.  Within an hour, I felt the now-familiar acid stomach, and had to sit down for a while.

After the queasiness wore off, I went back to the dance floor and bounced around for a while.  Before too long, I needed to pee, and knowing how unfun peeing can be in the dark woods, even when sober, I decided to take off before the acid really kicked in.

I found myself a nice little tree and began happily relieving myself.  Halfway through, though, the 'cid hit me like a brick wall--all of a sudden, my vision exploded with small, repeated, swirling patterns, and from the corner of my eye, my shadow looked like it was trying to attack me.  I got all paranoid and felt like there were people sneaking up on me, so I finished my business as quickly as possible and returned to the party.

In the light, the visuals had faded, and all I felt was somewhat energetic and euphoric.  I danced for a while longer, and then looked up again around 4 AM, and the people outside of the dance area looked very blurred--somewhat similar to the appearance the world takes on under the effects of nitrous oxide.  Sometimes, when people moved, they appeared to be leaving trails, but this was only the case when they were farther off, not right in front of me.

I was tired of dancing, so I went and sat down.  I hadn't sat long when, despite my earlier bladder-purging efforts, the cold mountain air made it necessary for me to head back out into the dark, scary woods--this time, the acid in full effect.

I returned to the tree of before, only to find that there were people sitting around it, talking.  I wondered what thsee folks were doing sitting by a tree in the dark, but I didn't question it; I just moved on.  The next tree I stopped at, there were people sitting around, too.  Gave up on that one.  Finally, I found an unpopulated tree, and prepared myself for action--only then did I spot the sitters under it.

By this point I was pretty freaked out.  What the heck were all these people doing here?  It was obviously a bad idea for me to go off by myself.  Fortunately, I had the presence of mind to pull out the flashlight in my pocket, and upon turning it on, all the tree-squatters disappeared and I could carry about my business in solitude.

The party continued for several more hours, and I sort of forgot about the fact that I'd taken any acid.  When I wasn't really paying attention to it, the effects didn't manifest--I had to actually actively try to make hallucinations show up.  I wasn't mentally impaired to a great degree, but I was rather spacey--I was prone to staring off in one direction for a long time without blinking.  (At one point, I was asked, 'What are you on?  We can't figure it out,' so I suppose I was obviously intoxicated, even though I didn't think I looked that way.)

The party was broken up by the cops around 5, and the hour-long drive home was one of the shortest-seeming and most enjoyable car rides I've ever had.

When I got back to my house, I went to my backyard clubhouse with my friends and smoked a bowl.  Marijuana obviously potentiates the hallucinogenic effects of LSD, because before I smoked, I really didn't see anything...but afterwards, the wood-paneled walls were swirling like plasma, with little spots of lights on them in rapidly changing colors.

That was about it.  This effect lasted until about T +8:00, at which point I basically lost my ability to function, but could not sleep at all.  I didn't move much for the next two hours, by which point the effects had completely worn off.

What I have learned:

--Pot does good things to me when tripping.
--Never to pee alone in the dark.

[Erowid Note: According to an article in the Feb 18, 2008 Army Times, the U.S. has stopped LSD testing military wide due to the low number of positive results detected in the past three years.] 

I was reading on your site that you did not know if LSD was tested for in the military.

The U. S. Air Force definitely tests for LSD.  I know this because I was kicked out on a dirty test.  They use the GC/MS test and their cut off level is 200pg/ml. The Air Force can and will court-martial an airmen for just coming up positive, they feel the test is all the evidence they need.

I do know the Army and Navy use the same test as the Air force and all three use Brooks Lab. When any test regardless of the drug comes up positive the lab re-runs the test if the test comes under fire by the soldier the lab will run the test again at the same lab instead of another lab. (Jacked up I think) Wrongful use of LSD in the military can get you 5yr's in jail. The thing to remember is LSD has four components, You have ISO LSD and LSD which breakdown into four parts or isomers, and L and D on each. We know that the only active component of LSD under which it is reasonably likely that a person would feel the effects is the D isomer of the LSD so we would ignore the L isomer of LSD, the D isomer of ISO LSD and the L isomer of ISO LSD. So it is possible to come in contact with LSD and feel NO effect. I hope this will help someone.

Esto sucedió hace varios años, pero aún recuerdo todo con fascinación.
Por esa época me encontraba tomando bastante LSD, siguiendo algo que no sabía bien que era, pero que de alguna forma estaba relacionado con mi espíritu.Guiaba mis viajes con el Libro Tibetano de los Muertos (Bardo Thödol)y procuraba elegir lugares solitarios y momentos especialmente propicios. Durante un mes tomé cinco dosis de lsd, 'Panoramix 200' y creo que esto determinó la última experiencia.Con una amiga fuimos al Cajón del Maipo,(un lugar cordillerano en la región metropolitana de Chile.)

 Tomamos nuestras dosis en un túnel de tren abandonado, a las 11 am. Como de costumbre, no probé bocado alguno 24 horas antes y nos alimentamos sólo de jugo de naranjas.  

Los efectos no tardaron en aparecer (10 min!!!), séntí que 'algo' me llamaba dentro del túnel, así que me devolví, dejando a mi amiga que comenzaba a reir y a dar vueltas sobre sí.A diferencia de otras veces, el ácido me golpeó físicamente con convulsiones y sensaciones de 'náuseas purpuras', estaba muy irritable y sofocado.Estaba débil y agotado. Necesitaba imperiosamente estar SOLO.

A medida que entraba al túnel sentía que el suelo tenía una pendiente y las murallas se hacían mas estrechas. Sentí real miedo, ya que sabía muy bien que el lugar NO ERA ASÍ CUANDO ENTRAMOS!!

Era como un 'daescensum ab infernos'. Veía gusanos cuadriculados de colores rojo y verde luminosos que pasaban zumbando a mi lado y el suelo seguía conduciéndome hacia abajo. En un momento me detuve y me devolví. Entonces ví algo increíble: ME VI A MI MISMO EN VARIAS POSICIONES, CONGELADO,EN ACTITUD DE CAMINAR. Un efecto óptico que nadie podría explicarme. Me detuve nuevamente y decidí continuar, a esa altura ya no sentía miedo ni fascinación, sinó un profundo recogimiento.Ya no estaba dentro de un túnel, ya no era yo, o estaba disgregado, ya no estaba mi amiga ni nada en mi mente, no tenía absolutamente NADA.En ese momento tuve la visión más fabulosa de mi vida(en vigila)...me encontraba en el borde de un lago enorme, de color verde fosforescente, detrás de mucha gente. Veía sus siluetas inmóviles y escuchaba un zumbido similar al 'OM' pero sin vocales ni inflexiones 'humanas'. 

Al medio del lago se construía a si mismo una especie de edificio surrelista, como los que pintaba el Bosco.Sus 'ladrillos' eran similares a las celdas de la naranja o el limón. No recuerdo cuánto tiempo estuve allí ni que hice, la escena no parecía destinada a terminar y, de hecho, cada vez que la recuerdo viene a mí la imágen nítida del castillo en el lago. Cuando salí me encontré con mi amiga y le invité a entrar, pero ya no había nada. Después nos dedicamos a hacer las usuales locuras del ácido; a sacar maravillosas conclusiones, a revolcarnos en el césped inventando idiomas, a reírnos de nuestros rostros, caminar, caminar, caminar y caminar...hasta que todo a nustro alrededor se despidió del sol con una indescriptible degradación cromatico-sonora y la noche nos trajo alguna que otra figurilla de colores locos.Sacando cuentas, el efecto cúlmine duró 6 horas...

What have we ever truly expected in the few moments before ingesting LSD??  We might prepare physical settings that surround us with colorful posters, a scenic journey through forestland, or mellow tunes & rhythm.  My experience began with no mental or physical preparation whatsoever.

Towards the end of my junior year in high school the weather started to ease from winters embrace.  Snow melted everywhere and an unusually humid breeze whistled through tall pines.  Life slowly began to breathe and flow in my small mountain town once again.  This beautiful day gave my friend and I the itch to go hiking up in the hills.  We stopped at a friend's house along the way to see if they wanted to come.  The three of them agreed and we all decided to go to an abandoned mine and explore.  One of them offered my friend and I some acid.  I had not expected to trip that day but I was handed two hits of white blotter.  I had tripped many times previously so I threw the paper into my mouth.  I thought with only two hits I would know what to expect. I was eager to go hiking.

It took us only 20 minutes to reach the mine by an uphill trail. White mica laden quartz rocks lay everywhere, reflecting sunlight in every direction around us.  An entrance located near the peak of the mountain seemed just what we had hoped for.  The mineshaft stood nearly 20 feet high and went about 120 feet into the mountain.

30 minutes went by and I felt nothing yet.  Our party ventured inside and the cool air revived our bodies.  We walked all the way to the end of the tunnel.  Water dripped everywhere, bouncing off rocks above and splattering our faces.  I looked at my watch and it had been 45 minutes.  I remembered again taking acid and a strange feeling overcame me.  'How could I forget about eating acid?' I thought to myself.  I urged my friend to follow me back outside because the trip began to rise.  I reached the mouth of the tunnel and I was astonished at what I felt and saw at that moment. 

I realized that in less than in one hour after ingestion I was seeing more visuals and movement than in peaks of past trips.  I could see for miles across the tops of other hills.  The pine trees liquefied on the distant hills.  The scheme swirled and bounced into a massive blanket of green.  Clouds peeled and bounced to the same rhythm as the flow of green before me.  The air thickened into an almost gel-like substance.  It felt hard to breathe and walk through the thickness.  My skin was wet and sticky.  I reached down to pick up a piece of quartz rock. I realized my robotic movements and how simplified my thought process had become.  I stood up and saw everything was moving in one rhythm trapped inside congruent fractal geometric patterns.  I threw the rock and its white tracer lingered long after the rock had landed.  My friends and I decided to throw some rocks off the cliff ledge for a while.  The tracers were splendid in length and brightness.  Once again I looked at my watch and decided that I was tripping my hardest ever, only minutes after the first hour.  I then became frightened and began to ponder, 'how long and intense is my trip going to be?'

We collected and ventured into the main processing building for rocks and stone.  As a massive building it stood 6 stories high with a solid wooden frame structure.  Walking inside I noticed dust and rocks swirling into the same fractal geometrics as the trees.  The grains on the lumber flowed like wet paint applied by an invisible brush or roller.  The lines inside of the wood shone in a brilliant iridescent green and blue.  I was continuing to get surges of psychedelic energy that told me I was still on the rise of my trip.  After walking around some more we went back to the vehicles.  My trip had only started and I knew that it was going to be a very long night.

The ride back to my friends house only took 10 minutes and it was almost erotic.  The vehicle floated around every corner and the blackness of the asphalt never stopped expanding.  Anxiety from this set in to me and it infested my tonal as I became a lost cause.  There was no turning back now.  I began to forget what it was like to be normal.  I felt like I had been tripping my entire life and I knew no different.  I knew that I must have been climaxing at that point.  I had no grounds on what to compare my state to, reality seemed a dream I wanted to return to.  

My friend, (who was on the same dosage, but not tripping as hard as me), took me to a hill with a rocky outlook.  From that vantage point I saw mist and low clouds begin to sweep across the tree tops.  It looked like rain was to come.  We sat and I told my friend that the trip was too intense and I wanted to live no longer.  I looked up and saw unusually low fog blowing from left to right across the tree line.  The fog took the tops of trees right off and scattered them in the air I imagined it looked like a dandy lion would when blown upon, sending airborne chutes aloft.

My tonal weakened and I walked back down to the house, grabbed a guitar and plucked my death song.  A patch in the grass looked comfortable to die in.  I played the slow three note song like it was my own funeral.  Another good friend of mine showed up and I embraced him with a hug.  He was shocked at such a move until he saw my eyes and facial expression.  I was mournful for myself.  I thought it would be the last time we would ever meet.

My grass patch called me.  I wanted to lay down and end it all.  I could not talk any more and I was expressing sadness, anxiety, fear and dumbfoundedness all at once.  Several hours of this plateau and it diminished into a state of drunkenness from keg beer.  I found myself again surrounded by friends, a beer in my hand and walking about some sort of party.  It amazed me how I eased back into reality when I thought it just a dream to only be visited.  These feelings stayed inside of me for many months afterwards.  I was certain that I had died.  

Timothy Leary once wrote that a trip is a dying experience of certain things such as emotion, or a persons ego.  For me it was my life.  I have never stopped using acid for it can be a learning experience, bad or good.  

I seethe upon peeling clouds, bouncing trees and lines of saturation.  I am crispened into intricate frames of fractal geometric patterns.

 One hell of a first experience 

I'm not sure how sensitive I am to LSD-25, but I must say that this is the most potent experience I've ever had in my life.  On New Year's Eve of 1999, some friends suggested we all go camping and drop.

I'll cut to the chase.  My perceptual processes were simply not ready for the rush of everything that happened, and I spent a long period of time adjusting to it all.  Part of it was the acid.  Another major part of it was being out in unfamiliar territory and not feeling so sure of myself to begin with.  Then, there were all the people yelling, the rangers, and the fireworks.  I'm talking massive overload here.  My mind's reaction was to shut down some of the sensory input by turning off different senses.  I spent a brief period of time being blind and another one being deaf.  These both shortly came back to me, however, once I was in a lower-stimulation environment.

That's when the really bizarre thing happened.  My mind was having a hard time serializing everything into one constant flow.  Effects were sometimes happening before causes.  I soon found myself pretty much trapped in my own mind, and found that my analytical thoughts were being used to process the high levels of sensory input.  My body was running on a sort of natural autopilot (I later found out that nobody thought anything was wrong with me), but I was well lost in my own head, having conversations with archetypes of my friends and watching possible futures unfold before me...different thought patterns would naturally fizzle out and such...eventually, I'd have a window where I could act again.

The process of action was very difficult for me.  If I wanted to go sit out by the fire, I had to emote it...I had to allow my 'me-ness' to drift toward the 'fire-ness.'  Reality seemed to exist in a state of freeze-frame, too, unless I kept my body moving.  Thus, in order to stay cognizant of things around me, I was constantly tapping my fingers against a surface to keep my mind in motion.

Eventually, this settled down.  My senses of taste and touch became exceedingly dull, and were for some reason instead rerouted into the tapping of my fingers against a surface.  When given an extremely sour candy that left others writing on the ground in pain, I sucked on it, noticed no flavor, and then found my right hand drumming erratically at the table for minutes later.

Sunrise came, and it was an incredible experience.  I put on one of my more serene CDs (This Mortal Coil's album titled 'Blood.'  I recommend it.) and stretched out to watch the forest dance lightly to the music and the sunrise.  I then went down by the river's edge and sculpted it in my mind.  I have never in my life seen such incredible beauty.  Sadly, since my emotions had been tied up elsewhere in my mind, and so I found myself indifferent to it.  Never before have I experienced such beauty, and been so unmoved by it.

My body held onto the LSD pretty tightly, and so I was still feeling the effects hours after everyone else had gone to bed.  Sitting there, alone, in a dark apartment, with nobody to talk to, and hearing the neighbors argue, seemed to dredge up some old childhood fears.  I curled up in a chair, squeezed my old lovvee closely, and wept for a while.  It was hours before someone got up, but when they did, it was nice to have interaction again.

Finally, it had been about 22 hours since I dosed, and I still hadn't come down.  I was developing a headache, and was getting tired of having no sense of taste or a hand compulsively interpreting different sensations.  One of my friends made a run to the store, and I had her bring me back some Dramamine.  I've used a prescription version of it (though they're pretty much identical) to treat sleep terrors in myself in the past, and have also used it to help a lover fall asleep when she had a severe migraine.  One Dramamine tablet, and fell asleep a half hour later, and never slept better.

In all, I couldn't sum the experience up as positive or negative.  It was interesting, and I'll definitely be trying it again, although it might be a long time.

I decided to go to a rave this last weekend in New Haven, CT, in probably the largest venue I had seen a techno party anywhere, at the New Haven Colliseum.  I had been in the techno scene a few years back but kinda got jaded from the commercialism and the lack of PLUR and bad vibes that had begun to develop in the US techno scene these last few years.  however, I had never done acid at a techno party and had decided that I would give it a try, as I had grown into different interest, particularly tribal and goa trance.  

So I went to the rave rather late and dropped 4 hits of very clean acid, found a good spot on the huge dance floor, and began dancing along to the various trances and breakbeats.  

I started seeing the typical illumination effects on clarity that I had long been accustomed to, as the colors became clearer and the sounds played with my aural senses, tickling them in delightful but familiar ways.  In many ways, it felt like rolling on ecstasy, with the heightened awareness and the beauty of the scene.

but, about an ahour and a half into the event, I noticed a very harsh, very beautiful change in gears.  In many ways, it was overwhelming, and at times, quite frightful, particularly during the darker trance tunes.  I was intoxicated by the beauty of the acid moment, without the sugar-coated overtones of ecstasy's more appealing but less powerful vibe.  At times, the room became a huge serpent, with tribal dancers riding this huge snake in cathartic rhythms of primal angst and beauty; at other times, the room soared to heights of beauty that I cannot begin to describe, reaching spiritual if not religious heights of ecstasy and harmony, as dancers probed their deepest machinery to forge a cacophony of symbiotic magic, each feeding off each other's pure energy and giving of themselves to this higher consciousness that the whole room had achieved.  

I cannot begin to describe the overshelming nature of the rhythms on my sense of perception and self, as I had become but a small part of a larger organism, locking into the various waves of harmonic existence with the various other dancers who drew higher strength from a communal language.  I am reminded of Jung's descriptions of archetypal communion inherent in every human's collective unconscious, as shapes and forms shifted from goblins to angels to the epitome of devils themselves....and yet, throughout this planescape of imagery and feelings, there was always the inherent feeling that it was all a great and beautiful part of the whole, and within this, all I can say was that it was a strange and beautiful trip, something I would love to do again, and yet, only because it reveals the beauty and horrors of this primal nature, of unimaginable strength and candor, without the candy-coating that other ravers may seek.

My friend and I consider ourselves experienced trippers to some degree or another, even spiritual if you will. We often would sit in my well designed basement bedroom, 'the acid room,' and trip for hours on end listening to goa. This is a most stimulating experience in itself, to listen to one of the most auditorily challenging music styles on the planet. This isn't any kind of techno, however; it is a very spiritual and influencing sound. 

One day I decided to indulge on my own, which I really do enjoy at times. I took 2 blotters, which I secured from a rave a few day earlier. The acid began to take effect and let down its unrelenting power upon my willful mind. General color pattern changes and breathing and molding occured. I sat and watched a candle move around for quite a while.

I proceeded then in my peak to smoke a bowl or two of some good commercial and increase the auditory stimulation and reception of my mind. So there I lay on my couch between 4 three-foot three-way speakers and two tweeters, which created an enviroment with awesome surround sound. All was normal until the weed kicked in. Directly across from me there was a black light illuminating the room and lighting a Hebrew eye chart across from me and a few irridescent things in that area of the room. To give a short idea of what this room looks like, imagine half of a normal sized basement, a speaker in every corner, and on both concrete walls there were complete black light hand paintings I did that have UNINTENTIONAL 'hidden pictures' in them, which my friend pointed out for me.  One is quite impressive, it's a lake reflecting green hills and a mountain of volcanoes and it looks real only under the black light (painted in white light, mind you).

So here I was in the center of this room staring at the wall with my favorite techno dj tape on (dan efex:protocols) and the moment it started I felt as though I was being pulled further and further away. When I finally looked at what I was seeing, I realized I was looking out of my face as if I was seeing through the holes of my eyes, nose and mouth. Eventually I was no longer there at all. The experience itself remains somewhat of a mystery, but  I do know that I attained knowledge, memories and life experiences of someone else which I knew of when it happened but the setting of this out of body experience was completely foreign to me, out of this world. I highly recommend to all those people out there who are into experience, find Hallucinogen:the lone deranger, or something known as GOA trance, and take a listen while in a good LSD/marijuana state and you will understand what I mean. Salvia is next on my list so expect to hear from me again.

We entered the park at about 11am, and, against our better judgement, we decided to drop the acid before we had found a suitable place to settle down. On our expedition to find a place to settle, we foolishly located a serene spot in a field of cows. I noticed the cows started to approach us, so we quickly made our departure into the next field. In this adjacent field, we set up the groundsheet and blanket that was going to be our home for the next 5-6 hours. This seemed like it was the perfect spot to be as we approached the event which would confirm the potency of the acid for sure - those first distortions in our vision.

The next half an hour or so seemed to go quite slowly. We talked to each other as we felt the acid coming on. It was a beautiful summer day, and we chose to lie on our backs and stare at the sky. As we stared, we talked some more. I watched the clouds move across the sky, the patterns they made reminded me of steam rising into your face as you look down into a boiling kettle from a height. This, it suddenly occurred to me, was not actually happening! Clouds, in my experience, could never move with such ferocity and volatility - there was another force at work here, the acid. 'Shit, look at the clouds!' I said to my friends, as the 3 of us stared. I decided that now would be a good time to close my eyes, and observe the patterns on the inside of my eyelids. I noticed a kind of binding pattern to the vision; concentric hexagonal ripples, emanating from the focus of my vision, flowing, distorting everything I saw. I opened my eyes again, and noticed that the pattern remained there, superimposed onto everything I looked at.

At once, it began to rain. Just a slight shower, but what an incredible experience! I was on my back, staring straight up into the sky, with the rain falling around me! I saw tracers on each raindrop, creating a kind of random 'tunnel' around me, stretching off into the clouds. I opened my mouth to taste the rain. It jostled and sparked in my mouth, all at once sweet, salty, bitter and sour. I was overcome by the sensory information being transmitted to my brain by my tastebuds. The rain stopped as quickly as it had begun, and we all decided to roll over and look at the world.

I stared at the blanket. Those checks on it, squares of cream separated by strands of dark red and brown, seemed to somehow become free of their surrounding squares and not be part of the blanket as a whole, but separate entities in their own right. They distorted somewhat, and the blanket, when I looked at it as a whole, waved up and down at me, seemingly about to take off from the ground.

The hairs on the backs of my arms suddenly leapt into life, thrusting themselves upon my consciousness, growing, changing.... I felt strange as a result of this, because it was me that was changing also, not just the surroundings. I decided not to look at my arm anymore, and made a decision to save the spiritual experience until later on in the trip.

Suddenly, my friend said, 'Look at this!!' - he had found a tiny, green insect making its way across his arm! It wasnt making much headway, the hairs seemed too much of an obstacle for it. We collectively realised that we had experienced a unique insight into the world of that insect...its struggles seemed as insignificant to us as our own struggles throughout our own lives! I became aware that I was being shown something, something new, a new truth was making itself gently known to me.

I looked around me, at the field. The panorama of looking at the grass from a low angle was breathtaking. It was as though things close up were moving very slightly, not much at all, things in the middle-distance were moving on a kind of light, waving level, and the trees in the far distance were contorting out of all proportion, almost unrecognisable in their waving, flowing appearance. They looked alive to me, not as 'trees' but as actual beings, full of life. I said to my friends: 'Id love to be a tree - pure being, no attachments, no complications.' I still mean this now. I looked at the bushes. They were glowing with life, and colour. I went 'into' the bushes, and came out again.

One of my friends decided to stand up, to see what it was like. I joined him in this venture, and we were blown away by the experience of walking around in this state, like it was a totally novel act! We strayed from our blanket acid-home, but were drawn back towards it by some mysterious force: a binding visual field surrounding that place, I wasnt sure what it was. The more I strayed, the weaker it got, and the nearer I got to that place, the stronger it got, like a mist in the air of pure colour and life. I decided to try to pin-point the source of it. I walked around, and homed in on an object...what was this? It was seemingly the source of the visions. I laughed in pure elation when I realised what it was: a small black tape recorder! It wasnt a visual field after all! It was a sound field, of simple oriental music, transfiguring my world.

I wondered what it would be like if I stopped the tape. But when I did, I felt cold, like something was missing, and one of my companions said, 'Hey, I was enjoying that!' so I resumed the tape. We stood there, slowly walking around in this new world. One of my companions asked me a question: 'Are you there?' It was as simple as that. Was I there? 'Yes,' I replied. We were all in that other place, a new realm of experience. Shit, yes, I was there!

One of my companions remarked, 'I feel like dancing!' He danced around a bit, and actually removed his t-shirt and began to wave it around. I began to feel restless. I kicked off my shoes, in an attempt to make myself feel more comfortable. I felt like I should do something, like this was too precious an experience to waste. I made continual suggestions to my friends as to what we should do: 'Lets go and look at the cows' or 'Lets jump up and down.' I think this was an attempt to make the experience more memorable - because I would have memories of actually doing things on acid, as opposed to just recollections of feelings. It made sense to me at the time...until a friend said to me, 'You say 'lets do things,' but you are already doing it!' 'Yes!!' came my response. I was already doing it! Nonetheless, I picked up the orange which my friend had brought with him. I began to peel it, and the smell was incredible. I ate some of it, but it didnt seem right that I should be hiding this from my eyes by swallowing it, so I held it for a short time. Then I decided to throw the orange. It glided through the air - leaving a sparkling train behind it, like a rainbow.

By this time, the hallucinations were becoming more and more intense. The 'pattern' was everywhere I looked, overtaking my normal vision, distorting everything beyond recognition. I fell into a deep state of understanding, like I now knew what the psychedelic experience was about, and that I would be changed by it forever. I had abandoned any sense of verbal concept - my wish to conceptualise/verbalise had disappeared earlier on in the trip, following the suggestion of a friend that there should be no talking for a period in the trip. I felt like I understood some Ultimate Truth, the truth at the head of all other truths, from which everything else is stemmed. My thoughts at the time were, 'This must be God, in the form of the Holy Spirit, what else could it be?' And this, I think, was the crucial point in the trip: the realisation that if 'God' could be bought in the form of a drug, how could 'God' exist in any external form? My belief in God was shattered! I didnt feel bad about it, I felt like I truly understood the foundations of theology and religion. I had experienced what Saint John had experienced in the Book of Revelation, but he had been unable to interpret it correctly...an experience which was completely mind-blowing.

My visions had a central focus, which seemed to take on the appearance of anything which I thought about at the time. I could see my thoughts - they were taking a visual form in front of my eyes. I dont know whether my eyes were open or closed at that time, but I dont believe it would have mattered that much anyway. Now the only sense I had was a sense of my own thoughts. Cogito ergo sum - I think, therefore I am. Suddenly, I got a glimpse of something which shocked me to the point of not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Whilst Cartesian reasoning led me to think about myself, suddenly I felt all images of 'self' or 'ego' beginning to seem like they were no more real than the concepts of 'God' or 'Time.' I had no sense of individuality. I am unable to describe this state any more than this, but I can refer to the Tibetan Book of the Dead and use Buddhist terms to describe my experience: an ego-loss state, a state of non-game ecstasy, the Clear Light.

No sooner had it appeared than it disappeared. I felt a bit shaken by what I had experienced. Suddenly, the 'game reality' came flooding back, and I realised that my surroundings had changed profoundly since the start of the trip. It was now pouring rain, and all my stuff had got pretty wet. I had lost my glasses; my shoes, when located were full of rain-water. I realised that I had been walking around in circles, confused. I had no sense of time, and I felt like something was wrong. I could no longer recall the experiences which I had just been blessed with. I felt like we should go somewhere, but this time to get out of the field - what I imagined to be the source of the 'badness.' My friends were sitting under the groundsheet, sheltered from the rain. I looked at them, and realised that I had been completely into another world! I just thought 'fuck it, no point fighting it,' and through mental exhaustion, I fell to the ground, face first, into the mud. Actually, it wasnt as bad as all that. When I decided that it should be OK to look now, I propped up my head with my hands.

The rain had stopped, and the sun was brilliant in the sky. My friend was reading from the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and he kept saying how it made perfect sense to him, but I felt uninterested. I couldnt remember the experience. My friends said, 'Before you couldnt say enough about the experience, and now you wont say anything!' I told them that I couldnt remember the trip.

Actually, I could remember the events that took place, but many months later I did acid again and I was reminded of the experience again! The sight of the pattern suddenly brought back much of the trip, and this is how I am able to relate this experience with you.

I hope you found this interesting....

bold and sassy, this drug tap danced on my brain.

last year at this time, my friends and i decided to take 'the plunge' with acid. i had smoked a considerable amount of weed by this time, and was very familiar with the effects of a 'high,' but many people glamorized this 'tripping' thing.

i had a few offers to try it earlier, but in fear of losing my mind, i declined each time. also, i thought LSD was something similar to heroin, or coke or something, and all throughout elementary school and junior high i was told of the horrors of LSD and how it 'fries' your brain.

eventually, i'd grown up and formed my own views, after indulging in several episodes of weed smoking. i got to college, and one lazy, boring, pot smoking night, a little spanish girl named natalie came to my dorm to ask my roommate if he wanted to buy acid. well, as it was, i had just gotten a considerable amount of money, and was keen to try something new and exciting.

about 4 friends and i decided that we would all trip together, and go to a local 'hoppin' party. sounded good.

so, natalie takes a pair of tweezers, and singles out two tiny yellow things from a pencil case, and places them in the palm of my hand. 'what the hell is this?' i asked. 'that's the acid, now where's my fourteen bucks?' i was very surprised at how small the hits were, but i'd never seen acid before, and had nothing to compare it to. 

my friends and i dropped the acid, then rushed to the store for orange juice, which makes you trip harder, or so they say.

about 15 minutes later, after asking about a million times 'when will this kick in?', i had intense chills, very tickly, followed by intense episodes of laughter, which my friends got annoyed with, and tried putting their hands over my mouth saying, 'c'mon, keep your composure, what's the matter with you?!' 

i'd say that was the funnest part of the trip.

then everything got really bright, and visually pulsating. out of nowhere, there were all of these visuals. i guess i noticed when i tried to focus on something, and saw how lucidly clear, yet backwards it was. when i would put my hand on something, it felt like it was moving. and everything just seemed very wavy. the mindset that went with it was very silly, like being 5 years old in a candy store, a tim burton-esque candy store.

when i got back to the dorms, i found that my room looked like a disaster area. everything seemed so scattered, so i did the first thing i could think of...eat gummy bears. the gummy bears seemed all weird too, and i imagined that they were pissed at me for eating them, so i stopped.

my friend kirk, who was very silly at this point, had caught himself up in the blinds on the window, and swore he was being attacked by an octopus. i vigorously tried to save him with an umbrella, and we pretended to be on a hollywood high-seas adventure, playing around like a bunch of children. it was lots of fun.

after the peak, we decided to sit and play playstation in the dark. the characters in tekken seemed to speak in tongues, translated to:  satan is going to come over with girl scout cookies, and pulverized us with one punch.

we laughed and laughed for hours, as we tried to decipher the spanish channel. the sounds of foreign languages sounded hilarious! but then again, so did everything.

as we came further down, we were very chill and complacent with everything around us, still thinking silly stuff, and still having visual distortions.

sleep was not even a remote possibility. it seemed like bugs were crawling all over me when i tried to lie still under the blankets.

my friends claimed to have been still getting visuals when they went to sleep, and they had no problems actually falling asleep. but i was antsy as hell for about 6 more hours.

all in all, LSD was very fun, and something i would do again. it seems as though it discombobulates your mind, and puts it together at random throughout a trip, and if you have a fucked up mind, this may not be for you!!

i've also heard that for some people DXM is stronger or equal to LSD. it's not as strong, or as visually interesting and spacy as LSD, at least not in my opinion.

LSD was also my gateway drug to MDMA and mescaline, which led to some difficulty, so just be careful, okay, don't get wrapped up in tripping, it can be very costly.

to begin, i am a very experienced user of acid. i recreationally use lsd to explore other dimensions and secluded mindsets which i believe the brain hides because mankind isn't civilized enough to comprehend these thoughts and feelings.  i dosed at approximately 11 am. at approximately 11:45 i began to feel the rising effects, slight disembodiment, confusion, trails, bright colors, etc.  i had a sitter, also a very experienced tripper, and he was only baked.  to make a very long and sensual trip into a beautiful universe short, the most vivid memory of the trip was the first valley after a frenzy.  i looked at my hand because i was instructed to do so by a very bright, ambient color changing figure i later found to be my lava lamp, but as i opened my hand i felt a rush of perfection and i still to this day believe that what i felt and saw in my hand, was the entire universe expanding and showing me its secrets.  each time i try to describe what i felt at that moment i almost cry.  it is to this day the most beautiful thing i have ever felt.

please know yourself enough to handle the drugs you choose.

thanks for listening.

Having LSD available to me for the first time, I immediately took four drops of the mint flavored liquid.  I had tried a low dose of AMT before and about four days previously a dose (~45mg) of 2C-T-7, but was unable to break into the psychedelic region with either.

My inhibitions rapidly dropped away, but I remained in complete control of myself mentally and physically (maybe it was weak acid or I was still somewhat tolerant from the 2C-T-7).  Before long I found myself hitting (well, more accurately, politely asking for sexual favors) on a sober friend of mine (but not before calling my gf and asking if it was okay).  Luckily, my friend is cool with that stuff and didn't read anything more into it than a compliment on attractiveness.

Not too much later, someone brought out the nitrous.  I took a ballon and entered the nitrous world, but with far more euphoria than I had ever experienced before.  After a ballon, I would experience five minutes of bliss listening to music so distorted by my mind that it was really something else entirely (I refer to it as the nitrous song because every time, no matter what I listen to, it turns into the same thing).  I started going through ballons like mad and ended up 'wasting' a great deal of my trip trying to work the stuck cracker.

It was only later coming down that things got really interesting.  Mostly down, I went to wander around outside in the dim predawn light.  I ended up lying down next to a fountain and telling myself that, like the Buddha, I would not move until I experienced a revelation (I had been reading a lot about LSD and religious experiences).  Trying to concentrate my mind on religious issues, I sat there for about 15 minutes.

Then a bubble of realization appeared in my mind, telling me that I could not believe in God because my parents had divorced.  God was the father and as I was raised by my mother, I could not trust that God would be there to take care of me.  Right then I started believing in God with a great sense of relief and euphoria.  I was completed because I could believe and trust in the goodness and purpose of the world.

I got home and actually kneeled down and began to pray (for a longtime atheist, this was quite a change).

Later I sobered up.  I was still deeply affected by my experience, but I wasn't naive enough to actually believe in god.  After all, even if the psychological cause of disbelief had to do with my parents, this didn't give me any reason to believe god existed.  Moreover, I was not convinced this was the reason for my loss of faith.

Psychedelics provide insight into the workings of our minds, but these insights can be traps for the unwary.  Certainly god and my parents' divorce are important issues for me, but who can say how they relate or if they even do.

My trip started out as usual. I had decided to just take a little liquid (6 drops; it was decent, but not great acid) by myself and just mellow out to Pink Floyd and contemplate cosmic questions and life in general. I decided to go for a walk around my block because it had begun to rain and i thought that would be interesting. It was around midnight and i'd dropped at around 10:30pm, so i was tripping pretty good. After completing my lap, i went back into a field on a hill behind my house and spun around in the rain and stared at the storm clouds and lightning bolts dancing across the sky. As i stood on the hill, i tensed up all the muscles in my body, held my breath and made my face turn red (like you would when you're taking a really intense shit, for lack of a better example). 

I began to feel really dizzy, so i relaxed and took in a deep breath. This triggered the most intense experience of my life. Involuntarily, i collapsed to the ground. As i hit the ground, i heard an extremely loud *whoooooosh*, and then my right leg began twitching uncontrollably. It was almost as if i was watching myself from outside my body. I became somewhat scared for the person i saw on the ground shaking. I forgot who i was, where i was, what had just happened before i fell. It was like complete temporary amnesia.

My leg only spasmed for about 5 seconds, but as i regained control of my body, i was still completely and utterly confused about my surroundings. Not only did i not know where i was, i couldn't even recognize what my surroundings were. The hill, the grass, the trees, the lights coming from surrounding houses, the road, the sky - it was like i was a newborn baby looking at the world for the first time. The only possible way for me to further describe the alien setting i was in, was that there were what appeared to be 'tiki gods' large and small everywhere, mumbling incoherently. The only thing i can remember thinking during this was, 'i've never experienced anything like this before, i have no control over my body at all.' What i saw was the most intense hallucination i've ever experienced, and i've eaten an abnormally large amount of acid over the years, and more potent lsd, too. The effects, after i fell to the ground, only lasted about 20 seconds. As soon as i was able to pick myself off the ground, i got up and maneuvered through the maze of trees, which i still didn't fully recognize, and almost zombified, i stumbled home. I went inside and began to attempt to sort out what just happened and what had caused it. I didn't remember tensing my muscles and holding my breath for about 20 seconds. 

After i figured out what instigated the experience, i walked back up to the field to re-attempt it.  I did it again, and fell to my knees and began shaking involuntarily again. This time while i was watching my body from outside, i thought that i was a cat. I could hear an unbelievable amount of previously non-existent sounds and see the sounds being broadcast to my ears through waves. The effects again wore off in about 20 seconds, however i did once again forget my surroundings, what had just happened, and why i was on the ground.

I told some of my friends and we agreed to try it again under the supervision of each other. I understand that what caused it was a lack of oxygen to the brain, but i still don't know if others have had the same kind of experience, if it can be dangerous, or why i reacted the way i did.

my friend G and i each took a hit of acid at my girlfriend's house and then after about 3 hours we left and drove 50 minutes back to my house...nothing.  we felt nothing.  5 hours later.  nothing.  duds, we were mad.

so G left and went home and at about midnight, my world exploded like an atom bomb.  i have tripped once before this, and i didn't understand what was happening, but i knew it was so good, it was SOOO good...  

:::conscience:::

i just grooved with it.  my head opened up and i thought every thought and dreamed every dream that anyone had ever (and will ever) think or dream.  my entire being overflowed with life and thought and dreams and hope and...

:::awareness:::

i laid down on my floor and put on my studio headphones (AMAZING sound quality) and turned on some Hallucinogen (for anyone reading this, Hallucinogen is a british psytrance artist.  his album 'twisted' changed my world, and i recommend you buy it N OW).  so i just succumbed to these booming trance beats and guttural grinding noises and i let myself float to the outer reaches of my own mind.  i traveled untrodden trails of my own brain and discovered avenues of life in my head that i never knew were there.

:::pulsating:::

then i took these gloves i have for raving that have glowing LED lights for fingertips and i went into my bathroom with a discman playing 'trance stimuli' and i just left my body.  i went through the entire album dancing in my bathroom thinking these explosive thoughts and discovering new life in an album i heard so many times.  and my gloves...my gloves blew my mind.  when the last track finished i was dripping with sweat down my entire body, but i wasn't tired.

3:15am

:::serene:::

i laid on my front lawn and smoked cigarettes and just re-examined my ENTIRE being.  i thought about every aspect of my existence inside and out and i came to a conclusion after 2 hours of constant thought.

everything is all right....

:::peacefulness:::

i eventually slept and called G immediately when i woke up to tell him what i had experienced.  'say no more my friend,' he replied, 'i was right there with you.'

and he was.... we never told each other about our trips because i knew and he knew there was no need.  we had a telepathic connection i never thought possible...he KNEW, and i KNEW.

:::inexplicable:::

but WONDERFUL.

The day started off as any normal day.  I got up and knew before hand that I would drop acid this day.  I had recently made a decision to stop smoking weed, and I thought a little LSD would give the introspection I needed to understand why I had to stop smoking.  

12:30: After calling the supplier met up with him in town.  The supplier was with a friend and she showed me what they had.  She was cutiing the pieces with some scissors.  She handed me two little pieces that were about the size of 2/3 of a normal tab.  I asked her if she was serious and she then told me that they had intended to buy a vial, but instead the guy soaked up all the acid from inside where it was made onto three pieces of paper.  Having known her a while, I believed her and went home.

1:00: I decide to go on a hike up a creek by my house.  It would take  me to the top of a hill which I thought would be fun to look at. I dropped both hits and started walking.  I had a video camera, two Red Bulls, and a mind starting to expand.

1:45: Drink one Red Bull,resume hiking.  I'm getting the pre-trip feeling.  Hope Red Bull will help me out.  

2:30: Acid had taken over.  I am on an outlook on top of the hill.  I watch the town below undulate and contort.  The distant clouds look like I could touch them if I wanted. Pulled out video camera and started to film.  

3:15: I'm at top of hill.  If I dont concentraight on my thoughts they will wander off on tangents.  I start to get paranoid that I was in Mountain Lion teritory and if one was to get me, no one would know.  I start back home.

3:45: Before going home I sit on a rock and meditate on things, in general.  Then I go home.  No one is there so I'm cool.  I watch Dark City and it blows my mind.  I relate it to everyday life.  I get lost in it and when it is over I feel sad.  Now the hallucinations are everywhere and I feel like I'm in a kaleidescope.  I turn on VH1 and watch the 100 greatest Rock and Roll Artists.  I have a paranoid thought that maybe all old 70's bands did acid and got to the same level of tripping as I am in right now.  I start to appreciate all the artists I see and other things about them.

4:45: Totally lost now, this stuff took me over.  Every thought I have turns into a vison. I ponder running to the beach, which is foutyr miles away.  Seriouslly.  Sanity comes back and I meelow out.  Start having real visions.  Like being in a dream while awake.  

6:45: Mellow now.  Hallucinations have stopped.  Stll freaked out about the visions.  Am in awe the rest of the day.

The moral of this story is NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF LSD.  Once you do your fucked.  If i had been in public, I would have been arrested.  I totally lost contact with reality for about an hour.  Now, I am going to stay away from LSD.  To all you new, eager acid heads out there, beware.  What I thought was a joke of a dose turned into the most powerfull trip of my life.

I drove to Eau Claire, WI (I am a student at the University of Wisconsin in Madison) with a friend for the weekend.  It was one of those situations where a person has a preconceived expectation of an entertaining experience; the three hour car ride was filled with this sort of enthused anticipation.

When we arrived, I was greeted by friends and we decided to wait until the next evening to take the acid.  By the next night we were ready.  We had two sugar cubes and two gel tabs. (One of the gel tabs, however, was cut abnormally large.) My friend was an acid virgin and decided to take only one of the sugar cubes - this left one sugar cube and the two gel tabs for me.  I had taken acid several times before and wasn't going to complain.  I was reading Tom Wolfe's 'The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test' at the time, so I figured it would be historically clever to dissolve the sugar cubes in cherry Kool-Aid.  I remember searching the foreign kitchen for 'the appropriate glasses' from which to drink the electric Kool-Aid.  As I opened the cupboard doors, an image struck me like an ethereal sign from the drug god: two sparkling martini glasses!  

The cubes took about half an hour to completely dissolve. When they did, we drank up. (The acid, as I had expected, was tasteless in the Kool-Aid.) There is a sort of mystique to taking acid, because there is no turning back.  Plus, you never really know, unless you made the acid, how much you're taking.  You always know how much weed you're smoking or how much coke you're snorting, but acid can be deceiving.  A little piece of blotter can have a shit-load of acid on it. After about a half hour, my friend was obviously experiencing some effects:  a big smile, intermittently unstoppable laughter.  He also claimed to have vague 'trails.'

My acid took longer to kick in - about an hour.  And for that first hour, I had the same effects.  Nothing unusual I thought, and I was happy.  About twenty minutes later, the trip began to get slightly more intense - I began to develop what John Lennon called 'kaleidoscope eyes.'  Everything in the room began to have hints of reds, yellows and blues.  This was very exciting, and I was very happy.  Two to three hours passed and everyone (they had all been only under the influence of alcohol) retired to their rooms to sleep.  My friend did the same - his trip was obviously fairly uneventful.  I went upstairs to sit in a friend's room.   This guy lived there and is a tropical freak.  His room resembles a jungle (especially on three hits of acid).  So, I sat there and looked around.  Alone.

This is when things started to go awry.  First of all, I now know it's a bad idea to trip alone unless you have something significantly distracting to do.  Secondly, this room was not user-friendly.  Oh yeah, this guy had three pet snakes, too.  Shit.  Everything in this bizarre room began to move and change color.  Simple things that normally remain simple began to take on severely different characteristics.  There were colorful, moving geometric designs in broad air.  One interesting point:  I remember thinking that, even
though I was beginning to become frightened, the geometric designs you see on acid when you concentrate on something are very beautiful - they are indescribable and no artist could possibly reproduce them well enough to do them justice.  This is why I am not going to try to explain my hallucinations to you.  Other things are interesting, however, and easy enough to explain.  For example, this guy had a mural of fish, and when I looked at it, the fish were actually swimming around.  It didn't think this sort of thing was actually
possible.  I had never really believed people when they had described things like this.

Hallucinations can be fun.  The down side is that acid messes with your thinking process as well.  I tried to write down what I was feeling, but by the time I had written down three words, I had forgotten what I was trying to say.  It gives you a strange sense of paranoia as well.  You seem to think something bad is going to happen to you.  And you usually believe yourself.   But why not?  This is  an easy thing to do, when nothing you have seen in the past four hours has been real.

After about eight to ten hours, I seemed to be peaking.  This really scared the shit out of me.  After awhile I was able to realize that it would all end in time, but minutes seemed like hours.  I wanted to sleep - my body was tired, but my mind was racing.  And, of course, I couldn't sleep, but this came as no surprise.  I remember trying however:  It was awful - the hallucinations I saw when I closed my eyes were worse than the ones I saw when my eyes were open.  I woke up one of my friends to talk with me, to keep me from going
insane.  I couldn't look at him though - his face started to turn into awful things.  It would become all contorted, and his hair turned into tentacles which began moving toward me.

Finally the drug wore off.  I still couldn't sleep though; I had that strange physical feeling where you're tired but you can't sleep, and you just accept it.  I was almost happy.  I remember thinking on the ride back to Madison - a voyage which was as metaphorical as it was literal; from utter craziness and a lack of reality back home to sanctuary and reality - that although my experience was very frightening, I still wouldn't call it a 'bad trip.'  I had experienced things that most straight people will never experience in three lifetimes.  I tried to tell people about it as I am trying to explain it here, but you really can't because it is an indescribable experience:  'I can't explain; you would not understand. This is not how I am.'  I don't know if I would have done it having known the consequences.   I don't know if I will do it again now knowing the consequences.  I probably will.

I had gotten hold of some acid from an acquaintance of mine and decided to share it with some friends I knew had been looking for it for some time.  K. and I had both tripped twice before (both of mine were pleasant, and mild).  C. had never done acid, and he decided to try it.  We each took an initial dose of blotter paper, before deciding to get our hands on some more from the same supplier.  By that time, J. and B. joined in and we had a group of five.  The stage was set as I began to feel the effects first....

As I said before, both of my previous trips had been pleasant, mild and solitary.  This was truly about to be a great experience--the shared one.  I was also excited for C., as it was his first time.  As the drug took hold of all of us, I could feel the energy level of the whole group rising and flowing in an indescribably free and encompassing manner.  The physical sensations I had were somewhat more intense than before:  I would even compare them in a small way to the effects of Ecstasy, which I have done once.  Anyway, we all talked and laughed and I could honestly feel everyone else's thoughts and energy.  It was absolutely beautiful, as if we were all walking through some bizarre Narnia together.

Eventually, J. and B. both left, leaving K., C. and me to continue our journey together.  We alternated between the front yard (definitely a dark night, with the street lights adding an eerie glow to everything) and the living room with Pink Floyd and a lava lamp.  No matter what we were looking at, we all saw the same thing:  the street oozing, the ceiling sliding, the carpet flowing, trees melting--WOW!!!  I had never seen anything more beautiful in my life.  The shared experience was the closest I have ever come to feeling at one with my surroundings.  The life around us just flowed and pulsated and caressed me in a way that I can never hope to describe.  C. was just in heaven, and we were so happy for him.  The sunrise was a truly cosmic experience.  None of us felt any ill effects, save the drained feeling that comes at every trip's end.  Furthermore, the three of us connected on a level which can never be expressed in words.  We just look at each other, remember, and understand.  Damn, what a feeling.

I went to go see a concert at the Gorge Ampitheater and took some acid that just fell into my hands as I ran into a friend I hadn't seen in years.  It was during the day and I was tripping....I walked to a cliff and sat down on the top of it.....the wind suddenly gusted and I felt it enter my body....all of the sudden I felt the prescence of a friend of mine and then realized that he was there....it wasn't just a thought, but it was a shamanistic sort of connection. 

We did not say anything to each other, just nodded in the affirmation that this was happening.....I began to cry as I realized what humans have the potential of doing but do not seem to be conscious of....the power of our minds can allow us to go anywhere our imaginations are capable of taking us to, and the presence of everyone you have ever met will always exist in your mind.

i woke up at 6:40 am on a friday and promptly ate three blue blotter. at approximately 7:25 i was walking to a coffee shop in my home town when i began to notice how exceptionally speedy this dose was. i have tripped several times and never before or again have i had such a strong amphetamine feel. 

i went to my high school and started band at 7:50. a pleasant body buzz came over me about half way through the period as i was marching outside, and everything gained a very ironic feel. several people asked my why i was wearing sunglasses, but that was the least of my concerns. i noticed that a member of the band's head was a flag, and i began to wonder what was going on until i realized that i was on drugs. this puzzled me. 
at 8:40 i left the high school in a friend's car (he was driving) and remarked at how incredibly beautiful the fall leaves on all the trees were, and how amazing it was that my legs were at rest, yet we were obviously moving. i then went home and called a friend, asking him to meet me at the library while admiring my insanely dilated pupils. i went upstairs to my computer and wrote the following:

'I have saucereyes shining back at me from every reflective surface. 
my hands move with their own consciousness.
my mind is filled with a dim green golw of benevolence, washing forward and backward through my suddenly open consciousness.
waking.  Everything is moving quickly with that speedy shimmery trainride feel, sweeping and lifting me, funnelling through a spiral of forgotten thoughts and fragments, transcending this state of smiling idiosynchrisies and uncoordinated floating chaos. In this sea of collisions and orderly creation and destruction I have made my home beyond words. This is bliss.
screams and quieted notions greet me from the seas and mists of forgotten lores and empty passages unbeknownst to me now. Sssstirring from the cabin of this vessel has infringed upon my trainride awareness.

Someone has lost this place.  Laughing and bursting and climbing through the walls and opening their lives back and forth in a cycle quick and precise,  we're all running back and forth through the fire searching for order in frantic wide-eyed notions of mobility and so we break down into pieces.

Incoherent warblings and buzzing eminate from the semiconscious subconscious subhuman followers of an outdated order of life. This is a cycle of things. A feeling of familiarity. family. liars.
And a bright white climax of fire and emotion, a shower of lights, a dawn of perception, an awakening, and then it passes back into this disconnected bunch of insanity. It's funny that i'm prompting this schizophrenia in my own mind and looking to it for so much support. irony. blindness. We hide from ourselves we run and run and hide from ourselves. 
the words on this page have gained a sentience.  I'm going to go soon.'

After having written that, i went to pick up my paycheck. It was close to ten o'clock, and i was peaking.  It should be noted that at nine o'clock I experienced a psychological peak, which plateaued for about two hours. At about ten I experienced a body peak, and around ten thirty  I experienced a visual peak. This was highly unusual.

After a lengthy conversation with my employer, i went to the local bank to cash my paycheck. While waiting in line, I noticed a large mirror on the wall and admired the reflection of a young lady in it. At that point i had some confusion over my identity, and whether i was in fact me, or the girl in the reflection. I thought to myself, 'what's going on here? is this some kind of plot? good god man, get a hold of yourself!'

I nonchalantly reached down and put my sunglasses back on, and pondered the idea of using lsd as a supplement to everyday life.

At about eleven, I waited at the library and noticed a fog appearing from around the corner of a nearby building. I then wrote the following in my sketchbook:

'The calm cool mist of impending destruction has taken a centre stage in today's glorius activities. 
and i feel okay. 
still. 
there are a lot of crazy things going on here. i wonder whose plot this is.
cement mixer. 
the trees sing! 
epiphanies! 
all is right with the world for a brief moment. 
T+4h20min 
and the clocktower chimes. 
ten city blocks from ground zero and the world goes crazy. 
waiting for the aftershocks.'

By eleven thirty I had met up with two friends and made my way to the city park along with two bottles of orange juice purchased in a nearby carry out. We were contemplating the nature of our hometown, seeming like a post-industrial wasteland in the middle of a life-sucking suburban community. When we reached the swing set, I downed a bottle of orange juice and decided it would be an appropriate time to contemplate the many questions i had set aside to ask myself during this trip, all relating back to the nature of a closer connection between my subconscious and conscious mind.

I looked down at my obscenely long hair, the fallen leaves, trees like veins in the empty skies, and the people I surrounded myself with and felt an immense security. The beauty of the breathing ground and ancient collective consciousness of the nature around me infringed upon my perception in a sensory onslaught, leaving me immersed in a million thoughts moving too quickly for my brain to grasp. 

Being overly satisfied with this situation, my friends and I departed, walking downtown to see that the trees had all been cut down months before, and the pavement ripped from the earth, leaving gaping holes and dust in the air (the fog of impending destruction). We picked up a hammer on the way, thinking of it as a valuable companion and tool in the journeys that lay ahead of us. Soon afterward, things became far less surreal. I was beginning to come down.

My two friends and i walked to the local dairy queen in search of food, and we left the hammer outside.  After we ordered, we went and sat down, and one of the dairy queen employees went outside and picked up the hammer. A few minutes later, he brought us our food and began to walk away when I stopped him.
'hey,' i said, 'just what the hell do you think you're doing? did you steal my friend's hammer?'
'uhmmm... yeah, it's in the back... i'll... uh, go-'
'Oh, that won't be neccessary. you can have it. just take good care of it. i'm sure you'll take it to where it belongs.'
'right. i have to go now.'
And so he left and i began to eat my ice cream.

I quickly noticed that my body had no intention of eating this ice cream. whenever i put my body on autopilot, trusting it to continue consuming the ice cream, it would stop, holding the ice cream in front of me. Finally, I coaxed myself into finishing it.

At that point i went home and listened to a lovely album by a perfect circle on my still relatively new stereo system. It was incredible. the third track has a distorted bow bassline that made me feel very light, and like i was riding some sort of twisted roller coaster, bounding from side to side. I often wonder what effects of lsd are psychosomatic, because the nature of the drug lends itself to giving you complete control of the trip with a little practice. 

It should also be noted that the body buzz associated with lsd is a 'light' one. Alchohol and marijuana are slightly heavier than one's own body weight, dextromethorphan is like having a house on top of you, and lsd and mdma are like floating. 

At around 5 o'clock, there was a marching band practice for the football game at 7:30 that evening. a friend of mine informed me that my pupils were still noticably dilated. This particular football game was band senior parent's night, and being that I was a senior, I got to walk down the fifty yard line escorted by my parents.  I informed them that i was feeling just fine. They never suspected a thing.

One final note is that the next day i had the worst amphetamine comedown i have ever experienced. The whole day before i had felt speedy, but saturday morning i worked for six hours, and it sucked. a lot. One rule I think most people should follow and that i almost never break is to set aside a day after tripping to recap your days activites and to recover from excessive walking/moving.

It was the last day of my junior year in high school. A bunch of us went to the park outside of town on the hill for a picnic. It was a lot of fun, romping around the playground equipment and picnic tables and playing in the grass. After a while, we split up into two groups. Five of us, me included, went exploring at a man-made stream at the edge of the park, where a cement wall created a little waterfall. The other half of our group, which included about six people, took a van to buy some food and drinks, and cigarettes if they could find someone who sold to kids under eighteen. They were gone for about two hours.

During this time, my friend R and I roamed away from the pretty waterfall. We were going to freak out our friends my pretending to down a few pills of acid. After she went back to the waterfall, I did two hits of acid I happened to have with me but I didn't tell her about. When I came back to the waterfall, she kept asking if I really took some. I didn't say anything.

I kept watching the water in this little creek. It was very hypnotic. And this is where it got really strange. I THOUGHT I had been watching this water the whole time, kneeling in the grass. As it turned out, I had been on one hell of a trip.

I thought I was still watching the water when someone shook me and asked if I okay. I sat up and realised I was lying on a park swing at the OPPOSITE end of the park, almost half a mile away from the man-made creek and the little waterfall. My pant legs and shoes were soaked. The people in the van had returned. 

They told me they'd been looking for me for over an hour, that they had panicked and were fighting and crying over whether or not to call the police. R had told everyone what she thought I did. They also said that, before I ran off in what they called a fit of ecstacy, everyone had gathered together for a group photo. I was later shown the photo, and I was in it, right in front, a big smile on my face, but I'll be DAMNED if I can remember posing for it. I still swear, to this day, that I was never in the photograph.

I'm a fan of acid, but I still think you have to know your body well enough before trying anything. I'd done two hits before, and was confident I could handle myself. It's not that I had a bad trip or a train wreck. I simply lost ALL sense of reality. What I thought was just an hour of hypnotic staring at a stream turned out to be an hour of running around like a wild child, and eventually disappearing. I could have run onto to the highway and gotten flattened by a semi and would never have known.  I have scars and scratches and tears in my clothing from that very weird afternoon, and I don't remember getting any of them.

It all started the day my friend Shauna and I decided that we were going to go to a college fraternity party and that we wanted to be under the influence of some mind altering substance, instead of drinking like we normally did at parties.  And we wanted something stronger than just marijuana.  So, we talked to a friend and he said he could either get us Ectasy or LSD.  We told him either one would be fine.   I had done both before, and never had a bad experience.  Shauna had never done either, but wanted to be with me the first time she did.  Finally, he called and said that he had gotten us some acid.  So, we went and got it about 6pm.  The party started at 11, so we figured we would take it around 10.  The kid we bought it from told us not to take more than one at a time because they were really potent.  He called them Purple Monster.  They were tiny, with a purple background and a cartoon-like monster pattern on them.  So, we went back, stopped for some orange juice along the way and sat around till 10.  At 10pm, we took the first tab, then we got ready for the party.  We didn't feel anything yet when we arrived at the party.  Shauna kept asking me if she was supposed to be feeling it yet, and I said that it was odd that it hadn't kicked in yet.  By midnight, we were just feeling a little like we had smoked pot.  So, we left the party and walked back to our dorm with 2 guys we know that live a floor above us in the dorm. (Neither of them were on anything, they were just drunk.) As we were walking back (it's about a 10 min walk), it hit me that I was feeling it.  I looked back behind me to see if Shauna was feeling anything and the scenery blurred as I turned my head.  Everything seemed to be in slow motion.  Then, I knew that we were tripping.  I told Shauna to 'think happy thoughts,' as we had discussed what a bad trip was before we took it.  She asked a lot of questions before we took it, and understood what was going to happen...somewhat.  

So, we got back to the dorm, stood outside and smoked a cigarette.  Then Shuana and I started talking to each other.  We stood directly in front of one another and just focused on each other's eyes, and everything and everyone around us just disappeared.  Shauna kept telling me that one of the guy's mom's was coming to visit and that she was mad at us.  I was trying to talk her out of it as I began to believe it myself.  So, we went inside and up to the guy's room.  I sat down on one bed on the one side of the room and Shauna laid down on the other bed  across the room and I discovered that inside the mirror across the room it was snowing.  Shauna didn't believe me, and her face twisted and contorted until it was this evil, demonic face and her voice changed into a deep, growling voice as she told me that she didn't believe me and that I was lying to her.  One of the guys sat down on the edge of the bed and she put her one arm up over his shoulder, so all I could see was him grasping her hand hanging over his shoulder.  I thought that he had hurt her, so I started crying and telling her to take her hand off of him.  She just glared at me with this demonic look on her face and said 'No, Ann...he's not going to hurt me.'  Time went on after this and we just sat in the room and tripped and the guys messed with our heads.  Nothing unusual....yet.  Then we decided that we wanted to smoke some weed.  And we both took another hit of acid at that point.  So, I got my bowl, Shauna had one of the guys roll her a joint with some of her weed, and we went outside to smoke.  Shauna went off with the guy that rolled her the joint to smoke it, and I stood on the front porch of my dorm and smoked about 3 bowls between 2 of us.  It was about 2am at that point.  Shauna came around the corner of the building sobbing hysterically, repeating my name over and over again.  She couldn't handle being away from me on her trip.  She went nuts if I wasn't in the same area or room as her the whole time.

We went back inside, and after a while the guys passed out, so we had to go downstairs to my room.  So, we went to the end of the hall and down to the landing of the next floor down, where I live.  We couldn't decide whether it was my floor or not, and we stood there for what seemed like an hour trying to decide if we should go down the stairs (which looked like they led to nowhere) or go down the hall.  Finally, I convinced Shauna that we should go down the hall to my room.  My roommate was home for the weekend, so the room was empty.  We went in, and got dressed for bed.  Shauna laid down in my roommate's bed and I laid down in mine.  She started saying how bad her back was hurting her, and then my neck started to hurt really bad.  This is another effect of acid.  Then she looked at me and said, 'let's have a cigarette.' Since I have a smoking room, this was not a big deal.  So, we each got a cigarette out and sat there holding them, thinking they were lit, since we could see smoke coming out of the ends of them.  I said we better go over by the window so it doesn't smell like smoke too bad in here.  So, when Shauna went to get off of the bed, she realized that the floor had morphed into water, and if we touched it, that we would drown. So, we had to get over to the window without touching the floor.  We sat and devised a plan to jump from the beds to the chairs by the window so that we could smoke over there.  We finally made it.  Then when we realized that our cigarettes weren't really burning, we lit them and smoked them.  Then we went back to the beds and sat and talked about our visuals.  I saw this huge cement drainage tube that was open and at the top was a big tilted bottle of Heinz ketchup that was pouring into the drain pipe.  I told Shauna about it, and she said that she was trying to get to the other end of the tunnel to get to me.  The pipe then transformed into a tunnel.  I told Shauna to walk towards me, and as she did, Santa Claus appeared in front of me and wouldn't let Shauna walk past me.  So, I was hollering to her that she couldn't get by because Santa Claus was in the way.  Then that visual disappeared and we both shut our eyes.  All of the geometric shapes were green and red, Christmas colors.  And we saw the same exact things at the same time.  Then we discovered that if we looked up really fast with our eyes open, we could see these crackling, silver sparkles that flooded across the room.  All of a sudden as we were talking, I transformed into someone else.  Shauna started talking to me as if I was someone else.  I asked her who she was talking to and she said that there was a man with a red beard lying in my bed.  And that one side of his face was male and one side was female.  She asked him where Ann was, and he/I said that she had gone outside to smoke.  Shauna then got very upset that I had gone outside without her, and that this man was sitting in my bed.

Then she looked at the door and said, 'Oh, Ann is back.'  Then, I instantly transformed back into myself.  Then, we were sitting talking and every couple of minutes, Shauna would glance at the door and say, 'Ann, the door is open,' and I would look and it was closed.  I would tell her that it was closed and she would say that everytime I looked, it would close really fast then it would open again.  That started to freak me out.   So I was paranoid that someone kept opening the door.  Finally, after a while, we started to come down.  Many times, we would think that we were done tripping, and that feeling would come back.  Finally, we both fell asleep, exhausted mentally and physically.  All in all, we tripped for 10 hours.  The next couple of days, neither of us felt normal.  I have had a couple of flashbacks.  Even now as I am writing this, I can visualize each experience with great clarity.  Shauna's first trip was a great one.  And Santa Claus was an underlying theme of the whole trip.

I just read some bad trip stories, and all I can say is holy shit...I think I definitely would have died. The first time I tripped, on two yellow geltabs, I thought I was going to go insane. But as one unfortunate person put it, 'There will always be someone who has done more than you. ' Indeed, my friend said that he tripped so hard once he had to go up to trees and touch them to see if they were real. That made me feel better. 

Anyways, reading about those bad trips made me feel a li'l sad, so I decided to contribute a happy trip story.

That very same friend and I tripped on New Year's Eve, 1999. My friend, Neo, loves to trip, the harder the better. I, on the other hand, am definitely a roller. I would have loved to roll that night, but let me tell you that when you're dead ass broke and you're craving a roll real bad, a mind bending $5 trip hits the spot real good. We dropped around 11:00pm and smoked up a little with my sister and my other friend Goku. It seemed like a long time had gone by, and I had actually forgotten that we had dropped already when I started feeling that weird wirey acid feeling. The main thing was Goku's watch. Every time he moved it, the street light would glint off of it, except instead of it being a white glint, it was bright red. Neo and Goku were talking, and Goku flicked away his cigarette, which left a long orange trail behind it. Neo then asked if I was feeling it, which got an emphatic yes.

By the time midnight struck, Neo and I were both tripping balls, and it really sucked having to go in and hug my family. We went outside shortly thereafter, and everything was moving. I knew it was cold outside, but I had taken my shoes off and I couldn't feel my feet. Everything was moving really fast, and the grass had a weird pattern on it, like brain coral. Neo came out and we stood together, looking at the clouds. They seemed to be wanting to spell something, but never quite got there. Then I looked at Neo, and he looked ancient. He gave me a hug, and it felt like our bodies were a gummy-bear consistency. Goku joined us, and we went to the side of the house, out of sight of my family. The shadows on the wall from the plants were moving all over the place, and the cars looked like they were breathing. I laughed and asked my car if I treated it good, and it actually nodded at me! That was a little scary, but no big deal.

Then we went over to Goku's to dance with glowsticks, and that's where the fun really began. Goku wasn't tripping, but he was high and drunk, and is an incredible dancer. He is the one who taught me to dance, and calls me his prodigy. Anyway, when Goku would dance, it looked like he was constructing a pattern around him, like the Epcot ball. Other times the trails formed weird celtic knots that we couldn't quite figure out. Most of the time it looked like he had four arms, and that his hands were eagle's claws holding blue and yellow medallions. It got crazier, too. Sometimes it looked like the trails were going through his body, shooting out his chest and shit. He would do this weird trick where he would move the glowsticks around my face, and it felt like he was picking my head off my neck, twisting it around and putting it back. His body looked like it was fragmenting into two or four pieces, the way it would look in a shattered mirror. And at one point, when he was really dancing in my face, he was moving his hands back and forth in front of my eyes, and I could see his face THROUGH HIS HANDS!! His hands were translucent or something, and I could see his face clearly, like something you would see in a weird music video. Goku has done a good share of intense shit, but even he had to admit that was crazy. My dancing was good too, but I couldn't really get into it, and I kept dropping the glowsticks. The comforter on the bed had a floral pattern, though, and when the glowstick would fall there, it looked like the liquid inside was combining with the flowers, and the flowers were going into the glowstick.

All in all, it was fun, since I can handle acid now. But what I hate most about geltabs is the inability to sleep afterwards. I never had that problem with the wimpy paper hits. Many hours later I began to feel sore, especially in the back and feet. I know geltabs are supposed to spare you this discomfort, but who knows. 

Neo and I got home (after a very intense drive, let me tell you) at around 5:30am. I thought the trip was going away, but I was wrong. My feet looked white and the joints looked purple, and they looked like the feet of a corpse. It didn't bother me, but they did hurt, and were about as cold as a corpse's feet too. I kept saying I thought I had frostbite (in Miami? yea right!). My room looked really pretty. It had a soft pinkish glow, and everything seemed really colorful and interesting. I never realized what a good tripping room I had, even though a friend told me so a long time ago. Well, i got in bed, and hard as I might try, I could NOT sleep. When I closed my eyes, I kept seeing a weird pattern of shapes that looked like letters, but not quite. Maybe they were alien letters. Anyway, they were all over everything, as though a screen of them had been draped over my eyes, and they were turning every color of the rainbow. I had been seeing them since the beginning of the trip, and were getting annoying. After miserably watching the sun come up, I fell asleep for a few hours, and had all sorts of acid dreams, which looked like splatters of paint being shot this way and that. I was completely fried and exhausted the next day. At least I didn't feel like rolling anymore, though!

All I can say about acid is that it's fun if you can handle it. It should definitely be done with someone who has a lot of experience with it, as this makes you feel safe. I would also definitely recommend not to half-ass it, because if you do, you will feel uncomfortable and not have any visuals. Let's face it: LSD is not a physically pleasant feeling. What's great about it is the mind blowing shit you will see. I have never hallucinated off it before, but the amount of colors on everything is amazing. Also, have other alternative things planned. Dancing with glowsticks is amazing, but since acid is not rolling, you will get tired of it relatively soon. Have good movies ready, particularly Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. You will laugh until your stomach hurts. The Matrix is also good. Nothing sad, or you will completely ruin your trip. I saw Deep Impact tripping because I thought it would be cool; big mistake. I came home wanting to be with my family, and I was totally depressed. Also, I know I am probably an exception, but I tend to get starving towards the end of my trip, so have good food ready. And plenty to drink. Mainly, have things to keep you occupied and having fun, because if you let your mind wander while on that shit, you could get in mad trouble. Peace out.

I am by no means a writer and some of my accounts of this story may seem hazy and Chaotic but this is the best way for me to describe this experience. I`d been Joy Trippin for like 10 or 12 years but nothing was ever quite like this. It was February of 1998. The day stared off normal enough as I woke up, grabbed for my pack of Ports and the phone. I made some calls and headed out the door by 2 in the afternoon with my friend Theresa. We made it into Austin at about 3 and went downtown to chill with some Kidz on the Drag for a few hours. Some Kid told us about a party that night so that became our goal for the evening. The party itself went off without a hitch and all was good catchin up with some Kidz I hadn`t seen in a while and doin some doses. I don`t usually make it a point to keep track of how many hits I`ve taken but I`m sure it was somewhere around 50 paper doses. At any rate I was informed before the night was over to come to this girl Heidi`s (R.I.P.)house the next day if I was gonna be in town at around 5 cause my friend Tre had somethin in mind for me. 

It was on. Theresa and I went on back home and slept for a few hours woke up showered and chilled for a while. We made it back to Austin around 6:30(fashionably late)and no sooner made it in the door as my friend Tre said 'open up Kid'. He dosed me about 10 drops of the Sickest Liquid I`ve ever come across. We chilled there for a while and by 7 were out the door to another friends house. The Trip started to set in a little within an hour but it was a feeling I had never experienced before. I felt really uptight and on edge so I smoked some hydro and tried to relax. No dice. This feeling went on for almost 4 hours and I was feeling pretty sick pretty much just thinkin it was bad acid but not wanting to say anything to Tre to Dis his shit. Tre decided it was time to set his plan in motion and asked us if we were ready to go. I asked him where to and he just smiled. O.K. no biggie,this is Tre...so off we went. Me, Theresa, Tre and his Girl. Our destination turned out to be a Howard Johnson Motel in Austin on the top floor of all places. 

Like I said I was feelin pretty bad so goin to the top floor didn`t seem like all that much Phun. When we got to the room Tre told me there was someone he wanted me to meet. I asked him who right as the door opened.  I wasn`t sure who this Cat was but I was sure I`d seen him before. He let us in the room and we all exchanged greetings and all that jazz. After a few minutes of chit chat this person that I`ll call F. asked me if I`d like to do some drops with him. I told him I`d taken 10 already and he asked me if I was still sick. Feeling Puzzled I said yeah why?(Thinkin maybe somethin was really wrong with this situation). He asked Tre how long ago I dosed and when Tre told him about 4 hours he said I`d feel better soon and once again asked me if I wanted to do some doses. At that point(and I don`t know why) I said sure. He asked me how many and I got all cocky and said whatever`s clever (big mistake). He came over to me with a vial, bit the tip off and squirted it into my mouth. I instantly started geekin in my mind but held it in to at least look like I was keeping my composure. He then did the same for himself. A few minutes later the sickness was actually going away replaced with an intense feeling of warmth. Tre and F. spoke amongst themselves as I spoke with Theresa who had also done about 30 or 40 drops herself. During this time Tre was tellin F. of how I had always wanted to Spin Out and had never manged to get there even though it wasn`t uncommon for me to eat a sheet or more at a time. F. came back over to me and talked about it with me a bit before offering me the chance I`d always wanted. Put on the spot of it I was a little scared at first but I`m sure it was just the realization of what I had already taken was starting to mess me up pretty bad. I agreed not really knowing what was gonna take place in the next few minutes as I started trying to convince myself I`d be ok. F. pulled out a different batch of vials along with a bottle of 2 fingered tequila (that I later found out was full of Un-Cut Liquid) and carefully put different amounts of (unmeasured)doses in each of 6 vials. Not knowing exactly how much was in each one.He had me sit in a chair, place my hands on my lap and tilt my head back when he started pouring the vials in my mouth and on my face. When he was finished he gave me a hug followed by one from Tre and wished me well on my journey. I relaxed a bit and started to fall into the groove of things for a few minutes when it hit me all at once.

At first it was very peaceful, I started to drift off out of consciousness a bit and was experiencing visuals at an unheard of level, but about 5  minutes later something went wrong.I fell into a complete panic. I started feeling as though I couldn`t breathe. I looked around the room and not wanting anyone to know I was panicking I closed my eyes and tried to ride it out as with any other trip. No dice. In my head I saw blood everywhere and saw myself losing it and starting to kill people that were in the hotel room with me. I opened my eyes again and jerked my head from side to side trying to find a way out of this mindset. I told myself that I needed to get out of the room before I lost it and jumped up and reached for the door. I made it about halfway out the door when I had the feeling and thought in my head that I was telling myself that I would jump (remember I`m on the top floor). I jumped back in the door slamming it and put my back against the door as I slid down it to the ground. Every bad thing that people had told me could happen ran thru my mind and I felt them all happening to me at that point. Tre looked over at me and asked me how I felt and if I was ok. I told him no. He asked me what was wrong and I told him i was scared. He tried to assure me that there was nothing to be afraid of and that it was just my mind trying to let go and that I was trying to hold it back and should just let it go. I put my hands to my head and started crying squeezing my head. At this point he knew something wasn`t right and grabbed F.`s attention to let him know that I was geekin. F. came to me and sat down on the floor beside me, he offered me a bowl and tried to talk to me a bit. I wasn`t comprehending anything and my heart was racing. He helped me up and had me sit in the chair I had started out in. (This is where it got crazy) He had me close my eyes and started placing peaceful thoughts in my head to help me relax as reality was floating away quickly (all this happened within 10 to 15 minutes from the point he splashed me)

He decided this wasn`t going to work and had everyone either leave or be quiet.He took hold of my hand and led me somewhere in my mind I`d never been. He was telling me kinda what to look for and when I found it I let him know. He asked me if I was there and I told him I was. All I could see was a tornado of different colored numbers and letters. He talked to me very calmly and led me back to a point where I was somewhat in grips with what was going on.(more or less I`d say this has to be close to being hyptnotized)I couldn`t believe this was happening.It couldn`t be real.I tried to make sense of it in what little mind I had left but it was no good.This went on for about 20 minutes. Just him talking to me and takin me for a ride (I`d heard of this happening but never believed it was real). When he brought me out I seemed to understand alot more of what was going on around me and things were clearer but I insisted that none of this was real. I quickly put it out of my mind just thankful to be feeling somewhat better but it wouldn`t last for long. He had just gotten me thru the onset of it all. A little later we left there on a mission to get some Meth from another Cat across town. I was feeling really mellow when we left not really thinking about things too much. Just kinda goin with the flow of thoughts of peaceful things that F. had fed me.

When we got to this Kidz appartment I realized quickly that this was a set up. They opened the door and told us to come in but the first thing I saw was a kid hiding in the hall and the barrel of a shotgun barely sticking out. I turned and looked at another kid who had a gun in his pants. As I started to bolt Tre also saw what was going on and started to run also. I took a few running steps and rather that go down the stairs I jumped from the second level walkway. Tre ran down half the stairs before looking back and seeing them start to come after us. I was already in the car and was starting to pull out while opening his door for him to jump in. As we started down the road 2 gunshots rang out and my mind went with them. I don`t know how we made it back to the hotel but we did and right then and there I lost it. I lost all track of everything in my mind. Nothing was real.I don`t really know how to expalin it without sounding like a fool but oh well. I lost myself as a physical being. I didn`t exist. No one did. Nothing was real. No shapes no thoughts,nothing. I was lost in a space of colors. Beautiful colors coming and going from every direction. Not a single thought existed. I was told that what it looked like is that I`d fallen into a Trance and about 20 minutes into it they said I just passed out. Out of fear of what had happened earlier no one wanted to call an ambulance and have everyone all freaked out so F.had some of the people there take off just in case anything happened to me so they wouldn`t be involved. I was that close to death becoming a reality and didn`t even know it.

I awoke several hours later completely delirious.  Not being able to make any sense of anything. My ability to speak was gone only to be replaced by jibber jabber baby talk. I stayed like that for a couple of hours (while I was told later everyone sat around watching me hoping I`d be ok but not really knowing if I would or not). (I was also told of the baby talk as they called it as I had no recollection of it) After that I passed out again and everyone started to panic a bit. This went on with me waking up and passing out the whole morning, day and half of the next night. I finally started to come out of it a bit when I heard the phone ring. I looked around and asked everyone what was going on. I was still really out of it but I had some senses of things. I smoked a bowl with some help and they managed to feed me a bit when it hit me again. This time I understood things a lot better but was still not in my right mind. By the morning I was able to get in the car to start making my way home. 'Finally' I thought. I was able to drive so I figured I must be ok. Everyone thanked me for giving them the scare of their lives as Theresa and I left the hotel. Halfway home we noticed a DPS Trooper right on our bumper. Not good. I was able to maintain some kind of mindset to keep the car straight and that he was just running the tags to make sure we were all good. Whew!! We were and he went on his way. I had trouble getting used to being anywhere but the hotel for hours when we got back to my friends apt. and by the evening time headed back for Austin still trippin. We hooked up with Tre and his girl and rented a room where Tre and I proceeded to match and raise each other on doses the whole night with both of us passing out and waking up over and over again. You`d think I would have learned something or been afraid but after all I had already been thru nothing seemed impossible. I don`t know what exactly happened to me on that trip but I haven`t been the same person. I lost some of my edge on things that I don`t understand. I can`t explain what I saw. It was religious, it was eternal, it was pure insanity. I learned some things during this time though I`m still not really sure what they were. I don`t know if I would recomend anyone doing this without putting some serious thought into it first. I could have died and it didn`t cross my mind until I was faced with the reality of it.

Raw Liquid is about as pure as it gets aside from getting dusted from a crystal and None of us are really sure how much I was given. F. isn`t even sure and was upset with himself for not being more careful. I`m alive and it`s all good but I don`t know if I`d ever do it again. It took almost 2 months for me to feel normal and get some of the things I had seen out of my head and to this day I`m still not the same person I was when I got up that day to drive to Austin. Getting Spun is something that can easily get out of hand. This is a very dangerous thing to do. Not knowing the exact Mics you`ve ingested can be fatal, and with Liquid it`s hard to say. Keep that in mind if you decide to venture any further than just weekend Joy Tripping. It`s so much more than that. It`s an Experience. One of a lifetime for me I think. Omega

Well, my first mistake was that this, my first trip, was also my first time doing anything.  I was 17, and I've been a relatively 'straight kid' for most of my life, I mean I had only been drunk once.  Anyways, I had never quite been against drugs, and thought it would be neat to try one that would give me a definite, memorable experience.  So, a couple newer friends of mine asked if I wanted to trip, so I accepted.  I took one hit, and my friends each took two.

All was well when it just started to kick in, extreme happiness, a body buzz.. I couldn't stop smiling and laughing.  Then, just as things started getting a bit overwhelming, my friends' parents came home.  So, we had to go out walking around a very busy part of town.  During our walk, we were especially out of it because 1) the acid we took was unusually strong and we were peaking 2) we were in a very uncomfortable, transient environment and 3) because we had no one to calm us down.  To make matters worse, a  guy came up to me, and asked me for my number, and then if I had any cocaine.  This, was particularly unpleasant, as I didn't want to be asked any questions, and I was somehow convinced that I might simply have been imagining the walk, and that I was still back at the house.  My friends proceeded to haul me into various stores at which we bought nothing, and I became even more irritated, afraid and paranoid.

Finally we returned to my friend's house.  That's when we heard Rod Stewart music spewing from outside.  My friends, much more enthusiastic than I at this point, bolted outside to see where it was coming from.  Right then, alone in the room, I felt very overwhelmed, and wanted only to have the trip over with, so much so that I was almost willing to just call my parents and explain everything so that I could get help if possible.  My friends rushed back in, somewhat oblivious to my bad trip, as I was trying very hard not to show it.  Thankfully, my friend sat me down, put on some nice music, and put a magic eye book on my lap, which seemed to calm me down.  After I had come off of my peak, we watched tv, and then played with the snow on the screen.  The rest of the night was wonderful and calm.  So I guess I can say I'm not scared off lsd, but I'd definitely reconsider the environment in which to take it.

I trip sporadically-from every day spanning a week to once every couple months- each time taking in excess of 3 hits.  I usually trip with at least one other person.  My experiences transpire generally with my peers who have dosed smaller amounts than I (e.g. they eat 1-2 tabs while I eat 3-7) and I am much less affected by the drug.  My trips range from no effect at all to a felling of euphoria and/or anxiety accompanied by a most entertaining and subversive train of thought.  Last time I tripped I took 3 hits and my girlfriend took 1 and my trip lasted about an hour and a half.

I experienced no visual hallucinations, just a heightened perception of beauty in everything around me, and the usual unsusual and insightful train of thought.  I felt high and happy with no ill effects (I have never experienced any ill effects besides a sore neck probobly from looking around so much).  My girlfriend on the other hand had a very intense trip lasting about 10 hours.  We both took the same acid, and we both smoked the same amount of pot.  The pot seems to have little or no effect on my friends and I while we are tripping.  My girlfriend had finally come down around 5 in the morning and she wanted to smoke some pot.  I used the lavatory, noticed my pupils were no longer dialated and returned to pack up a bong.  We smoked about 3 grams of pot and then my girlfriend freaked out and started crying saying that she was still not finished tripping, but then she came to her senses and began to laugh, thinking that the pot had caused this to occour. (is this possible?) I went to look and sure enough my pupils had widened, but I felt no different.  

On a seperate occasion I took 5 doses of lsd and felt nothing but a bout of hot flashes and anxiety.  My pupils never dialated but I did feel dosed.  All effects stopped thereafter and my peers who had taken only 1 hit of acid were bouncing off the walls and they ended up having an 8 hour trip. I ended up going to sleep about 2 and a half hours after consuming the 5 sugar cubes.  

I have done a bit of searching and cannot find any explanation behind a tolerance to lsd besides dormant or active pschotic disorders.  I am pretty sure I have no psychotic disorder but I have been told I need to be checked for ADD.  I would like to find out any correlations between tolerance and biological/psychological make up.  I smoke pot every day and meditate occasionally.  If any of you guys has any info on this subject I would be happy to hear it.

 I was still an amateur at this point, only had taken sid about 3 times. Most of the summer had been spent smokin' and not doing much. I had been on the boat with two friends, had a blast and was wiped out. We got back to the house and did the usual, try and find some doja. We called this girl we knew just to talk, but she said she was busy. 'What are you talking about,' I ask and she replies 'Me and (some other weird girl) are gonna trip.' My heart jumped. 'Holy shit, can you get us some shit?' The answer had to be yes or else I couldn't tell about it. She came over with two other guys who had the whole freaking spectrum of gel, and some whack blotter. This was when geltabs were making it into the scene in my area and were quite expensive, so we settled for the Blue Moon (I was later told the dosage was around 200 mcg per hit), a blotter that had a Blue moon and some other drawing on it. The guys left and I was sitting there with five hits in my hand. I only took three (good thing) and saved some for later in the week. [Little did we know the conversation our friend had with the dealers. it went something like this: Dealer - 'your friends do a lot of acid?' Girl - 'I dont know, I guess so.' Dealer - 'Oh, well this acid is gonna kick their ass. (together) HaHaHaHa'] 

We took the hits, my one friend and I took three and the other took two, at about 6:30 and proceeded to my house to see if my parents were hiding any shit we could smoke. The theft was a success, hadn't been caught yet, and then went back to the starting place. Just chill'n on the couch when My #1 friend (the 3 hit friend; I will refer to him as #1 and the 2 hit friend to #2) said 'Dude, I think I'm feeling it.' and rambled about these glowing strings he had in his room. We all knew that hell was about to break loose any time now. We walked outside when #1 went off the wall. #2 and I kept telling him to calm down as people were walking their dogs and kids. It was about 7:30 now when #2 lost it. I was begging them to cool it and that they were insane, no pun intended. At the end of the street I was in uncontrollable laughter.

Going back to touch base, and get swim gear on and head to the neighborhood pool. Got there and were literally sucked in (actually figuratively, but the acid made it literal) and went about our lunatic way. It was 9:00 and all dark; the stars were trailing but no true visuals yet. I could stay underwater forever, looking into a green abyss and laying stagnant a meter down. We were yelling and laughing and holy shit. This was the most Pleasure I had felt in my life, like the world was one. We had tried to get out of the water but couldn't. It was the most challenging feat, to actually step out of the pool. We were joyed when #2 actually did it to get the time. We told him to stay and help us out but he was sucked back in. This pool had power that I had never before seen. 

I came up from below and looked at the blue and white rope with buoys, It started to move and slither amongst itself like a threatened rattlesnake. I almost went berserko, and immediately we all go out. Heading back to the room should have taken 3 - 4 minutes but instead about 30. Getting to the room was like traversing a maze, very confusing. Space was shifting every which way and my teeth were grinding so much they made sparks. A mirror showed my thin body become even more thin and blue and wrinkled, almost like rotting away, not really freaking me out but making me uncomfortable and seeing how frail my mind is; to be incredibly changed by such a small amount of a small chemical.  I quickly turned away and put my shorts in the dryer. 

Damn, this is weird.  Everything I look at is funny, the ashes of pot look like fleas running away, and it is so freaking dark. I took a walk by myself outside; the grass was cool-wet and I felt like a ball of energy, the size of my fist, where my heart would be with two wires attached to my eyes; Hovering. Like Emerson on once wrote, I become a transparent eyeball. This was at 12:00 am and I still had six hours left.

We took a walk and the trees looked like plastic; my hand was melting into the colors. As I was walking I felt like I was getting shorter, then things would jolt and Id be walking again. Then I started to taste the colors. It didnt taste like chocolate or cheese, but it was a 5th taste. Like the four are Salt, Sour, Bitter, and Sweet; well Color was a fifth taste, really creamy and smooth. I mostly tasted Red, Green, and Purple. They were trying to mix together but couldnt and constantly swirled. This taste persisted through the night. I was watching an episode of Taxi and it didnt make any sense. I didnt know what was going on. More mental hallucinations were seeing time. A wave with crests and troughs, and the part that was tripping was smeared everywhere. All three of us also had the urge for something. I want something, said #3. We all agreed but didnt know what we wanted. 

All was pretty much the same for the rest of the night. I guess I fell asleep at around 6:00 am and woke at 10:00 am. It didnt feel like I had slept at all, just missing time. I have to say, I will always remember this, although it was really screwed up, I have had more pleasant trips. This just felt as if some sinister force was controlling it, controlling my mind. I guess that would be my society. We later came to the decision that what we wanted was to be sober. Thank God for that.

LSD






Back in the spring of '90, I was attending Drexel University in Philadelphia , and my roommate and I decided to drop, along with a few buddies who lived up the hall from us. (This during a period of my life where I had just finished having a slew of, not bad, but rather unpleasant trips) This was my roommate's second trip, my 100th? (lost count) Anyway, we were engaged in wide and diverse activities, like staying in our dorm room and watching TV to the music of Floyd . Anyway, my roommate and I got antsy and left in his car. He felt fine to drive a short distance, he said, so we drove to Fairmont Park. Now, this was about 3 hours into the trip or so, and around 1:00 in the morning. Anyway, the two buddies had headed to Fairmont Park, and we looked for them. Feeling *really* paranoid, because of some shifty characters parked next to our car who kept staring at us. I'm not rascist, but perhaps they were, and they were black, I'm white. 

Anyway, we left our cars, and climbed a rock formation which has a car underpass under it, and overlooks the river. The lights reflected off the water twinkling with the currents, providing some real good eye candy. Anyway, we sat up there and smoked a bowl or two, and were watching the night sky, wondering where our buddies were, (and I was paranoid about getting mugged, even though we had gone there a lot before) when we noticed what the clouds were doing. Even though it was dark out, we could see the clouds and they were forming right before our eyes. I have seen this once before straight, but it was nothing like this...on acid, they kept forming cartoony shapes, like the Escher dragons biti ng each other's tails, etc., etc. Extremely intense. 

Anyway, my roommate asked me what I saw, and what I described to him (as it was happening) was exactly what he saw. That made it really cool. So he then described what he was seeing, as it occurred, and I was delighted to find that I *was* seeing what he saw, bu t it was not suggestion, because I knew what I saw before he described it. All in all a really weird experience, but I guess you had to be there. Anybody who' s tripped before should be able to relate to it.

Anyway, later on that night, back at the dorm, our buddies met up with us, and they related to us quite a story. They had gone to Fairmont Park, but further upriver. They had had beer with them, too. (Don't know why--alcohol is a waste of time on LSD) So they were feeling esp. paranoid when a cop car drove by once on the highway with its lights on, then circled back, because he had seen them, and parked and came over to them. They hid their pot and beer real quick and *tryed* to sober up. Anyway, the cop asked them if they had seen anyone suspicious because someone further along the river had been stabbed earlier by a black man. The real kicker on this story is that two black guys had been in the same area as my friends, but when the cop car pulled up, one hid under a car, and another ran into the woods. AND they had come from the same direction that the cop had said the incident occurred. The cop suggested rather strongly that my buddies should leave the park, and this was one incident where my friends felt that a cop's advice meant something.

(liquid)






LSD is the most amazing physocactive wonder in the entire world. It is a marvel that helps me and many other create a world in there mind that is different from the outside world and one that one can live out all there dreams and nightmares for that matter. 

I had one of the most wonderful experiances of my life on the wonderful drug of LSD. My dosage was 5 liquid hits and I am at shame to admit my age of only 15 years old with such strong drug experiances. Me and a friend of mine named D. Bought 4 sugar cubes two for each of us. My friend in the car put 5 liquid hits on two cubes (2 on one, 3 on the other) at 12:45 AM. I went home and immediately me and D. dosed all of the hits. 

It was a over an hour before I started to take any notice and I didn't even take notice until after smoking a boul out of 'big red' properley titled because of it size and after my favorite football team the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Then we went upstairs and started playing a multi-player game on my Nintendo 64 and then it started to begin. 

I had the most intense feeling to kill everyone in the game. I started shooting anyone and everyone while watching light spectrums on the big screen zooming in and out. I saw tracers fly past every bullet. My heart pounded. After about 25 more mintues I started my very long peak. At which point things got very interesting. 

This is 100% fact and is in no way shape or form made up. It began with seeing players from the game in the house. I was starting to feel as if I was in the game and I had a gun of my own. I then without any reason at all stuck my face to the tv and for about an hour I thought I was in the game. My friend D. told me I was sitting the whole time but in my mind I would fly around corners shooting my bullets with tracers golare. 

When I got hit with a bullet I could almost feel it in my body. I started to get upset and started to go insane. Running all over the map shooting anyone and everyone who opposed me. I begain screaming wildly. I remember once I was being chased so bad I aimed the gun at my head and pulled the trigger four times. Each time I could feel the bullet pierce my skin but when I checked nothing had happened. I turned around fell over and began to throw up humungous chunks. I thought I was dying in real life or at least something bad was going to happen. I came down to my computer and wrote the following lines.

'As I sit here I feel as if I am going insane. I see visions of blood, god, warriors and war. I cannot escape it and I fear I will be in this world for the rest of my physcotic life'

I know not all what I went through. I have been through very much for my age. In my opinion, LSD is the drug that will help anyone deal with anything.

I have had acid a number of times before, and since, this night but this was probably the most intense experience. I was between 16 and 18 years of age and already experienced in taking acid. 

A few friends and myself had procured some acid from a friend of a friend. They were delivered to us by the friend with the notion that they were 'double dip' and would therefore cost more (around £4.50 rather than £3), however I was told that they would not be double the strength but still stronger than a single dose. As it turned out I have had 3 1/2 blotters and not tripped out to this degree.

One of my friends parents were going away for the night so him and his sister threw a party.  Myself and a few other friends took the acid in a nearby house and then headed over to the party straight away. Now Ive had acid that has taken 3 hours to come up, but normally it takes an hour or two. However this time it felt as if we were coming up on the walk round, which was only 10 minutes at the most.

We arrived at the house to find that the Parents had not yet left. We were invited in and handed drinks. The father of the house was sitting watching a chess tournament on tv. By this time I was definitely feeling the effects and struggling to hold on. Glances at the rest of the group confirmed that they were feeling the same. My friends father started talking us through the game explaining how the two players had played each other fifteen years before and had replicated the first ten moves of that match in some kind of elaborate mind game. This was just a bit more than I could stand. After a while (god knows how long, I certainly dont) the parents left and the night progressed. The party filled up and became very hectic. 

Its a haze now but I remember laughing constantly and uncontrollably for a long while. After a point I wanted to phone home and tell my parents that I would be staying out tonight because like a fool I hadnt thought ahead and made excuses. Being apocalyptically tripping I didnt want to use the phone in the house as I thought that people would play pranks on the other extension and there was no way was my mind flexible enough to cope with such high jinks. The idea came to me to walk to the nearest phone box, which was at the end of the street outside a string of shops. I asked for volunteers for my journey but none were forthcoming. After a period of trying to string enough sentences together to convince someone to go I decided to make the walk alone.

Reaching the payphone was suprisingly easy however it was already taken. This small setback seemed like a huge blow to my ambitions of making a phone call. Not wanting to hang around outside the shops, due to intense feelings of self-consciousness bordering on paranoia, I decided to go into a shop to waste a few moments of time. Stumbling into a off-licence I was hit by the bright fluorescent lights. I walked in squinting to see the local nutter in there being served. The man had hassled myself and a friend previously, after another acid night, on the walk home. He didnt seem violent at all but was random, insistent and intrusive (at least last time he was).  Putting my head down pretended to be intensely interested in some crisps. The nutter left and I managed to stagger out of the shop with a drink.

I returned to the payphone to find it still full. It seemed like a long time in the shop so thinking that it was getting very late, and being a bit on edge from dealing with the ! experience alone, I decided to walk even further to another payphone which was at a junction of 5 side roads. 
I headed of down the road peering into the distance. I could see the first 20 or so yards reasonably clearly however after that it was a bit of a haze. As I focused it seemed as if the road repeated those first 20 yards endlessly into the distance. I had been walking now for what seemed like a long time and still couldnt see the end. Suddenly I was standing at the end of the road. It opened in to a concrete clearing on which 5 roads sprang from similar in design to a cannabis leaf. I had walked down what I though  was the diagonal road second from the right, When I emerged however I was on the horizontal far right road. This confusion shocked me deeply. I just couldnt get my head round the juxtaposition of which road I thought I should have merged from and where I was standing. After what felt like an eternity I managed to map the area in my mind and convince myself that I hadnt flipped realities or teleported or whatever I thought was going down. 

I then proceeded onto the telephone call home. I struggled to recollect the number but finally managed to punch in something I thought was a close approximation. A womens voice answered and I didnt recognise it. Rather than explain wrong number and hang up, I was so disjointed I made a couple of inarticulate sounds and hung up. As soon as the phone disconnected I realised that it was my mothers voice that I had just hung up on. Now in some kind of panic I struggled to find any small change and just flung in the first coin I had. I managed against the mental randomness to explain to my mother that I was staying out, I was very drunk, it was me on the last call I and had dropped the phone.

Task done I headed back to the party. As I walked back my mind, which had been taken up completely by the logistics of the phone call, began to truly wander and I realised that I couldnt remember How old I was, what day it was, whether I was in school, sixth form or whatever. I couldnt recollect if it was the holidays or just a normal weekend. When I tried to think of my life up to this night it seemed like abstract templates and half notions that wouldnt stay still and definite. Through a Herculean effort I managed to sweep aside such concerns and returned to the party.

The difference between the dark and still night outside to the party inside was quite extreme. A constant background murmuring of noise, activity in almost every square inch of my visual axis, and random detached snatches of conversation drifting across my consciousness. The contrast wasnt helped by a prank it seemed everyone in the party had decided to play on me, which was to shout my name at me as I walked in to the main lounge. The sight of dozens of faces all pissed some tripping looking at you and shouting your name while tripping yourself was not pleasant, but it was a surprise.

I managed after a short while to get back into the rhythm of the party and enjoyed myself for the next few hours. However the drama had not finished yet. I was sitting outside with a few friends in the back garden. One of their friends, who I hardly new, was a bit of a ruffian. He had also had the acid and was going a bit mental. He was talking constantly to the group pacing the garden. The group listened to him and laughed occasionally. I laughed along with the group politely while looking for an excuse to leave as it was obvious that this guy was losing it and could turn violent. Whether he could sense my uncomfortableness  or just didnt like the look of me I dont know, he suddenly stared at me and asked what I was laughing at. Were there was laughter it fell into intense silence. It is hard to explain the sudden dropping feeling that came over me as he made his challenge. There was laughter and a warm fuzzy feeling, then suddenly a deep dropping sensation, silence, a sudden sharp coldness, and a feeling that I was on the spot and had to respond as a failure to could result in violence, to me by him. This sudden flip of events shocked me so severely that I could only manage that I was laughing at nothing. This didnt help matters much and it was only the intervention of mutual friends which calmed the mad fucker down. I left the garden and went inside. I managed to brush of the confrontation and enjoy the rest of the night. The ruffian later apologised for the outburst.

Sorry for the length, it has actually been quite cathartic typing out the experiences. It is hard to truly recall the feeling of being on LSD.  Even recalling this night, which is one of the clearest memories I have on LSD, seems like telling the story of the story and not the actual events themselves.

Dear fellow trippers

1 1/2 weeks ago my friend David and I had an extremely traumatic experience which I am sure will make all of you even more convinced that the police are a bunch of fucking bastards and that the system (wherever you are) stinks to high heaven.

But first let me tell you about the circumstances of this experience. 5 days earlier I went to a huge rave (about 6000 people) in Cape Town, South Africa (where I live and where this whole story is set) ; I dropped a cap of acid and had the most uplifting, euphoric experience of my life. There were no fantastic visuals or anything - in fact 4 rfiends had caps from the same batch and said they were practically duds. Anyway , my trip was so good that I thought I must be the luckiest person out of all the thousands of people there ; I won't go into much more detail about it cause there are no words to appropriately describe what I had experinced. The point of this is that when it came to the trip Dave and I were to have later that week, I *knew* that it would be good; I was still basking in the glory of the one at the rave.

This was also to be our first trip outside of clubs or raves ,so I was nervous but excited with anticipation. The night before we went to a club to buy the acid - we only got one cap to split between us, but this was a double-dipped silver surfer flown in fresh from Amsterdam that afternoon, so we presumed we had made a prety good purchase.

Now for the main part of the story. The next evening Dave and I went to the shopping complex at the cape Town waterfront and bought tickets for the animated film Pocahontas. At 5.15 we went into the cinema and dropped our half-tabs. Half an hour and that lovely tingling feeling we know so well began. After an hour or so I was getting very restless and sucking furiously on the lollypop I had. But I was determined to follow the plot of the movie right to the end and in fact I did - despite sometimes getting lost in arbitary little details of the animation, and becoming aware that the walls around me were changing colour.

Then the movie ended and... bang! pow! ..the trip kicked in so hard I didnt know what hit me! We could hardly get out of our seats cause everything was so fucked up. When we made it outside the archway with pictures on the walls was warping hectically and I felt warm with pleasure and weirdness. Dave and I needed to go for a piss and when I stood at the urinal I thought peeing was the funniest stupidest thing in he world. We then proceeded to walk around the shopping centre, amazed at the wonderful sights and sounds that hit us. There was a funny old dude playing the piano- this sounded like the most hectic happy hardcore we'd ever heard. I watched David's lollypop pulsating while he told me that he was seeing it leave long trails when he waved it around.

We took a stroll outside where it was really cold, so decided to go to the car to fetch our jackets. At the parking lot there was a security guard who seemed to be watching our every move. Now in the car we had a couple of joints waiting for us (this was to be yet another first for us - smoking up while peaking on acid) but I said to Dave that we'd better leave that for now because the security guard was making me a bit nervous... she was looking straight at us and talking into her radio... I didn't want any cops to come roaming around looking for someone like us to pounce on. So anyway we left the car and I forgot about being worried and continued to enjoy my superb trip.

We headed for the BMW pavilion where they have luxury cars hanging from the ceiling - this was intensly amusing - and clean , smooth decor ,polished floors etc which was very pleasing to look at. But of course we wanted some more adventure, so we headed back towards the shopping centre... when we came to cross a road I remarked to Dave that I could feel the sounds of the passing cars deep within me, but all he could do was burst out laughing in reply.

Back at the shopping centre we went into a sweet shop filled with millions of brightly colored sweets; I somehow managed to buy a long stick of gum and when we came out of the shop I just began playing with it in my hands cause I didnt know what else you were supposed to do with it ; I also marvelled ( and laughed my head off) at how I had actually managed to acquire this gum.

We walked into a shop that we just couldnt understand; it had a whole lot of interestig-looking stuff with people looking very interested in everything, so we tried to look interested but simply couldnt. So we walked out and just strolled around feeling like we were about to explode with energy any second, every now and then closing eyes to see everything rushing towards us and expecting (and wanting ) to be swallowed up by the ground at any moment. We went into a bookstore which had the most unbelievably brightly coloured magazines, toys, books, stationery, floor, ceiling , shelves, etc. I saw other people looking interested in the things people are normally interested in looking at, like magazines and cd's , so I tried to do the same to look a bit normal; but trying to concentrate on anything just made me more inclined to stare at the stupidest things, like blank paper, pencils, etc.

We sat on a bench in the middle of the complex where we could just watch evereything happening around us. I said to Dave that it looked like people were all walking leaning to the side, so he told me that he could tell what type of people they were by the way they walked. 

After a bit more walking around feeling very amused with ourselves, we decided to go out to the car to get the dope that was waiting for us. On the way to the parking lot I remembered the gum, so we proceedede to stuff our mouths with the stuff ...a thoroughly satisfying experience. Once inside the car Dave noticed that same bitch of a security guard staring at us from some distance, so we just remained calm and chilled out for a while, enjoying the gum and the pictures behind our closed eyes. After a while we got out adn opened the boot to get the joints... we were planning on goin for a walk towards a darker area so that we could smoke them without being seen, but at this moment there were still a few too many peolpe around so we sat in the front of the car again chewing furiously on the gum and laughing and carrying on like complete loonies. 

Eventually we couldn't contain oursselves any longer - we just *had* to smoke. So we decided that we would walk to the exit of the parking lot and along the road that lead out of there towards Sea Point (a suburb) - this was a dark and quiet road and we thought it would be okay to smoke as we walked along. Before we got out of the car, I was agonizing over what to do with my gum, cause I didnt want to smoke with it ins my mouth but it was so good that I had to save it for later; so I was immensely pleased with myself when I left this huge glob perched on top of the steering wheel.

We got out of the car with our joints in our pockets and went round to the back to put something (can't remember what) in the boot. As we were getting ready to close the boot and move on, I noticed a police van drive slowly past... it then stopped almost directly opposite us and when I looked at the driver our eyes locked in one terrifying moment. We started walking away and I saw out of the corner of my eye the reverse lights of the van come on and it backed slowly after us. I was now panicking . I _knew_ that the cops were now onto us and I was desperate to get away to avoid being arrested for being in possesion of dope. We were going towards the exit of the parking lot now and I couldn't understand why Dave was so calm about all of this - didn't he know that the cops were about to get us? I tried to tell him to head back towards the shopping centre where we could get lost in the crowd, but he was just asking dumb questions about what direction we would take to Sea Point. I realized that it must be the trip thats making me paranoid (this happend on a previous trip - where I became terrified and it turned out to be my imagination ; when I realised this ,the trip turned into one of the best I'd ever had )

So with difficulty, I followed Dave's lead and continued walking with him. But I couldn't shake this feeling of fear, especially after walking past yet another cop van (although this one was empty)... all the goodness of the trip up to now had been converted into gut-wrenching panic; I was acutely aware that we were being watched - particularly by the police. I heard voices which I sensed were talking about how to get us. As we left the parking lot and started along that dark road I was sure I saw that same van circling the area from which we had just come, and I was expecting it -and other cops - to come and get us at any moment now. I thought about getting rid of the dope now while we still had the chance, but then I saw how cool and collectde Dave looked adn I thought he would think I was silly to waste perfectly good joints. 

I desperately tried to hang onto the rationallity that seemed to come to Dave so easily, but the more I did so the more I thought about how we were walking straight into a carefully laid trap... I thought about going to prison and my 'normal' friends and the rest ofsociety condemning me; I thought about how I would bring shame to my parents and relatives - and also how I had just blown my chance to continue with the fun , free life I had been living at this time, though this idea seemed insignificant in contast with the shit we were getting ourselves into at this very moment. All this time though there was a slender thread of hope I could still cling to - the knowledge that I was, after all, tripping and I could be compleely freaked out because of that alone.

This thread of hope disappeared completely when the cop van drove up and stopped beside us. Oh fuck! My heart was pounding. The guy in the van talked to us in a very strange way. He was telling us something about people breaking into cars in the parking lot and he wanted to check if ours was okay. In between sentences he was speaking into his radio saying '... we've got two guys here...' or something like that... I knew that we were being stalled while backup cops were being called. He was asking us where we were going and why we would park our car at the Waterfront if we were going to Sea point. I was glad that Dave was still calm enough to handle the situation. He was acting innocent and seemed to be speaking very sensibly, so I let him do all the talking - later I found out that Dave actually had _no idea_ what was going on cause he was so tripped out - meanwhile I was (even in my petrified state) very impressed and relieved that he was putting on such a good act. Dave suggested we walk back to the parking lot; the cop agreed with this - aparently Dave had the idea all the time that this cop was actually tryig to help! So back we headed ,and what does this dickhead of a cop do? He follows slowly at about 20 metres behind us, headlights watching every movement we make. I was saying to Dave 'how the hell are we going to get rid of this dope?' Despair. We couldn't drop it now - the cop would see. 

Then Dave turned round and stopped walking. By this time he had also become suspicious but luckily wasnt nearly as freaked out as I was. The fucking bastard then sped up to us so quickly and stppped so close that he almost knocked us down. He told us to hop in and as he rolled slowly by and I realised that we would be heading straight back in his van I took the opportuniy to slip th ejoint out of my pocket and let it fall silently to the ground. Walking round the back of the van to the passenger side I noticed with horror that Dave hadn't yet got rid of his. I whispered loudly 'drop it, drop it!' and just before he climbed in the van he too had flicked away the joint.

We sped quickly back to the parking lot where the cop dropped us off ,only to be greeted by another one of the jerks. This one also began asking stupid questions and trying to get us to give ourselves away by not knowing where 'our' car was - meantime the first idiot had dropped us in a parking lot with hundreds of cars; it would take anyone a few moments to get their bearings and work out were they had parked. At first I was babbling incoherently back at this second cop, fully aware that he would think I was acting very suspiciously, but then I thought: now wait a minute! we're safe now. Fuck the stupid cop. I angrily showed him the keys which I took from my pocket (unfortunately I didnt have the wit at that moment to also tell him to shove his head up his ass) and went to the car - which Dave had now found - an loudly demonstrated how the key fitted the lock perfectly.

At this point I noticed with disbelief that the lump of gum I had left on the steering wheel was gone ; I was now *convinced* that while the cops had happily kept us stalled out on that dark road, they were busy searching our car for drugs. I was shocked and relieved that we had in fact had the dope with us out there and not left it in the car... it turned out , however, that this whole idea was just fantasy (the gum had dropped to the floor of the car) but this idea did contribute to the rush of thoughts and contemplation I had a short while later while we were sitting down outside the shopping centre again trying to get over this ordeal.

What I thought about and discussed with Dave, while I awas physically shaking and feeling very nervous and fragile, was how it is so crazy and unfair that the police and society consider us to be criminals - I mean , if someone asks me if I have comted a crime I'll say no, but according to the law I should have been put in jail long ago. Why is it that taking drugs is offensive when it harms no one (not even the user, if he is not stupid about it) ; if I was in another group of friends I might have been into drinking gallons of beer. But of course this is _fine_, and even encouraged in society! And then theres the police. It seems that they are just out to harass us; when they were watching us in that parking lot they just decided that two young guys just having fun must be up to something that posed a danger to society! Yeah, right!

Anyway , all this thinking was getting me extremely distressed, so we went to the CD store and listened to some music through headphones to try to get ourselves up again. Somehow Dave managed to get his trip gooing well again but when I closed my eyes while listening to the music I saw frightening images of people all around me watching me and I could sense their suspicion ofme. The music did help slightly, not by relaxing me, but by giving me a sense of familiarity, of something I knew and liked. I felt a little more comforable.

When we left that store all remaining traces of my trp, except for a feeling of nervousness, vanished. Dave was still having a good time - the experience had obviously not affeced him as harshly as it had affected me - which made me feel more and more pissed off, as the evening wore on , that the cops had done me out of a perfectly good trip.

Well, thats the end of this story... right now it is perhaps too soon after this experience to have learnt anything from it; I am still feeling really resentful and feel that I have an unfinished trip that I have to make up sometime. I won't go on preaching my views now... you can take what message you will from this story.

three great things that go great together.

it was most likely a fairly irresponsible thing to do, but since I was tandem I didn't fret about it. Would definitly not recommend doing this if you've never jumped or are doing a solo.

The entire afternoon that I was out at the jump site was amazing. the sky was filled with an almost snow-like scene, except every speck was alive and moving with the music coming from some guy's car stereo. Whenever a parachutist would come down, the specks would seem to glide out of the way and then slowly refill the void.

the actual jump was beyond explanation. when the airplane door opened at 9000' it was like I was transported back in time and was being born. an almost ethereal peace settled over me and then I let go of the plane's strut and floated off. At this point it was almost a mental and emotional overload as every part of me tried to come to grips with weightlessness and seeing the ground so far away with the wind rushing by at seemingly supersonic speeds. the sunset created the best visuals I've ever experienced before. the rays were racing around the clouds and intertwining with each other creating beautiful landscapes in the sky. when the chute opened the entire scene shifted again to something almost pastoral. greens became really deep and livid and the river was undulating across my field of vision. every aspect of my vision seemed alive and moving with graceful motions. the touch down was extremely soft and pleasant and my body became a part of the field and everything seemed to be cheering and clapping and generally being excited by the whole affair.

that explanation doesn't really do justice to the experience, but it's always good to share good trips in some way. has anyone else done something similar with good results? again, I wouldn't recommend doing something like this, but it just so happened that I did it. wasn't planned at all, it just came together to create one of the best trips I've ever had.

'Having read _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_ numerous times, and given that I was planning a trip to Vegas to meet some old college buddies for a weekend, I decided that I'd try a hit before boarding the plane. Having only done this 2 previous times, there was a bit of nervousness. Many thoughts of losing it and running rampant through the plane with drool spilling from my lips were streaming through my mind, but I decided that it would be worth the effort. It was. I'd highly recommend this, especially if you are an experienced intrepid traveller. I had no problems on the plane. Was over whelmed with the flight, the earth below, and the sunset that I got to experience on the flight into LV.

It began with a glorious flight down the Oregon and California coast. The teeny-tiny patterns in the ocean waves were trigger enough for many a visual explosion. Highly intellectual journey as well. I was reading some book on philosophy at the time and was blown away. Landed in San Jose and actually had to have the wits about myself to switch planes. All went well. It was tough at times to keep from breaking out in uncontrollable laughter, but eventually was seated on the window again for the final leg of my journey. The desert and the mountains were just gorgeous from 30,000 feet, and the sunset was indescribable, not to mention the vision of the strip as we circled around to land. The rest of the evening was a really good time, but the flight in was one of the most incredible experiences of my life. I'm damn glad I did it.'

I was sitting in the living room listening to Pink Floyd's first album, The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, when I first noticed a slight change in atmosphere. The walls in my small but high-tech hovel, seemed to start undulating as if they actually breathed with a life of their own. I was startled at first but quickly realized that this must be a direct result of the natural inspiration in which I had imbibed. I slowly floated into a kind of separate reality, construed of a nature totally unknown to me before, but yet, so real. Or at least so it seemed to me at the time. I recalled vague, complicated words written by Aldous Huxley in his treatise on mescaline.... The Doors Of Perception. Chairs and curtains, I KNEW what he meant. The lines, the shapes, the colour. These thoughts all came to me and meandered about and through my head like fleeting spirits from beyond reason. Thats when I realized that profound changes were taking place inside my very head. I was never to be the same again I thought, this is the end all of end alls. This is the key to that realm that has always just been out of reach, just outside of my limited perception. It was as Huxley had said, the flood gates had been opened. I searched in vain for a reason but all reason had floated away like the smoke from my cigarette. My ego had died. My SELF had dissolved into an effervescent cauldron of teeming geometrics. I was one with all. To me, that brought great peace, no fear, and no reason to reason. It was if a great burden had been lifted from my shoulders, I was free. And in that instant I realized, we all are free. It always has been and always will be a matter of perception. And we hold the key.

THE PEAK 
I had reached a peak, a plateau of sparkling clarity and conciousness. The world was sound, a vibrating molecular dance from the infinitesimally small to the infinitesimally vast, deeper than anything I'd ever imagined. I looked out the window and saw machine clouds churning through an endless sky. I saw light and colour and vacillating patterns possessed of an indescribable essence. I realized that the room and world around me were alive and that all things spring from the Divine Ground. This must have been what the ancients felt when they spoke of the Great Spirit and in my minds eye, I could almost see an old shaman standing by his fire, arms outstretched to the heavens, with spirits dancing all around him, in the shadows... 

There is ancient wisdom and knowledge here, something that prescinds the truths we've come to accept in this civilization we've built around us. Something that transcends dogma, religion, culture, all the established ways and mores of society. And for a time I'm ecstatic about being apart of and witness to this deeper truth. I found myself wishing everyone could glimpse this ...path, this window. Surely no one could go through this experience and not come out of it a little more fulfilled or centered, a little more whole...

There is also a certain amount of fear here. This I found on introspection, to be inevitable considering the complexities and fear that pervades the world around us. But it didn't last, ecstatic communion and hope won out as I realized that I held the key to keep, or let go of, the fears that I possessed. Like I said before, it's only a matter of perception...

My intention was to return to that rather frightening but nonetheless undeniably intriguing place where I had been on my last trip... yes, that bizarre 'brain wrapped around the universe' mode. This time I was equipped with a greater degree of understanding of the place, due in part to conversations I had had, and in part to my own realizations in integrating the details of the last trip.

Only 2 hits of LSD this time... but it was quite enough. Again, the start time was late at night. I lie in bed. My brain and body thought that they were preparing for a night's sound sleep... heh heh, little did they know. Shortly, I began to stretch out in my bed, much as a dragon would awaken at the scent of battle. I felt the wind. Not the physical wind in the atmosphere, but the psychic wind that permeates all things (of which more later).....it swept through me, awakening with a tingle the dormant energy within me. I began to writhe in its glorious unearthly currents. The visuals emerged, separating out from their usual role as scaffolding in the structure of reality, and exposing themselves for my manipulation. They were part of ME. It wasn't long before I was again the conductor of an alien orchestra... the orchestra of my brain. I literally swept the LSD visuals into their structure as the representation of my brain... or else they assembled themselves.

My first reaction was a sense of horror -- because I had forgotten the hellish feeling of Metaphysical Emptiness I had associated with this before.. the feeling (which I tried to describe in another report) that All is an empty illusion, and the only truly existing thing was just a brain/thought process that happened to be in a particular configuration in the pre-determined cycle. Instead of seeing the world, I saw the underlying reality behind the world, namely, the amorphous tissue behind the retina -- a total deconstruction of reality into the ugly, raw input. I was a mere detail, a mere surface expression of this inevitable program. But this time it made some sense that it hadn't really made before-- I knew I didn't have to get locked into a one-dimensional thought process (in which you can only do two things... go toward the light or away from it).

Instead of 'me' being trapped inside heavy folds of brain tissue, my brain was laid out before me like the keys of a vast piano. My room was my brain. And my body was also my brain. Through the cells in my body I could feel the thoughts in my head and orchestrate the vision 'in my room', because the room was also in my head. I could also see my thoughts in the room, as if they were located in various places in my brain. 

For the next few hours I explored my brain as if it were physical territory. I thought.... my God, it is so dirty in here. How could I even see correctly with all this gunk here? It occurred to me that cleaning it out would clear up my perception of reality.

There are places in the brain that correspond to the various emotions. Love and hope and joy are up above... I reached upward with my mind and instantly, I was a fountain of light, bursting with joy in all colors, existing as pure, light consciousness. Heaven! But it was very brief.

Pleasure, enthusiasm, aggression... are various places along the forward equator -- responses that propel us forward. To the side, humor, disgust. I did see some pretty disgusting things... in fact I had my first real taste hallucinations -- I tasted bitter rue! It was in a corner of the mind along with hair (sticky matted stuff like you find in drains and sinks), bubbly purplish snot, and some octopus tentacles. Yuck! But I laughed, because it was SO bad it was funny. I quickly got out of that one by swallowing it and 'recursing' up, up and away.

More places in the brain -- behind is fear, below is despair. I was overcome with fear when I 'went' to that spot, for a moment I was crouched in the corner in terror. But realizing that it was a place that I had gone, just like the love/joy place, made me realize that getting out of fear is simple -- just move up!

When we refer to thoughts and feelings, we like to use physical terms for them... 'sinking feeling', 'really reaching', 'deep thoughts', 'preying on the mind', 'a flash of insight', 'feeling tense'... I know why now... the unconscious mind knows full well what muscular tensions and motions correspond to various kinds of thoughts and emotions, and so 'figurative' language developed in a way that represents an accurate portrayal of these muscle motions. One particularly funny moment was the occurrence of dawn. Not just any dawn (in fact it was 3 am), but the Archetypal Dawning Moment, the dawn of a new age, I had finally 'awakened', something had 'dawned' on me. I felt that each awakening was a reconstruction of self-aware consciousness, a miniature echo of creation.

In the brain, there are various closets and broom cupboards and unswept corners and attics. One can get into quite a cleaning frenzy, opening up old trunks and so on. Typically what I found was cliches and habits and instinctual behavior. All the ingredients of personality. I found that 'reaching' physically and 'reaching' in the mind are the same. All the time on acid I find myself reaching with my right arm for things, especially my glasses, whenever I want to reassert my intellectual hold on the situation. Now I see why! That's my left brain 'reaching' into the right brain and rummaging around -- that's my way of visualizing the process of connecting unconscious symbols with conscious intellectual ideas. I started to realize what dreaming is... literally, housekeeping. All of that stuff there in the corners exists in symbolic form.

The archetypes are back there. Those symbols have not just been collecting dust all this time, either. I have been associating things to them constantly all my life, actually, probably eons beyond my present life. Snakes, for example. I saw them there, in a corner. The archetypal reptile. But this time, I made a connection to these snakes that brought them out of the closet of the unconscious mind and into consciousness. These snakes were kundalini energy, the Serpent Power. And what was the serpent power? It was the control of brain muscle. Here I had been storing all this occult symbolism for centuries, and just now I was making the connection between all that occult symbolism and an internally perceivable mind-state. These connections were thrilling to the mind... the mind which keeps everything around, knowing that one day, connections can be made between everything.

That is what I felt the last time, but didn't understand. I saw or felt, as I was turning my body, shoelaces (karmic threads) being vacuumed up and disappearing. A sense of recursive levels of a deeply nested function all finally collapsing and producing a result. These recursive levels went back for eons. I realized what karma is -- unconnected bits and pieces that need to be connected. The mind is on a continual quest for knowledge (spiritual growth), to make connections between ideas. That quest is necessarily repetitive, trial and error. A single experience of deep connection with the spirit might wrap up years and years of karma. Certainly the awakening of kundalini and the understanding of powers of the body hitherto unknown had this effect. Certainly the penetration of the light of consciousness, with its scientific training, into the depth of the unconscious, enabled the unconscious to make connections it couldn't make all by itself. And likewise, I the conscious mind made some connections that I couldn't make all by myself. These connections are visualizable as threads in the cosmic fabric... the ego and the id are relentless knitters, tying this fabric into a sensible reality. The mind is literally obsessed with reality and truth... obsessed with a need to know. So obsessed that it is willing to risk insanity or death to discover its true nature. Self-awareness is the process of connecting inner states to outer states, where those outer states are also a part of oneself.

I become strangely 'inverted'... outer and inner reality were somehow reversed. I could 'see' my brain 'out there' (even though it looks like ordinary reality for the most part, I 'knew better'), and it was kind of hard to make sense of ordinary tactal input. I think there was something weird about left/right being reversed that confused me. I was lost inside the brain and didn't know where the eyeholes were. I was locked into perceiving oneself as a brain and I couldn't figure out how to turn myself back 'outside-out'. I spent many minutes trying to figure out how my cat was able to exist inside my brain there with me. I thought it was because she was actually projecting herself into my thoughts. I also was a bit concerned that I would have cat hairs in my brain.

I could hear some slooshing sounds (brain gloop sloshing around) and felt nauseous when I stretched my brain a lot. Also, it was a sore afterwords for a day or so, so I really do think I was using those muscles.

If this sounds rather frightening, it is! At first I felt a great sense of power...... ah, I can direct everything from here! One quickly realizes that this is more of a responsibility than a power. I thought: I'm not qualified for this! Allowing the unconscious to become conscious might not be a good idea... this is like promoting someone with no experience (the ego) to a job they aren't qualified for... but which for the Id is old hat... routine, even dull.

The biggest danger is the panic reaction. Don't Panic! The unconscious is still operating, so just letting go of the ego is the answer here. I had the idea (the same fallacious idea I had the first time) that the only way to recover normal reality was to retrace my steps... this is wrong. Normal reality is a natural state of affairs... simply allowing normal reality to return, having 'faith' that everything is O.K., and not worrying about it, is necessary here. Going toward the light does work. Light is input from out there, and restores ones orientation to the world outside.

Again I went back to the deep loop in which my thought cycles through God, free will, time.... although this time I had some idea what I was after. I was testing the limits of my model of reality. This is where it hurts. This is where my model of reality is really strained. It has some gaps in it, and the gaps are connected with God, free will, , and time. I write in there, because there is something nameless in that list of four things that keeps recurring in my thoughts as a sub-linguistic concept. Because I haven't named it, I can't really even consciously understand what I am representing by it. It may have something to do with 'soul' or 'psyche'. I learned a quite a bit this time (I can talk about it in another message)... I discovered that a lot of what I associate with the word 'God' is part of me (a 'higher self' or the id, or something). I'll write up some of my other insights in another message.

After giving in and trusting the natural functioning of the body, I regained some sense of normality, and was able to appreciate the brain aspect of awareness as a dual form of awareness (although I am still a bit confused about some of the details as to how outer reality maps into inner reality). I spent some time getting more comfortable with this new way of experiencing part of my body (and mind). I realized how I don't really know how to operate my whole body, and I am just learning how, like an infant. I experienced myself as biomorphic protoplasm, an organized aggregate that has organs that extend into the world of 'mind' as well as the world of 'body.' Just as the skin protects the body from physical invaders, there is also a membrane that separates Self and Other in the realm of mind. It is the job of self-aware consciousness to stitch together these two membranes (the physical membrane includes the eyes and ears) -- this stitching is the re-creation of the perceived universe.

The descriptions of kundalini awakening seemed to describe what I had experienced, and I agree with Gopi Krishna's assessment of it... it is a force that pushes evolution forward. I wouldn't be surprised if 'the kundalini force' turns out to be a psychoactive chemical that can flow in the nerves.

It was towards the end of my freshmen year of high school. (It had been a year of many changes for me.) I had gone to an all boys private school in 7th and 8th grade where I was miserable. They were rich,shallow and boring. I was middle class,laid back and energetic. When I finally returned to Hanover County public schools from my two year exile, I was enthralled. I made up for everything I had missed. I partied, I got drunk, smoked weed, hung out with girls every chance I got and felt good. My many experiences of being intensely stoned stimulated my already curious, creative and active imagination. I found the 'distortions' of senses thrilling. But I wanted a more intense experience. 

So one night in drivers ed i happened to speak to a dealer. The next night i was presented with 10 tabs of what he reffered to as wizard of oz. A friend and I ate five each on night with a little campfire in a field next to his house at 12:00. We sat there talking for a while not knowing what to expect. At first I felt like a child finding everything novel and entertaining. Eventually, the giggling turned into occasional bouts of intense staring and engrossing visual images. 'My' old world was transmogrifying into Jung's archetype's and the Buddhist void. Little cognition was involved in my activities and events are difficult to recall. (Probably because it is state dependent) We went for a walk to the other end of the field. We suddenly stopped as the darkness felt like liquid enveloping us and reading our every thought. The usual field was now a horizontal cliff which frightened us even though we still can't recall why. Perhaps it was fear of the unknown or a projection of some fear embedded in our conciousness we were not ready to face. Anyways,we unanimously decided to make our way back to our campsite. Our pace became hurried. It felt as if the faster I walked, the faster the 'object' that was back there was coming faster and faster. Regardless,we strained to walk casually. I looked at the ground and my feet to keep focus on the task at hand. An old corn stalk on the ground suddenly turned into a corpse and grabbed my ankle. It finally let go and I hauled back to the warm shelter of the campfire which nestled us from the darkness of the unknown. 

At this point my already racing treadmill of a mind was blazing. It was approx. 2:00 when we had returned to the campfire. We decided to lay down and relax. From there I was taken into depths of undescribable and unforseen places. Were they places of my mind or other demensions I don't know because 'I' was not concious or attentive during the period of 2:30-6:00. The eyes simply observed as my usually racing mind apparently stopped doing and started being. No deadlines, no worries, no emotions, just existnece in as far as I have yet experienced it's purest form. 

When my ego had returned from vacation, my friend and I sat in awe and could only say wow. I felt as if the universe had been passed into the neurons of my brain and engraved in my gentics. Preconscious cellular processes were now understood to me. I could feel the platlets in my blood cells forming. The quick of my fingernails pushing and growing every so slowly. At 8:00 after taking a walk into the woods and playing catch with a water bottle, we went inside to have breakfast. We laughed our balls off at his dad telling old fighing stories and looking at his face still looking like a goblin. I went back home about 9:30 and fought off falling asleep until I gave in and slept for hours. My dreams were strange and acted like an exstension of the trip. When I woke up the next morning I felt refreshed and viewed life in a new aspcet.I also now knew that I could stop my ever nagging mind from bothering me when I needed to, just as wizard of oz had shown me. That experience sparked a burning passion for knowledge, spirituality and a zest for life I sometimes have forgotten in this fast paced and hurried life Americans lead nowadays.

Here is MY story! It was a GREAT TIME!!!!!

Back in the 70's I did acid a few times, but in the ten years since then I had no access to the stuff, nor was I particularly interested because of other pursuits. Recently I have been studying cognitive and neural systems, which has revived my interest in issues of consciousness and perception. I was delighted therefore when a friend offered to share two last hits he had saved in the freezer from the days of his own wild youth. I had vague recollections from ten years ago of weird sensations and hallucinations and I prepared for the 'experiment' with a checklist of questions to myself about my experiences. The questions were in the nature of 'How does the visual world look?' 'How do you experience sounds?' 'can you compute 345/15?' and the like. I looked forward to the experience with great interest and curiosity.

We went to my place that night and made ourselves comfortable, and when things started turning weird, I pulled out my checklist. First of all, the notion of having a checklist seemed at the time to be so hilariously funny that my friend and I were doubled up with laughter for a long long time before I could get to any of the questions seriously. It was a kind of laughter that I havent experienced since childhood, a deep and overwhelming mirth that shook my whole body to the core and tears were streaming down our cheeks as we gasped happily for breath. Each new question occasioned a renewed outburst of helpless laughter until we were thoroughly exhausted.

When I finally got aroud to the questions I discovered a fact that leaves me astounded to this day. I answered every one of the perceptual questions exactly as I would have while stone cold sober. The reason why this was so surprising was that I was actually feeling very very different. In fact I was feeling exceeding peculiar. In fact words cannot express how strange I was feeling, and yet, my sensations of the world around me were exactly as they are normally. So, I asked myself, what is it that is actually different? Well, the sights and sounds and smells were the same. It was my perception of them that was different. This experience gave me a new appreciation for the word perception. Normally we think that if we observe an object, a pencil in your hand for instance, we see exactly that, a pencil, the real pencil, and nothing but the pencil. It came to me that that is not the case. Even when regarding as matter-of-factual an object as a common everyday pencil, we perceive it through a filter of our own perspective, our own view of things. This perspective is normally so ordinary and unremarkable that we are not even aware of it, but it was exactly this perspective, our view of the world around us, that is altered by the drug. It brought my attention to something that I had been totally unaware of although it has been in front of me all my life.

It is somewhat like the experience of intently watching some event unfold before your eyes, and suddenly becoming aware of the fact that you are watching it on television. Shifting your attention from the event itself to the glowing phosphor dots on the screen. You are looking at the same thing, and you are seeing the same thing, but your perception of it has altered radically. Well the same thing was happening to my own senses. Suddenly I was aware of the fact that the world around me is not the real physical world, but only a view of the world as it impinges on my senses. That the image of the pencil is not a pencil, but a pattern of neural activity in my visual cortex. Of course this is no new scientific revelation, I knew that all along. But now I could feel it, I could perceive it in a way that has permanently altered my way of thinking about consciousness.

We went outside for a little walk in the night air, and while walking down the street I got a repeat of that first insight. I had the feeling that instead walking down a real street, I felt as if there was a big spherical screen all around me, with an image of the street projected onto it, and that as I walked the image changed, expanding out in front of me and collapsing back down again behind me. I could look up and see an image of the sky, look down and see my feet pushing the sidewalk backwards. I was stationary, it was the image of the street that was moving. Of course when you think about it, this perceptual 'distortion' is actually more real than the 'normal' perception. My brain, comfortably enthroned in my skull feels nothing of the outside world except through the pattern of activity it receives from the senses. It receives images, sounds, sensations, and pastes each one in its proper place on a sensory sphere that represents the world around me. My perceptual distortion was that instead of seeing the outside world, I was now seeing this sensory sphere, with a sensory image of the world on it. To me this an extremely interesting and exciting insight that I will remember for the rest of my life.

I would see strangers approach along the sidewalk, at first appearing as a little insignificant dot near the expanding focus of my sphere. They would grow and grow until I could see them in great detail before they passed behind and shrank back down to nothing. It was as if each of us posessed his own sensory sphere, and as we approached the spheres would intersect, and I would appear in his sensory world as he appeared in mine. We played a little ritualistic game as we passed, each in turn taking a good look at the other, then politely averting their eyes to allow the other to return the visual examination without making direct eye contact, before hurrying on down the street. It brought to mind an image of dogs presenting themselves in turn for the other to get a good sniff.

We stopped at MacDonalds to get a bite to eat, and never did a big mac taste so good, although it seemed to take an hour to consume it, and I was a little concerned that the other customers might notice the enormous effort I was expending in getting it down. I could feel my tongue and cheeks maneuvering the lumps of food into position on my molars, a few good chomps, then it was pushed down the chute where my esophagus began an elaborate sequence of peristaltic contractions to persuade it down to my stomach. I looked up at my friend between mouthfuls, and his face looked so weird, it is hard to describe. Although visually he looked exactly as he always does, I would become aware of individual components of his face, his nose, his cheek, his eyes, which would trigger a strong response to my senses independant of the rest of the face, so that the impression was somewhat like a cubist painting.

We attempted a few mathematical exercises and found that although we were fundamentally capable, it was difficult to remember which part of the problem you were working on, or to hold interim results in your head. While walking around town I had found it extremely challenging to navigate around the familiar streets of my neighborhood for a similar reason; although I could plan a course, I had some trouble remembering which part of the course we were actually on. We were never in danger of actually getting lost, but we did spend some time discussing where we were and how to proceed. It was a wonderful sensation like exploring a fabled town that you have read about but have never actually visited before. As the hours rolled on by we spent the time playing with a slinky and one of those electrostatic lightning machines, blissfully absorbed in such simple pursuits like two children playing with toys. Our conversation disintegrated to short meaningless sentences. I would say something like 'The quality of light is an etherial essence' to which he might respond 'But the meaning of existance is not comprehensive' and I would reply 'Yes but it is if you want it to be', and it would go on like this, knowing that he had no idea of what I had meant, which didn't matter at all, since I didn't know myself what I had meant. Often we would just break into paroxisms of mirth, laughing and laughing until our stomachs hurt and the tears flowed in rivers down our cheeks. At one point I noticed a luminescent glow on the slinky that I could not account for. I told him breathlessly of my discovery, thinking it was a new form of mysterious energy, on a par with Newtons discovery of gravitation, and it took us at least ten minutes to discover that it was only the reflection of the lightning machine, which triggered another bout of helpless mirth.

At one point we turned out the lights and looked at the patterns of light cast on the ceiling from the street. I cannot begin to express the deep beauty of those patches of light. I stared and stared with my eyes boggled out muttering 'oh my God! oh my God!' I swore I would never take patterns of light for granted again! I could see fantastically complex latticework patterns in the dark which became very vivid when I closed my eyes. I tried to describe these visions to my tape recorder because I knew I could never remember them in all their beauty and complexity, but the visions rushed by so fast and furiously that I could not begin to keep up with them, even if I could find words to describe them.

Throughout these experiences I remembered an insight I had had ten years ago when I had last taken LSD. I remember thinking that although the experience is novel and fantastic beyond the wildest imagination, that there is also an element of familiarity to it all, a sense of deja vu, that at some past time I had seen these kinds of things before. After much thought it came to me. Remember when you were a kid, and could see patterns in clouds? I remember seeing things in every random pattern. In the linoleum of the bathroom floor there was a man's head, and a little girl, and a horse. In the trees across the street from the house I could see goofy and the snap crackle and pop characters. When I first learned numbers in school, 6 was a little fat boy with a big stomach, and 7 was tall and straight with creased pants, while 3 and 8 were little girls. Now they are just numbers to me, they have lost their fanciful connotations, but on LSD I see images again, like I did as a young boy. And near the end of the trip when thoughts and sensations become more 'fundamental' (how else can I word it?) and you feel spasms pulsing through your whole body and shaking you to your very foundations, it brings to mind the convulsions of a very young infant, and the boggled eyes with their expression of uncomprehending wonder and fascination. Is this the reason for the familiarity? Is this the way the world looked when I first cast eyes on it?

If I were an alien intelligence come to visit the earth, to get a taste of life among these primitive semi-intelligent self-important pompous ape men, if I wanted to really know what it was like to be human, to have human thoughts and perceptions and I slipped into a human brain and viewed the earth through an earth mans eyes and ears and body, this is the way it would look. This is the wild distorted narrow visioned perspective on the world as seen from within a human mind, but seen with an alien detachment and objectivity. LSD gives me an opportunity to experience what being human is all about. To step back and see my world from a perspective that cannot be gained any other way. To gain deep insights into the nature of what I am. Should LSD be legal? Absolutely! Would I recommend it for just anyone? Absolutely not! I am an easy-going happy person, satisfied with my life, so the experience has always been a good one for me. But the psychedelic experience forces you to face up to some fundamental issues about your own life and mind, and if you are at all mentally unstable, unhappy with your life or yourself, if you have any unresolved mental conflicts, then the experience could well be disasterous beyond your most horrific nightmares! Anyone who takes this drug does so at their own risk, and it should never be taken lightly or pushed on people who arn't sure whether they want it. For those who are suited for it however the experience can be so rich and rewarding in a multitude of ways, that no man should have the right to deny it to them. It is a truely priceless experience!

The incident which I relate occurred 28 years ago, but I still remember it as if it happened yesterday. I was tripping on acid on a weekend evening, and I was well on my way, being very stoned. I liked to walk over across the road from my house where there was a pond with an open field all around- no houses- and someone had built a gazebo in the middle of this pond, with a narrow wooden walkway out to it. I was enjoying the acid trip as I usually did, when suddenly, off in the horizon, I noticed a flaming round ball shooting thru the sky, then going behind some trees. The ball was an orange flame color, larger than say an airplane light would be if you saw it at night. This was way off in the horizon. Before I could think what in the hell was that, I felt a tremendous force over the pond- it was light and energy, and the force of it pushed my chin back, and forced me to lie down on my back in the grass at the edge of the pond. I couldn't look at it- the force was too great!

And then I heard a voice. It seemed to come from some place both inside and outside me. It said 'Don't look at me, or you will die!' At that time, I chose not to look at it and I lay there on the grass feeling this incredible force over me, pushing my chin back.

I felt tremendous exhilaration, but not fear. Then the voice said to me,'Do you want to come with me? Or do you want to go back to your friends?' In that instant, I felt that if I went with the force, I would surely die. So I said 'I want to go back to my friends.' And I am sure that I did not move my lips, but the speaking was by thought except I could hear it. 

In a moment, the force slowly began to lift up and fade away, and when it was gone, I got up and ran back to my house. My friends were there, and I told them what had happened, but they didn't believe me and they thought I was having a weird trip, though not a bad one. So I just accepted that they wouldn't believe me, but I know that it happened to me, and I can still remember it clearly 28 years later.

First, let me explain the large dose. I'm some sort of freak, because I had tried LSD five times before this time, going up to a dosage of two good hits without getting any effects other than physical ones. So, I figured I'd try four to see if that would do anything at all. I wasn't expecting much, but I got it.

I am writing this 8 days after the trip, which was a monday nite on a large cruise ship in the Caribbean Sea. I went to dinner with my family, then went back to the cabin with my younger sister. I had decided I would go ahead and try it that nite. So at 8.30pm, I took the acid into the little bathroom with me into the little bathroom and consumed. My sister and I then left to go met our parents at the theatre on the ship to see a show. The show was a musical impersonater that would have been pretty entertaining even if one was completely straight. My family and I sat in a balcony seat overlooking the lower audience and with a decent view of the stage. I could feel it starting to work physically already by this time, around 8.45 or 8.50, while we were waiting for the show to start. I was actually starting to feel a bit nauseated, with the rocking of the ship and a very full stomach. I reminded myself that I could always leave the show if I got to feeling too bad. The bar service man came by and I ordered a sprite, then headed to the restroom. On my way back from the restroom, The Smilies kicked in. I couldn't help it. I was aware I had a silly grin on my face, but luckily it was gone by the time I got back to my seat where my family was.

The sprite tasted like blood, but I drank it anyway thinking I needed the liquid in my system. The show was good, the impersonator did a very good job on the singers, so I thought. The show lasted for ever, however, thanks to the time dilation. My sister would look at me during the show and when I looked at her, her form kept jumping slightly side to side quickly. The crowd below.... the crowd looked like someone had taken a picture of it and pasted it onto a sheet that kept undulating. 

We didn't stay for the entire show. My sister began to feel sick and we left I think around 9.45. I wasn't aware of what was happening, I didn't know the show was not over. When I realized what was going on however, I told my dad that I would split and see them later. He said allright, have fun. 

Let me just say now that most of the events of that evening are fuzzy to various degrees. Anyway, after splitting from my family, I wandered the ship, getting deeper and deeper into the A. I made my way to a cafeteria on the second highest deck, one with windows for the walls. Luckily, it wasn't very occupied. Only a few other people sat at one other table there, speaking some other language. Hell, I remember it being Spanish, but it really could have been anything, or nothing. 

I sat down at a table to figure out what the hell was going on. I looked down at my pants and intricate patterns were forming on them and quickly becoming other images. I remember seeing a dog barking at a woman and then these two entities merging and dissolving away. I looked at my arms. The skin was tightening and pulsating, the hairs were being forced out from their pores. I looked out the window. Dark streams of colour were flowing past the window. The other people had left and two crew members were sitting at a table, they looked philipino. I left after sitting there for a few more minutes.

At this point, I think I went up to the highest deck to sit in the wind and think. I had stuck my discman in my pocket before the show figuring that I would need it later. I listened to the first five songs of Pink Floyd's Meddle. The music sounded better, but I can't remember why exactly. No doubt it had something to do with the fact that I had a milligram of lysergic acid diethylmide surging through my brain. I lied in a reclined chair, listening to the music and taking in my surroundings. When the wind would catch my pants and hold them against my legs in a certain way, it made it look like my legs were wasting away, developing deep holes in them. The stars were bright that night; there were no city lights to deal with or a moon. Every star seemed to have thousands of other stars flowing into them constantly, single stars consuming entire galaxies.

In the blackness of the sky I saw something that will probably be the most difficult thing to describe in this passage. The image was like a complex geometric pattern of cubes. The cubes were not stacked flat, but were set up so that they had one corner pointing directly towards the earth. Every side of the cubes showed the same design, a design which changed constantly. The design had tessalations of Japanime in it, constantly changing the subject face. I split after seeing enough of the sky show and listening to Meddle.

At this point, I think I wandered back down into the ship, inside, off the open decks. The next thing I have definite memory is entering the main atrium in the ship, where there are five floors around an open center. As I was walking into the room, a man, probably 30 or so, stared into my face. In recollection, I should have told the guy to fuck off or just ignored him. He held up a camera, wanting me to take a picture of him and his family. However, and this is important, he was Italian. He didn't speak any English nor did any members of his group. I took the camera and waited for the group to essemble to be photographed. However, they just kept standing around in the circle. It gets even more complicated. I had just been walking with my discman in my hand, and now that i needed two hands to take the picture. I had to put the discman in my pocket, but I couldn't find my pockets. So, the logical thing to do at the time was to hand the Italian guy the discman. This caused confusion, he refused to take it and I shook it at him and told him to just hold it for now, which was futile since he didn't speak english. This whole event didn't take much time at all. Also, the guy had small scars on his face and they would jump to whoever I focused on in the group so that they had the scars too. Some other member of their group showed up and took over the job of taking a picture, so I was relieved of that duty. I went up to an outside deck, feeling bad and stupid about what had just happened.

I leaned over the rail and thought about how dumb that last incident had been. I wished I had a friend there to take care of me, but I was alone, head full of lsd, roaming a huge ship with three thousand other occupants on the middle of the ocean in goddamned nowhere. I watched the waves and continued to think. The waves caused by the ship were entertaining to watch. After a few moments, I stopped seeing waves. Instead, I saw milk. The entire ocean had turned to milk, covered with fruit loops. We were now traveling upon The Cereal Sea. The cereal then turned back into the dark water it had been before, but I was seeing the waves as dark stemed flowers with dark coloured petals. A sea of flowers. I continued to watch the waves, and they continued to evolve into new things. Each stage of evolution was a bit odder than the previous one. 

I saw huge jellyfish, fuckin' big stinging jellyfish. The boat had come into a herd of them crossing the seas (so I thought.) I watched them swim and noticed something odd: their mode of communication was electricity. They shocked each other to convey messages. A new species no doubt. I remember thinking about jumping in with them, meeting an early and painful death. However, the waves didn't stay as jellyfish forever. Oh no, the jellyfish became dinosaur skeletons before long. Large carnivore ones, white bones. I had had enough reflection while watching the waves and walked to the end of the ship, the very back of the ship, so that I could watch the trail that the wake of the boat left. This was the best part of the trip, probably. I didn't see anything in the waves, but I started hearing things. Wonderful ambient techno was being created in my head, just for me. It was perhaps a bit repeatitive, but nevertheless beautiful. The music lasted for quite a while, as long as I looked at the wake. 

By this time, I was growing tired of the paranoia and feeling like I should be hiding from people. If I had known about a small deck I found the next day I could have gone there and no one else would have been around. So, a little after midnite I think it was, I attempted to go back to my cabin. However, this wasn't as easy as it should have been. I entered into the atrium, knowing it was possible to get to my cabin from there, but not quite sure how. I felt like everyone was looking at me, and I probably looked confused or lost. People were beginning to look ugly. I thought about just asking someone for help, which would have been a bad idea. I eventually found the hallway that lead to my room and proceded down it. I felt like I should say 'I'm glad we had this little talk' to the universe. I had come up with the idea of Life being a challenge, and god being the thing that gives the challenge. I've dismissed the latter idea as foolishness since I'm atheistic. But anyway, In the hallway I passed a blonde girl that smiled. I remember thinking 'You are Americana, I want to exist within you.' Whatever the hell that means.

I entered my cabin and went to take my contacts out. In the mirror, I looked near death. I was sweaty looking and just odd generally. I listened to Echoes from Meddle in bed and then went to sleep. However, the LSD kept me from being able to sleep well at all. I tossed and turned for hours. I should have gone back out since I was still under the influence... 

The next day I felt fine and recounted the events of the previous nite. I felt quite good, actually, like the LSD had put some things into perspective. Was the trip worth doing? sure. Would I do it again? Hell yeah.

Having done my share of LSD, I spose I should add my two bits to the heap. I have had over half a dozen sessions with acid, ranging over about 5 years. I have ingested roughly 10 blotter hits in this time. The last time I dropped was Dec 15 (or friday, whichever the date was), and second last was Dec 30 1987. Most recently, I started with 1 blotter at 7:39 am, took a second at 8:45, and a third at 4:00 pm. By 9:00 am the liquid skin disease had kicked in, and the metallic sweats came and there were indications of activity. By 10am mental activities were real white-waterish, if ya know what I mean. It was very pleasant. By noon I was really riding high. After the 4:00 booster, the effect was even more profound. By this time I had taken just below 3 blotter units. Acid insights galore, along with the laughter caused by profoundly realized revelations and humorous social-cultural reflections. Asleep by 3am, my girlfriend and I had a delightful, close, 'bonding' evening such as the effects were so wonderful.

With me, acid can make me devilishly-mischievous, meditatively reflectful, probingly thoughtful, reflective, serene, joyful, intensely happy, radiant of love....it tends to enhance my understanding of the cosmos. It is a way to travel to reality-prime, where things are not exactly as they appear, and things are really eternal and ordered, assuring. It is a soulful drug, a mind/spirit/soul amplifier of perception, not a body drug like the legals. It allows 'the doors of perception' to be cleansed, it reminds you you are eternal. I once feared LSD cause I thought it would take 'me' away, it would destroy 'me'. Now I know personality is indestructable, at least for those who have found 'identification'. While everything changes, 'I' will remain. Those who have done lsd may suspect it is illegal because it causes thought processes that may threaten consensus reality power, it does not promote their 'authority'. LSD is a long strange journey where you walk with yourself and get to know who you really are.

I've had some really wonderful trips, and have learned quite a lot from this chemical. Its perspective cannot be wrong, just different. How many times has it been said or implied lsd drives you crazy? Are the Beatles crazy? They have done more, and better, LSD than I ever will. Didn't Rock Hudson (or was it Cary Grant) use it? Didn't the CIA? Why must scare tactics be used to squash anything the gov/power-structre doesn't like? Informed, intelligent adults should have the powers of choice, including choice of chemicals. This current prohibition will be no more successful than the last one, in its stated purpose. It has been very successful in its real purpose. Freedoms must be taken if the WoD is to work, and the typical person is too afraid to stand up and question or comment. Places like this are indespensible resources for dissemination of the real truth, and the real news. I thank NetGod that I need not depend upon the TV for news, or our local slanted rag.

While I admit a slight possiblity of having a 'bad trip' on acid, this has never happened to me. I do see how one could have a displeasurable encounter with lsd if

1) in bad environment, 
2) with 'bad' people, 
3) afraid of self, or 
4) unable to laugh and enjoy a good humour mood

But I think all the krap about emergency room bad trips is exaggerated, dark-age hyperbole. And last time I dropped I looked out my 4 story window, not jumped. LSD's LD50 is evidence that it is no harmful to the body than water is. It is beneficial to the mind and soul when used properly. It simply changes your perspective, shifts your dimensions a bit. Like Alice down the rabbit hole, its a strange, but fun and stimulating adventure.

It's not like I do it everyday. It's been YEARS since I did it before just recently. And thats fine with me. I was celebrating a 4.00 average for this term in school, and thats for Comp Sci, Math, University Honors and some history courses, not basket weaving. My cums up to 3.54 so I am sitting pretty at school, and work for those who would assume otherwise. Which goes to point out the ole 'amotivational syndrome' is a load of myth also.

Probably the worse thing about this latest War on Drugs is that it is at best, a hypocritical witch-hunt based on misinformation and one sided propaganda. It is against information, and informed-formation. It would crush those who would excercise their legal rights in the name of the law. It would put the Law over the Individual, a corrupt and unjust law. It demands uniformity of posture and mind, rather than unity in diversity. The Drug Warriors assume Judgment as their own, rather than taking stock in tolerance and freedom. As with the Amercian flag, the symbol has become far more important than that which it represnts. And this is a mistake, a grave and fatal error plagueing democracy --- that the citizenry will be 'taken care of', and then controlled. Legislation can never produce moral change, or anything like meaningful growth. Only personal exerience can teach the lessons of life; laws cannot make one good regardless of number, severity, or penalty. Heaven must be something like a self-governed anarchy, with no laws carved in stone, except 'to thine own self be true', and 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you'. Tolerance IS necessary for growth, laws should be to protect the responsible from the animal-people, not to restrict free movement of freewill citizens. Intolerance is indicative of narrowness, and prejudice. Ignorance and prejudice stand in the way of growth, they are unbecoming of those who would learn, and learn to know. (german: kennenlernen) One day perhaps we will pass out of the era of negative, forbidding laws to a system of positive, helpful laws, the Law of Love. When you love every other person as you can love yourself, and when you seek to do good to them and to do good for them, you will see that this is the best rule to run your life by. Laws (rules of behavior or patterns of response) are every persons duty to legislate for himself. Make the real rules for yourself; find your own moral code and live by it, and be true to yourself. If you find yourself fully self-accountable, you need not fear the trials or the scrutiny of tyranny. A truly self-assured soul need not fear worldly troubles, for the citadel of the spirit is ever unassailable. Drugs or not, find yourself and be yourself, and be yourself fully and unwaveringly, certain of the Truth you increasingly live.

So then i took 12 hits of this purebred Octopus blotter, and after the usual leave the body white light communion and birth of the universe-genetic racial memory bit, i found myself (not to say that i had any concept of 'i,' 'my' or 'self') in an unfamiliar space. I was within a multi-dimensional web, somewhat akin to a sphere with a center everywhere and circumference nowhere, being turned in on itself an infinite number of times. The web was boundless in its permutations, copmposed of blue hexa-octa-and decahedral cells and not in linear time. 

I was not alone. 

There were others, distinct, and i believe non-human entities; and they were mildly annoyed at my unannounced visit. They were rather busy, engeged in a game, The Game; i was a pawn, one of many in the 'stable' of an entity called 'Chako,' a '7th-level oversser.' The game took place on many levels, only one of which was our familiar, everyday consensus reality. Apparently, all beings vibrate at certain specific levels of psychic frequencies; by seriously tampering with mine through the ingestion of much dosage, I jumped temporarily to receiving 'level 4' data, and ended up in this 'overseer' domain. Chako 'told' me all this through convoluted yet clear thoughtforms, which i understood only partially, being limited in my wetware. 

The object of the game, while ungrokkable to a level 1 entity such as myself, did not appear to be entirely benevelent. For that matter, Chako was not benevelent at all, and posessed of a rather demonic ambience. Anyhow, as Chako's pawn, i was to face another, someone else's pawn, but whether this other was human, when, where and on which plane was not made clear. At this point, the the effects of the lucidant were waning, and i was pulled out of the web, with no reluctance i must say. 

Unlike many other trips where the revelations are fogotten shortly after emergence, I was left with distinct memories of the events that transpired and an almost engramatic warning of consequences of 'jumping' psychic levels. The strangest of all was the clarity of the name Chako and the concept of humans as psychic pawns in overseer's stables, playing The Game without a clue as to its purpose.

This happened several years ago, it was neither my first nor my last high mikage experiment, but i have not been to the overseer domain since. Psychomemetics, hallucinogens, fantasticants - call them what you will, this was as real as anything i've experienced, mindset and setting irrelevant at this dosage. I await the encounter with the other, and i have no doubt i'll know when it comes. I hope i will be ready. 

So, gentle people, have any of you ever had a like-minded journey? If so, did you figure out what the purpose of the Game is? I'd appreciate any comments, thoughts and ideas you may have on this matter.

Tripping outdoors is always the best, letting Mother Nature personally guide you. This is how it went one night last summer.

Summer break was ending and my friends (Bill, Marcus and Jamal) were just getting back into Colorado from other states.  We had all simultaniously gotten into this drug thing but we had never tripped together.  There was nothing to do on campus this Friday night, but I had 8 hits of acid on me.  I ran into my friends outside our dorm and told them my plan.  To make a night of it we drove Bill's Cougar up towards Rocky Mountain National park at about midnight.  About half an hour after dosing we stopped in a small mountain town along the way to walk around and look at things, including a large dinosaur (triceratops) skeleton in a shop window that we could not stop laughing at.  After meeting this creature and realizing we weren't sober any longer we decided to head on up into the mountains.

Bill's car stereo is one of the best I have ever heard.  When it's turned up and the windows rolled down you can hear it from literally miles away, we were fortunate to have it with us that night.  As we were listening to DJ Dan while acending deeper into the forest and farther from the rest of the world we decided to pull over and explore.  The moon was full, and the entire forest was ours, it might as well have been some beautiful new green planet we were on.  We found ourselves in a little valley with a stream in the middle and forrested mountains on two sides, with the sky clear and every star shining.  Marcus and I decided to take a walk down to the stream while Bill and Jamal broke some new glowsticks and danced in the middle of the road.  After several hours (or minutes?  you can never tell on this drug) I was thinking that there couldn't be another human within 20 miles of where we were.  Right as I converted this thought into words, a car drove by, saw the glowsticks, hit the brakes and turned around and stopped.  

Right as we were about to panic (we were in no condition to deal with other people at this point) two guys stumbled out of the car with two cartons of orange juice!  I can't remember thier story but they were tripping also, driving across the state.  They left us a carton of OJ and we smoked them up, and they went on their way. Analyzing the encounter, they seemed to be just a couple of farmer's kids out having fun like we were.  They came from such a different background compared to four little candy ravers, and we never would have met them, least make friends with them if it weren't for the drugs bringing us together.  Not long after they left we decided to continue up further into the mountains.

Several miles down the road we found the spot:  to this day I think of this little area as my spiritual home.  When I die I am sure this is where my spirit will go immediately.  It's simply a small parking lot on the top of a small mountain pass with overlooks on either side.  On the left there is the remainder of a mountain, on the right a small rocky hill that the road winds around.  One can see the lights of Estes Park (50 or so miles away) and possibly further from the overlook, thousands of feet higher than the valleys below.  We were two hours into our trip now, and everything was beautiful, too much so for words to begin to describe.  Huge green pine trees were all around us, concealing us from the world and the world from us.  I had purchased Paul Oakenfold's 'Tranceport' that day and had not listened to it yet.  We put that CD in the stereo and listened as the bass rumbled through the forest, through the valleys so far below and up past the high mountaintops.  I credit that music for creating the feelings felt that night.  We stayed in that spot and danced the night away.  The trees seemed to dance to it also.  At one point the four of us took a walk down the road to look down into the world.  Bill and I were leading with Marcus and Jamal trailing and having a wierd debate about TV commercials or something.  There was a tree laying on its side that apperently gave Bill weird vibe, so he approached it and asked no one in particular 'Are these trees?  I don't think so...'.  On closer inspection they were indeed trees.  All of us had the same perception problems and had a blast sorting things out, but not before engaging in an argument with the downed log.

Back at the car Bill and I decided we needed a campfire.  We had planned ahead and brought lighters, wood and newspaper to light, so we opened the trunk to get the materials.  'Wait, what were we doing again?' 'I forgot...I know we opened the trunk for a reason...hmm'.  Quickly forgetting everything, we danced for who knows how long before Marcus yelled 'Hows that fire comming along?' 'OH YEAH!  A fire!!'.  After forgetting what we were doing several more times the concensus between the four of us was that we were not of mental capacity to start and maintain a fire, and the idea was dropped.  In hindsight, we probably would have burned down the forest so its better that way.

I can't tell you the details of several hours where all memories are kida fuzzy, all I can remember is a feeling.  A feeling of joy, contentness.  More so than MDMA can ever give you.  My three best friends in the world, a different world perhaps, and I were all dumb as animals, trying to get a grasp on reality, but there was no hurry in getting to wherever we were going.  We had all night, and memories of school and the campus were so incredably distant as to be a dream.  It was amazing how much like a dream the past 18 years of my life were.  Reality wasn't reality at all, and I was finally awakened from it, into a far better place where reality is constantly changing at the touch of a thought.

As the sun began to rise we decided to climb the rocky cliff near the car.  The car!  It must have been 200 yards away  and twice as far below us but we could hear Tranceport as clear as ever.  I remember Bill and Marcus climbed up farther than Jamal and I, and watching thier silouhettes dancing against the brightening sky.  Rock climbing was dificult, and here we were conquoring the cliff, and proving it by DANCING on it!  We felt as if we had just climbed Everest and were on top of the world.  And the view from the top...  We were surrounded by miles of wilderness all around us and we could look down on it all and command it.  As supeior beings we watched the sun slowly rise and light the valleys below, feeling a bit like Zeus must have on top of Mount Olympus.  Unfortunately the drugs in our systems were waning, and Jamal and I started the long descent back to the car.  As we got to the bottom a park ranger's car was pulling up (oh no!  We were still too cracked out to string two words togeter in a fashon as to not scare a person not on this drug).  Talking to the ranger was fun as it turned out.  It felt like my mind was so expanded I could understand anything in an instant, while his was compressed and slow.  He was just checking to see if we were OK as it turned out, and gave off a good vibe.  Nonetheless, it was almost 8 am!! and we took it as a sign it was time to head home.  

At the time none of us realized what had trancepired [sic] that night, I hope I conveyed it into words suitably.  It was the perfect trip.  We did everything:  traveled to new worlds, met mother nature personally, talked to her trees and rocks and mountains.  Practiced telepathy.  We met new people experiencing the same things as we were.  We danced.  We discovered new ways of thinking.  We bonded.  No matter what happens many years from now, The four of us will always have that night to look back upon.  Everything was perfectly synchronized.  We got into the mountains righ as we were beggining to peak.  We had just enough lsd in us to see the sunrise and try our hand at being immortal.  When it was time to call it quits and go home God sent that park ranger out to us.  Every time I listen to Tranceport I remember the feelings of this night, although they get fainter and fainter every time.  Still, I look back on it as the best night of my life.  If i were to die tommorow it would be OK because I was there, experiencing it, having more fun than anyone should be allowed to have, and knowing that only a fraction of a percent of all life on Earth has discovered what joy is.  What it feels like to awaken from the dream that was reality.  Thank you Mother Nature and Paul Oakenfold.

It was my very first taste of 'hardcore' drugs. I had done pot and plenty of alcohol but not much else.
I tripped with a couple roommates, we all took it at the same time around 1 or 2 pm.

We started by watching the Beatles classic 'Yellow Submarine'. Amazing, we had fun just lying on the floor and watching all the crazy things in that movie. But since I was on the floor all it took was a slight uncomfortable moment to make me want to constantly move around. Eventually we became restless and went on a nature walk. We walked to a small area near by, void of people. Stood around a sewer grate, watching it, some of us first trippers were paranoid about what people would think if they saw us.

We then headed back, realizing that we were indeed tripping hard. We would some and go a lot throughout the day and night and my sense of time was lost, when I would come back I would go to my room and sit on my bed, everytime I did this I would think to myself that maybe I was caught up in this infinite time warp, thinking I would be doomed to do the same thing over and over. 

I then began to trip by myself. I saw the wood grain on my roommates bed grow and change, then the ceiling would form these sort of rainbow images. I then began exploring my computer, realizing how much, much better some music is. Beatles, Pink Floyd, and other artists sound amazing. I closed my eyes and lied on my bed relaxing and feeling my body sort of melt away, where the only thing left was my existence, no materials just my thoughts and mind. I then went back to my computer, watching my background morph and icons move. I attempted to go online but failed, so I just went to Itunes visualizer, the visuals were amazing, it seemed as if it would seep into our reality and become the only thing I could see.

Then we reunited once again. We took another trip outside and basically attempted not to look foolish. While tripping, I always felt paranoid that someone would see me but when others would say this I would look at them and the only evidence of the trip was huge pupils.

We eventually also decided to take a trip to a dining area here. Everyone seemed to be looking at us, eating wasn't a high priority because LSD makes me lose my appetite. I had only french fries, none of which I remember eating. The others either had nothing but fruit. It was alright except we ran into an authority figure, not a cop but someone who could get us in trouble. For first time trippers, going out with lots of people is not recommended until you know how to handle it and how you will feel.

Finally the rest of the trip consisted of us finding places to rest and savour the rest of the trip. I had to stay up until 5 am because I couldn't come down from it. One guy who had tripped went to a party later. 

All in all, I had a fun time. Would definetly do it again.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

I had tried lsd once before with little effect other then intense laughter and apprehencation of music. I was pretty open to trying it once again with a higher dosage and my friend 'joe' felt the same way. So one day after waiting for a time to do it we decided to go camping at a beautiful lake. We had to do things like meet his gf and pick up the acid and by the time we were on our way it was 138 am. We wanted to go up to whistler first but when we got there the highway was closed so we sat on the side of the highway toking out of my bong when we decided to drop the acid.

We then drove down to the lake and got out for a look see. It was 4 am and light was just starting to appear over the mountain. Nothing much was happening we sat on a bench played frisbee and walked around. At about 5 the sun started to come over the mountain and that's when it started. I kept seeing these shapes of gods in the sky and the trees but not only where they moving but they were dancing as if there was some kind of music playin. This was just the start the dancing and movement of the gods intensified and there were more of them dancing and swaying to the music. Not one single god was the same, some were smaller some took up half the sky but they danced together constantly. Then in the trees I saw purple and yellow elephants shrinking and spliting into 2 and multiplying over and over again. All I could do was sit there and watch this happen. It seemed to calm down as the sun eluminated everythign.

We played a little more frisbee until we decided that we should go somewhere else. So we got in the car ( I do not recommend doin this even though we did) and we drove up to whistler to skate the park. We were so distracted by the ppl lookin at us the 2 weirdos that we left. We wanted to smoke some more pot so we found an old loggin road and we walked along it and we looked over and there was this massive rock face and we saw like carvings in the rocks that shaped ppl and we started to believe that world was made for humans and this is wat the carvings told us. We stared at these carvings as we packed a bowl in the bong. We decided we had enough of these crazy carvings by this time it was 9 am and we thought we should find some other symptom of entertainment.

So we drove yet again and while driving we see this beautiful river that was fed from a glacier and it was beautiful. We parked the car and climbed up the hill and all of the sudden we stopped and looked at the ground and there was a fast layout of vibrant colours these moss like plants grew all along this forested hill and they all had different colours from red to blue from green to orange and we were absolutely blown away after a huge colaberation of this we decided to move on
We found the river and we swam in it. Was amazing the cold water hit us like 1000 bricks in the chest. We hung out there for a while smoked another bowl and left. We drove home and crashed instantly I was so tired. Lsd was one of the most amazing moments in my life but not without its marks on my mentality.

My trip began early that day. It was about 11:00 a.m. when I took the first hit. Although this could have been mind over manner, I believe I felt the effects of LSD the second it dissolved in my mouth (I also felt this way almost immediately after taking shrooms). Of course, the effects weren't very strong but I noticed a slight change in consciousness. Colors began to get a lot brighter and I noticed something was different. However, I wasn't exactly sure what it was. After about an hour, I was disappointed that I didn't experience any kind of hallucination. At least it wasn't what I expected. At this point, my mind was altered a great deal and the colors were very enhanced. They were absolutely beautiful. 

This is when I decided to take the sec  ond hit. It ended up being a very stupid decision because I was called into work. I was a waitress, and this is definitely not something I want to be doing while I'm tripping! I went to work at 3:00 p.m. and worked until about 8. I was very uncomfortable at work because I was sweating a great deal. Perspiration was dripping from my body. One minute I was hot, the next I was cold. I also kept knocking things over. I was a very klutzy waitress. Lets just say I didn't get very good tips that night! One thing I noticed about my experience, which was similiar to shrooms, was my imagination. I would look at something and imagine myself to be somewhere else. As if I were in a movie or a different world. For example, when I looked at a table under this very bright light I imagined I was in a movie. There was a person sitting at that table smoking a bowl. When I was on shrooms, I imagined that while I was walking down the street I was actually in the ocean. I thought the lawn sprinkler was a huge wave. Anyway, let's stay on the subject of LSD....

When I finally arrived home from work, I listened to a lot of music. A lot of Pink Floyd of course, some punk rock, basically anything I liked a lot. Later that night, when I tried to go to sleep, I found that my eyes refused to shut. They would immediately bulge open. This is when things took a turn for the worse....

The nighttime part of the trip was the hardest. The shadows on my windows transformed into monsters. (I had been waiting for a visual all day, and this was what I got!) Some of them looked like skeletons. I thought I was going to die. I kept thinking that maybe I should leave a note for my mom and apoligize to her. I wanted to tell her that I loved her. I was really starting to panic. This was very scary and at one point I wanted to start crying. I did eventually calm myself down, but this took about an hour. Eventually, I did fall asleep. It was about 3 a.m. but it finally happened.

All in all the trip was amazing during the day. It was a very interesting experience. LSD is probably the strangest drug I have ever taken. The night was difficult, but I made it through. I learned that I like shrooms a lot better. I've never had a difficult experience on shrooms and this is why I like them over LSD. Every shroom experience has been highly pleasurable and a life changing journey. LSD was pleasurable at first, but difficult at the end. It wasn't the least bit life changing, just mind altering. VERY mind altering.

After a couple years of somewhat regular use, there are a few things I started to notice.  One is that I starting looking at life and the 'rules' differently.  So I know there were some changes going on, a waking of the mind.

I had been color blind since a traumatic event as a young child.  I have some ideas on why, and know the how, but being color blind is embarrassing to say the least. Let me just say, the 'need' for color got put unto the back burner for the sake of preservation. At many points in my life, if the crayon didn't have the label on it, I could not tell you what color is was, other than light or dark.  Grey, brown, green and dull red's all looked exactly alike to me.  Beyond that I can tell a difference between the primary colors, especially if I knew that's all that was there, but it was more by elimination than recognition.  

Anyway one day I took a couple hits, and was walking down Garnet Ave.  My friend at the time was on the same dose as me, and we were feeling it.  As I walked and tried not to look too many people in the eye, there were red bricks on the ground, and they really got my attention.  They looked more red than normal, but more than that they had a 'uniqueness' about them I had never seen before.  The texture was 'trippy' but more than that, the colors just had my attention like never before.  The color had meaning to me, which it never had.  Then like a bad movie, A purple laser beam shot out of the corner between two of the bricks, and hit me in the eye.  There was nothing there just bricks and mortar, but something had happened, I had seen purple for the first time in my life.  I understood it, recognized it as a color in itself, not just a shade of blue.  An audible pop went off in my head when this happened, and to this day, 20 years later, I still see colors.  I don't see them with an 'artists' eye, but life is much better for me now, I can stop and smell the flowers, and appreciate the melody of colors that populate a spring meadow. Life has much more depth to me, and I believe LSD rebooted part of my brain that had been disabled in my past.

Hello, this is Jordan. I am not going to tell you about the full acid trip because there are plenty of other trips written up online that describe the same basic stuff. So I want to share the unique part of my experience. I was at a friends house and took one dose from a blotter paper at 9:00am to start the trip.

Sometime deep into the climax of my LSD intoxication I was sitting in a living riving on a wooden chair. For some reason I was looking at another chair sitting somewhere in the middle of the room. This chair was a computer desk chair, a chair with four wheels and spins. It was facing me. However, I imagine the description is not too important. So, I was looking at this chair when I noticed something very odd. Everything started to rotate. I wasn't moving, but everything I was looking at, in example the chair, was rotating in all directions from one point. This startled me a little bit because I was seeing the backside of the chair, even though the FRONT was facing me. [NO, the chair itself was not moving!] The rotation speed seemed to speed up until I realized that I was seeing the chair, and the rest of the room, at every possible three-dimensional angle at once. It is extremely hard for me to describe what seeing the chair and the rest of the room from every possible angle was like.

Everything was sort of meshed and took on irregular shapes that I would never have been able to comprehend before seeing them. It did NOT look like a bunch of different images layered over each other. It was almost as if my vision was bending around each object. But seeing the chair from every angle made me realize that there was more to it, much more to it. By that point I realized I was not only seing the chair in every possible three-dimentional angle, but I was also seeing more of the chair than was ever there in three dimensions. It was almost as if everything I was seeing imploded and exploded and retained original shape at the the same time, yet meshed into one shape that still has me baffled. The chair that normally looked so straight and so symetrical was now a complete mess. It was like...it was EVERYWHERE. But everything else in the room was everywhere too! What I thought was everywhere before didn't seem to exist because everywhere took on a new meaning. I also began to feel like I was being...pulled. Pulled isn't the right word though, because the feeling I am trying to describe I never thought existed. It was sort of like being pulled by gravity, but not just down, in every direction. And in other directions that I didn't know existed. And every part of my body down to each atom felt like it was being pull in every direction plus the directions that I didn't think existed. Again, remember I am trying to be careful with the word pull because it really wasn't the same. But it was as if I taking up new space. Space that I've never felt before perhaps. 

I have not been able to get over what I saw. I don't know if I actually saw in 4 dimensions, but what I saw was not at all normal.

I have to firstly say that I completely advocate the use of drugs as Ive had fantastic experiences on so many occasions.  However, there was one time in my drug history where I took too much LSD and had an experience I could only equate as utter Hell.

I was 19 at the time and completely up for doing any drug.  I bought 10 trips from my neighbour at college and went home to do acid with my friend.

The night began with him and I going to this girl's birthday party, but before going in I said to my friend that we should take 3 trips each (I had a brilliant experience in the past with acid and assumed that taking 3 times the strength could only make it 3 times better).  The night began really well as my friend and I gradually became higher and higher on acid at this girl's party.  Of course the party was at her parents house, hosted by her parents so we weren't exactly doing the most civilised of activities.  I told my friend that we had to leave and he agreed so we left to walk home.  I lived in quite a rural area and so the walk home was essentially through part of a town and the country...

The walk home was phenomenal.  Whenever I used to do acid, the whole time-era I was in went back to the 1950s as everything became black-and-white, and the streetlights gave a neon tint making the whole world be in pure technicolor.  So many mad incomprehensible occurance took place like a huge friendly Great Dane in the middle of nowhere with no owner with it.  Imagine that, walking down a country road and fields far miles from any houses and a huge Great Dane comes up to greet you.  This was obviously a stray dog but the coincidence of us tripping as well was mad!!  And we were still getting higher and higher on acid...

Anyway, once we got back I said to my friend that I wanted to go in and listen to the Orb music to really add to the experience.  We separated from each other and I got in my house.  This must have been the early hours of the morning and I knew that its always a good thing to drink a glass of orange juice before going to bed when I've been tripping.

I opened the fridge door and got a glass from the cupboard.  I then started to pour the orange juice and the whole world then became orange, pure ORANGE.  This was the hallucination becoming solid, no trails of lights on the edges of objects, but a complete change of my visual field to the colour ORANGE.  The whole world became one single shade of orange, no differences in shades, just all the same shade of orange.

Of course I started to panic and the experience got worse and worse.  I then had the images that I was seeing, merging into each other all around me.  Every image around me - what was a toaster, what was a kettle, what was an orange juice carton, a chair, they all started merging into each other and I was seeing images as though they were monsters approaching me from the left again and again and again.

I lost the complete 'core self' that we all have.  I term this 'core consciousness' - the part of you which is the experience of being 'you'.  Your 'I' if you like.  That went from me and all I was thinking about was 'This is insanity there is no 'I' I am just an amalgamation of sensory inputs, I do not exist.  I also thought that even though I was 19 I was wearing my mind out completely i.e. I thought I had the mind of a 100 year old person and so I was running out of my finite numebr of thoughts.

I must have at some point taken all my clothes off, because I then remember walking round my small village completely naked with not an item of clothing on me.

The whole trip lasted for at least 14 hours as I eventually came down enough to find where I was and get back into my bedroom.  I have to tell you though, I cant image an experience ever being worse than that.

I have been an experienced drug user for about 6 years now, doing almost every drug imaginable in my past, but finally cutting it down primarily to pot and alcohol. Getting most of my drug use out of my system before even getting to college, I was more than satisfied with sticking to herb and brew. I did enjoy eating mushrooms or acid every time I got the chance due to them being relatively rare drugs around my area and have tripped shrooms about 35 times and had about 8-9 previous lsd experiences eating as much as 3 hits at a time.

Me and my friends picked up a ten strip from a total sketch job, and with the thick tabs and nice logos we figured it would be good stuff, not realizing how right we were about that. On Friday night I had drank pretty heavily despite knowing I was going to trip the next day, and got only 7 hours of sleep. Waking up tasting booze in my mouth, I knew I did not have time to nurse a hangover and had to eat the LaLa as soon as possible because I tend to have 20 hour acid experiences.

Me and my buddy both ate two hits and took the train downtown. After about 25 min. I began to feel funny and being sensitive to chemicals sensed the acid taking my to LaLa land quite quickly. We arrived to downtown Chicago, and the day was beautiful, not a single cloud in the sky and the warm sun beating down on us. We were trippin pretty good for about 3 hours, walking around and ddecided to go see a movie, Kung Fu Panda. It was one of the best times ever. Anyways when we got out of the theater the acid seemed to have calmed down and I felt like the trip was coming to an end even though it had been only 5-6 hours into it.

We decided to go over to my friends apartment because it was his b-day and he was going to have a party. We made our way up there and when he opened the door and we walked in, all of a sudden everything changedtowards the worse. He was watching the new hairspray in a very dark room and I walked up to the tv and when I saw John Travolta in the fat suit, which was hilarious, for some reason I got really REALLY really frightened. Travoltas eyes seemed really dilated and the grew huge like alien eyes. I got cold/hot flashes and the room began to cave in on me. I had my ipod and decided to go in my buddys room and listen to some weezer because they always put me in a good mood. But as I lay on his bed and began to listen to the music, everything became tooo intense. I closed my eyes and I began to see all my friends and family, EVERYONE I knew laughing happily but aging at the same time and rotting out, I saw myself graduating college, getting married growing old dying..I saw the universe and my own insignificance within it. This all sounds very cool, but it was one of the most intense incites I had ever had. I couldnt keep my eyes closed it was too scary, but when I opened them, everything was still really messed up too. The lamp shades were dancing around the lamp, a movie poster was crawling around the wall and the ceiling was wavy as if it was liquid.

I realized I was having my first bad acid trip and felt like I was about to have a psychotic breakdown. I ran out of the room and decided to talk to my friend. He has long curly hair and as he was trying to talk me down, all I saw was little versions of his face in his own hair laughing at me. My best friend now seemed like a freakish demon in my eyes. I decided to go outside and get some fresh air. I stepped outside and the sun was now setting. I had taken the cid hours ago and it took me soo long to peak that I realized I might be tripping for much longer than I had expected. I saw downtown Chicago with all the lights on and a purple sky with the sun setting and it seemed so beautiful that it hurt my eyes to look at it. In fact my eyes were so dilated that I could not really see anything more than 20 feet in front of me too clearly and people in the distance seemed hazy and unfocused. I decided to go back inside and have a beer, hoping the alcohol would take the edge off..and it did. In fact I got a pint of rum and decided to just get drunk to calm the whole trip down.

Good idea! People showed up for the party and we all ended up having a great time. But I still have goosebumps about the hour or so of hell. Because when the acid is in my head, I cannot escape it..Anywhere I go I'm still tripping, and despite my love for psychedlics I think I got my fix of the ultimate acid trip where I felt anymore would just kill me. Ive eaten 5 hits before and not tripped as hard as I did off these thick, tasteless, star branded blotters. I dont think I will trip again for at least a year, even though everything worked out ok. Setting is everything, I thought my trip was over then I switched locations and I got a mindfuck.

There had been a big drought back in 2000. There was no acid to be found anywhere. My friend and I had started experimenting with it when we had finished high school. We had done it a few times, and liked it alot.

T+06:00pm
So my friend had finally found some and boy oh boy were we excited. He came with another dude to pick me up from my house. As I got in the car he produced the tin foil the papers were in and gave me what he thought was two papers but I think he actually (by mistake) gave me four.

My friend was a dealer at the time and we had to go and pick up 4 ounces of weed from this guy. So we were driving listening to music everything was cool bananas. I remember stopping at the guys house, waiting and listening to crazy sexy cool by TLC. Now I know its not the trippiest shit but the intro song that goes for about minute sounded so gooooooooooood, so intense. I moved in a convultionary state when the beat kicked in.....

T+07:30pm
Anyway we had another stop off before we got back to my friends house. Where I dont know, by that stage I was nicely toasted and throughly enjoying myself. While waiting there I remember seeing a guy coming up the foot path my friend (who was also tripping, but on two papers) and I started giggling like mischievous kids. We locked the doors as if the guy was some sort of threat to us, but laughing the whole time.

The guy who was driving got back to the car and we left. Why our next stop was Mcdonalds is beyond me but I was fucked and cant remember. Now is when my brain meltdown commenced.

I went into Mcdee's, and on my way to the entrance I walked through the car park and noticed a man who was standing in the car park. When I looked at his face it appeared rubber-like his chin and forehead were exagarrated he looked a bit cartoony. I entered Mc'dees and waited in line. I dont really remember what I was thinking but I knew it was way to bright and way to intense to be in there on this drug, so I went back to the car.

My friends started laughing at me when I got back, I told them  it was way to fucked up in there. The guy driving went into get me food. While in there buying me food my brain lost all rational functioning thought. I started saying things like ' What are we here for ' ' What can I do '. Basically I could not think of my purpose. It felt very dumb now that I look back. I'd say' thats what I can do put on music ' But as soon as I did that I had to find another purpose. I had become uncomfortably restless. The guy came back and we started eating hamburgers. It did not taste good. Actually very yuckky. We left for my friends house. I dont remember the drive there.

T+10:00pm
At my friends house I had a sudden urge to go home and tell my mother I was trippin real hard on acid. I wanted to be home because it was the only safe place I knew. So I asked my friend to take me home. He replied that he would as soon as he finished bagging up the ounces. I really had to go home the urge was ridiculous. I said to him that I would call a cab so it would take me. He told me to wait five and he would take me straight home. I didnt agree with that I started grabbing the phone and trying to dial a cab. My friend grabbed the phone off me and hung it up. This happened about four times before I could not take it anymore. I stood up and started climbing out his window. When I was half way out my friend grabbed me and said ' man, wait two seconds and ill take you! ' I replied half-sticking out of his window ' You know when you have to go, well I gotta go '

And with that I jumped out the window and Carl Lewis sprinted down the street. 

While I was walking trying to find a phone to call a cab. My thoughts went into overdrive. All thoughts were of great meaning all of them having an idea. About 40,000 sub thoughts would branch off one giving me an insight into something which lead to another thing and so on and so on.... The brain is a powerful tool which I think we have not yet mastered, Lsd showed me that night.

While walking everything had a fluroecent hue to it. But taxis stood out like dogs balls. By this I mean they were lit up in some ' thats the way to get home ' sort of way. I stopped and sat on a curb in a street just off the main road. My brain was racing all I wanted was this drug to stop and me to be at my nice safe home, then some guy pulls up and asks me whats wrong (Very weird now I look back). I say I just need to get home, he asks again whats wrong. At this point I just am not thinking properly at all and grab the back door handle and try to get in the car but as I grab the door handle he speeds off. Gloom doom and despair. I felt trapped. As if the whole world was trying to stop me getting home. I kept walking up the main road. I went to a house and knocked on the front door and asked if I could use the phone. An old granny who I probably scared the absolute shit out of said to go away. I kept walking to a service station and finally called a cab. 

When I got in the cab I told the driver I was on acid and was not feeling to well. He had some sort of elevator music playing which just added to the effects of helplessness. As we drove under a sign for the freeway all the street letters on the sign were in arabic but yet still in english.

T+1:00pm
When I got home my thoughts started getting the better of me. I suddenly realised I couldnt talk to my mum, I was fucked upppppp. I went to bed. I was lying there looking at my clock thinking that this is how I'm going to be for the rest of my life, and mental defect. In the morning my mum would come and speak to me and would realise she had a mental patient for a son. This pattern of thinking lasted a while and then bang! It all stopped, I mean I was still fucked but the intenseness was gone. I woke the next day sweet as.

That night was a strain on the brain. But I'm so glad I experienced it. I will never forget that night. Ever.

I'd sworn to myself I'd never try Psychedelics, and, most probably, I won't do them again seeing as I've tripped around 10 times, but I've decided to share, for those looking to try Acid, my Acid experience which was almost indescribably beautiful.  Sometime this past February (2005) I was able to find a sheet of Acid with some friends, and after selling most of it off, I reserved about 5 hits to myself.  The night I had it, I decided, though only having done Acid once before (and only 1 hit) to take a large dose--3 hits.  It was supposedly quite powerful, and, as you'll read in a moment, I, at the very least, thought it was.

At around 12 AM I took my three hits, and thought I was getting ripped off for the first hour.  And then, very suddenly, I began to come up very, very quickly.  I'd been pretty experienced at that point, and was only mildly afraid.  I was with two girls, whom I liked, and a psychotic kid who I didn't like, but I'll get to that later.

The first 4 or so hours of the trip were marvelous.  It snowed 2 feet overnight, and I watched it--on three hits of acid.  The snowflakes cast the most intriguing shadows under the low-intensity lamp outside of my dorm, and they seemed to be undulating in large, beautiful shapes, spinning through and amongst each other like some kind of non-aggressive bee tribe, swirling and shooting back and forth.  I was so incredibly overwhelmed I sat down in the snow, wearing, thankfully, heavy clothing, and began to trip the fuck out.  At that point, I started getting the Fear very briefly, but luckily, I got a kiss on the cheek and magically, as if a lukewarm substance were injected into me, I started to have the most amazing visuals.  Returning to my room (because it was balls in your stomach cold) I ran into an RD who was, thankfully, Drunk out of his mind.  I reached my room and hallucinated for about 3 hours with the two girls. 

My trip only turned *mildly* bad when I was left alone with this guy.  We'll call him Fuckbag.  Fuckbag was on about a hit and a half, which I sold to him for an exorbant 15 bucks a hit (when I'd gotten it at 6.50) and he was bugging out--bad.  He was the kind of guy who filled empty space with needless conversation, and I thought he was speaking some weird, alien dialect of English that coincided only in its words rather than in sentence structure or grammar.  Finally, after listening to his raging trippy bullshit for a few hours, I came down, and had a very large, very tasty breakfast.  I know this story wasn't THAT amazing.  Peace

 I had tried to take LSD many times but none had worked and I was beginning to get very frustrated.  Most were fake blotter tabs and one was a dilute vile which messed me up but still nothing that would constitute an LSD trip (from what I have heard and read).  I finally got a hold of what I think was the real thing at a Rusted Root concert in Albany.  I had decided on the way up to the show that I was going to try and find it there and began getting very excited for the night.  I was with 3 other friends W, T, and B.  W was our driver and decided to go sober for the night.

As soon as I walked through the door I was approached by a rather shadey looking character.  He asked if I was interested in some doses and told me to follow him in the bathroom.  I was a little skeptical but proceeded anyway.  He said it was $10 a hit but told me he could give me 2 for $15.  I was planning on just one but felt obliged to buy both because of the offer.  I took the first hit and went out to the floor to meet up with my friends.  The show began about a half hour later and I decided to take the second hit because nothing was coming on.  Another half hour went by and it seemed that I felt something but I wasn't sure if it was the beginning or just anxiety.

I suggested smoking the joint we brought and all agreed.  It was a rather large joint and I figured if nothing else I was going to get really stoned.  After the first couple rips I could really feel the effects of the LSD.  The lights started to swirl and grow very defined rays off of them.  The music kept me swaying just as everyone seemed to be.  The crowd seemed to be moving together.  I began having closed eye visuals that seemed to portray what I thought the music was trying to convey.  During what seemed to be the peak of my experience they were starting a song that I was unfamiliar with.  They got a little ways into it and a loud boom shook me.  I was very startled and the mood of the crowd seemed to go sour.  The music was off and the band didn't look very happy.  After a lot racket the band started up the same song from the beginning.  This settled me down along with the rest of the crowd.  They were getting to about the point where the catastrophie had happened before and another very similar noise shook my body once again.  I was now very confused and was wondering if I was reliving past experiences, visualizing things that had already happened.  The silence of the music lasted a lot longer this time but the crowd made up for the loss of noise.  The music finally started back up again and all was well.  They played for a really long time, I think to make up for the disturbance.

We went back to W's appartment where we laughed and talked for a long time, all the while I was still getting a lot of visuals.  By the end of the night my body was exhausted but my mind was wide awake going through all that had happened.

This was my 2nd time taking LSD, and I was prepared to go balls deep since the first time I had taken it, I barely had any visuals at all nor did I have an openness of mind / speech etc. 

My friends and I decided to start super early in the morning at 6 am which is insane I know, but my previous experience with acid I had started at noon and was still tripping by 8pm even though I had wanted to go home. So I drove over to my friends house and we proceeded to take our tabs. 

I took 2 tabs, and we started walking to our tripping destination.  We really chose an awesome place to trip, a location that was secluded and had lots of space / nature / foliage to sit around and talk, and this location also had a beautiful view as well.  I noticed that I was starting to lose motor function and couldnt really walk up the hill very well, a 10 ft. incline seemed to me to be almost 50 ft. This is when I realized that I was starting to trip, and that this trip would definitely be a lot more intense than the first time I had taken it. 

At this point I was also starting to feel that everything was really funny, which I enjoyed, I have always been the type of person to find humour in everything, and this situation was no different. I have always been the type of person to find humour in everything, and this situation was no different. By the time we reached the spot, almost an hour later, my friends and I were all already tripping, we had one trip sitter, but this girl seemed like she was never sober, and it was my first time meeting her, so I wasnt quite sure what to make of her.  She ended up being one of my pillars later on during the trip. 

I sat down between two tree trunk roots and proceeded to sit in the same spot for the next 2-3 hours. Upon sitting down, I still had 2 more tabs in my pocket, and decided to take 1 more and split the other one with my friend. This was not a good idea, since I was already tripping I should have waited a bit longer but I didnt think I would have an opportunity like this again, so I took 1 more and split another half with my friend. 

An hour after that, 3 hours ish into the trip by 9:30  10 am, I was tripping really really hard.  I was unable to distinguish between reality and what was going on inside my mind.  By the time I thought to say something, my mind was already slipping into something else.  There was no difference between me closing and opening my eyes, because either way I still had a clear as a picture image of what I had just seen in my mind.  The entire world became a tracer, so every time I saw something I would see that image move along my entire scope of vision.  I didnt eat anything, and barely drank any water the entire time.  I also lost all sense of hearing, vision, etc. I felt that everything was captured in a picture and then when I saw something else, that scene would slowly drift into the next.  When I looked up at the sky, the sky had just become another part of this scene driftng.  

We had only brought 4 or 5 bottles of water, and were sorely unprepared for how dehydrated we would become.  I hated checking the time, because I had no concept of time, so I really couldnt understand how if it seemed as if I checked my phone every 10 minutes, but the time never changed.  This was really disturbing for me because I am usually a very time-conscious person. 

Apparently I kept on playing the same song over and over again, and this song also became one of my pillars, my friend whom I was tripping with was also another pillar, and my other friend whom had taken the same amount as me was another pillar.  I believe I had 4 pillars total, which was totally necessary because if I didnt have these people I would have lost my mind.  I had no concept of size, walking was impossible, I moved maybe 3  4 feet during that entire 8 hours that we were located at the tripping spot, but to me it felt like miles.  One of my friends was sitting at the same spot for an entire 8 hours, and I should have joined him, because he had the most incredible view of the city beneath us, the sky, and the landscape. 

My friends who had only taken 1 or 2 tabs were coming down at this point, around 4pm, and we all decided as a group to go back to the town, so began the long journey down the hill, it felt like hours to me, but of course to them it took maybe 20 min to get down the hill. 

I remember trying to eat a cookie as we walked down the hill, upon staring at the cookie I realized that it was morphing, I could see every molecule of the cookie roll back and forth as I tried eating it, I was extremely discouraged from eating it at this point, and I really did not want to bother this cookie, because I was convinced that it was a living being. I really did not want to bother this cookie, because I was convinced that it was a living being.  When I glanced up at the sky and the trees, I could see that everything was pulsating and alive.  Everything was beautiful and connected, I could see everything surrounding me breathing in a slow and gentle movement.  

By 6pm, we had moved to our other friends house and were just sitting and lounging around, when I walked into the room I swear that I was sunburnt, but when I went back outside to ask my friends, they said that nothing about my skin tone appeared out of the ordinary.  I realize now after shrooming, that I have a tendency to notice the red tones in my skin a lot more than usual.  I reapplied sunscreen and went back into the living room. 

We went to another friends place to watch some television around 9pm, and I was still tripping although by this point it had settled down into a more marijuana high, which I dislike. I had a dentist appt. the next morning.  At 10pm, I decided to drive home, this was a HORRIBLE decision.  At 10pm, I decided to drive home, this was a HORRIBLE decision.  I was ok when I started the engine, but right when I started driving I knew that I should have put my car back in park.  I drove in circles for at least 30 minutes before getting onto the freeway, driving on the freeway was a whole other shithole because I was terrified to drive over 65, and could barely drive 40 mph,  I maintained a 60 mph speed the entire way back home, and that was the most horrifying drive of my entire life.  I tried listening to music so I could calm down, but the forest and trees were so luminous and dark.  My car was dark as well since it was nighttime, so that made it even more difficult to focus on the road.  That 20 min. drive turned into an hour and a half since I was tripping way too hard to drive and could not even drive the speed limit. 

Once I got home, it was so hard to get back up the stairs and into my room, I was too freaked out to turn on the lights and knocked over an entire table full of stuff since I was still tripping. I tried taking a shower, and when I looked in the mirror again my entire body was still really red (of course this was still in my imagination). 

In retrospect, I would probably never take that many tabs again, I think I would max out at 2.5 or 3, and I would also never let myself get in a car since that was really unsafe and could have put my life as well as others at risk. I was truly fortunate that I did not get hurt.  

I think I tripped too hard to gain any spiritual insight into myself, since I dont really remember what I saw since the peak of the trip I spent deciphering what was in my imagination and what was reality.

It was the 2nd night of a music festival, in the back of the vendor space my friend had set up. It was him (Will), another friend (Jessica), and her friend (Kaitlyn). They all took their tabs, but I was hesitant to take mine, not trusting my subconscious self. 

They wanted us all to be on the same level, and I agreed, so I stuck however many tabs it was in my mouth.

There was a body high; a melting feeling. We girls soon went for a walk around the campgrounds. There, I noticed all the artificial lights had rainbow orbs around them. The moon was full and I saw it bounce further and closer.

There were 3 ping pong balls on the ground that I questioned were real or not. I stepped on one and thought it disappeared completely. I enjoyed playing with them in my hands for a bit. 

We kept walking, and I did naturally feel somewhat anxious/ insecure. When I closed my eyes, I saw tunnels of patterns and colors. We stumbled upon these 2 other trippers at their tent, building a meshy glowstick wall. We stood there a while staring, talking. And then we made our way back to home base/ the vendor's tent, where we left our water. There, we basically all collapsed wherever we could find to lay down. Jessica fell asleep instantly. 

I was laying, facing Kaitlyn for a while. When I'd close my eyes, I'd explore worlds inside myself. I was trying to find my way through the tunnel of anxiety, I think. I was trying to find my way through the tunnel of anxiety, I think. Also, feeling short of breath, I was trying to find my lungs but could barely find my body. I was all in my head experiencing rooms & worlds. 

When I'd open my eyes, I'd see Kaitlyn's face right there. Sober or not, this makes me uncomfortable, as I'm scared people will see inside my soul. Her gentle smile morphed into an ugly evil frown, so I closed my eyes again.

The tie dye tapestry in front of us revealed many pictures of many animals. We experienced this together for a while. 

After moving from the pile of clothes to the cushion bed sprawled out (w/ Will), I remained deeply anxious, trying to not lose myself, to observe myself. I went to pee a bit later after falling asleep, and instantly was drawn towards music. I walked over to the big tent with an incredible light show, not feeling like dancing. Just standing in the background feeling self-conscious. I came to the conclusion that I can't fake happiness anymore. Nothing that you don't feel, is real. 

Though my trip was somewhat enjoyable, I wish I could have been able to let go. I was still anxious/ self-conscious into the next day.

The last time I was fortunate enough to take LSD, I was at home with two of my friends and my folks out of town.  I had to work earlier that day, and I spent the entire day on the phone with my friend Justin trying to close a deal on some acid.  We were finally able to obtain 10 drops of some liquid on two sugar cubes, five generous drops on each.  When I finally got off my shift at work, it was arranged for me to meet Justin's friend to pick up and pay for the acid, which I did.  I went home and immediately put the sugar cubes in the fridge to keep the acid 'fresher' for the night's activities.  My friend Justin showed up and we went out and got some Chinese take-out to wait for Kyle.

When we got back to my house we decided to make my traditional 'house drink' for Kyle since he wasn't going to be dropping any acid.  Basically, my drink consists of a little bit of everything we have in the liquor cabinet, a pitcher of OJ, and a lot of Peach Schnapps and some pure grain alcohol (195 proof!) that my dad had in the back of the liquor cabinet.  We pour all the alcohol into a pitcher full of OJ and shake really well.  It's surprisingly good, too.  Since my parents were out of town for the weekend, Justin and I were both very relaxed and basically stress-free for the weekend, so we both went into the trip with a positive mind-set.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

Kyle showed up around 9 p.m., we all had a few of my house drink, and Justin and I dissolved our sugar cubes in our mouths (T +0:00).  We all piled into Kyle's car and drove down to the waterfront and the beach to await the coming trip.  We sat on the dock for a while and talked, and after about 40 minutes I began to feel tingling in my extremities and in my chest.  I glanced over to Justin, who had a big smile on his face, and I knew he was beginning to feel it, too.  I looked down and noticed that the grain in the wood of the dock had re-arranged itself into some sort of tribal-looking patterns (T +0:45).  We decided to drive back to my place so we could enjoy the trip more (our laughter and comments were beginning to draw some looks), so we got back into Kyle's car and drove back.  When we got back, we decided to bring the pitcher of OJ/hard alcohol upstairs and watch a movie on the entertainment system.  I popped in Beavis and Butthead Do America and we all sat back to enjoy.

By this time (T +1:15) my trip was really getting going, and I began hearing strange, wondrous sounds in the background of the movie, and all the characters had a different look to them that was hard to describe.  I was getting lost in the world of sounds and colors of the movie, and my mind was beginning to wander into an altered state.  Then the scene when Beavis eats the peyote in the desert came on.  Beavis's trip began, and mine was climbing to a peak.  Beavis's trip is pretty strange, especially when I'm tripping as well, and I was getting weirded out by all the sounds and creatures and colors, so I turned the movie off.  When I did, my entire TV screen turned blue (as it usually does when you hit stop on the VCR), but I was mesmerized by the 52 of high definition bright blue in front of me.  It seemed to envelope my entire being, and the whole universe became nothing but a serene, bright blue.  Nothing existed but myself and the blue, and it began to present ideas to me about my life and how I live, and I was able to look at my life more objectively and realize things I had never known about myself and why I do the things that I do.  I began to realize that everything and everyone is connected in some inexplicable way, and that the things we do to each other reflect back on ourselves and on the universe as a whole.  I realized that many people dont know this or dont seem to care, and that this is a shame, but at the same time I realized that I must accept this fact, and that everything, good or bad, is part of a bigger picture and plan and must be accepted.  The blue was pulsating with serene light and there were strange, indescribable sounds all around me, and they were a part of the blue, too.  The blue seemed to want to envelope me, and I welcomed it, but I was at the same time apprehensive about letting myself go into it completely.  I believe now that if I had let this happen, there would have been complete dissolution of the ego and I would have become a part of one huge blue sea of being and one with the universe.  I hesitated for some reason I still cant understand (perhaps just fear of the unknown), and Kyle, who had gotten himself into an alcohol-induced slumber, woke up and turned on Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

I snapped from my trance once the blue disappeared from the screen and decided to go downstairs and put on some music and wash the dishes.  I went downstairs, where I found Justin on the back porch in the light rain staring up at the stars.  At this point (T +2:45) I was starting to peak, and the outside wasnt the place to be for me  mainly because the raindrops landing on the hood of the gas grill turned into serpent-like eyes, and then they looked like serpent scales and the grill turned into a huge dragon.  I went inside and put some Phish and Grateful Dead in the CD player on random and began the dishes.  When the dishes were over, I had just reached my plateau for the night (T + 3:15), and Justin and I went back upstairs to sit in the bonus room (big living room area over the garage with the computer and entertainment system, etc.) and burn some incense and listen to some music and trip our minds off.

Kyle started messing around with the special features on the Monty Python DVD and found some trailers for some really tripped-out movies: Stanley Kubricks Dr. Strangelove Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, some fucked-up movie called The City of Lost Children (The best visual effects of 1995, 1996, and possibly 1982) and another one called Baron Munchausen.  This last one was for some reason incredibly hilarious to all three of us, and we laughed our asses off for a good 40 minutes straight.  Later, Justin went into my room to listen to music and try to enjoy the remainder of his trip and get some sleep, Kyle had passed out again, and I put on some music and tried to get some sleep.  In the total darkness, it was easy for my eyes to convert the blackness to blueness, and I spent the rest of the night (T +4:30  T +8:00) in a sort of trance, wandering into far-off corners of my mind, all the while being embraced and enfolded by the blue.  I guess I nodded off to sleep at some point, because the next thing I knew, it was morning and I had to get up and get ready for another day of work.  We all sat around on the floor of the bonus room and ate Cocoa Krispies, shared stories about the night, and had a good laugh over Baron Munchausen.  All in all, it was a wonderful night full of new discoveries, and Ive been looking forward to my next trip into the blue.

One night I was with a couple of my friend my friend Rob, D, and Jamie. One night Rob hit me up and asked if I could get him some solid acid and being so fortunate to know a guy with some decent cid. I help him aquire enough for all of us but my friend Jamie wasn't taking any just trip watching us. This all happens around 10PM

We take the tabs in my friends jamies car and realized that we had no where to trip at and we didnt not have enough gas to be just driving around. We decided to go to some tunnels inside of a gulf course near D's house. Jamie parks the car and I see my friend Rob get out with a huge backpack. Not asking anything we proceeded into the small opening in the middle of the course.

45 We are in complete darkness. My friend Rob brings out LED flashlight from this huge bag and hands us all some glow sticks. We turn on the light and crack all the glow sticks. At this moment I knew that we were about to start tripping. I look down the tunnel and it started stretching and I kept moving farther and father away. I snap out of it and realize it was all in my head. We start walking down this dark tunnel by flashlight looking at all the graffiti bombings on the walls. Most of them were very well done and the colors of it all was very vivid the red looked red-er, black looked darker then normal if you know what I mean. 

We finally get tired of walking around in the tunnel and sit down in a spot and just talk and smoke. My friends are just tripping I could tell. I look at my friend D's face and his eyes looked empty like a body with no soul. And Rob was chill he was enjoying himself laughing talking with the group. We get tired of the light and wanted to sit in pitch black for the hell of it so we turned the light off. The OEV were strong things felt like they were flying past me in weird shapes.  Out the corner of my eye I saw a light coming from the glowstick but ignored it and that made my visuals spin start moving in all directions.

D had gotten the idea of cutting the glowsticks and throwing the liquid all on the sides of the pitch black tunnel. After he had opened about 4 of them and covering the walls with the liquid we turned off the light again. Stars... All I could think of is stars. I stared strait at 1 in particular start and it didnt move but everything around it was morphing trying to take the star I was looking at but concentrating on it was the only thing keeping it still. I close my eyes and the only thing that changed was the stars were gone.

We all start to want to move to a new spot out side of the tunnels. So we get out of the tunnel and onto the gulf course at about 2 in the morning and walk to my friend D's house to kick it on his porch. On the way out of the tunnel I felt like I was sewer people or something the world outside just looked new and glorious. We walk off and I notice the ground that I was walking on was like cement on a gulf course not so much as hard but as sturdy. We got to his house and sit at the table he had set up in the front.

After about 2 more hours we were just talking and out of the blue a pair of red small lights look at me. I looked back... All I could see was a shadow behind Rob's shoulder with red piercing eyes. I was dumbfounded I couldnt move talk or blink I could only stare. It moved side to side as if it was going to take Rob alive. As soon as he got close to Rob I guess Rob went to reach for something on the table and the shadow collapsed right before my eyes. If you have seen paranormal activity 3 then its the part were the ghost uses the bed sheets and it looks like a person but then the sheet collapses on its own into nothing... Same thing happened. I was in complete shock and my eyes were tearing. I didnt tell my friends about it for some reason. I was compelled not to like if I told them what I had saw I would be releasing a bigger burden onto them so I kept it to my self. After our peek went down enough to look publicly non-intoxicated we went to Jack  in the box and talked.

I'd never had any experiences with psychedelics that widened my perception before the night in question. Unlike Huxley with mescaline, it took some doing before my doors of perception would be opened, and it wasn't cacti that did it for me, it was the synthesis of cereal grain mold we call d-Lysergic Acid Diethylmide, or LSD (an abbreviation of the german spelling). I'd been taking Acid awhile by then, and knew it was capable of weird stuff, but I was young then and had no real compass. It was just another drug, and it stayed that way until Christmas of 2014 when I took more than I ever had. I guess I was a bit down, with it being the holidays and there I was alone eating Acid with the phone off.

This night something altogether different would happen. I'd heard doses over 400 mics could cause some very otherworldly things to happen, I'd taken a pretty random sized square of high potency blotter I'd taken a pretty random sized square of high potency blotter acid that was likely more like 600mcg, whatever happened when you overdose on Acid, I was going to find out. I was prepared with a benzo and some opiates should it just get out of control,  but again, I had never had it happen and might not recognize it if it began. Tonight, it would happen. I would see that other side... I listened to David Bowie's Diamond Dogs at some point during the trip (the record has become essential for tripping ever after, I find it very comforting for some reason) and at some point saw Bowie himself staring down at my supine body (he hadn't died yet)--I didn't remember laying down, but I must have just found my way there in my reverie. This was the last normal thought I remember having, the next got really weird, the kind of stuff that scared Dr. Rick Strassman away from his DMT experiments; a spiritual encounter.

There was a void of pure light with a very simple temple far in the distance, pyramidal but flat topped with no outer inscriptions beyond a rune above the door. I think this was the name of God. I can't remember what we said, but we spoke for a time, and when the time came to return to my body, it felt ravaged. Particularly by drink.

I should mention I'd been a pretty nasty alcoholic up until my night in God's court; 3-4 litres of whiskey a week, sometimes more. I was quite disoriented when I got back from the high dose Acid trip, but one thought was quite clear in my mind; the drinking was over. I was quite disoriented when I got back from the high dose Acid trip, but one thought was quite clear in my mind; the drinking was over. Not 'The drinking will stop soon' or 'I need to moderate my drinking'...it wasn't like that, I had quit pretty vehemently during my concourse in the light. The smell of ethanol makes me gag, beer smells like farts, and wine like grape juice someone left in the sun. It was OVER, I tell you.

I've had social drinks since, because fucking-everybody-and-their-gottdamned-uncle drinks and it's hard to avoid, but it's 1 or 2 to be polite and that's all. What transpires next is dismaying and reinforcing at the same time, a room full of people get drunk and I don't, I won't, I can't betray what Thompson called "the Great Magnet", but those who imbibe become shameless. Animals looking to rut or throw up. Disgusting.

As an age seasoned partier, I often think back to my 20s when acid tripping was a common weekend activity. Often yearning for those happy days. Now my life was work and care filled for my dear wife and other commitments. When an old friend mentioned he scored some blotter, I could not resist a trip after nearly 2 decades of sobriety. My wife was gone for a weekend on a business trip so I went for it.                                                                     

On a saturday about noon, I dropped 2 hits of the blotter, I turned on the tv without sound and set the stereo to a classic rock station. After an hour of thinking maybe it was bogus blotter. I felt a tingle of excitement creeping over me. As the pattern in the carpet began to dance with the music, I felt warm all over. Like an old friend gave me a hug. I watched the tv characters fumble through their roles. I even began to understand what they were saying despite the music. Everything they did was unusually funny and I rocked with laughter. I never felt so good, I was in complete control of my mind. I never felt so good, I was in complete control of my mind. As the walls shimmered and vivid color patterns danced on the wall to the music, I wondered why I had feared returning to acid land. I was the trip master. I was at the top of the world.                                                                   

It was now about 3 hours after dropping, and I noticed objects in the room seemed out of place. The picture of my wife was hanging on the wall, but it was on the wrong wall. I struggled to my feet and examined the picture closely, as an average gal it was an average picture. The chrome picture frame glowed brightly, it almost blinded me with its brilliance. As I stared, she morphed into the most pretty girl I'd ever seen like ms america. The she melted into a demon girl, with fangs and blood dripping from her mouth. In horror I stumbled away back to the couch.                                                                     

The peak washed over me in waves, time had no meaning. The beautiful carpet patterns changed to a dark fearful pit. Paranoid I lost all sense of comfort. As the walls flashed thru colors at a maddening speed the room grew darker. My heart raced, my stomach tightened into a knot. I knew I was dying. The music faded away and seemed very distant. Visions of my life flashed thru my mind. The couch seemed hot and sticky, and I couldn't move. It seemed like hours and hours I was numb and confused. I stared at the wall unable to move, visuals of all shapes seemed to suffocate me.  

Finely my mood lifted, the grip acid had on my mind began to ebb. Although I was still tripping, I could stand up. I was hungry, it took me 15 minutes to make a sandwich. When I bit into the sandwich it felt like mushy goo. I threw it into the sink and stumbled back to the couch. 

As I lay there thinking 1000 thoughts per minute, I realized I will never trip again. I was too old, I felt ancient. The young party days of the past seemed like a distant memory. The young party days of the past seemed like a distant memory. I wanted the trip to end, but it dragged on till I felt hollow inside. The dancing walls were fading fast, so I took a walk outside. The fresh air seemed to bring me back. My mood improved. 

Although the trips ride up was exhilerating, I went thru 3 or 4 hours of hell. I have no regrets, I knew what I was in for. Over time we all tend to remember the good trips and forget the bad ones. I did them all in one day. 

Exhausted I went to bed at 9pm and watched faint patterns on the ceiling until I fell asleep.

I had the evening off at one point over the summer, so I decided to go camping with a few of my friends who were already doing so for the week. I drove down, and on the way smoked two bowls, one as soon as I left my house and one when I was almost at the campsite.

When I got there, I was hallucinating. I thought that there were two amish children standing at the far end of the parking lot, waiting to kill me when I left my car, so I ended up taking a golf club with me for protection. Also, the campsite sign said 'Umbrella Fantastic' as I entered, instead of 'Camp *****'. I walked to the campsite by myself, as it wasn't dark yet and I wasn't too disoriented, especially since I had been to this particular grounds many times before.

I met up with my friends, who nominated me to light the fire. Please take note that campfires and being well beyond stoned do not go hand in hand AT ALL, and I ended up with a few 2nd degree bruns on my hand as a result. I ended up giving the firelighting rights to another of my friends and I started telling stories - simple ones that I was familiar with, giving overly animated sound effects and being very outgoing and very loose in telling them. After my second story, I got up and went to stand by the water and watch the moon light up the night.

At this point I dropped three hits of medium-powered strip acid under my tongue and sat back to relax. There was a watersnake going over the water that was at least 6 feet long, something which was backed up by people around me who were sober.
About an hour later, I walked off into the woods, almost getting lost (although I didn't, thanks to the help of one of my sober friends), and I smoked another bowl to help sooth the pain of the burns on my hand, and then lay down on my sleeping bag in the canvas tent that the group was sleeping in.

As soon as I lay down, I could feel the LSD kick in. The music coming from my friend's headphones became louder and I felt as if my soul was struggling to dig in his direction to hear the music better. Soon enough, I could hear it all, and it blended with the crickets and the birds and the wind in the trees and for a few moments I could hear everything around me in perfect detail.
The canvas tent roof above me, a standard army green, began to subtley swirl and reverberate, swaying with the music.
I began to see rose-shaped fractals woven into the dull fabric of the tent, and I could see the weave as more than just the way the cloth had been made - it swirled and spun and linked every fiber together to make a protectorate roofing.

As the fractals and interwoven shapes got stronger and more apparent I began to close my eyes. I began to float, and I could not feel any of my weight acting upon the surface I was lying on. I was weightless. And then I fell asleep.
I slept on my back, which is very very rare for me, and I did not wake at all, which is good seeing as I commonly do.
I dreamed very little that night, seeing only vast black expanses lit by strange glowing shapes, floating around me like electrons in orbit. This went on for infinity, and the only remarkable things about the dreams were that I could feel and perceive everything around me as if I was one hundred percent sober and straightfaced, and also that my mind did not process any thoughts other than those concerning the absolute beauty of the expanse around me.

When I woke up I felt as if I was cleansed, and although my burns had turned to blisters, I could not feel any pain from them. After getting up and packing my stuff relatively quickly, I said goodbye to my friends, and drove home to eat a 'real' breakfast.

Bad Trip?

Well I sort of suck at writing shit down, but I had the most fucked up trip ever. When I was fifteen me and my friends discovered this great drug for five bucks a pop, that would get us off for hours.

We did acid for a year straight (not every day of course but as often as we could). Doing as much as six hits at a time. Never once did I experience any dragons flying through the sky or mickey mouses trying to kill me. Nothing but good times, hard-core laugh attacks, fun hallucinations, and mind fucks. After awile it became scarce, because I'm from a small town in Ontario. During six months of no acid, me and my family started fighting all the time, because my parents were into church and I was into drugs. I lost my best friend over something stupid, and I was trying to pretend like nothing was wrong. I was trying to forget about everything by not thinking about any of my problems.

Acid came back to town. Me and four friends decided to drop, so we each got a hit. Then we walked through a blizzard back to my friends place. As soon as we walked inside and the warm air hit us we started to trip. We went up-stairs in an attic bedroom and started to trip with two other people, who were just smoking weed.

The first thing I noticed when we sat down was a red line coming out of Sam's head, going into Pam's head (they were going out). The image of lighter popped out of his head traveled across the red line and into her head, she pulled out a lighter and lit his smoke.

The line and the lighter both looked like the red lines in a 3-D book when your wearing the glasses. My first feeling was excitment, but when I questioned them they didn't know what I was talking about. I can't clearly remember everything after this because it was so fucked up, but I will try to explain it as best I can.

Everything was very spiritual. Native American spiritual. I kept seeing their thoughts, thinking that it was only us doing it out of the 7 people that were there, thinking that the reason they denied it was, that if they talked about it, it would make them crazy. Then the excitement left when I realized every one could do it. I felt like life was a big conspiracy and I was the only one that didn't know. Every one looked like they had war paint on, but the main one was a fox over my friend Sam's right eye. It was a spirit, telling me riddles and I had to guess them or I would go crazy. I don't remember the riddles, but I do remember feeling every emotion as the trip went on. They would come like a beat. I would feel proud for a certain amount of time then it would change to humiliation for a certain amount of time so on and so forth. Until every emotion was felt, then it would go through them again except faster, by the end of my trip I felt every emotion in about 5 seconds. back to the beginning. The scariest thing about it was that it felt like a big dejavous(I can't spell). It felt like I went though this all before and when I died I would be born again into the same life because I royaly screwed up, and there was nothing I could do to change it. It felt like all my friends  really lived in a spirit world where every minute could be an hour And I was the only one living in my world my untill I did it right. I was left in the dark.

Always looked forward to tripping and usually did it amongst friends or solo. Hadn't eaten much food for a couple of days and had been active not sleeping much. Took ten fresh blotters all together.

At 15 years old in 1969 I took my first lsd trip and from then up until the middle of the 90s I took lsd whenever it was available. When it was available I would take it weekly which meant I could be taking it for a month or two or just a couple of weeks before it became less available again. Sometimes years passed before it was available again so it was always a bit of a buzz when I came across it again. 

Anyway it became available to me one more in the middle of the 90s. I got hold of a couple of microdots to begin with which were always my favourite and a guaranteed 6 hour trip. Then some paper trips became available but I found the strength of them to be a bit weak and I was taking at least four at a time to get anything near a decent trip. 

Anyway one night a friend turned up with some papers fresh off the boat and wanting to make sure I had a good trip I went for the big one and took ten. It knocked my socks off and I went on the most amazing journey I had ever had on lsd. Every trip I had before this one I had been in control of no matter how strong the hallucinations were I could always control them. This trip was completely different though because not only did I lose control I lost my sense of everything around me and went completely subjective. The first thing I remember is popping right out of my body which I could see lying on the floor against the living room wall. I dont remember everything about what went on but I do remember some really heavy stuff like the death of ego where it felt like every thought or idea I had ever had was being ripped out of me like having a limb ripped off and having the pain to go with it. And being aware of all the mistakes I had made in life and having this overwhelming urge to kick myself for every time I said yes when I should have said no and vice versa. 

At another stage I found myself in the past surrounded by a bunch of those ancient greek philosophers and watching the world being formed out of atoms. Then I found myself in what I can only discribe as a victorian classroom sitting at an old desk and looking at a blackboard that had some kind of formula written on it and I had an overwhelming feeling of the world being made out of wood and everything being all creaky. And in what seemed to be a dungeon where a guy was strapped into a chair and two guys in white coats were saying that he was mad and the guy was thinking to himself if they were experiencing what I am experiencing they wouldnt be thinking I am mad. There was something about being in outer space as well where I was watching what seemed to be a galaxy of stars swirling about and in the motions of the stars I could see things that happened on earth like a man and a woman making love. 

Finally, or what I recall as being the last part of this trip, there was nothing but blackness and my mind and two other minds. I had to remember something but every time I did the other two minds already knew what I had remembered so I had to remember something else, something new. I finally came back to my senses repeating the word 'forward' over and over until I realised where I was.

Although that trip blew me away a couple of weeks later I took another one, my last, just to make sure I still had a good grip on reality and to prove to myself that I wasn't frightened to go there again.

The day was young and I was at my home pondering what could come for the weekend ahead of me. Before I knew it a family friend had brought over another one of my buddies,who had just taken a hit of acid. Since we had been interested in LSD for a while now and our dealer had obtained some what better time than now to do it.After he tripped in my brothers room for about 20 minutes and we had gone out to smoke a cigarrette and then piled into the Justins car and drove to his apartment.I walked in and our dealer was watching a movie on with his lady friend.The anticipation was killing me,with all this talk about tripping balls from my friend vince who was the one tripping in my brothers room.At first I was unsure about doing it,but there was no stopping now.

After an hour or so,when the movie was done we walked over to my dealers apartment.I patiently waited as he cut the acid for me,after handing it to me I had put it on my tongue and thought to myself 'well there is definatly no going back now,what ever happens happens'.We walked back to Justins apartment and I eagerly awaited the acid to crash over me.

Time had passed now and I was staring at a candle to see if anything would happen,and before I knew it the candle started to move and I decided to move to another seat and see what else would trip me out.My focus had slipped onto Justins coffee table,the rings from his coffee mugs had begun to form a stack of skulls,and from that spawned a whole grave yard pulsing different colors.I studied his table for about 20 minutes and decided I would probably have more visuals if I shut my eyes,when I did that all the sounds in the room composed a song with visuals dancing along.After this we decided to have a cigarette.

On a balcony now,tripping about as hard as I've ever tripped before,eyes fixed on the sky waiting for it to crash down on me or something like that.Suddenly a cloud began to take form of a skeleton warrior riding a dragon straight towards me,oddly enough I wasn't frightened,I was just happy about what I was seeing.Soon my brother had arrived with his friend and they watched as me and Vince tripped balls laughing freely.

After a while Justin drove me to another friends house after taking Vince and me off roading for a little while.When I arrived at his house I was just about to peak.Everything in his house took part in this pychodelic extraviganza taking me for a ride.The spirals upon his pipe began to spin,designes and symbols around the room spinning or doing something else unorthodox,his carpet turned to sea below me and the designes on them began to spin.By this time everythign was going great for me,untill I made the mistake of going on the interenet and posting a bulliten on myspace about me peaking on LSD,and of course my girl friend read this and was not happy at all,in fact she was about to break up with me,and even with all of that going on it did not affect me in the least.I would have expected that experiance to send me into a burning downward spiral straight into a bad trip,but it did'nt.

Being there for a while now and beginning to feel unwelcome it was time to go home.My brother had driven me home and the drive home was just as intense as anything.After saying good night to my mother,me and my brother decided to go in the hot tub and smoke a bowl(after smoking alot earlyer in the evening,which I had forgot to mention).When we got in the hot tub I noticed things where still tripping me out and I was still in fact tripping,because I had thought I came down before I got in the hot tub.We spent a while in the hot tub listening to music,and then I decided to go to bed.Of course before going to bed I had to listen to Tool,because,one I was one acid,Two Tool is good music,3 Tool is good music especially when you're high so why wouldnt it be great when you're on acid.After falling into tool for a while I finally made my way to bed.At first it was nice and peacfull,a nice vision of a well in the middle of forest blanketed by a purple haze with creatures strewn about.All of the sudden the vison became very bright and it was hard to sleep but I eventually fell asleep.

Acid was one of the best times I've had,the visuals where very interesting and have had me wondering for a while,trying to dissect just exactly what they could mean,because to me they where there for a reason,I believe drugs simply tap into different places of the mind by releasing certain chemicals. All though I promised my lover I would never do it again,but I have to say if I had the chance again I would most likely do it.

9:30 PM:

I pick up two blotter tabs of Acid and take them there. My brother was driving, and my wife and I took the acid. We get to the movie theater around 10:00, and I could definitely feel myself coming up as we bought the tickets for a 10:30 showing.

The previews come on, and I go to get popcorn. I tried extremely hard to appear normal, and it seemed to be working. I was coming up, and harder than I ever had before on a hallucinogen. I bought popcorn and a drink, and began to see the sparkles in the theater's floor start looking like stars in the distance as I walked. From here, I was tripping and things got unusual. 

I'll try to explain as best as possible. We were seeing 'Where the Wild Things Are', based on the children's book. We were not counting on this being a terrifying, dark and depressing movie. To make matters worse, my experience watching the movie was essentially me being the character. I now fully understand what it feels like to be another person. I felt this kid's emotion, and better yet, I could smell every scene, feel everything. I smelt water at the ocean, I was cold when it snowed, I felt snow fall on my face. I was terrified at times, happy at others.

I had to tell myself that as long as I stayed in that chair, I would not die. At times, I couldn't even feel the chair. I would grab onto my wife's hand, and she felt like my only tether to reality. 

All in all, the movie felt like it lead me into a fantastic trip the rest of the night. Like it was guiding me through it almost. It felt as if the movies was years long, but was over before it started. The rest of the night was amazing as soon as I got home and felt safe. However, watching this movie allowed me to fully think and feel like a 6 year old, fully understanding that i was only imagining everything, yet still actually seeing these fucked up adults as fun, brutal monsters. It may have been a masterpiece of a movie, I may have been blown, or it was both.

One beautiful July evening, two friends and me decided it was a prime time to eat some acid. I was giddy with excitement so I called up my dealer and bought six hits, two for each of us. As soon as we got our hands on it, we put the vinegary paper on our tongues and began walking towards the beach.

As we arrived at the beach, the effects began slowly creeping upon me. I was light, and felt as if I were floating like a fairy. Everything I looked upon began to get that familiar halo-like outline to it. We passed through a huge crowd who were watching the Fourth of July fireworks.

We came to a large patch of grass with tall trees all around and decided we should lie down there. This is when I began to come up. My body started to feel electrically numb. The fireworks and stars were breathtakingly fantastic. We noticed a large group of alpha-male types having a vicious circle fight right near us so we got up and moved on.

At this point I was aware that time had gone out the window. My mind became flooded with rapid-fire thoughts. I was dumbfounded when I looked up to notice the grass and dirt beneath my feet waving like a liquid ocean. I walked up to a tall evergreen and put my hand on it. It was as if I could feel the tree exuding some life force onto my hand.

One of my friends ran into two friends of his and we followed them to one of their apartments. When we walked down the apartment hallway, I hallucinated massively. As I walked down the hallway, black paisley patterns would be magically painted onto the walls in my wake. We arrived at the apartment and all sat down on the couch to roll up a fat joint or two. Every time I closed my eyes a brilliant shimmering curtain of rainbow colored flower petals would dance about.

At this point in the trip I experienced a level of awkwardness difficult to even describe. I couldnt keep eye contact with anyone because I felt they were reading my thoughts. When I glanced up at my friends buddy he appeared to have four eyes and an elongating stretching chin. A little freaked out but nothing to worry about, just a side effect of the drug. However, throughout the entire trip I was laughing and giggling on and off.

When the joints were rolled we proceeded outside into the night and climbed on top of the restaurant my friend worked at. Up there on that roof we watched the town below and smoked joints. On the way down I almost stepped off the roof due to a lack of being in my body. This scared the shit out of me and I slapped myself back into it and climbed down the ladder.

Later one friend left to catch the bus home so my one friend and me left wandered aimlessly around the dark streets of our small town. We walked up some round grassy hills and then lied down on the top. This was one of the coolest parts of my trip. I was literally leaving my body and flying into the complex cosmos of stars. We lay there for an immeasurable amount of time.

Eventually, I became exhausted and decided to go home. Bad idea. When I got there I lay naked on my bed in the fetal position. My mind began working overtime and hyper-analyzing my life and future. This was mentally exhausting and I was still slightly tripping when the sun rose the next day.

Overall, a very positive experience and it will not be my last.

Amazing

First, let me tell you a little about me. I'm 17. I've smoked pot for years, done ecstasy enough times, explored the effects of DXM, popped many type of pills, but I never did acid. Main reason: hard to find. But one night, about 6 months ago, I did get some....

It all started one Saturday night, when I decided to spend the night over at Daniel's house. Two other friends, Kevin and Sean were also staying over at Daniel's house, too. Daniel's older brother, David, was also staying there. Sean came and picked me up and drove to Daniel's house, even though Kevin and Daniel weren't going to be there for about another two hours. Once we got there, we just watched T.V. with David. A co-worker of mine (at that time) called me and said he had some acid for $5 a hit. So, I decided to buy six hits. That's two for me, two for Sean, and two for Franz (another friend of ours that wasn't spending the night at Daniel's house). After purchasing the acid, we drove to Franz's house to drop off his two hits. When we arrived back to Daniel's house, I examined the acid: small, white paper blotter with a red triangle in the middle.

Sean and me didn't think that these little pieces of paper could do anything. So, Sean and me carelessly put our two hits in our mouths. After thirty minutes, with no effects, I started to doubt if it was even real acid. But fifteen minutes after that I felt it's first effect. I was sitting on the couch, with Sean and David, and a just started laughing and giggling. Then Sean started doing it. David just thought we were acting like fools. I specifically remember me and Sean turned upside down on the couch and started 'walking' on the ceiling. I, then, realized that we did indeed get real acid. Daniel and Kevin soon came home and we told them that we were tripping our balls off. Kevin knew some knowledge about acid and he said we would probably be tripping for the next twelve to sixteen hours. I never thought acid lasted so long. Sean and me got worried, because we both had to work the next day at ten in the morning. Daniel had a dime-size joint, so we walked outside and started smoking it. Daniel started joking around, saying 'Whoa dude, your tripping' and 'You getting any visuals'. Daniel was also acting like he was going to hit me. That was when I started to feel the anxiety and nervousness that acid gives you. Almost like you have a sense of false security.

We got back inside the house and David, Daniel, and Kevin decided to go to bed. That was when Sean and me started peaking. My mind felt like it had million of questions, statements, thoughts, images, and colors racing threw it all at the same time. I found very simple things to be very amusing. Like staring at the ceiling, watching T.V., or playing with a cigarette. Sean had a pair a glow sticks and he soon began to wavy them around in different patterns and shapes. I found it very fascinating to look at them. Time only seemed to creep by. I remembered that Franz had also taken two hits and that he had to work the next day at eight in the morning. I didn't call him because I was so paranoid from the acid.

Everything that I looked at had an extra sparkle, even if it was dark in room. I began to worry if I was going to be able to going work, letting the acid get the best of me. But it was now six in the morning and I was still tripping, along with Sean. We watched cartoons for a while, and drank some milk. I walked over to the window and glanced outside. The sun's rays were just starting to come up. I was dazzled by the sky. It looked like someone littered the sky with watercolors. Then colors would change rapidly. 

We soon realized that we were going to have to go to work tripping still. I wasn't getting visuals still, but I could still see tracers, and I'd still see things in multi-colors. So did Sean. On our way to work I can still feel the nervousness that acid give you. Sean dropped me off, and told me that he'd call me later. 

At work, I'm a cashier. So, I had to interact with people a lot. I didn't like that idea. You could tell a difference in the way a talked to people. I'd try to avoid people, customers, and employees. My manager said I looked tired. I told her that I was out late last night. The effects completely whore off over the next couple hours at work.

Acid made me look at life in a new way. To explore my boundaries. If I could do acid again I would. I think it's amazing how acid makes you see and think about things. Oh ya, Franz tripped that night for his first time, too. Only he was alone. Now that would be weird.

LSD Microdosing Movement

Ive had a small cap of 100ug LSD (it was mixed with sugar and put in an empty pill capsule) sitting in my refrigerator for a while. Being interested in microdosing, but was unsure how.  After a long internet search, decided to put the full cap in 100ml of vodka. Wanted to wait for 24hours before having some, but that same day I was going to be part of a Contact Improvisation JAM (a space for movement improvisation either alone or with more people), so I was very interested on how would touch feel with microdosing. 

I left the cap to dissolve for around 2 hours before taking 0.6ug before heading to the event (around 18:15). While on traffic (I was not driving) (around 18:50) songs sounded in loud and amazing, had to do a full karaoke moment. Usually Im really nervous while on traffic since where I live you can get mug in that situation really easy, but I felt really calm and with no anxiety in my body. I was more focused on the singing part. 

Got to the I.C. JAM around 19:05. Movement and touch felt the same, but I laugh more than usual. Movement and touch felt the same, but I laugh more than usual. We did like 2.5 hours of full moving on our own and with partners. I did not feel interested in doing lifts or more complex stuff, I was more interested in playing and improvising with the music. I was sweating a lot! (more than my usual and more than anyone else) Drank 2 glasses of water.  There was some food, but I was not hungry at all. 

Finish activity at 22:30. I was feeling energetic, so decided to head to a dancefloor. On the way there, had half a joint. This made me feel spaced out and relaxed. Got to the club and order 1 rum&coke; with a looooot of ice. That drink, plus one glass of water, got me dancing up until 1:30am. I was not feeling super excited but more like if Ive had a great nap and could just keep up for a long time. Decided to leave the club of a responsibility aspect of actually getting up the next day, but my energy could have kept me longer. 

When I got home (2:00) I got right to bed. Sleep really well and was able to wake at 7:30 for work. Work that day went by with me feeling happy and carefree. I even got a lot of painting done that night after work, still feeling inspire with every song that came up and all the color palette. 

First impression is that micro dosing gave me the energy Im usually lacking to get things done and enjoy present moment.

Introduction to LSD *FUN*

I found it easier to list all I did, then sum up with my mindset etc at the end. 

I had gone out to the bar with some friends and upon returning grew rather bored. I had been wanting to try LSD for some time now and a friend had gifted me with about 16 hits of blotter a few days before. Now I didn't know what a standard dose of blotter looked like *it was all in one strip* and I figured I might be alone for my trip so I asked a pal to deal me out what he thought would be a very light dose. He cut roughly four hits off of the strip and I placed them under my tongue at about 2:45am. I then started playing Madden 2k5 with a friend.

The drug took maybe 45 minutes  before I noticed an effect after which I swallowed the blotter. I felt a mild euphoria and grinned alot. Madden became more and more difficult to play. I began experiencing interesting visuals, but nothing overpowering (objects shifting very slightly, things taking on a 'glow'). AFter what seemed like a very long time *but in retrospect was likely only 15 minutes or so* I became convinced that because of the low dose this would be the extent of my trip. *The day before one of my friends who'd never tripped before took 8 squares with the guy that gave them to me and thought this was a good beginning dose. I am now glad I started with 4!* I wasn't dissapointed and resolved to try a higher dose the next time I was with my friends.

This feeling went on for probably another 15 minutes before I began to experience more powerful hallucinations. I could no longer play madden as the floor kept distracting me with it's movement, patterns, etc. At this point I bid the only guy still awake goodnight and went back to my apartment. Upon entering the hall I saw an array of rainbows being cast from the hall lights and clearly remembering saying to myself, 'This fucking rocks!'. I believe I may have stayed in the hall staring at the pretties for quite awhile though I'm not sure. I went into my apartment feeling just a little bit nervous about tripping for my first time alone. However I felt confident in my ability to keep myself level and began to play guitar. Or attempt to play guitar. I found my fingers reacted very sluggishly and could play nothing even remotely complex. After giving this up with some reluctance *I REALLY wanted to play, had some great ideas just couldn't get 'em out* I caught sight of myself in the mirror. Things were a little bit wierd here as I was able to change the way my face looked by consentrating on it. I made the images of an old man, satan and an alien appear. I noticed also a hypersensitivity to my appearence. I noticed every pore, every whisker, every fault with my face. I remember thinking to myself that I should never break up w/my girl because I'm an ugly fuck and how the hell could she stand sleeping with me? This caused me to want to shave. >8D I found this difficult because I kept getting distracted by shit. I then took a shower and the tactile sensations of the water hitting me became very unbearable. I also spooked myself a bit when I caught my reflection in the faucet. 

After this is when the trip starting going...not bad per se, but not totally enjoyable. I attribute this to my being alone, bored and tired. Wasn't panicky or scared or anything, I'd just run out of ideas and was kinda lonely. I began to think that this was, while an interesting drug, a sterile one. I felt 2-dimensional and like I'd lost my connection with earth/life/nature/etc. Really all those things wrapped into a word I don't think exists. I believed this to be the case because it is a man made chemical and thus unnatural. Music was going through my head and for a split second I saw in the swinging blinds a pendulum composed of spinning sawblades mowing through a field of corpses. I thought this was really cool, logged it in my thoughts and then continued my introspection. Time stretched and I wallowed in bed for awhile. I kept seeing in my head a really cool purple cloud that said LSD. I tasted purple. I STILL can taste purple though it is like the memory of a dream. Again this wasn't so much enjoyable as it was interesting. I wanted my trip to end, wanted to go to sleep. I stopped hallucinating to any strong degree at about 7:30-8am. I watched the news and felt an intense loathing at the fakeness of the program. They would giggle and fake laughter about a parade of santa's, then turn somber and dark to talk about a soldiers death, then happy again as a kitten got adopted. At 9am my trip had stopped completely though I still felt a bit...funny. Went next door to my friends and banged on the door yelling 'Dude! I need to talk to a human, man! A HUMAN!' For the next several hours I was a bit overheated and felt a kind of sizzling/popping sensation. Felt good though. I forced down some chinese food later though I wasn't at all hungry and felt totally normal at around 4pm. 

I would like to note that though I had caught a buzz at the bar I was totally sober by the time I dosed. I went into this with physical and mental acceptance and eagerness. I was very confident and in positive state of mind. I did not go into this expecting spiritual revelation and I think because of this, recieved none. I looked at it more like a science experiment. And one I will try again. I was never really scared, though sometimes I would spook myself with my reflection and wander off to do something else before coming back to play in the mirror. I never once during my trip regretting taking acid and look forward to doing it again soon. I've also found that while writing this account I have been able to better understand some of the things I was feeling/thinking at the time of my trip. Also, I THOROUGHLY researched the physical and mental effects of LSD. I read trip reports, both good and bad. I read about how people coped with a bad trip and how they, with positive thinking, were still able to turn their trip into a positive experience. Simply put I was well prepared.  With that in mind, I hope this account has been useful to anyone considering tripping for the first time. The next time I trip I will be with friends and hopefully do it during the day. Yup, can't wait!

Thank You, LSD

I'm writing this because it's been one year since my first acid trip and the change of my life, and also for anyone who thinks that illicit drugs have never benefited somebody's life.

I made it through my first semester at college.  (Champagne!) In typical college fashion of an early flight the next day, I stayed up all night so I could pass out on the plane. (Which I did.)  I got home later that night and I went out to see all my friends, and I was asked if I wanted some acid.  I'd always wanted to, so I jumped at the chance.  	Me and three friends did it the next day at about noon.  About one hour after putting two little squares of paper in my mouth I felt the something-not-quite-right feeling.  About half an hour later we were tripping balls.  That day included a journey to a chicken wing place, our favorite headshop, and then another friend's house where I drew some songs on her bedroom wall. (She let me.) Followed by a return to my house where we partied in my room, still tripping.  I smoked some weed and drank some grain alcohol that night, but there was no drunk or stoned, just acid trip.  Much later that night I went to my friends house, still tripping, to smoke his hookah.  I think I got to sleep at about seven or eight in the morning.  

The visuals were amazing.  To this day I don't look at water the same way.  My favorite aspect was that I could read people's faces.  I could tell exactly what they were thinking, what they wanted, just by their facial expression. My favorite aspect was that I could read people's faces.  I could tell exactly what they were thinking, what they wanted, just by their facial expression.  I have not been able to replicate that feat since.     

I think that day I found God.  He is inside me, inside every human, I just needed acid to find it.  For the first time I felt complete, like I knew what direction I wanted my life to go in.  Acid revealed to me what I wanted.  Looking back, it seems now that my whole life before I never knew or did what I truly wanted.

One year later, I have since changed my major to chemistry, started my own business and have about two hundred pages written of my book.  Lysergic acid diethylamide changed my life.  So many of the things I love would not have been possible without it.  I am so thankful for being given that experience.

I have a reasonably extensive experience with serotonergics, cannabinoids, and somewhat eclectic experience with various other assorted psychoactives, with honorable mention for dopaminergic stimulants, which I currently do my best to avoid. By the time of this experience, I have developed a relatively high long-term tolerance for psychedelics, although my short-term tolerances are currently low.

I had been sipping tea prepared with roughly fifty micrograms of LSD for about an hour [had taken 25 micrograms, approximately], while doing organic chemistry homework; and once I was alone in the classroom, I turned on some music. The music was played from a single speaker, located inside a desktop computer about half a meter from my head, on my right side. I've been slightly congested in the recent weeks, due to the onset of winter, but could currently hear the music clearly from both ears.

This experience occurred less than a minute after checking the credits on the recording, while wondering at the exact nature of work done to earn those credits categorized as engineering rather than performance.

Without significant physical sensation from my left ear, the following two changes occurred simultaneously: a high-pitched noise began to my left, reminiscent in timbre to white noise with the lower registers muted, without any noticeable attack; and the subjective location of the music panned sharply rightwards. Within the next minute, the noise faded almost out of perceptibility, while the source of music retained its new subjective angle. Throughout this experience, the computer playing the music was entirely in my field of vision, so I was consciously aware that it had not moved.

After a few minutes of reflection, I recorded the above experience, and returned to my work.

LSD awareness

LSD...One word AMAZING. The stuff is amazing. It's fantasy, mystery, bliss, and OBLIVION, all dropped into one. 

At the time of last ingestion I was 19. A buddy and I, experienced trippers, went up to the lake for a night of chillen and trippen. The whole evening went as planned. A fire for comfort, outside for peace of mind, and acid for the show. Each hour melted into another and before the millionth thought had melded with the ten millionth it was light. Time to head back to life and town. Each hour melted into another and before the millionth thought had melded with the ten millionth it was light. Time to head back to life and town. We paused to look at the sand under the water and ponder just how all the little valleys and towns had formed below the surface...very interesting at the time. Out of nowhere,(I say nowhere because the night had gone so well), blickity blam...........the sickest feeling in the world hit me. It was despair, fear, and evil rolled into one thought and then injected into my soul. I turned and looked at my bro.....his eyes reflected the same intensness that I was feeling. Before I could ask him he said ' Something is wrong...do you feel it?'. 

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

We ended up driving up into the mountains (which I had always enjoyed) but the feeling of 'evil' or 'despair' still plauged us. A literal 'shadow' was cast upon everything our eyes looked at. Very intense. We swore never to injest this chemical again....and nine years later neither of us have.

It took quite a few years to 'recover' from the effects. For what seemed like a lifetime (6 years) I still saw spinning wheels in front of my eyes during my awake hours. The clouds would be full a faces at night. While affected by these persistent post trippen signs, I had to have faith and peace. I had to remember I was still in control of my life and mind. I could achieve whatever I determine to put my mind to. Since those younger years, I have married, had children, and acheived. I have still had an occasional momentary trip, but who cares.

For a time from mid-summer 2007 to September of that year I went on an acid binge where I would trip every weekend on at least two hits.  This was without a doubt a life changing experience; I felt that I learned more about myself and my niche in the social network I had been creating the past 20 years.  I had tripped on acid 2 times before the summer binge and upwards of 25 times on mushrooms prior dating back to 11th grade.  So I guess you could say that my classroom acid experience was the culminating event/day of my very memorable summer binge.  

The night before, a Tuesday evening, a friend was able to find some acid and sell it to me.  Promptly thereafter I proclaimed that I planned to eat it the next morning about half an hour before my American Literature class at 11 a.m.  I would mainly attribute this impromptu reaction to my friends ability to sell me acid very late into the night before the class to my lack of acid the previous 2 weeks.  

Anyway, I wake up at 10:30 a.m. the day of this class, have sudden apprehensions, but take the hit almost instinctively soon thereafter.  I dressed, smoked probably 2-3 hits out of my bong, and got all my stuff ready for college feeling great that Im about to accomplish a goal I had set for myself roughly 2 years earlier.  I did not eat breakfast.  During the walk to class I felt no effects of the dose.  However, upon arriving at the lecture hall and seating myself (in the back of course) I began to feel the stomach butterflies that usually accompany the rise of any trip.  Also during this period, brush stroke-like bands of pinkish-red began to form around some things like the screen the projector projects on.  Also, my depth perception went out of wack and concentration lessened, which I had anticipated.  Also, I was having a hard time controlling laughter.  I felt crazy because I knew that no one in the class knew I was tripping at the time.  It really was a great feeling though; it was like I had a huge super secret all to myself.  I believe this secret is what led to my feeling of extreme giddiness.  Anyway, I trip very hard the entire class; time seems to drag on for a while as I attempt to concentrate, but fail in doing so.  Class lets out at 11:50 a.m.  

Upon leaving I feel quite elated knowing that I have a whole day (for usually when I trip, as long as I get up once, I feel the drug until I fall asleep; either a gift or a curse, I assume the former) to trip on acid.  I ponder what to do, and maybe due to the literature based topics I just listened to for the past 50 minutes, I decide to go home and write poetry; something I hadnt done for many months and had been meaning to get back to doing on a regular basis.  The walk home, which is roughly .75 miles, seems half as long as normal for I am lost in my own thoughts, cool visuals, and overall sounds of College Park, Maryland.  

So I get home, whip out my notebook and pen and begin to write my, as of now, favorite poem which I believe holds the most truth:

Our Lives Depend On

circles in the sky with lined paths of
billion-year-old light; doth display
constancies, here, on this sphere, lay a knife
used to cut, the fruit of knowledge and learning 
with seeping clear juices to drop into eyes

change.

After these lines, which my mind seemed to vomit onto the paper, I began to laugh out loud.  Tears came to my eyes and I was completely overcome with joy and again I reminded myself that I had an entire day to trip and have fun; after my next class at 2 p.m. of course.  Time flies between classes and the poem; I do not particularly remember, but I estimate that I ingested about 5-7 bong hits during this time.  

My next class is with one of my good friends; he had no idea I was on acid, but I showed him the poem I had written earlier; he couldnt read my handwriting.  Class started and, maybe because I was in the front row this time, I started to feel like I was going to be called on and put on the spot in front of everybody.  I couldnt shake the feeling, especially since I had not read the required material for the day.  This developed into a sort of paranoia, which I believe I was only able to pull myself out of because I am very experienced with psychedelics.  At times I felt like running out of the classroom; I was truly scared.  Anyway, I was better able to comprehend what was going on during the duration of class, but I could not write the notes as well in my notebook; I would later use them to study and I found them to be comparatively, to the other class days, sub-par.  Class ends at 3:15 p.m. and not a moment too soon for I was tired and just wanted to chill for the remainder of my trip.  Which I did, and ended up having a tremendous afternoon and evening.

OK, the reason I decided to write this post is to give the most detailed report I can about my first time dropping acid. Keep in mind though that while all the things Im describing are INCREDIBLE, it doesnt really do this amazing substance justice. I cant even put 1% of what it really does to me into words.

First off, Im the crazy one out of my friends when it comes to drugs. Im always the one still ripping bong hits while the rest are flagged. I lick the bag clean when I eat shrooms. Anyway, everyone is telling me to only do one tab my first time. Fuck that I said (;p). I got two blotter tabs of acid from a dude who was known to sell STRONG ass acid. So one night I decided I had a good mind-set and enough time to trip. I was by myself. I sat on my couch, turned on The Universe (I love outer space:)) and put the tabs under my tongue.

11:00- I start feeling lightheaded and a little funny so I put my headphones in and put on The Beatles (amazing idea btw).

11:30- Definitely feel something, sort of like when shrooms are kicking in. The second hand on the clock was starting to wave around and move back and forth. The walls were getting wavy and starting to breath. I noticed a metallic taste in my mouth, sort of electric almost.

12:00- This is where things got interesting. In a split second, the acid just overtook my mind, kind of like a wave crashing down on the shore. I closed my eyes and saw my first acid CEV. It was 3d red and yellow squares moving in opposite directions. Suddenly they parted and a smiling sun came out from between them. Its expression comforted me and its sun rays washed a warm and comforting light over me. I fell back on the couch and looked at the ceiling. It turned 3D and started morphing into kaleidoscopic patterns. I was amazed! It felt like I had a car battery hooked up to my spine and felt waves of electricity pulsing through my whole body. I still had the acid in my mouth so I swallowed it and started laughing like a maniac. I got up and ran into the bathroom to look in the mirror. Now, if I had never tripped before, this probably would have freaked me out. But it was awesome! I looked like an alien, my pupils were HUGE, and my face kept morphing and changing shape. I stared in the mirror for a while.

12:30- All of the sudden, I wanted a cigarette. So I went outside and, holy shit, it was in-fucking-credible! I had complete night-vision and saw everything. The starlight all blended together to form a neon blue and yellow sky filled with patterns, flowers, smiley faces, and peace signs. They were all flowing around in the sky like there was a current. The moon was covered in geometric shapes and suddenly exploded into a flower with a super peace sign in the middle. A yellow brick road opened up in the sky and beckoned me to continue on my journey. I lit my smoke up and called my friend D up since he had tried it for the first time recently as well. He was totally baked at some party and I ended up talking to like 10 people I didnt know. I was trying to explain what I was experiencing but with little effect. I could barely talk!

3:00- I stayed outside running around in the grass for over 2 hours. I went back inside and was still tripping BALLS. Crosses, peace signs, smiley faces, flowers, and shapes where showering out of the walls. The walls themselves where distorted and morphing like they were melting or made out of water. Time was so fucked up at this point that I didnt know if a minute passed or a whole day. I just sat on the couch and tried to play Modern Warfare 2 with little success. 

4:00- I decided to go into my room. I made it upstairs and went into my room. My bed, which is blue with patterns, looked like the ocean. Waves were moving through it like the shore at the beach. I continued to see crazy patterns coming out of the walls, sometimes even flying past my head. I just put on some Beatles, laid back, and watched the CEVs flowing around in my head for the next few hours.

The next day was very bizarre (on top of that I didnt fall asleep) as I had to go to my stepbrothers kids birthday party. I was still wigging out and seeing shit. I still tasted metal in my mouth and was twitching a lot.

I went on to do LSD a bunch more times. It was amazing and Ive never had a bad trip on it. If I'm in the right mind-set and prepare for my journey, Lucy will take my hand and fly away with me into her sky thats filled with peace, love, and diamonds.

Acid and Halloween

Let me first start out by saying that I am was 17 years old at the time of this trip and I am no stranger to LSD and its effects on the body and mind. I've tripped several times, but this is the most vivid experience I've ever had with this chemical. I've also done almost every other drug that you've heard of.

It was Halloween night, and me and the girl of my choice at the time (we'll call her Ally) really want to trip. She had never tripped before so I explained to her that this could really fuck with her mind. She was still intent on dropping so we called up a buddy and had the acid to us within a half hour. We purchased 2 hits for me and 1 for her. This was around 9:30 that we dropped. I had about 9 people in my car at the time so I needed to get them all home. I didn't want a car crammed full of people when we started tripping-things could go very bad. I've drivin' on every drug I've done including LSD and I've never gotten pulled over or had a ticket, but I just didn't want to take any chances.

Around 10:00 P.M. I get everyone out of my car except for Ally and  two other of my friends (Zee and B). We headed over to my other friend Ari's house to see whats up and to see if he wants to hang out for a while. He is deathly afraid of LSD so he opted not to take a ride with us. We go over to Zee's house and on the way there the effects are kicking in farely well. It's around 10:15 and I'm getting very good tracers and I'm feeling very euphoric. 

Around 10:20 we get to Zee's house because that's where we thought we were staying for the night. We all stood out in the driveway while Ally and I were tripping and we all had a cigarette. Ally isn't saying much, but I sure as hell am. B grew up in a bad part of town and is pretty ghetto. I start yammering on about how he's a white trash piece of shit, and that I'm going to kick his ass. B is a guy you don't want to say this shit to. He realizes that I'm just tripping and he doesn't get too pissed off. By they way I don't mean anything of what I'm saying to B even when I was saying it. I just say stuff like that to get a rise out of my friends and that night was feeling good about myself. 

Around 10:45 we head inside after the cig and go to Zee's room. Zee's room is full of vibrant colors so this was amazing. Ally and I just layed on the floor staring at everything in amazement. We kept on staring at the rug on the floor that had streets all over it like a little kids play rug. The roads were moving all over the place and the tracers were intense. The euphoria was kicking in to high gear and we were both happier than ever. I knew what was going on and what to expect so I wasn't sayin much about the hallucinations. Ally kept talking about the roads on the rug and how they are moving. After awhile I was finishing her sentences. She would start saying 'Just look at how they..' and I would end with 'Dude I know.' 

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

After about a half hour of that Zee was farely drunk off of some liquor as well as B. Then Zee's dad woke up and realized that there were more people than expected in the house and all he wanted was Ally out of the house. I couldn't just let her walk home so I had to split as well. Which was really good because we could not stay in that place much longer. We wanted to be around people and we already thought that the night was coming to an end at that place when we just started tripping about an hour ago. And Zee and B would not let me drive but now they had no choice but to let us go. Ally and I hopped in my car and lit a cigarette. We just kept watching how the cigarette burns and how great it looks while it does its thing. We didn't know where to go after that so I pulled over at a grocery store parking lot. I Say to myself 'it's fucking halloween night, there is deffinetly a party somewhere.' I phone up my buddy A and he was already plastered from the massive party he is having. He yells at me for tripping and not being at his party, so we head on over to A's house.

By the time we get there it's around 11:30 and almost everyone there is trashed. People are dressed up in outrageous costumes and it's completey tripping us out. We automatically become the life of the party because everyone there is only drunk and we are tripping balls off of this amazing acid. Everyone starts talking to us and it's an amazing conversation. We decide to play some pool, but not really. We kinda just head over to the pool table and shoot a few and that got old fast. So I'm on one side of the table and Ally is on the other. When all of the sudden this guy C goes behind her without her knowing and acts like he's smacking her ass. This really pissed me off for some reason and I just start pointing at him yelling 'What the fuck is wrong with you!?' He comes up to me and gives me a high five and from then on all is well, or so I would think. 

Everyone was completely fucking with me the whole night after they found out I was tripping. One guy kept on walking behind me making weird noises thinking that I would thinkg that it was just in my head. Most of there bullshit didn't work. It was what they weren't thinking of doing which really fucked me over. They were arranging themselves in defferent ways all the time and I thought this whole party was a practicle joke for me. My mindset was cmpletely fucked and I didn't know what to believe anymore. I thought I had seen some video of what they were doing on youtube before, but I couldn't put my finger on it. 

I can't tell you what time this is all happening in because I didn't look at a clock the rest of that night. I decided I needed to get out of that house for a little while to cool my thoughts. So we head out to one of my friends cars to go smoke a bowl. My buddy and I both smoked down one bowl and that calmed me down. We went back to the party it went back to just how it was before. Everything in there was fucked and I was the only sane person in the room. When really it was the other way around. I talked with C to get things straight and he assured me that he wasn't fucking with me. Which he really was the only one who wasn't fucking with me that night. Then I realized I was having this complex over this little detail about C from the trip. This happens sometimes but never happened to me before so I wasn't ready for it. 

I think it's around 2:00 A.M. and people start passing out from the booze so it's less people to fuck with me which is good. I decide I just need to go in my little corner and just think. Acid is the most amazing drug to think on because when you start thinking about things, you can solve any problem. I get into this argument with myself about the beginning of time and the meaning of life and everything about the universe. When Ally comes out of where ever she was and wants to know what's wrong. I tell her that  there are just too many things going through my mind right now that I can't even begin to tell her the most subtle detail of what I am contemplating right now. She kinda wigs out and then suffices with a smoke outside. 

After the smoke we head inside and there are so many questions running through my head the only 2 phrases I said for the wrest of the night were 'what the fuck?' and 'what is going on?' and maybe the occasional one word answer to someone. A decides that I'm wigging out too bad and takes me up stairs and throws me in a bed. The only problem is that I can't sleep. You can't sleep when you're in that deep of thought. I go back downstairs telling myself that there has to be more to this night. 

The buddy who smoke a bowl with me is playing guitar hero so I sit and watch him for a while. Due to the weird and almost traumatic experiece I am not really paying attention to the screen but from what I remember the colors were amaand moving very rapidly and stretching out into space. It's nearing the end of the party where everyone is passed out and A is still awake along with 2 others. Ally and I decide to walk over the conversation. I am still only saying to my self 'what the fuck' or 'what is going on' and everyone decides to ignore me. Ally is almost at the end of her trip and I'm just finished with my peak, but was just in awe of what just happened I can't stop thinking about if everything is fucked or I am. I start thinking that I'm insane, but I keep it to myself because I don't want others to think that I think that I might be insane.

Ally takes me over the the couch and just sits with me and we fall asleep together. I only get a few hours of sleep and am recapping all the went along the following night. I am still getting a little tracers going along and think that I might be in a perma-trip. Then I say no that can't be possible, I'm just coming down it's all good. The whole car ride back to Ally's house was weirder than hell. I wasn't hallucination, I just felt all weird and tingly. After all the of passed drugs I have done I start twitching sometimes. So now I am twitching very weirdly and Ally is wondering if I will make it to her house alright.

We get to the driveway and realize that we are safe. I apologize to her for wiggin kinda bad but she didn't really think I wigged out. Maybe it was all in my head. So anyway we start making out and she gives me a hand job and she takes off. I drive home and then have to mow the lawn and clean the gutters while still semi-tripping.

While many would call this a bad trip, I do not. I have never had a bad trip out of all the many times I have tripped. The experience was just very vivid and weird to me and something to learn from. The visuals were amazing. Especially when driving the yellow lines in the center are awesome. And the deep conversation I had with myself was one of the most intense things ever. I am a weird guy in the fact that I know I will never have a bad trip. You just have to be in the right mind set.

Adventures with LSD

LSD marked my culmination with hallucinagetic drugs.  Beginning in my earlier days with marijuana I soon grew bored and used mushrooms.  It wasn't long after that I did a little research through reputable websites and other reliable sources.  LSD seemed safe enough so long as one is in control of one's emotions so I tried it.  I slipped a little piece of paper under my tongue for a few minutes, and then I took a few bong hits.

I really wish I hadn't smoked because it blended the onset effects of the LSD.  I am not sure when the LSD started and the weed took effect, and when the weed wore off.  Within twenty minutes of administration most of my decision making capabilities were eliminated.  For nearly an hour I sat listening to music and watching music visualizations trying to experience what sound could look like and what colors could sound like.  It is a blending effect.  Needless to say if my friend didnt encourage me to take a walk I would have been content to sit on that couch for the entire trip.  I could not pick a game to do, or decide on something to watch. In fact it took every effort of my body just to read the 15 titles of my dvd collection to my friends.  Just like high doses of marijuana LSD had my mind racing uncontrollably.  I would think of one thing and then get sidetracked and think about another.  That is why I believe it is called a journey.  I got tired from all the thinking (about nothing coherant) but couldnt turn it off.  Hallucinations did presist.  I never saw anything that did not exist, but things were moving.  Doors gained a curved shape, and lights seemed to have tails.

After six hours, following onset, the effects subsided but insomnia pursued.  I could not fall asleep no matter how much I needed / wanted to.  There were not aftereffects aside from fatigue.

I was 15 years old. I had taken lsd about 35 times previous to this halloween. The first time I took it I kinda enjoyed and kinda didn't. But I always looked forward to doing it. So, on halloween me and my friends decided to trip because it seemed like it would be fun. This was before I had a good understanding of powerful drugs like lsd. There was about seven of us. And we all bought light blue geltabs. And a few of us got some dark purple ones. Unknown to me the purple ones each had two doses in them. I'm a very small guy for my age, and had never had a bad trip before. I also have bi-polar 2.

The night started off with alot of other people buggin us to get them some geltabs(it was from a semi exclusive source) and this ended up injecting 5 more people into the mix, and they weren't close friends. So we all took our acid, I ate a light blue and a 2 purple ones, but I thought I dropped one of them out of my mouth so I took another purple one. And we started smokng alot of weed out of a bong. We were chillin in my friends neighborhood in someones garage who we didn't even know. It was just getting dark and people were just starting to trick or treat. After about 5 bong bowls I started to feel real fucked up and I was feeling extremely uncomfortable with everything. I couldn't take bein outside anymore. My good friend noticed and suggested we go to his house for a little bit. So we did that.

We sat in his room for a little bit. It was there I was starting to get schizo of the lsd. In his room I started to feel like I was in a moving spaceship and I couldn't get comfortable. Then our friend who was 21, tripping as well, showed up. We all considered him our drug mentor as it were. He came by to get us out of the house, he was worried about me. Right around the time we left I was feeling more fucked and confused than I had ever been. We went back down to the neighborhood, everyone I saw trick or treating was getting to me in a bad way. After we got back down there I layed on the grass just staring up. I was really starting to hate how I felt. My behaviour was getting erratic by now. I didn't want to be outside so I went home.

I was at home flipping out basically. I tried to fall alseep at one point, I tried taking a shower, I was trying anything that popped in my head to get sober somehow. I contemplated calling my dad and telling him I fucked up bad, good thing I didn't. So after a while of my running around whacked out of my gourd, my friends came back by. They knew immediately I was having a bad trip. I thought I had the secrets of the universe figured out and everytime it was on the tip of my tongue it would go away and I was very confused, but I seriously believed this. And I kept thinking about x-3 whatever that is. At this point I was not me and I can't even explain what happened next. Too fucked up for words.

My friends saw a bottle of my medicine sitting out and thought I overdosed on them, which I didn't. Then they dragged me out of my house and I made an ass out of myself in front of alot people on the street. My friends didn't handle the situation right at all, they were slapping me and stuff like that. Later on I ended up coming down, but still thought they were doing magic tricks and things like that. I've left out a good deal of what happened because I can't even explain it.

I ended up learning alot of things from it. Lsd isn't a 'fun' drug. For the right person it makes a good shaman tool. It doesn't make your body feel good at all. The only thing enjoyable about it are the hallucinations, but for that I have to eat too much. I haven't tripped in 5 years, and never will again. I did trip again after that a few times. Lsd is stupid in the hands of a kid.

It was at the Renaissance Festival... The first time I did acid when me and my friends thought up this idea. Halloween trip. 

As time progressed after my first acid trip, I decided that I would take two hits on Halloween during my senior year of high school. But no! Halloween 2008 fell on a Friday!! Therefore I was forced to take the acid at lunch while I was in school! So yeah, thats what I did.

12:00 PM 

I hit up my dealer, who was my best friend at school and I got 2 hits of LSD off him for 29 dollars ((4 of which were my lunch money) and yeah acid is really expensive around here). I popped both blotter hits in my mouth and sat in the back seat while my friend took me and my other friends out to lunch I didn't notice any symptoms, but I knew that not eating anything would make the acid kick in faster than normal, which was cool because I needed my lunch money for it anyways. 

When we got back to school it had been about 15 minutes since I had taken it. Some people I knew who were also into LSD asked me if I had taken any at lunch. I replied that I had, and that they shouldn't tell anybody about it. I heard a bell and decided it was time to go to class... So I did. I sat neatly in my chair. The class was a literature class, and we were studying Bram Stoker's Dracula. We were about to watch a version of the movie in our class... Little did I know how horrifying it would be. 

I first felt the effects about 50 minutes to an hour after I'd ingested the drug. I noticed in the opening scene, where Count Dracula denounces Christianity (I thought he was a bad ass for it ;)) that they took a sample from that movie Dracula (The one with Keanu Reeves (lololol)) to put into the song Torn by Into Eternity. This made me feel happy. My trip began.

I Looked in front of me. A large kid in a dark blue shirt. I mused that it looked bluer than all of the oceans in the world... I realized I was tripping, and giggled to myself about it. I looked up to the TV monitor. I don't know if you've watched the Dracula movie with Keanu Reeves, but its really sick and downright disgusting, especially on acid. Therefore, I was sort of uncomfortable. I kept looking at the backs of friend's shirts, watching the designs dance and move on their backs.

I looked at the woodgrain table... It rose up from the and formed a visible 3D small mountain range on the table. It was layered. I closed my eyes and stuck my hand in one of the layers and it traveled through solid matter. 

Dracula was still disgusting as hell.

The hour FINALLY ended and we got up out of our chairs and somebody flicked on the lights. JESUS CHRIST I'M TRIPPING! Everything looks NUTS! I stand up and try to keep my cool. I picked up my backpack and walked to the back of the room to chill near the door until class ended. The teacher was saying something but I was definitely ignoring it. Apparently she had said that she had candy for all of her students because it was Halloween (I found out only moments later). I picked out some Smarties from a bag of candy she had for us. I ate them all quickly and began to exit the room. I saw one of my friends dressed up as Waldo (you know? From the Where's Waldo books?) and I began to laugh out loud. It was even funnier to me because he knew I was tripping. I walked out the door and went quickly down the stairs like a robot to Wilderness Survival class (where I had my insightful visions). 

I don't remember what the insightful visions were... I however now realize that they were part of my 'Atomic Existence' theory which states that all life lives through their atoms which are recycled into the universe no matter what after death and are turned into new things. We were watching a film about people stranded out at sea (Oprah from the 80's (my teacher noted her girth)). I somehow related to it in my altered state of mind. I felt that I too was lost at sea on a raft, by myself in a vast sea in day to day life. 

Thank Christ that ended. I FINALLY walked relieved through the door. It was officially a Friday night, and I was trippin out. I met up with my friends, who had also taken acid in school and asked them how they were doing and shared my own mind blowing experiences. We were to go hiking at a local park near my house. I drove straight there with my friends from school. We hiked through the park and examined the large lake there. We all loved the nature of it and continued our walks. 

We did a bunch of stuff there, and then we went over to our good friends house that was just out of rehab. I was very excited to see him, so we all went there. We watched a movie that I thought was hilarious, and then I went home for the night and ate a bunch of my Halloween candy that my parents got me (they're nice folks).

Thank you.

My roommate and I drove half an hour to another friend's house to procure seven hits of LSD. He got two, I snagged five. We picked up yet another friend and headed back toward campus. The remnants of a recent, particularly strong hurricane were just beginning to pass over our city, and the weather was a total mess. I dropped the first hit as we were leaving the house, and tasted that familiar taste...acid. I had a good feeling going into this trip, like it would be an earthshattering experience. 

When we entered the dorms, I ate a second tab, and the guys who I rode with decided to go meet another guy and drive around. I later learned that they spent the night riding with someone around town, watching transformers explode with a weird green flash and seeing the wind blow away the world. I proceeded to my room to attempt injecting a hit intravenously. I entered, set up several beat-sensitive neon lights, a blacklight, the playlists for the night, and then started Winamp visualizers. I prepared the shot by folding a square and placing it in the barrel of the syringe. As, LSD is water-soluble, I drew up 60 units of sterile, isotonic water and shook the hell out of it. After letting it sit a minute, I saw the water glowing under my blacklight, and said to no one in particular, 'It's time.' I found a vein and began. I quickly learned that injecting it too quickly burns; it had to be done at a very slow pace. About halfway through the process I was in a full-blown trip - and everything went dark. Apparently a tree fell on a transformer and took out the power. With some difficulty I finished the injection and stretched out on my bed. The visions were incredible, as the IV hit brought on an immediate peak. Being a rather experienced psychonaut, I felt comfortable enough to get up and go out into the hallway. It was still lit, the backup generators just didn't power individual rooms.....cheap-ass universities. Everything around me glowed green, except certain people, who were pink. I wandered downstairs and outside to smoke a cigarette. In doing so, I ran into three other friends.

These people had no idea I was tripping, and invited me to ride with them and smoke. We got into the van and left campus to smoke in the wind and rain. I informed them of my level of intoxication and consumed the last two hits. They put on some music, and I became lost in it......it went around and around, in and out, through me. We smoked a couple grams of dank between four people, and this amplified the LSD.

We made our way back to campus, marvelling at the power nature was displaying. When we arrived, I was hitting one of a series of peaks, feeling like an insect crawling upstairs to my room. Being unable to find my own room, I followed the other guys to one of their rooms. I collapsed on a bed, stuck in the corner, and found myself lost in the molecular structure of the ceiling. It is obscenely difficult to explain to someone who has never eaten a high dose of LSD what this was like, but I tried nonetheless when my friends were asking. This seemed to go on for hours, but in reality probably lasted thirty minutes.

The guys figured out some way to power a laptop and lamp, I think from some massive backup battery supply, and put in a Simpsons DVD. I just stood and stared at colors I had never seen before, out of the visual color spectrum. I am usually an avid Simpsons fan, but I was so distracted I am completely unable to say what episode we watched, or even what characters were involved. At some point here I received several 1mg alprazolam tablets. Shortly after this, I and one friend managed to get to my room --- next door.

When in my room, I loaded up a bowl of 20x salvia extract into a glass bubbler. With the assistance of my friend, I prepared to take my trip to yet another dimension. I took one massive hit, then another, and after one more the bowl was cashed out. BANG! I exploded. The sensations were indescribable. I saw bright blue laughing demons in the room, outside the window, in the walls. A few minutes later I came back to reality -- at least, the reality that was LSD. I put on headphones and lay down on my bed as my friend loaded a bong. He took the green hit, then passed it to me. I rolled over and took a hit. I was gone. I let him smoke the rest of the ganja and we chilled a while. Eventually he left and I was left on my bed, stuck, wandering through the world in my mind.

The rest of the night and the next day is just a blur, but i know i ate 1mg alprazolam after smoking some more salvia, then three more before my film class the next day. It was the morning after that  day when I returned to baseline. I apologize for the end of this report being fairly weak, but i wrote the first part early after the trip and am just now finishing it to post.

Just recently I had an experience that I will never forget in my entire life. A couple friends and I decided to take LSD on new years night, my friends will be labeled as friend A,B,C. We had all been very excited through out the day to take our sugar cubes with two hits of liquid LSD in them. We had been jamming all day at friend B's house and we were going to spend the night at A's house. 

So we arrived latter that night at 10 o'clock and took our hits at around 10:20. Everything was running very smoothly we had started to come up very quickly. We were all sitting in A's room listening to the album Gamehendge by Phish which was extremely amazing in all aspects. The visual and physical effects of this trip were beyond anything that I have experienced before. 

After listening to music we had decided to go chill in another room and let ourselves drift off completely. At this time a weird vibe had started to flood the room and everyone could feel it. An friend C wanted to watch Alice and Wonderland witch would have been a glorious idea if the only working dvd player wasn't right near A's fathers room. C couldn't get his mind off it and it was extremely annoying because he kept saying 'Want to watch Alice,' and we told him we were going to at 1:00 to get his mind off of it. We were all tripping insanely hard more than I had ever before. 

After a while A gave into C's demand and took him down stairs to watch the movie while me and B chilled upstairs. Me and him were disusing that this entire situation was completely fucked and the vibe was so weird. We said that we didn't want to be there. From what I was told by A, C was being to loud downstairs so they came back upstairs and that is when things went into a spiral of horror.

C was making a lot of noise in the room and we were all telling him to be quiet. We all thought he was tripping to hard to control himself. But that was the weird part because we were also tripping so hard but could handle it completely. C started making absolutely no sense at all with random remarks of insanity. C started throwing everything he could get his hands on, even his own stuff that he just started demolishing. Everything thing he said wasn't making any sense. We were all tripping out of our minds also, but just wanted C to chill out before he woke A's dad and that was something that we just didn't want to deal with. We couldn't even smoke our bud because it we had to literally babysit C. Because he was FAR from himself.

After about three hours of trying to keep C silent we decided something was incredibly wrong so while me and B tried to sit in the room an calm C down, A went to get his dad. A told his dad that C was freaking out and we didn't know what to do. We had told his Dad that C had taking LSD without us knowing and we did not. When A's brother came home he had to man handle C down to A's basement so C wouldn't brake anything. As we sat there watching C literally go insane and talking complete gibberish, A's dad called drug control and they told him to call a ambulance because we had no idea wat he was capable of. 

While the ambulance had arrived A's brother and the paramedics were carrying C out to the ambulance, C began to vomit not a lot mostly dry heaving and urinate himself. After he was restrained in the ambulance we had to talk to the police while still tripping very hard. We had told them that after dinner C went to bathroom for a good ten minutes and came back out, and hour latter we couldn't control him so we decide to contact some one and here we are now. 

When we had removed C we were all still tripping very hard, and we were at the same time relieved that we had gotten rid of C because we didn't know what to do. But we were also happy that he was safe and controlled. 

One last thing is that C's actions were something beyond him even in his normal state of mind he would never have done. It was not him at all. C was completely out of his mind. Also its not like C was this random kid from our band he was a friend that we had known for most our lives. Another thing this was not our first experience with psychedelics. We had all done LSD before even C. C one night had eaten more than an eighth of mushrooms and was the best person to trip with. 

C is fine now but is grounded for a very long time and I think its going to be a very long time before I try hallucinogens again. That night was so fucked up. I had tripped harder than I ever had before with visuals and realizations beyond my understanding but I think its time to stick to the ganja and having and old fashion good time. After this is was all and done with, now we need a new fucking bassist for our band.

My boyfriend (22) and I (21) been talkin about takin acid for a while now, he did it few times before and I convinced him to let me try it.

It was friday, we were at his place. At 21:00 we each took 1 hit.

After an hour he said it's starting to affect him, I felt nothing, but he said it'll take longer for me cuz it's the first time. Time passed by, it was hard for me to feel it working, cuz I didnt know just what am I suppose to feel. Slowly but surely I began feeling happy, I was laughing for no reason, it was hard to remain calm. I felt energized, had the urge to go somewhere, do something. Music sounded so alive and great.The playlist was on random, some songs were amazing, I heard them like it was for the 1st time, different sounds, different beats, other songs which I usually like-sounded awful. The sound was affected by the mood. also the taste, we drank some cranberry juice and I was amazed at how perfect it is. Felt every drop runing down my throat. Then we went outside to get some fresh air, and it was the best air I ever tasted. So fresh and sweet.Came back inside. (still laughing non-stop)I looked at the clock, it was 23:20 but it seemed like so many hours have passed. Time just didnt move. my bf wanted to smoke, but said it'll make him feel sick, so I suggested he'd just hold the ciggi in his mouth. He did. But for some reason there was smoke coming out of his mouth (even though the cigarette wasnt lit).

Then I noticed that the 2 bottles of juice on the floor were moving. One of them was leaning toward the other one, like trying to touch it. We layd on the bed.for some reason my legs went numb. I tried to move them-nothing. But he calmed me down and said that if I'll really want to move them- I will. Then we we began having sex.It was probably one of the most intence expiriences ever. Every touch was so vivid, every tongue movement, every fingertip on every skin cell. The breating seemed really loud, every movement was very very intence, could actually feel him inside me, but in a totally different way.

We fell a sleep at 08:00. And slept for 8 hours.when we woke up we felt like after a night of drinking, tired and weak. But nothing more.

The whole expirince was nice, everything was intence, more vivid, more alive. But it's not what I thought it would be. I heard people looking at walls and seeing red dragons and blue fairys- didnt see anything like that. No odd colors, just few weird movements, vivid taste, vivid sex and a lot of laughs.

Title: A Head Full of Acid in Class
Date: March 30th 2006

Well, I got a sweet acid hook-up~! I bought 5 tabs for myself and went to my girlfriends place as soon as I could get there. We said we would trip together... The situation is this: 

I've done acid once before, plently of experience with mushrooms... 
...she has done mushrooms twice before, not the best experiences.. Never done acid. She lives really close to her university, and has her own place. 

It's 3:30 and we decided to pop the tabs. We have 1 each. She has class at 7 at night, we thought by then the acid would start to leave us... We were very wrong! 

Upcoming buzz was minimal to nothing, couldn't feel the acid working at all. I thought it was bad stuff, and we almost took another hit 2 hours after nothing had happend. 

It wasn't until 3 hours after we took the hit when we started to feel the effects... At this point I was biking my girlfriend to her class, which I said I would attend... It's a lecture room with about 200 other students. The class was for sociology.. Anyways, by the time I'm in her class and sitting down I'm starting to trip out. 

I couldn't help but notice all the patterns... Each brick was perfect, the layout of the lights, everything in the room was tripping me out. I didn't have very many visuals however, they were kept to a minimal the whole time. Though, I could feel the acid working ... 

I can't believe my girlfriend had to sit through the whole class taking notes, I was tripping harder and harder as I thought about what I was thinking about. I was tripping harder and harder as I thought about what I was thinking about. I then realized I was in control of the acid. The harder I wanted to trip, the harder I did. A video was put on the wall for the class to watch, it was 40 minutes long... There was a point where I was watching the doctor speak... And his face would slowly start morphing into a frog, I shit you not. It was incredible... Then all those bricks on the walls began dancing a bit, forming straight lines that went into the ground. That is where I hallucinated the most. 

The whole class was 2.5 hours long. 
During the lecture I put my headphones on and tripped out to Mars Volta ... Listened to the whole CD, without a clue to what the teacher was talking about. 

There were times where I thought my girlfriend could read my mind, and her friend who was sitting to my left could hear me when I was whispering... I also came up with 'Acid is the key, and your head is the car. The key can turn the car on, but you have to be the one to drive it.' ... I had many many many thoughts in my head, and I could hardly contame them all. 

Once I got out of the class I felt like I was free... At times I was sitting in the same spot for so long, I would begin to wonder when the last time I had moved my body was... There were many bricks that had intense designs and patterns I really wanted to look at... But iddn't have much time to. The bike ride home was awesome, I felt like I was floating..and could bike VERY fast without it feeling like I was pedaling at all. 

At home my girlfriend and I spoke about our trips...hers wasn't all that exciting since she was taking notes the whole time. I wouldn't shut up about mine... Was smoked a bunch of bowls and watched the family guy movie. It wasn't until 4:30 am when I started to feel tired... 

All in all it was a really good and fun acid trip... Though we are gonna dose again this coming saturday with 2 or 3 friends and take at least 2 tabs each. We have a hospital nearby and a few fun places to check out while tripping.

Last weekend, a friend of mine calls me up and asks if anyone I know would like to test a hit of acid that night to test the potency of it. I immediately jumped on this opportunity and had him come pick me and a couple of friends up from our dorm. We're all pretty experienced in mind-altering substances. My three closest friends here had all tripped on DXM with me, we've all done shrooms, 3 of us tried LSA; in fact, between the 4 of us, there were few popular drugs out there that we hadn't tried. A week or two prior to this event I had gotten some 5meo-dipt from the same guy who was asking me to test the acid, so I trusted him and took the hit. He said his friend had just bought it off some hippie and warned that it might just be a piece of paper without any LSD on it. So I took the acid and waited.

A week ago I had mistaken a caffeine pill for Foxy and actually sold a few hits of it, and did some of it myself. Due to our habit of being stoned all the time, the placebo effect actually had me fooled for a while. I didn't want tonight to be a repeat of my gullibility so I was determined to be as skeptical about it as possible until I totally tripped out.

We played xbox for about an hour and then my friends started asking me about the acid. I was pretty stoned at the time so I told them I wasn't sure. A few guys told me that it should take about 45 minutes to hit me, so I became skeptical of the authenticity of the tab I took. We continued to play X-box for another hour until I started to realize that I wasn't just stoned. A poster on top of the TV looked slightly distorted but I couldn't point my finger on how exactly it was distorted. And then the people in the poster started look very real, like a window into another world. The poster did not become animated but I made note of this visual and told my friends I was beginning to feel something.

About 10 minutes later, I was sure I was tripping. My friend took me into his room and played some techno and trance for me and let me watch his winamp visual on his computer. The visuals completely captivated me. They colors were more brilliant than normal, and at times the screen looked like it was bubbling and the glass was being melted off. Pieces of color looked like they were about to pop out of the screen. At this point, wasn't having any difficulty organizing thoughts in my head and the body load was no where as strong as when I take shrooms. My mind was clear, and I was able to function pretty normally for the most part.

After a while, I got tired of the winamp visuals so I went outside to play more X-box with the guys. It was at this point that I started feeling the inebriating effect of the LSD. I wasn't able to concentrate on the game, and Halo seemed so complicated and confusing. Then all of a sudden, I look on the screen and I see my friend's cat running around in the level being chased and shot at. Nothing else interesting happened after that and I began to come down soonafter.

Overall, it was a good experience. However, the potency of the acid I took was less than satisfactory. I may have to take 2 or 3 tabs next time.

This trip occured approximately 3 days ago on June 22, 2008. This is the day I felt enlightenment in my grip. I felt it in the tips of my fingers and under my eye lids.

I had been planning to trip for a few days but things kept coming up and ruining it. I'm fairly new to LSD, this trip being accounted was my 3rd time using the benevolent Lucy (as she will now be reffered to from here). Even tho I have only used Lucy a total of 4 times as of right now (June 25, 2008) I know her power and I respect her benevolence, teaching, and knowledge. I am currently reading the Teachings of Don Juan and as it teaches to be a Man of Knowledge you need an Ally and I have chosen Lucy as mine, or should I say she has chosen me.

Anyhow onto the good stuff. I had 2 good size triangular doses of Lucy wrapped in foil in my wallet. I decided to walk the backroads to a bicycle/walking trail near my house that runs along a river. I had with me; my doses, a pack of smokes, the Daodejing, a bottle of water and my cell phone. However I forgot something crucial to this trip which was my zune. This was not a completely fatal mistake but however.

I began walking at about 1245 because the walk to the trail on the back roads was a decent mile and a half. I dont walk very fast so I figured this would be a good time to leave. I had recently been drug tested by my parents and came up completley clean, despite have dropped acid the day before. Standard drug tests dont test for Lucy so I wasnt worried. As I'm walking outside my dad is working on the yard and I tell him I'm walking to the trail. And he says', your not like going to drop a hit of acid and walk around and stuff are you?'

'I'm just going to the trail' I answered.

'okay' he said

I began walking looking at the trees and the sky feeling refreshed and revitalized. It was a perfect day out, high 84 and the sun was shining and there was a ever so gentle cross breeze blowing. Anyways I began walking up my neighborhood and out onto the back streets. I came to some wild flowers and looked at them and was reminded of Hofmann saying that we need to come back to the roses, the plants, to mother nature. I brushed them with my fingertips and smiled. I kept walking and as I came to about 100 yards to the trail I looked at my cell fone and it was 1:07, the time I was planning to drop (military time its 13:07, my two lucky numbers :). I took out the first one, un folded the foil it was in and placed it on my tongue. I moved it around, pressed it to the roof of my mouth for a few minutes, took a small sip of water to make sure it went down. Then I repeated it with the second dose.

I came to the entrance of the trail and began walking. It is approximately 2 and a half miles down and back once. This however seemed like it took an eternity.

I started walking and felt the rising vibes of it and began texting my friend Luke who was tripping on an eigth of cubensis mushrooms that day. This whole time we texted eachother and kept eachother updated on our trips. I began walking and saw a nice place to meditate near the river. I walked down and saw a rock and pulled out my Daodejing and began reading. As I began reading I didnt like the Daodejing as much as I had the past few days I had begun reading it. It made me feel blank, like I was just another spec on a spiderweb. I kept reading hoping I would feel more blissful but this blank feeling just exacerbated the further I read. So I put it away and lit a cigarette. I sat watching the water sparkle and run over rocks puffing on my cigarette. When I was finished I got up and began walking again. I felt blank, almost like an ego death. This was a small dose but for the next hour or so I felt I had experienced an ego death. I wasnt feeling any emotions and I wasnt percieiving anything other than how it was. I didnt like this, most people would like this feeling saying this is how we should percieve the world. I beleive however, that everything has a spirit and is symbolic of many different things. 

I kept walking and this acid was coming on rather slow and I just kept walking singing to myself. And finally I was texting luke and said that I wasnt feeling the intensity of the doses as I expected, I wasnt feeling the threshhold and that I had no music. He shuddered at the fact I had no music and suggested going back. At this point I was at the end of the trail and was about 3 miles from home. I told him I was bummed and that I should have saved Lucy for later that night and meditated. He said not to be mad and just enjoy the trip. I agreed and kept walking back. Eventually I began to chant Om(inhale) Ah(hold the breath) Hum(exhale) to calm myself because I was somewhat of becoming anxious that I had wasted Lucy. I eventually found a different place by the water next to the remanints of fires. I sat down in a cross legged position and began chanting, om ah hum yet again and closed my eyes. Lucy was taking me to her threshold at this point and I saw waves of particles under my eyelids, waves of the water washing in and out over the rocks that were in front of me but that I could not see having my eyes closed. I continued meditating fro about 15 minutes until luke texted me again and I got up and began walking back. I was back at the beggining of the trail this time. And I as I was walking I looked at the plants next to me and realized that I came to be the same way they did. I realized I am everything because I have come to be the same way everything else has. I was the trees, the plants, the sky, the water, the birds, the squirrels. I also realized I saw all the stages of life laid out in front of me. I passed a baby, a toddler with its mother and father. I passed a young couple in love, and middle age couple in love. An older middle aged man pushing an elderly man in a wheelchair. I saw the order that my life will come in and I saw everything I am. I am everything and I always will be. I walked home smoking cigarettes and smiling at the sun. I went home made myself dinner spent time with my family. Sat in the grass near a fresh patch of mushrooms in the dying sunlight. I felt the best I ever will. I was real and I knew I was. I was everything and knew I was. I will be everything and knew I will be. This was without a doubt the most spiritual and knowledge gaining trip I have experienced so far as Lucy being my ally. Thank you Dr. Hofmann, may you rest in peace and may your spirit soar.

My friend and I were experienced in taking psychedelics (mushrooms, acid, etc) but decided to really explore the great unknown and take a lot more than we'd previously done.

We decided to go to the tip of Cape Cod, on this fine summer day and with our dual headphones, we'd listen to some psychedelic music on a walkman. Although this town is a haven for people of the gay persuasion, as far as I know we're both straight and went for the natural beauty that is the town's dune -filled Race Point on the ocean.

So, just before we got there by car, we decided to take 5 hits of blotter acid each, which according to descriptions and effects of one to two dose hits, which we'd tried earlier that summer, I'd say these were 80-100 mic tabs (even one hit caused noticible distortions and synthestesia effects and a full 12 hour trip) After only about 15-20 minutes the effects started (that weak, trembling rush) and I noticed that the music from my friends car stereo was dancing off the dunes and clouds aboove as we drove on. A hawk flew by and left an orange, blue, green trail behind as it passed by my field of vision.

We decided we needed to stop the car immediately and find a place to trip in comfort and private. No sooner had we stopped at a parking lot at Race Point, that it seemed we could barely stand. This was going to be strong and having read a lot about this, we knew we must 'run' for cover.

We managed to 'float' down to the bottom of a dune and basically said 'goodbye' to each other, knowing that although we'd be laying just next to each other, that we'd barely be able to communicate. I let out a grunt and waved bye bye.

All of a sudden I looked up between the branches of the tree I was under and all around the branches were electric lines tracing the outline. I started melting into the sand. I still felt weak because I hadn't settled in and closed my eyes. I saw the familiar checkerboard pattern behind closed eyes spiraling down. I gave up to the spiral and followed it down. Although I surely can't recall all my images and feelings, I remember seeing beautifully clear still images of friends and family laughing and loving. I remember chuckling and saying to myself how much I love these people. I distincly remember seeing a stuffed elephant toy from my childhood in beautiful technacolor.

I could hear people playing at the beach up and over the large dune and it was wonderful. I followed the circular sound of a plane flying overhead and followed it for what seemed like eternity till it faded.

After hours and hours (although it seemed like one single moment in time) of taking in this sensory wellspring, we started communicating in 'caveman' It was decided we'd put the Yes album 'Relayer' into the walkmen and donned our headsets. Immediately, upon hearing 'The Gates of Delirium' the trip took on an unbelievable quality full of energy, plays of shapes, beautiful colors emmanating and radiating off the clouds and dunes. Geometric pattern fired off and filled everything in the visual field. Say what you want about Yes but that album 'Relayer' is perfection when tripping and guides you wonderfully through the psychedelic voyage.

After a while we were able to get up, talk, walk to the beach and with the sun setting decided we could party now. We smoked some weed, drank some beer and smoked cigarettes. Later on we got out the boombox and listened to various Beatles, Pink Floyd and other albums. We had a great life-affirming day and although we are both successful family men now who live thousands of miles apart, we often discuss that one day and the wonder of it all.  LOVE

A friday in september of 2003, me and my friend, R, decided to drop some acid. We got a hold of 4 hits of blotter acid and headed for the hills. 

We each started of dropping one hit.

The weather was beautiful and the temperature was comfortable. (Being a norwegian living on the west-coast, this is not always the case, so we learn to appreciate the few days we get.)

We were fooling around the mountainside enjoying the woods, waiting for the effects. Nothing apart from the familiar tingling and some mild giggling. This lead me to believe that the hits we had got, where low in quality. This was not the case.

As we decided to take to the top of the hill, a thick fog came upon us. We figured that even though we were not off our heads, we decided to go back down. (It is very easy to get lost in these hills, being covered with quite dense forrest.)

It was now about an hour and a half into the first hit. (T+1.5h) We figured it was about time to drop the last hit, feeling it safe based on the first one. 

When we got back into town we went back to R´s house, dropped the last two hits and sat on his porch for a while. We were still feeling a slight tingle from the first hit, but we were both hungry for a slightly more profound experience. Suddenly R points out that we had nothing to smoke later on, so we headed over to a contact of his, to buy some hash. When we got there we told him (R´s contact) that we had dropped acid, just to clarify, in case the second hit should be stronger than the first, and we would start to act weird. 

It was now T1+2.5h, T2+1h.

We were sitting in the apartment of this friendly couple smoking some bongs and just having a nice time. We had both nearly forgotten about the second hit.

It struck me hard! I was suddenly overwhelmed with strong visuals. I informed R about it and that I thought it be best if we got going. He agreed and the host couple totally understood. I did not want to lose control in the home of strangers, no matter how friendly they were.

We got out on the street and headed for R´s house. I could feel the acid really coming on in strong waves. I was new in town and not so familiar with the part of town my friend lived. I explained to him that I had no idea where we were. He assured me that we were on the right way.

By this stage I was experiencing total confusion and I relied on my friend to get me to 'safety'. Even though it is only a 3 minute walk, it felt like forever. I was getting more and more paranoid, not able to shake the sinister feeling that R was not what he seemed. We were pacing along. R was probably a bit stressed to get me back to the apartment, so that we could lay back and let the acid have its way with us. 

TOO LATE!

At this point I lost all confidence in R.

This happened as we came to a playground that was just about 100m away from his apartment! This place looked so alien and when I looked at R he looked more like a joker, with evil intentions. His eyes were completely black and his smile was pure evil. The paranoia caused my confused mind to 'shut down'. Everything turned white and I can still remember shaking my fist at the sky demanding answers as to what the HELL was going on. R was still trying to pull my arm and get me to safety. A this point that was completely impossible, as I was convinced he had evil intentions. 

From here on I must have been wandering around. I can recall moments of clarity, when I could navigate. Identifying a  sign for a bakery which I headed for. It was only about 50m away, but it felt like an eternity. I felt like I was trapped in a loop and that I had been striding the same block for ever. I could not tell if I was alive or if I had gone to hell, and it being a state of eternal repetition. 

 After this I can not recall anything but short glimpses of my way home.

I came to in the middle of the night, having been rolling around my bed for a few hours. I felt really bad about abandoning R and got in touch with him. He had been really worried about me. We sat down smoking some joints talking about what we had experienced. He had not been tripping as hard as I, but me flipping out and he worrying about me probably ruined his trip. 

I think that if we had just gotten back home before the big wave hit, it would have been an awesome trip.

For me this experience made it clear how important it is to be in a 'safe' area. Most of the times I´ve dropped acid it did not matter where I was. Being in control of my self. But some times the stuff really hits and its important to have a retreat/safehouse.

Even though it was a rough trip, those are probably the most educational and I would not change it for anything. 

Did I mention it was on friday the 13th? 

Keep humble, keep dreaming, keep loving!

So! I didnt think it got any sweeter, but it most certainly does. My trip last Saturday went so well that it seems impossible, but Im still not positive that LSD-25 is what was on that mysterious white blotter. 

I mean, fuck... where to begin? After we each ate half a tab (cut from a long, unperforated strip) at 8:30 PM, we walked through a nearby park and watched the sunset. After that, we played basketball until 9:45. We got back to the house and each ate another half, doubling our original dose, but it still took until 10:45 or so for things to feel trippy and for a while I was disappointed that we had taken bunk acid. By 12:00 AM, I was probably as fucked up as Ive ever been. 

My favorite part was when I could taste the red, blue and green lights that spun like a hurricane around our tiny room. They tasted like Jolly Ranchers or Air Heads, it was that super-sweet to the point where its almost sour taste. My favorite part was when I could taste the red, blue and green lights that spun like a hurricane around our tiny room. They tasted like Jolly Ranchers or Air Heads, it was that super-sweet to the point where its almost sour taste. As they danced endlessly to the music we kept on shuffle, it seemed that I was witnessing perfection. The euphoria that coursed through my body was very warm and relaxing, something almost comically unexpected given that most of my past acid trips were bursting with powerful, sometimes jaw-clenching stimulation. 

It was hilarious. We laughed a lot, usually at nothing at all. It was a really genuine laughter too, the kind that boosted our moods higher and higher. Once we were there, in that unmistakable headspace that seems to escape my vocabulary, I immediately knew I was on the same acid as last time Id tripped, and it filled me with a strange nostalgia.

It was a different flavor of fucked up than my last trip, but undeniably the same substance. Now that Ive done it twice, my whole concept of it is much more solidified, especially given that everything went so well. During the day I casually meditated on whether or not I should go back down the rabbit hole. It seemed like a good enough idea, but naturally, I was nervous.

Once we were there, and we stayed there from 12:00 to 6:30 AM, it felt like time had completely halted. It didnt fast forward or rewind uncontrollably, it just... Stopped. We wondered if the sun was ever going to come back up. When it finally did after what felt like days, we stopped tripping almost immediately. The come down was so smooth that by 8:00 AM we happily drove to McDonalds with no signs of intoxication other than a beautiful afterglow. 

It was unbelievable. My body and mind are usually exhausted at the end of an intense trip, but for once I felt as though the acid had given me life and energy. Its been a few days since the trip and I still feel incredible! Its been very easy for me to integrate the experience into my life, which is surprising given how profound it was. It intrigued to me to think how impactful a positive psychedelic experience like mine could be on so many of the people I know that havent tried these drugs yet, but I can see why theyre so timid about it. For me, tripping feels like the most adult thing one can possibly do. Its heavy metal, its alien, and if one does it right, its the ultimate ecstasy.

For about a year now I've been experimenting heavily with mixing LSD and different types of meditation such as kundalini meditation and astral projection.

A friend got me a really good batch of liquid LSD and at around the same time I'd been using an audio entrainment called 'Meditation Mastery Activations' for Higher Self communication.

So of course I decided to mix the two.

I was staying in a friend's cabin in the Californian redwoods and she was away at the time - perfect.  The acid was really smooth, I was sitting out in the sun looking at the trees and could see them breathing.  The trunks were pulsating in and out.  I could also clearly see the trunks radiating a bright green aura.  

Clearly things were kicking in nicely so I put on my headphones and started the Higher Self meditation.

Seconds, minutes, hours later?  I don't know.  I behind closed eyes I could just see white light getting stronger and stronger.  I began to hear a beautiful hum and I started getting visions as if I was traveling at light speed.

All of a sudden I felt myself burst into some kind of dimension.  Where all this light was coming from.  I was floating, flowing, soaking in it.  I could see inside my body and I saw it being filled with these streams of light.  Things would slow, then speed up amazingly fast and I couldn't keep up, but at all times it was ecstatic.

I had the strongest feeling that I was floating inside my Higher Self somehow.  I just knew.  I didn't need anything here and I didn't want for anything.  I must have been here for a few hours, because when I came out the sun had changed a fair bit in the sky.

It's taken me a lot of time to process this experience and there is so much I just can't put into words.    

This was one of the most profound experiences that I've ever had.

'Painting Realizations: 10 Things I Learned From My First Trip'

Before starting this report, Id like to explain who the people involved in my life that will be mentioned are. 

Ill refer to myself as Len. Im an international student who has recently moved to New York City to attend college. I dont want to disclose too much, but Ill tell you I used to live in Europe. Im currently studying Communications, though for some time I have wanted to switch to Music Business. I am not very happy with my living arrangement within the University - I live with 11 other girls in a loft, which is always dirty, as they dont clean up after themselves. I feel disconnected with them, and I am not too comfortable in that environment. 

I have shared this experience with two other girls, who have now become my Acid Sisters. The first is my closest friend here in New York, Summer. Summer and I have been friends for almost a year now, and we have a lot in common spiritually, which I was aware of even before the trip. The other girl is Dianna. Shes been friends with Summer, also for a significant amount of time, but before this experience we werent awfully close - nevertheless, I did like Dianna a lot. 

We were sober-sat by Louise (though she prefers sober-played-with), and her sort-of-boyfriend Frey, who I went to high school with. Louise is Diannas suite mate, who shares the apartment in the dorm with her, and she was there as we dropped in Diannas room. We were meant to originally do it in Summers room, but her roommate (who isnt too fond of psychedelic substances) was there, and Diannas place was bigger anyways. 

Another thing I should mention is that at one point in this story, Diannas current sort-of- boyfriend, Mark, stops by. I am not too fond of Mark for two reasons. First, the only time I hung out with him, Summer, and Dianna, during the previous week, he seemed somewhat pompous. He would recite textbook-like phrases, and Id stand there, high as a kite, watching as Dianna wrote it all down. It almost seemed like the Mark-cult, which I was definitely not eager to join. 

The second reason comes in handy, because it also provides some backstory for some of the things that I saw, and felt, during the trip. Earlier on the month, Id began a sexual relationship with this guy called Seth. I, stupidly enough, fell head over heels for him. I think everyone around me realized that he didnt care for me... except for me. Dont get me wrong, I had reasons to believe that wasnt the case, but I was somewhat blinded by other convictions as well. When we tripped, I hadnt seen Seth for about two weeks, and we were no longer involved, as he had ditched me accidentally one night, and I had decided Id had enough, so I deleted his number and texts from my phone. Summer had run into him, and he kept claiming he was going to reach out to me, but when I contacted him and was ignored, I decided to let it go and give up. It wasnt easy, and I kept blaming myself for it, seeing Seth as a special, wasted opportunity I had thrown away. I was simply unable to move on, or realize better would have come along eventually. Because both Mark and Seth were film students, they shared a lot of classes, which brought about a certain hostility between them. Mark despised Seth, and claimed he was extremely pretentious and aloof (which is true enough, but save the aloofness, also applicable to Mark himself). That very same night we hung out, he declared ferociously Fuck Seth! to which I amicably replied, Hah, been there, done that. He was visibly irked out, and said to me, Wow, Im sorry you have to live with yourself, after that. I didnt feel particularly insulted, but rather undermined and skeptical about this guys supposed caring, gentle, spirit. I just didnt see it. 

Now that everyone has been introduced, lets begin at the beginning.

This whole venture began about five months ago, when, before meeting in person, Summer and I decided we wanted to explore psychedelic endeavors - she proposed eventually taking shrooms and listening to Lou Reed (who is a somewhat mythical figure to me), which I was all in for.

We felt ready around the beginning of October, back when I met this kid called Dylan West - whom we all just called West. Id describe him as a fuckboy junkie extraordinaire; hes the kind of guy whos currently trying to grow pot in his dorm room, dabs indoors with the smoke detectors all over the place, trips almost on a bi-weekly basis, and has a penchant for smoking up with steamy showers in the bathrooms indoors. As soon as I decided Seth was a no-go, I had ended up Wests world. I slept over at his place for the entire weekend, two weeks before tripping, and we eventually hooked up at one point. I knew he was the right person to ask for a hookup. 

Predictably, New York City drugs are expensive. West recommended one gram for each of us as a threshold dose (both Summer and I are 52 and about 110 lbs., so it typically doesnt take a lot for us to be affected), but his dealers prices would have forced us to spend ti50 on it, which he said wasnt worth it. Earlier on the week, a friend of mine, Remy, had taken shrooms, and was only able to trip on 2g. This would have brought the total of our supposed expenses to $100, which I just could not spend on drugs (yet I have probably already spent it on cigarettes, go figure). West then recommended us just going with acid instead. I was reluctant, since I believed shrooms would have been a better initiation, as they were more natural, and I wasnt too eager to put such harsh chemicals through my body. West claimed it wasnt much of a difference, and that he had started with LSD anyways. That wasnt enough to convince me, since one of Wests go-to catch phrases waking up in the morning was I need to get fucked up before breakfast. Sobriety is overrated. I didnt wish to end up like that, so I checked in with Summer and she was okay with acid instead of shrooms. I was desperate to begin my career as a psychonaut, so I gave in at my best friends request. 

We met Wests dealer three days before tripping, and paid about ti45 for two tabs of, supposedly, pure-ass acid that we placed in a fire-engine-red Italian Sicilian Orange Tic Tac box. Turns out, it was a great container, as the red filtered out most light from the substance, and acid is best kept in a cool, dark environment. Summer and I had planned to trip on Saturday night, but we had decided to head to a frat party on Friday, where she didnt have a great experience, and needed one day to recover. 

I. 

On Sunday morning, I was very upset. My room in the dorm was so messed up from me attempting to re-organize it that my bed was entirely covered in plastic bags, so I decided to sleep on the couch of the common area. My roommate hadnt noticed me, and accidentally locked me out of our room, before leaving for her hometown for fall recess break. Because this wasnt the first time that this had happened, I flipped out. There was outright screaming on my part in my native language, and I am not ashamed to say I talked to myself as a means to release stress. I had to go downstairs with the previous nights makeup, my pajamas and no shoes, so I felt extremely embarrassed. To add to that, Summer called to let me know that Dianna was going to join us, and she had decided to split her tab with her. I felt abandoned by her, and unwilling to accept it, (I now understand that this is definitely none of my business to control and decide). 

I definitely think that that freakout was one of the best things that could have happened. Back when Summer confessed to me that she didnt want to trip on Saturday, she was particularly shaken, which brought me to have negative feelings regarding the Seth situation. Releasing all of my stress and anger put me in one of the best mental places for the trip, and I felt powerful and reinvigorated. I ran some errands throughout the day, and met Summer around 7 PM. We went to our respective homes, so that she could pick up the Tic Tac box, and change into more comfortable clothes. On our way back to Diannas, we saw Frey and Louise, and they told us they were going to swing by later, which I was happy and excited about. 

II. 

We briefly saw Mark outside of the building of Diannas dorm (Summer and I lived in the same complex - which I will refer to as Blue C - while Dianna lived in Square Hall), as he exited, and told him about our subsequent plans. He wished us well, and we walked in the building. 

As soon as we saw our trip location, I was positively satisfied. It was a dorm apartment, so it wasnt enormous, but definitely bigger than Summers. There was a small hall and a living room area with a round circular table and a couch, as well as a decent bathroom and average-size kitchen. Dianna also said we were welcome to go to her room whenever, since her roommate wasnt home, but we remained in the common area for the initial part of the night. One of the reasons why we had also decided to do it at Diannas was because she had prepared endless tubes of acrylic pigments and large poster-size paper for us to paint on. 

I read a list of precautions and possible acid-induced negative thoughts that we might have had, so we could prepare for the worst in case of bad trips. We all turned out to have had designated tasks: I was the well-read expert, Summer had to physically take care of the stuff, and Dianna was more concerned with preparing activities to keep ourselves occupied during the night. 

Summer placed four different pieces of blotter paper on the table. One of them was a small 100 microgram square, which was for me, and two were tinier half pieces. There was also a little extra bit that Dianna and Summer also split. All in all, Id say they had about 50 micrograms each as their ultimate dose. (One of the reasons I was initially opposed to them splitting the other blotter was because their doses would have been significantly lower than mine, which I thought would have put me on a whole different level of experience, and I didnt want to be alone. Luckily, this didnt turn out to be an issue for any factor, besides duration of our trips, but Ill get to that later.) 

We were all pretty unaccustomed to acid consumption, so we placed the blotters underneath our tongue and waited, as Id read was the most traditional and effective mean of consumption. This was about 8 PM. 

For a little bit we just chilled out and talked, then Frey and Louise came back with their takeout food. We chatted up with them for some twenty minutes, and I discussed music with Louise. I was very reassured, as she and I were passionate about similar artists and genres, and I immediately thought she was going to be a brilliant DJ for the night. Summer then suggested us grabbing dinner, since we hadnt had much food (we both dont eat a lot... Id been so upset I was mostly hunger-less the whole day, and had only had a couple of slices of bread and a Special K bar, along with my coffee, as breakfast). We briefly stopped by CVS, before the acid started to hit us, and I picked up some sushi, while she opted for veggie dumplings. 

We went back to Square Hall, at Diannas, to eat, and immediately after I was done, I felt my muscles tensing up. I had a specific tense spot between my shoulder blades, which had me lifting and narrowing them. I immediately announced to Summer I was tensing up, and she nodded saying she also started to feel physically different (she mentioned something about not being able to feel her left arm and leg tension). I dont remember Dianna being particularly affected by that point, but she decided to sit on the floor, and began painting. 

Summer mentioned the blotter not dissolving yet after about 30 minutes of having taken it (she ate afterwords) and Louise recommended switching location to the rooftop of the mouth - this is possibly something to keep in mind for the next trip, as it immediately dissolved afterwards. I had accidentally swallowed my blotter earlier, which was probably one the reasons, along with the larger dose, why my trip was somewhat delayed when compared to theirs. Dianna was a true trooper, who kept the blotter underneath her tongue until it dissolved - and it took a long time: about an hour, but she began coming up immediately after it was absorbed. 

III.

I had previously recommended us performing an activity while waiting to come up, as Id read it was much better to casually notice we were tripping, rather than waiting for tell-tale signs. I joined Dianna on the floor, and began to stroke swirls in an abstract manner (regardless of my background as an art student, Im not much of a painter.) 

About an hour after we dropped, I began to feel different. The muscle tension increased, and as I was prompted to look at my hand, I realized it felt disconnected from my body. It wasnt like a phantom limb, where I didnt feel it - it just felt foreign and far. As soon as I looked up at my surroundings, I realized everything felt slightly foreign and far. The circumstances were weird, and I asked myself what was so peculiar about the reality I was in. This feels weird, I said. Louise looked up at me with a concerned look, and asked, Bad weird?. I considered, and had a hard time deciding: my feelings, thoughts, and emotions, were getting hazier and confused, Not really... not bad and not good, just weird. This sense of weirdness persisted throughout the whole trip and well-into the next day. I considered, and had a hard time deciding: my feelings, thoughts, and emotions, were getting hazier and confused, Not really... not bad and not good, just weird. This sense of weirdness persisted throughout the whole trip and well-into the next day. I later realized it was this weirdness that caused me to dissociate from my immediate reality, and re-evaluate the world around me. 

My painting style was then forced to become different, as my movements became more erratic as a result of the growing muscular tension, and I decided to instinctively pick up colors, and just throw them around on the paper. Instead of swirls, I began to shade, mix, and create shapes of various sizes and forms. I disrupted the harmonious green-teal-gold scheme I was working with, to add traces of red, peach, yellow, and navy. I felt euphoric and inspired, as if Id just had two pops of Adderall or Ritalin (I sometimes take ADD prescription meds - despite not having ADD - as a way to concentrate on studying, and stay up all night). Dianna began talking, and I found everything she had to say extremely funny. Her, Summer, and I were laughing loudly at the most random comments made by each other, Louise, or Frey. 

Louises roommate, whose name I forget, was at the apartment too, and prepared brownies. I wasnt particularly hungry after the sushi, but decided to try one, as they looked very good. Unfortunately, I think she baked them with the wrong ingredients, since they tasted like garlic. The smell was so strong, I didnt even want to be next to the batch. Neither Louise, Frey, or herself seemed to notice any of this, or chose not to say anything, like Dianna. Summer and I both agreed they were really bad. 

The sense of weirdness slowly pervaded everything around me, and it evolved into an inability of my brain to properly process, and make sense of, my surroundings. It wasnt like I didnt understand anything anymore, but more like my immediate reality just didnt compute. Why was I there out of all places? Why was Frey, whom I went to school with, there? Why were he and Louise involved now? That was all so random. I couldnt justify any of it, and was very bothered by the fact. 

Acid attention-span is notoriously limited, so I shook my worrisome thoughts away, in favor of a deep desire to leave the room. Dianna and Summer followed me, as we headed to the floors hallway to look at the traffic and cars through the window. That was the only part of the trip where I felt extremely energetic, and I had a deep desire to release this energy by running around. Dianna, Summer and I ran around the stairs, laughingly numbed down. All across the stairway, there were signs up, which depicted an apple and a cigarette with a red cross over it. Summer remarked that it was the most messed up no-smoking sign shed ever seen, and I explained that the apple represented New York City, the Big Apple, so it did make sense. I realized that if I concentrated, and really looked at something, I could make sense of it, so I got very excited. We were about to run further down, when Louise came back to get us, and lead us back into the apartment. 

When Dianna, Summer, Louise, and I went back to the apartment, the weirdness continued. Sitting back down was difficult; I felt so hyperactive, but I let my movements guide me on the canvas, continuing my shading. Immediately, when I looked over at her, I noticed Dianna wasnt as keen on keeping herself as grounded, and she began to giggle all over the place again. I cant really remember how much time had passed while we were like that, but before I knew it, I noticed Dianna asking Louise to paint her feet.

Louise picked up a clean, fine brush, dipped in purple paint, and began drawing steady swirls all over Diannas feet, who felt giddy and excited. She laughed and waved her long arms in the air, as she announced how liberating it felt. Suddenly, Dianna was so into the whole painting experience, I noticed her taking off her t-shirt, revealing a sports bra. I asked her whether she felt cold, but she was way too exhilarated to answer, or care, probably. She began painting her own tummy in a dark teal color, and at every stroke, she felt more enthusiastic and free. It was beautiful for me to watch that, and I felt like I was seeing all of Dianna expressing her artistic nature - (Dianna is currently studying screenwriting, but in her spare time she sings, acts, and plays the trumpet. She defines herself as a full-fledged artist.) 

This is what I was meant to do! she continued to exclaim, this is just what I needed! Im releasing all of my artistic energy, and this is wonderful. It feels so right!. Upon seeing her so relieved, about something as, supposedly, trivial, as splashing paint on her bare tummy, I felt envious of Dianna for a split second. She was like a little kid, rediscovering the joy of colors all over again, and I wished I could feel like that about paint too. I wanted to find something to also feel liberated and lightheaded. All of a sudden, Summer, who had been sitting in a corner, blasting out some dank tunes, got up and demanded Dianna to paint her calves. Dianna picked up the navy brush Id been using, and began drawing patterns on Summers calve. 

Now, I really dont remember how what happened next initially developed, but I suppose it spawned out of a conversation I wasnt paying attention to. I was extremely concentrated in identifying how I felt, and settling down the weirdness. I think I spent a significant amount of time staring at Frey and Louise, who were also playing a drawing game (they were attempting to construct a character, by each drawing a head, torso, and legs in turn, and then comparing the result). I was really trying to spot the little things that made me think of them as a couple: sneaky kisses, graceful grazes, and just overall looks. I found it fascinating. 

But back to what I missed, as soon as I turned around, I noticed Dianna had written Fuck Misogyny on Summers tiny calve. I laughed very loudly, which prompted them to laugh more with me. Dianna then realized she wanted more paint!, and went to change into shorts. I started to feel a sense of extreme euphoria: I wanted to laugh, I wanted to paint, and I wanted to feel everyone around me on a deeper level. It was a strange sensation - something I thought as more akin to MDMA (which I havent tried, but am intending to soon).

Dianna raced back in a pair of short shorts, and I still wondered how she wasnt freezing, since we were all wearing hoodies but her. She looked down at me, and asked, with a huge grin on her face, Len, write Fuck Misogyny on my thighs! In red! I want it to look ginormous and aggressive!. I found the request hilarious, and agreed immediately. My muscles were still tense, and I felt strangely antsy (similar to the Ritalin-antsy I feel when I cruise), so the result wasnt the best. Not to mention, I accidentally misspelled Misogyny and had attempted to correct it, making the letters even more daunting and bolder-looking. Dianna was, nonetheless, very pleased with the result, as it wrapped around her back, and she had the last syllable visible only from behind. It was at that point that she said, You need some color in you! and sprinkled my hair and forehead in lavender. 

Something you must know about me, I am extremely paranoid about my hair. I need to constantly straighten it every time I wash it (its naturally frizzy/wavy), and Id just done that for the occasion, earlier on the day. Having paint in my hair would have made it crusty and dirty, so as soon as I saw it there, I exclaimed, Dianna! Not my hair!, still laughing, of course. She conceded, but didnt let go of my face, Okay, but you still need some more color. At that point, Summer came up from behind, and began painting the back of Diannas legs, who then sneaked up on me, and stroked a huge red line on my face. I hadnt even realized it, but a painting battle was ensuing. Dianna was so into it, she began painting both herself and us, by squeezing the tubes directly on our skin. She recommended Summer and I both change in shorts and sports bras, so we could all paint each other. 

I am not the kind of person who typically agrees to this kind of stuff. I am not entirely comfortable with getting down and dirty, but I thought to myself, Im on acid, might as well! and as soon as I had mentally accepted the fact I was going to get painted all over, I felt extremely ecstatic. I wouldnt say my emotional responses were slowed down or delayed, but rather amplified: I processed everything with intensity, and was determined to survey my stance on every event that took place. Obviously, because of the confusion and haze of weirdness, I didnt reach very promising conclusions. It was very basic business - either something made me very happy, or very confused. 

When I went to Diannas room to change, I realized I didnt even care about being nude with the door open. I have always been very confident and at ease with being naked, but it was always with people I knew. In this case, in order to put Diannas clothes on, I needed to go full topless for some seconds, and Frey was right there in the living room, which was directly adjacent. I found myself so contented in my own skin that I wouldnt have minded being full-on naked and dancing. Still, I did realize that it wasnt an option, because of our hosts. 

This is something worth mentioning: when I was on acid, I was perfectly able to put myself in the shoes of a sober person. I could immediately imagine how Louise and Frey, and even Louises roommate, must have felt seeing that weird spectacle, and I initially apologized for it. Thankfully, Louise happens to be incredibly awesome, so she simply smiled at me and said, Len, youre on LSD, its bound to get weird. Stop apologizing. 

Our acid-uniform was extremely revealing, but it was absolutely perfect for the incredible amounts of paint we were about to pour on each other. I was wearing brown lipstick, and immediately realized it couldnt stay on. I needed to be fully naked, fully raw, so I quickly went to the bathroom to remove it. It was laborious, but entertaining; I tried to use tissues and water, but it smeared a red stain all over my chin - which only made me laugh more. Most people say mirrors arent a good idea on acid, but I have to disagree. I loved looking at myself so happy and carefree. 

Eventually, I realized that Dianna actually had makeup-remover wipes, and attempted to use them to remove the red smear on my face. I was somewhat successful, but at one point I remembered I was about to get paint all over it anyways, so I just left and ran back out. The sight I was greeted with was peculiar, to say the least: both Summer and Dianna were dipping their hands in paint, and plastering each other with it. I immediately joined, with black and gold 
palms, but as more paint accidentally got in my long, blonde hair, I felt even more uneasy. Louise, who was watching from a distance, offered to put my hair up in a top knot, and I thanked her endlessly. I remember thinking that she was being like a little guardian angel for us. 

And, like that, we drifted into another dimension. We painted our cheeks, our bellies, our chests, our legs, our arms... and it was beautiful. I wouldnt say that for me and Summer it was as liberating as it must have been for Dianna, who is much more connected to painting than us. Yet, it was something filled with beauty. We were in a daze of colors and easygoing uneasiness - it was weird, but it was okay! Thats when the perception of time went out of the window. I frankly dont remember for how long we painted each other for, but it was like a sacred ritual, so it was worthy of being timeless. 

At that point, an RA knocked on our door. It was Sunday night, and starting 11 PM, all halls of our university force us to turn music and voices down for quiet hours. I hadnt factored time in, so I immediately jumped to the conclusion that this person clearly knew we were on LSD, so I ran to Diannas room. She saw me and smiled anxiously, Len, you cant hide! This doesnt even look suspicious... they cant know! What would they write us up for? Being fucking weirdos covered in paint? Isnt that what college is all about?. For someone on acid, that was series of very logical arguments. 

Sadly, I couldnt be as logical as Dianna, so I still felt worried. Louise answered the door, and, like we suspected, the RA only wanted us to turn the volume down a bit, to which she agreed, and he, supposedly, left. I dont think he paid attention to, or saw, the three of us. I stumbled upon the mirror as I walked back to the living room, for what I thought was going to be round two of paint, and everything changed. 

As soon as I saw myself, I was shell-shocked. My face striped in red and gold, my legs scribbled in teal and navy, and my tummy yellow and purple - I felt so feral, so animalistic, so wild. I felt like a ferocious version of me. Summer and Dianna turned around to tell me how beautiful I looked, which only fueled this sensation more. Summers face was half-black and half-teal, and she also seemed real and majestic... and Dianna? Diannas face was green! She looked like mother nature! I felt connected to the two of them on a deeper level, like we were a tribe of painted Indians (Im pretty sure that if Id taken two tabs - like we plan to do soon - and felt a more intense high, I would have started to do some powwow dance shit. Summer had been dancing all night already, as she has had dancing training background, and was so in-tune with the harmonies that played, I loved watching her). 

We had never looked so beautiful, to me, but the more I scrutinized my appearance, the more I came to the realization that the paint had to come off. I looked at Diannas tummy, the first body part we had painted, and noticed the previously moist pigment had now solidified, and seemed fibrous and hardened, like it was about to crack at any minute. The paint was now a fraud - a courageous cover hiding my true self, and I had to let go of it immediately. My soul had to be completely naked for the trip, and this paint was covering it! Sure it had been fun, but like all things it had to end. 

As I began to scrape the hardened paint off of my chest, I realized what I just thought. I realized how immersed into my own thought process I was, and I slowed down. I rubbed my skin slowly and, frankly, it became even a little painful after a while (when I looked at the mirror, the peeled parts were all visibly sensitive-looking and reddened). It didnt matter though, because I was letting go of what covered me to reveal my true self and begin my trip - and there was no better come up. Feeling my flesh through my flesh was almost like a paradoxical surreal experience: my sense of touch was confused as to which surface was actually part of my own body, and which simply encrusted it. I gave myself warmth and protection; I suddenly felt very warm and cozy inside. 

The more I embraced myself by rubbing it all away, the more these thoughts seemed to have appeared. I thought about feeling at one with me - about wanting to keep hugging and touching myself; about nourishment. In particular, the nourishment of my soul, and how much feeding it must have been doing through my endless turbine of volatile, airy emotions. 

IV.

At this point, Id crossed the event horizon. The thoughts about spirituality, and communion with the self, clouded up my mind at every dazzling fingertip motion I made on my surface skin. This is the moment where I truly realized I was very high. My trip had actually commenced, and there was no going back now! 

On an important note: I wasnt impeded. I feel like movies, television, songs, or even just peoples verbal or visual descriptions and portrayals of being high on LSD are very much different from what you end up feeling, at least from what I ended up feeling on my dose. I wasnt totally fucked up!, like I could have never stepped out of it. In fact, Im sure that if I had been given some sort of fairly easy task, I would have been able to complete it (obviously nothing that required lots of creativity, as letting the mind run wild is what ultimately tripping is all about, and would definitely stimulate it.) Basically, I could have kept my cool, no problem there. 

The problems seemed to arise when I let myself zone out: my intellect drifting in and out of reality, and its metaphysical formations. Whenever I retreated into my own little world, I saw what was around me as a fraud - as a metaphysical landscape which, despite striving fearlessly, was definitely not the actual truth that I was exposed to on a daily basis. I was stuck in this dream-like haze, absorbing everything else around me, and soaking it in my melted brains acid- juice. Still, Id like to stress how much mentally hampered I wasnt. I was on drugs, sure, but when drunk, or stoned, Im usually less likely to be at a complete cognitive loss. I mean, nothing goes on, as far as brain functions go, when Im on those substances. Acid was much more like there was too much going on. 

Speaking of, everything was too much. This particular state caused me a lot of what is commonly known as distress. Im saying commonly known because the word closest to describing how reality affected me at that point was distress - yet it holds a really negative connotation. I want to highlight the fact that the distress I was feeling wasnt entirely negative, oh no. This goes for anything else that might follow in the report: even if it seems like Im describing negative emotions, they most definitely werent. Most of my trip was tainted by euphoria, wonder, and confusion - but overall, it was a very neutral experience, which made it much more complex, and interesting. 

So, back to the distress. I believe it was caused by the fact that everything around me was too much to handle. I looked over at every single random object around, and it amazed me. It wasnt like it seemed new, or I was seeing it through new eyes - no; I knew exactly what everything was, but I couldnt register it. I couldnt compute or understand it. Everything seemed to have a point, and objects just didnt. They just lied there, and the fact that they did was baffling me. It was funny, and, as always, confusing, at the same time. Everything sparked a whole new trail of thoughts and observations, so when I was forced to just look at things, I couldnt. I had to sit back, and actually observe them, considering them in the most holistic way possible. 

This, in turn, prompted me to think of acid as a little lens that zoomed into my feelings regarding everything. The intensity of emotions I felt was incredibly amplified, and I mean, I dont consider myself as particularly apathetic on a daily basis, but Im not very in tune with what I feel either. As I kept peeling scrapes of paint off of my belly, I was trying to identify how I felt - but I felt so much. At the same time. And I couldnt break it apart, no matter how much I tried, all I could do was just sit there and feel it, soaking it all in, like a little sponge. 

Dianna and Summer, who were definitely more socially engaged with each other by that point, just kept peeling, until one of them (I honestly cannot remember who it was) suggested to hop in the shower. Dianna thought it was a magnificent idea and, with a cheshire-cat worthy grin, sprinted to the bathroom to get the water running. Summer followed her with excitement, but I wasnt as joyful, all of a sudden. The feeling of weirdness from before had settled in with extreme intensity, and my inability to process my immediate surroundings sent me mentally far back to civilization. I thought about the concept of a shower - and how that involves getting hair wet. 

My hair was still in that top knot Louise had solidly pinned up in place an hour before, (I actually have no idea how much time had passed. Dianna had devised a system where she would give Mark a call every hour, in order to keep track of time, but had given it up after the first two calls, as we had decided to succumb to acid and lose ourselves in its timeless dimension), but it wasnt going to save much from the furious dorm-room nozzle sprinkling Diannas bathtub was equipped with. In the real world we could have found a way for me not to get my hair wet, but thinking systematically about real-life practical solutions seemed like a removed concept. No, I knew that if I stepped in that tub, my glorious straightened locks would have turned into the unruly lions mane I was born with. 

It probably seems a little weird to you that Im making such a big deal out of... well, hair. But it defined me. It still does. My hair is one of my favorite things about me, and I love to have control over how it looks, styling it to my liking. Getting it wet made me fearful and anxious, but I felt even more fearful and anxious, as soon as I realized my friends had left me in the living room. Im sure Louise and Frey were caught up in their own little romantic game to mind my uneasiness, but I still decided to join Summer and Dianna in the bathroom, instead. 

I saw them immediately hop in the tub, and turn, the shower on. Dianna took off her bra, and did her arm-wave thing again, her eyes squint-shut and her mouth wide open, soaking in the warm liquid droplets all around. Summer kept her top on for a little while, as she tried to only wash the paint off of her feet, but Dianna pushed her right below the water. She looked peaceful and exhilarated, letting out a loud, genuine laugh. It was so nice to see the two of them so happy. It warmed me up inside, when the rest of what was around me seemed cold and meaningless. 

They were somewhere else, but I wasnt with them. I was caught up in figuring out a way to get the paint off of my body without getting my hair wet. I sat by the tub, in front of the sink, with knees up to my nose. I found that I still couldnt help but touch myself, I needed to feel my body there, with my mind. I was afraid that if I didnt, everything would have disconnected. I stared at my legs a lot, but I wasnt exactly tripping; I mean, by that point I still hadnt felt extremely visually engaged by the trip. It seemed a little like weed, the colors looked nicer and brighter, but I hadnt seen. 

I wasnt thinking about that at the present moment, I wasnt thinking about anything in particular. Dianna and Summer pulled the shower curtains over, so that the water wouldnt have gotten me wet, and that prompted me to shut the door of the bathroom. I stretched my legs and decided to look at what was ahead of me, for a second. Oh man, was it complex. The little tiles squared off every single centimeter of that wall, compressing the whole white thing in small little grids. And the more I heard Dianna and Summer laughing, the more the tiles seemed to reflect that - they were the manifestation of those timid little shrills and squeaks that occasionally escaped from their vocal chords. And thats when I saw. 

I looked down at the mirror, and then at the sink. I was particularly fascinated by the the lower part, as Id never previously even paid a single mind to it. I wasnt looking at the pipes either, it was just the lower part of the sink container, as I saw it from ground level, that astounded me. I noticed it was white porcelain, and that it had tiny holes at the side. I kept staring at them in amazement, those holes were beautiful: small, delicate, circular, and harmonious with the rest of the design. The beauty ended quite rapidly though, as the smallest of the holes began to slowly expand, and then diminish in size again. Yeah, the sink was definitely breathing. 

I edged closer to stare at that spectacle, and watched carefully, as the hole, which, by that point, had definitely become the sinks mouth, opened and closed ever-so-steadily. But it wasnt a calm inhale and exhale... it was gradual, but by no means relaxed. It was frantic, lonely, and bleak. I heard Summer calling my name, wondering why I hadnt jumped in, but Dianna quickly explained to her that I was gone into my world. Then again, I totally understood everything, I did hear them - I just chose not to care; the sink seemed like a such a bigger deal at the moment.

And thats when I had my first realization, as I stroked the cold porcelain, I felt out of breath myself. Its the loH, I thought. That loH is making me suffocate; this sink is just as much me as I am breathless, and it. I kept studying the respiratory patterns of the sink, and noticed it slowing down even more, to the point of stopping. As soon as that happened, I opened up the shower curtains, and with what I assume was a terribly bewildered look on my face, I announced, I need to move out of that loft. 

Summer smiled open wide (because of a previous incident, which is definitely a story for some other time, Summer really wasnt fond of my loft mates, and had always been favorable to the idea of me looking for somewhere else to live in), and her eyes lit up even more, Come on in! she encouraged me, nodding off to the tub. 
After having suddenly realized that it was the loft that had made me feel toxic all along (not talking about the trip here, just my state of mind during the day), I felt the sudden need to be clean. To wash it all away, and screw my hair! Yet, I wasnt fully convinced.

But, my hair! I complained, It looks disgusting in its natural waves. 

Dianna grinned, I have a straightener, she said, Itll be fun. Come get clean, Len! And like that, as she spritzed water onto Summer, who sat there and took it all in with her eyes closed, I realized I had to do that: I had to get clean. I took my top off, stepped into the tub and felt the water on my skin, so warm and comforting. As I rapidly undid Louises top-knot, I felt even more liberated, Girls, this is my cleanse, I announced boldly. 

Once I sat there, there were few more moments where I embraced and rubbed my flesh. I dont know whether it was because I felt vaguely cold, or because I wanted to get all traces of paint out, or just because I wanted to keep experiencing the touch of my own skin, but it was effective for all three of those reasons. I cannot tell how much time I spent in my own little tub cocoon: it could have been seconds, minutes, hours, or even days. I remember, at one point, commenting on how it even felt like weeks. 

Sitting there wasnt as euphorically entrancing as it looked, by the way. As soon as I settled, I just thought... again. I loved to fall into pensiveness, but the more I came up, the more thoughts I had. I couldnt really concentrate on one single thing; everything induced me to question it. I was so removed from the reality around me that everything was overwhelming, and arising simultaneously. But instead of staying separate and going nowhere, it was like all of those questions united into one big reflection - and, after reaching such a promising conclusion on my living situation, I began evaluating other aspects of my life. All of it, all at once. 

As my mind grew heavy, I noticed that Dianna was right, and I was in my own little world. I couldnt be social at that moment; I mean, its not exactly like I couldnt, more like I really, really, didnt want to. Not through words at least. 

I evacuated my mind to look at my fellow trip members, and they seemed to be just as engaged as me. Dianna sat at the end of the tub, lying with her arms spread out on its edge, while Summer had her legs crossed to my right. The more I watched them, the more I felt like I wanted to be in their heads. I wanted to feel what they were feeling, but I couldnt bring myself to say it, so I chose actions to portray my words. 

I reached out to them, and embraced their shoulders. They moved closer to me, and we stood there like that for another timeless while. I gripped their wet arms and bodies in shower-soaked glory; feeling their entities in there, in the same position, in the same place - both mentally and physically - was wondrous. We were naked, in every sense of the word. We were all experiencing so much, and the more we touched each other, the more we felt it all around us: our adventures slowly merging together, in one moment of shared acid communion. It was magnificent. 

Thats when we realized that there was no going back, that after this experience, we would have been bonded for life. It wasnt just about dropping, and experimenting, with friends anymore. It was about acquiring a new, elevated connection, with each other. I loved them; probably more than I loved my thoughts - and they became my thoughts, as the force of their love and attachment overcame me. I loved love, and I loved to love. So much love. 

Summer, then, decided to head out. I asked her, Arent you finding this paradise?, to which she just looked at me and remarked, I was like that two hours ago! with a big smile on her face. She thought she wasnt affected by the substance anymore, but I didnt believe her. I let her go, since I figured she probably wanted to be alone for a bit. Dianna and I both agreed that we needed to be warmed up a little more before leaving. 

Dianna leaned her head back on the edge of the tub, and we both retreated back into our own respective dimensions. I was still in a haze of confused emotions, running one after the other, and often together - but all were tinged by love now. I thought about people that had left my life back when I moved here (before leaving, a bit of a mess happened with my old friends in my so-called hometown, and I had been alienated from my social circle) and then, it hit me that I still loved them. But not in a way that was holding me back, in a way whereby I thought of the good times we had had, how much they made me grow, and how thankful I was for all those experiences. I realized life was a constant running course, but that the feelings associated with particular moments would always be there, and I could choose to bring those back, as opposed to the hostility that subsequently overcame our relationships. That didnt matter, because it was a negative emotion, and I loved too much to feel it. 

My sea of feelings was briefly softened by Dianna, whom I realized I was lying on top of, only when she put her head up again, and attempted to explain, Oh I was on such a good trip Len... I was on a spaceship... but then I became the ship... and I was flying, oh it was beautiful! and I could see it. And it was. Picturesque. But I couldnt talk about that now, no matter how much I wanted to be visually engaged, I just needed to share emotions. 

I feel so much love right now, I communicated casually. My tone seemed almost sleepy and uninterested, but I figured I was simply physically consumed, and mentally overwhelmed, by the experience. Dont you?! Dianna asked excitedly; she seemed to definitely relate, as her eyes lit up. Theres so much love in this apartment now, I couldnt be any happier! she exclaimed. I simply smiled. Smiling was weird, tense, but so natural. I remember back when we were painting, I couldnt help but smile - like I had to tense up my muscles, and do it. But as I grew more pensive, I felt a decided separation from the come-up to the actual trip. The come-up was happiness, the trip was love. I separated them, deciding that, while happiness was beautiful, this was so much more engaging. Experiencing that much love didnt make me want to smile. No, it just made me more of a sponge, and I just kept absorbing it all around me. 

And the fact that theres so much art in here! Dianna added, I just, I just think this is what Im meant to be doing, you know? Like all of this art is my calling... all of this art and love. I would have spoken, but articulating a response took too much effort. (Honestly, I probably did, I just cannot remember what I said... I cannot remember how this particular conversation went, sadly, so Im probably paraphrasing what exactly was said. I remember that I just kept going on and on about feelings, while Dianna expanded upon her affinities with art). 

Youre such an artist though, like, you actually are! valley-girl speak was what was most articulate of me. I thought in very complex terms, but I was only able to express them in condensed form. If I attempted to exposed my theories, as I thought them out, I would have not made any sense whatsoever... but more about that later. 
Dianna smiled, So are you, she said. And it was true: we were all artists, because we were all lovers. We were one and the same. Everyone. It was such a universal discernment, that I was sure, no, I knew, that she just had had the same thought. Diannas blue eyes immediately widened, her smile grew wider, and with a startled look on her face, she declared, Oh Len, I just realized something, listen to this! 

I knew that was cue for me to turn around and sit directly in front of her. She spoke animatedly, and eloquently elucidated to me my second realization: 
Love is art, Len. Love is the abstraction of everything behind art. 
That made sense! I chimed in, Yes because we communicate what we hold dear to us, what were passionate about! 
She nodded, Yes, exactly! And art is just the tangible expression of love. The physical in what connects us and makes us feel. And its just so powerful, you know? 

This may sound like gibberish to you now, but it still makes perfect sense to me. To put it more fluently: art is a tangible manifestation of what arouses feeling in us, and regardless of what those feelings are, love is usually involved, as we create work based on things that we actually care about; while love is the conceptualized notion of all thats behind artistic creation. See, it is an intelligible theory. 
Immediately after reaching that enlightening conclusion, Dianna felt at a good mental place and got out of the shower. I knew I needed to stay for longer, alone, and trip a little bit. I thought that acid was going to transport me places randomly, but I had complete control on the level of immersion I wanted to experiment with, and now it was the time to dive. I leaned back and assumed Diannas old placement, but probably didnt look as majestic (my arms and legs are about half her lengths!) 

But instead of being richly involved into another world, I remained in the dimension of feelings Id been previously exploring, until i closed my eyes. Closing my eyes was interesting. Id say I wasnt Tripping hard!!!1111,, but I definitely had compelling closed-eye visuals. It was mostly mandalas, and typical LSD-esque tubular designs, moving around in teal, golden orange, and this iridescent purple/magenta color. All the shades were extremely vivid, but the shape of what I was looking at exactly seemed unclear. It was all relatively dark, and I had to dig deep to let it fully overtake me. All in all, I thought that I hadnt taken enough of Lucys juice to be actually optically enthralled, but boy was I wrong. 

I decided Id had enough of looking for an outer body experience, to then end up finding spiral patterns. I felt weirdly jealous of Dianna, and how, even with just half a blotter, she was able to feel and envision so much more than me. Maybe a change of scenery would have helped, I considered, so, with the little dexterity I had left, I turned off the shower and got up, determined to go out...only to realize my clothes werent there. 

Dianna! I called out. I heard her laughing, Yes? I think I left my clothes in your room... can I borrow some PJs, or something? I asked. I sounded very normal, which was strange. Was my trip already over? 

Sure, one minute!, I heard her exclaim from afar. She sounded so far, all the way in another room. Another room was another dimension... and I kept feeling bizarre: I wasnt high anymore, I told myself. Yet, the feeling of peculiarity and weirdness was still there. The whole reality around me was uneasy, and standing there in the cold, topless and in soaked shorts, didnt make things any un-uneasier. I decided to act sober, so that the trip would have further diminished, despite it had seemingly died out already. 

Again, time was confusing, so I dont know how much of it passed, but I stood there, like that, for a significant amount. I remember thinking how Dianna was taking forever, and I wanted to have some clothes on my body already! Dianna, can I borrow a towel, at least? I finally asked. 

Oh RIGHT. Im so sorry Len, this has all ben so confusing! I heard her, afar again. 

Her steps edged closer, with a tense kind of grace. She seemed to float amidst gravity, her euphoria lifting her up, as she opened the door. 

Here, she handed me a large white t-shirt, you know one of those they hand you somewhere youve actually been to, along with a pair of checkered pink and black bottoms. They were a little large on my small frame, but it was comfortable. Actually, it felt amazing. Like every inch of the fabric was cuddling my body. A pajama acid hug. The whole thing was so pleasing that I didnt even mind my wet, long hair looking especially brown and curly in its state. Id stood there so long it wasnt even dripping anymore, just a little damp. Not to mention, my underwear had gotten soaked with Diannas shorts, from before (we never took our bottoms off, in the shower) and so I was having my first, and painfully necessary, college-commando experience. Even letting my lady parts breathe helped me calm down. 

When I realized I was done dressing up, and had to head to Diannas room, I committed myself to keep what ended up being my sober-façade up. I can be completely unaffected by all of this, if I choose to, I reminded myself. So, one step after the other...- this is so weird.

As soon as I opened up the door, and saw Louise sitting there with Frey still, I knew this wasnt over. It was too weird to be over. Too unusual. Too peculiar. My steps were fragmented, and tentative, and everything seemed suddenly extremely uninviting. The kitchen didnt look like a kitchen, the common room didnt look like the common room wed been hanging out in, and Diannas room was another dimension. The dimension where my sisters and I had to step and be together in, immediately, I thought. I needed someone that could relate to what I was experiencing as soon as possible.

I walked in, to Summers velvety voice greeting me with gusto, Len, wazzup! I felt myself frowning, despite not wanting to, This is so weird, was all I could say. Summer grinned, her blue eyes trying to perceive exactly what my state of minds valence was: good or bad weird? As if Id just read her mind, I added, Good weird, but still weird. She nodded, and returned to whatever it was she had been doing on Diannas bed. 

I think I should mention there were two beds on the room, positioned parallel to each other, with a vast walking space in the middle. I sat on the left side, on Diannas roommates bed (whose name I forget, as she wasnt there that night), while Summer had been chilling on Diannas mattress, which was so messy that I think part of it might have been exposed. Still, not any messier than my mattress. 

Maybe its the SSRIs, you know? I read some people cant really trip on those, Dianna said, as she restlessly walked around the room. She kept stepping back and forth, while scratching and caressing her body. I was past that phase, but I still stroked my cheeks and chin way too much for my own good. 

Yeah, I dont know. Its not like Im not feeling it, just not really anything too intense. Im not affected by it. Summer said. I connected the dots, and realized that Summer had probably lamented not being high, while I was still in the shower. I related to that, since it was just what Id been thinking of, but things were about to change. Plus, quite frankly, Summer has a high tolerance when it comes to substances, albeit being even a couple of pounds less than me, and roughly the same height. I knew my girl, and I knew that merely half a blotter wasnt going to, necessarily, be life-altering for her. 

Me, on the other hand... I was a different story that was about to turn to its climaxing page. I am known to be moody, and it isnt unusual for my state of mind to shift rapidly from hour to hour, depending on the circumstances. Acid really didnt help with that. Its little lens zoomed in that shift, and before I could even process what my name was, I was back in the feels-dimension. 

I felt everything. Everything that was inside that relatively small dorm room was transmitting some sort of energy that I absorbed in subtle, but extremely potent ways. Every single entity in the room, be it Summer or Dianna, a sweater on the floor, a sham-less pillow on the bed, or a picture of an asian little girl, was feeling with me everything. No, I guess a more accurate description would be that every single entity contributed to characterizing the rooms feel, and that feel in turn affected me, as the setting was pivotal to the experience. I was the room, or better, I was what I felt like in the room. 

I looked around me, and the weirdest part was that all of these feelings came about on a purely superficial level. It wasnt like I had immersed myself in the details surrounding many of the times thrown all over the place. Just by looking, just by simply noticing one, tiny little thing, the whole feel became different. It became richer, it expanded and grew inside me, until I couldnt process it anymore.

I chose to focus on illustrations and decorations, since they were mere replicas of reality, and everything seemed like an unauthentic copy at the moment. Dianna had decorated her side of the cream-colored wall with a series of Keith Haring-themed designs, but one of them particularly stood out to me: it was a blue faceless stickman (his typical shapes) standing on a huge marine-mammal looking yellow creature. Its eyes were widened, just like its mouth, and it seemed like it was suffering from the weight, or perhaps the supposed motion, of the person on top of it. It made me very pensive. 

At first, it sparked within me very literal thoughts. I imagined humans, and how terrible our relationship with animals really is, despite how much we pride ourselves in being the protectors of the sea, which made my vibe drop significantly. I thought about a particular instance in Sixth Grade, when one of our Middle School Orientation teachers had forced all of the grade in the our auditorium to view a then-recent video of seal violence in the arctic. I remember how disgusted and appalled I felt, but that only translated into resignation - not even sadness, just a desolate feeling as I decided that it was in human nature to be cruel, and not every animal could be free. 

It was in human nature to be cruel. Like Seth. Seth had been cruel to me. And he always popped up. I dont know why I had some sort of notion that I was over him, or that drugs would have made me over him, because despite the deeply-felt heart-to-heart Id had with Summer the previous day, he was still there! Still monopolizing and dictating me and making me wonder, what had I done wrong? Why had I lost him. Why didnt I see him anymore. Wait. I was the one not seeing him anymore, not the other way around! 

As I still stared at the blue stickman, I realized I was it. I was the stickman and Seth was the little seal, because I had always been on top of him (technically, in more ways than one, but Im trying to be serious here, so Im keeping it on a strictly emotional level). Yes! I thought to myself, yes, yes! I was the one with the power, and he was just a tiny little fragment of my life. 

And thats when my third realization hit me: nothing really mattered. Everything seemed extremely small and insignificant, all of my relationship problems, I mean. Seth didnt matter anymore, he was just another guy. A guy Id been heavily infatuated with, granted, but at the end of the day just another stupid, socially impaired guy. He was going to be part of my journey through life, of course, and he had changed a lot of me within this journey - but he was just a part. A preLy short-lived part, at that. 

And soon, everything in the room became scarily meaningless. 
Now, Ive mentioned in various other parts of this report how meaninglessness was a crucial component to most of what I felt... but now, it had become extremely so. Not only was I unable to process the inner meaning of everything, but it ceased to have a purpose altogether. Everything was nothing, at the same time. 
Ive always been a bit of a nihilist, but I never realized how much frustration this could have ended up costing a day-tripper me. I looked at the Keith Haring designs, all of them, and they bothered me because they were so open ended, they meant so much, yet nothing at the same time. The conflict my mind was feeling, in searching for a meaning that was everything and everyone, and nowhere and nobody, simultaneously, made me feel so irritated that I had to engage with humans. 

I hadnt realized it, but Summer had approached me, while I was feeling the empowerment (I think I mentioned to her how I was the blue man, and Seth the seal, my seal). She smiled really wide, and, I dont know why, but my vision chose to fall somewhere it never does: her nostrils. I kind of noticed how Summer had particularly big nostrils at that angle - she was looking down at me - and the blackness of her nostril was just spooky. The shape of it, weirdly angular, and her flesh so pale around it... it just made me feel gloomy and odd, and I perceived a macabre presence. The macabre presence of death - of the endless blackness in her little nasal holes.

I saw death. In your nostril!, just like that. Fragmented sentence escaped day-tripper me. 

That made her crack up big time. Summer quickly erupted in a long, loud string of laughter that made me feel, all of a sudden, warm inside again. The human presence, the human spirit, or humanity in general - they all reminded me that we werent robots, that we werent programmed to be cruel, to loathe, to hate. That was another instance where Lucy reminded me to love more, and hate less. Even Summers death-shaped nostril deserved some love, because it was part of my best friend, in the good and the bad. 

And love was quick to wrap me up in its arms again. Love was quick to take me in, with all of the wonderful other stem of heart-warming emotions Id associated with it. I thought about my reality, and how much love I felt in this new place, a new place Id moved to in a whim, surrounded by people I didnt know, and how they did love me already, and how I loved them. I felt far, again. 

I was far away from my sassy mother, from my hot-headed father, from my sweet doggie. I was far away from the incidents with my friends... but what got me going was the fact that I was so far away from the friend I loved the most: Lorence. Back in my home country, Id met Lorence about a year earlier, at my former best friends party. Lorence and I quickly bonded over music, and subsequently became bandmates. Throughout the year, our relationship had tightened, and 
he was (still is) one of the people I cared to keep up with and carry on in my life. He had been close friends with Frey as well. And it all connected - the meaningless meaning was meaningful again. I realized how much I loved him, and how much love there was between us despite the distance: what a beautiful friendship - he is my brother. 

And that, thats what made me break down in tears. 

Summer had been making some videos of us, (she still saw herself as the sober one, and Dianna was sitting in a corner, still in the grip of the mysterious ants that had made her manically break down in laughter) so that we could watch them afterwards, sober. I have seen these videos numerous times, and, according to the footage, I was laughing initially. 

Something happened along the way that prompted me to fall into thought (this is probably when I looked over at the Keith Haring sticker), and there is a pretty disturbing moment where I hit my fist repeatedly against the bed, while moaning in frustration. I think thats when the lack of sense of reality got really intense, and everything felt like too much, so nothing it meant was ever enough. I think that was my release of the weirdness. After that fisting session is where I break down and cry. You can also hear Summer, and her lovely voice, singing to me a kind of lullaby, and exclaiming, Wow, youre having a revelation, arent you? 

I nodded, and, apparently, felt very uncomfortable at the fact that she was filming, since I exclaimed, Stop looking at me! Stop filming me! Stop fucking filming this! as I wiped a tear away from my eye. Summer is Summer, so she obviously didnt. I looked straight at the camera for (what I realized later were) several seconds before resuming the tear-fest and, with Dianna- like wavy arm motions, announced Im letting it go; so much. And I was. I let go of Seth, I let go of the drama, of glorifying nostalgic pasts that had never existed in the first place. And it was beautiful. 

The video appeared to end right when we all began to laugh at my hideous gospel-like intonation. I remembered we laughed extremely loudly, to the point where I think Louise and Frey must have gotten scared at the door. Or maybe not. Probably not, no, they probably knew even better than us. 

So, I just told you what I was experiencing at the moment, and what I was physically doing. Notice how different those episodes and reflections seemed? On acid, progression and synchronicity dont really exist. A thought flows into the other, which flows into the other, and it all melts together in reactions and feelings. So, while this was going on, I still had the were all so small! realization fresh in my mind, which made me cry even more because I saw our reality as perfect, as little, as functional - when compared to the space and solar system. Because no matter small, it was still all love and beauty. 

Unexpectedly, (by now, at least) I dont know how long the crying went on for. I dont think it was that much, the tears were quick and cold, but it was so intense it slowed down. I cried every single happy feeling I had ever had in my entire life... or so it seemed like I was doing. It was like every happy moment in my life, which had caused me to feel happy in the past, was uniting in a explosion of euphoria and fulfillment. Through the tears I was releasing all of it: I was crying my life away. 

The emotional liberation I partook in had definitely drained my mind, and I was ready to lean back and trip it out. I sprinted to the living room, and, with shaky hands, picked up my laptop and headphones. Back in Diannas room, she was lying back on her bed, making funny faces and giggling as she stared at the ceiling. I decided to do the same thing, but with probably much different music. 
  
What to listen to became an overwhelming dilemma. I had awaited this moment for so long, that when it actually came, I was extremely conflicted. Since thinking about all of the possibilities overwhelmed me, I decided to let my thoughts melt into my one catchphrase for the trip, Im so far, I whispered, sighing. Immediately, I knew that I had to put on Spring Hall Convert by Deerhunter, as the lyrics of the outro clearly sing out, So far away.... 

I remember once reading, when I was fourteen, on the lead singers blog, about the origins of that song. There was a bright picture to go along with it of a girl; she was spreading her palms open wide below her chin, letting her long fingers frame her face, as a light shone directly on her peaceful expression. She had her eyes closed, and a soK, serene smile. According to the singer, Bradford Cox, that song was actually about states of consciousness, and morphine, (he has Marphans, so he wrote it at the hospital, while he was very sick) - but the picture was taken during an acid trip. During my own trip, all of those elements linked together: the peacefulness, the serenity, the pink shining light, the states of consciousness... that was the quintessential acid song, and if you ever trip yourself- I urge you to listen to it. Itll enhance the experience, no doubt. I mean, its preTy amazing to me on its own, and its very amazing to me on weed... but on acid? It was fucking incredible. It was auditory LSD, it was auditory art, it was auditory love. 

As I was transported through my hearing into another dimension, I decided to let sight join me in my venture. Turns out, visuals were much easier to attain once I just looked for them. The ceiling above us was this textured, off-white-yet-off-cream color, but the various granules of shadows that hit it transformed into shapes in no time. They began waving around, enlarging and retreating, a little like the sink before. It didnt take too long for them to become mitochondria-like pieces of paisley, and then little snakes! They had a very specific green-yellow- purple color scheme, which I found wildly entertaining: why would I remember color theory while tripping out? Because this is a magical substance, my friends. 

The shapes kept vibrating and moving around to the rhythm of the music, and I was in heaven. I was away. I was so far. They put on a real show, not too long after that. They spun, circled, and jumped at a steady and wondrously syncopated pace. It was like they were putting up a performance especially for me. They danced for me and my mind only. For the benefit of my entertainment, there I was. And there were them. Even though I thought I was the only person to see them, they didnt feel like they were part of my mind. They felt like something else. Utterly and entirely disconnected with my cervical perception. And looking for them was strenuous. Strenuous, but amazing, and well-worth the effort. Truly mind-blowing. 

We remained like that until I had to change the song, and thats the first time I had access to a clock ever since we dropped. After calling Dianna, who had still been staring at the ceiling and enjoying herself quite a bit, on her bed, by tapping her feet, I felt like I need to let all of my sisters know, Girls... my digital clock here says its only ti AM. Its only ti ftUYS!. Im not sure what I was expecting, probably some sort of insane time vortex to swallow me, and let me out when it had passed through normal perception. It felt like the whole night had passed. Like a thousand nights had passed, actually. How could it only be one? 

My question wasnt really answered, as Mark stumbled upon the door of Diannas room, opening it loudly, Dianna! He exclaimed, reaching out for the bed, You have no idea... I was editing the footage for the, um, the movie... then, then I decided to smoke up a bit before coming over. So I got the munchies, and I raided my suites fridge for something to eat... I found these cookies, and they were so good... I had like three of those, man. But they were edibles... so Im about to pass out... his speech wasnt upbeat as usual, but lethargically entranced into the dimension of sleep. 
I could imagine what being high and sleepy on weed would have been like, but I was so far! I was on acid, and that sight just saddened me. Weed seemed to be dull and boring, while I was in that state. Dont get me wrong, I would have gladly smoked my way out during the come down, but all the euphoria and inspiration I was feeling on acid would have been dulled out at that point, and by then I realized that this trip wasnt about enhancing visuals (which weed would have definitely aided me in), no, this trip was me exploring the realm of feelings. A realm I dont feel incredibly comfortable with on a daily basis. 

Because Im not particularly attached to Mark, and because I definitely didnt feel like I could confront repressed feelings in front of him, I knew, as soon as he lied on the bed and Dianna sat next to him, that I had to leave. I couldnt be in that room with Mark. 

Everything that was beautiful became corrupted. All the feelings of peace and empowerment were wiped out by anxiety and weakness. Marks energy wasnt my energy, and I wanted to leave immediately. 
I...I have to go. Now. I declared, clumsily grabbing my headphones and my laptop, and heading straight out of the room. Summer decided to leave the lovebirds alone, and followed me back into the common area. I read up that whenever the trip takes a sudden, negative turn, it was a good idea to change my surroundings. I headed out in the hallway, in my pajamas. I had made the smart decision to borrow a blanket from Diannas and wrapped myself around it. 

I went back to the spot where we looked at cars, sat on the railing by the balcony, and realized Summer had followed me there. She sang such a beautiful melody, I cant recall what it was, but her voice was beautiful and it made it sound... so far. I was far. I was far from her. I was far from singing. (I should mention, I used to sing too... in New York I still havent goTen the opportunity, or the balls, really, to go for it, and her nonchalance while exposing such talent brought me to a realization - the use of the quote marks is pivotal, in this case).

I teared up at the thought, and then attempted to present it audibly, I know my calling, I felt the speed at which the cold tear dripped down my cheek, Im a messenger; Im not an artist... I just wasnt meant to be I repeated bitterly. Summer frowned, What? What makes you say that? she asked. She seemed visibly startled, like Id just asked why it was wrong to commit murder. 

Ive been a sponge for this whole trip. Ive just been absorbing so much, and you girls produce! You and Dianna, you guys are so talented, and I just want to know people as talented as you. My talents, well, they dont really come through. I quit them, because they didnt fit in my life, and it means theyre not important to me. Im a messenger, I hold a voice, not the voice, yeah that should be close to what I said. I wasnt really explaining myself, as much as I was giving her excuses on my artistic laziness. To this day, this remains one of the most daunting moments of my life. I was so sure my future and destiny would have led me to a longing for creativity myself, that it scared me. Forever wishing, forever absorbing, and never creating. 

Summer was not convinced at all by my argument, but had probably realized how so far I was, that she didnt have the strength to prove me wrong. We theorized on the nature of direction (Why do cars even move?), the meaning of light (Why are lights on, why are lights on...!), and the altitude of New York City (Imagine jumping...!), before heading back inside. I was much more inquisitive than Summer, who, at every question, decided to wisely admit she just didnt know! with a smile of sincerity painted on her face. 

Once we were back in, I noticed Frey and Louise had put up some of our creations from earlier on during the night. They also showed us the results of their drawing game, which were interesting, to say the least! They were fun to look at, although they made me feel weird. As always, the acid-kind of artificial unsettlement in a reality that did not compute. At all. Louise then began to critique and comment them in a way I found so bizarrely formal, I like the negative space up here! she said, pointing to the white part of the swirls that Id been working on right after dropping. I hadnt even realized Id left a space... We should hang it up! she suggested. Summer seemed to think it was a great idea, but to me the painting was mediocre, and I laughed at the thought of someone wanting to look at it everyday. 

We then stumbled upon other swirls Id made, on another piece of cardboard, which looked weirdly familiar. Oh my god, this is definitely a thing... like a person, look at the face. Its cool Frey added. I inspected the lines and the strokes, then seeing that yes, it was someone. I dont know whom, but someone indeed. A blue face on a sea of red and gold features. Picturesque. Too bad I dont know where that one ended up, that one was the only one worth looking, I thought. 

Immediately after that, Louise and Frey adorably followed through their nightly routine of sleeping. Frey was going to sleep with her in her bed, and they were both going to crash. I was comforted that no normal people were going to be awake now. I needed to retreat into acid, after that intense hallway calling. Summer and I sat on the couch, and with shaky hands, began to type out our feelings. Me by pressing fingers, on this very same keyboard Im currently pressing fingers on, and her by tapping her phones screen. She came up with a magnificent poem, of glistening quality. Me, on the other hand, I did.. well, I did this: 

WHAT ARE WE MADE OUT OF? 
WE CAN BE EACH OTHER WITHOUT OUR BODIES.... BUT WE REPRESENT MORE. 
IF I TOOK MY SYMBOLS OUT OF ME - LIKE MY CLOTHES - WOULD I STILL REMAIN? THEY REPRESENT ME THEY REPRESENT ME AND I KNOW BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS AND WE ALL ARE AND I AM BECAUSE I KEEP BEING. I KEEP BEING AND I KEEP LOVING AND I KEEP EXPRESSING ALL THE LOVE AND ALL I WANT WITHOUT ME.'

I guess that was an attempt at explaining the fourth realization of the night, which dawned upon me as I was pressing said keys! I realized that on a day-to-day basis it was only what I had to define me, not who I was. It wasnt about my qualities, or my personality traits, no, it was about my clothes and my nail polish and my makeup and... it couldnt be that way. Not anymore. This experience was way too spiritual for me to deny my existence as a spirit. As a formerly incredibly nihilist-absurdist person, - I find comfort in chaos - I just couldnt accept meaninglessness anymore, no I had to build up my soul and believe in something greater than me. Something intangible. I needed to be more. 

Back in Diannes room, we could infer what was happening from the noise. She was clearly trying to get a quickie on with Mark, Please, please, please! we heard her tender voice beg, but it was to no avail. Mark was braindead on the sleep-syndrome, and not much fun was to be expected from more time there. She then walked out and came to check up on us. She looked visibly less literally antsy and euphoric than shed been all night. And thats when I had the most sparkling, brilliant idea of the night, Lets go out, I proposed. 

Summer, who wrote a play called Insomnia: The Musical, was clearly in for aimless walking at night on acid, and Dianna agreed on the premise that we were going out to pick up food for her. Since I hadnt had anything since the sushi, and had to keep my motor running for the trip, I agreed. We quickly went back to Diannas to pick up our clothes - we all gave up on bras... or other soaked underwear by that point - and put them on. I wasnt the least bit impaired, nor did I have trouble putting my clothes on, but I was still so far. I was still in an impossibly weird, nonsensical, and removed abysmal world of non-realities. 

I looked at the first paining Id made, as soon as I had my beanie back on. My way-too-material heels squeaked on the ground, and my way-too-material brown lipstick was thoughtlessly re- applied by me, with ease. This was almost automatic to me, and thats when the painting spoke. 

Len, it called me. Now, its not like I could hear the painting as a specific person, I knew it was mostly me doing the talking... but it seemed to come from the direction of the painting. So I aTribute the conversation I had as a conversation with a painting. 

Len, you made me!, it reminded me, You made me. You created ME. You can create. You can be! that was true. Dianna and Summer had noticed my affinity towards the painting, and called my name numerous times as I headed over to touch the paper, Summer is right. Youre wrong yeah, yeah I was! Just because I was experiencing so much, and forced to absorb it, it didnt mean I was never going to be able to produce artistic material ever again. Much on the contrary... 

You can do an be whatever you want! Youre here. If you made it here, you can definitely make anything. Stop trying to stop yourself. Quit qui^ng... the voice of the painting grew fainter, and as I kept stroking it, it has said whatever it had to say, and quieted down in my head. 

I looked back at the girls, who were still attentively watching me, The painting just spoke! It spoke to me. The painting spoke to me! It told me that you were right, Summer, you were right and that messenger shit is stupid. I can be and do what I want I declared my fifth realization, happily. If I have enough inspiration to produce, I will. Eventually. 

THANK YOU! Summer conceded loudly. And now, it was us against the City. 

V.

This might, perhaps, get a little repetitive, but once we had made the decision to go to food (yeah, that was our destination), we felt, preTy much, sober. This might have been because, once you go back to a place of lucidity and intelligible, non-crowded thinking, it is hard to accept you might fall back in the trip. 

The type of hunger that we were feeling, by the way, was very unlike standard munchies from Mary-Jane. Lucys hunger was more along the lines of knowing that we were going to be awake for a long time, and having to keep our bodies running, in order not to fall asleep. 

Throughout the whole day, Id only had a Special-K Bar, coffee and the sushi from before, so I wanted to fill myself a bit. Just a quick snack: not like I needed food, but I wanted to nourish my inner self. 
When we headed downstairs, I remembered how I, originally (before the trip commenced), felt extremely worried at the idea of going out, or even having to sign myself in and show my face to the guards, high. My pupils were as wide as saucers, and I was still very physically tense and jittery. Thankfully, going out was actually painless. I tried to use my University ID to walk out, only to be reminded by Dianna that I didnt need it to exit... yeah, still very much not sober, am I? 

As soon as we went outside, in the cold breeze of early October, the wet tips of my hair tingled, and I felt almost like a sphere of energy forming inside me. It was regenerating, and it made me immediately fall within the trip again. I looked at cars, and how their bumpers looked like faces. I smiled and waved at them. Cars were like domestic animals: they reflected the people inside, so if I made friends with the cars, I would have made friends with everyone inside them. 

My childhood memories were back in the prime-time periphery of my mind. I remembered, back when I used to play this game, when I was in grade school, where I waved at drivers in the highway. Sometimes, they thought it was cute, you know? They smiled and waved right back. Others, just ignored us. Luckily nothing ever obscene happened (lets thank the innocence of my home country for a second here). Anyways, the cars were the owners. The owners were people. I was a person. They were like me! They were like me, and they also lived in my world. A sense of belonging in Union Square suddenly washed up over my body, and New York City had never felt more like my home. I was that little kid on the highway again, seeing everything, and recognizing it as new. I suddenly wondered, what would smoking be like? 

I picked a cigarette from my fresh pack of Marlboro 27s (oh, Europe thank you for making me smoke), and lit it up. Let me just say, even sober, I have a peculiar relationship with smoking- time. Some cigarettes burn away within the shuffle of one song when I commute home, while others seem to take ages to ash out as I walk through avenues and avenues. This one, to my amazement, was a strange example of the laTer category. 

It lasted forever. Maybe it was because Dianna was in a hurry to get to CVS - the closest destination to pick up some quick snacks at - but I felt like I stood there, huffing and puffing out in the middle of the night, for a very long time. Smoking always mellows me out significantly - I mean Ive been smoking for almost a year now, and sometimes, I still feel dizzy and lightheaded from cigarettes. Drifting in philosophical endeavors was calming, and as always, a given, as soon as I was mentally solo. 

Any activity I performed by myself encouraged me to re-evaluate my relationship with others around me, and as soon as Dianna and Summer began to walk around and observe the city lights without me, I just kept studying my cigarette and asked myself, What the hell is the point of smoking anyways? I might have said it out loud, but I cant remember. I smiled ironically, realizing how helpless I was in determining the answer to that conundrum. 

I walked over to Summer, and, holding my cancer stick, declared amusingly, This is the most meaningless act someone can ever perform. She smiled and raised her shoulders. What I loved about Summer is that she never had forced me out of my habits: here she was, completely relating to what I said, even if it was un-relatable for her. Nevertheless, it was pointless for something to be pointless on acid, so it suddenly came to me. 

The packs of Lucky Strikes that Lorence and I had split (he bought them, and basically picked a couple up and leK the rest for me, that bastard), social cigarettes over beer outside in the cold winter, nights of post-joint chain-smoking all summer long... it was all in my past, and it all shaped who I was. It was a stupid habit, yeah sure, but one that I could not shake. A little passport of memories that had impacted me just as much as my clothes, or ideologies. 

Summer still stood silent, and I smiled at her, even more abused when I added, But it does have meaning... for me, She looked back and raised her eyebrows, Really? she asked. I couldnt tell whether she was actually interested, or in her own world, faking it, but I thought it was important to respond, and present my sixth realization, It keeps my home alive, within me. Thats what habits do. Habits are just our ways to remind ourselves that were our own home. Theyre familiar, and keep a bridge between all the change... they just dont change. Obviously I was speaking for myself: a lot of people have found health and benefits in stopping to smoke, or whatever nasty thing they might have been doing. But I am not planning on it, I need to remind myself that I have a home within me, one that wont change no matter where I go. 

When I was finally done, we were ready to walk inside CVS and get something in our tummies (honestly, smoking has never made me feel less hungry, if I really wanted food), just as we were stopped by a young woman wearing a maxi-skirt and a brown leather jacket. She stopped us when she heard Dianna discussing the possibility of going to a more traditional restaurant, where we could sit down and be served. 

Oh girls, if youre looking for somewhere to eat you could go to the Cafeteria she said. Im sure whatever the name of the place was, it wasnt Cafeteria. Something along the lines of that, though. Dianna smiled and Summer responded, Oh we were just there earlier today, it was great! 

Ah, shucks! she said. She was holding a large tote bag, which she pushed over her shoulder. I observed her quietly, my first stranger on acid! She looked so quintessentially human, and in that basic humanity, I found an endless sense of peace and beauty. It was almost artistic, and art was love, so I quickly started to feel an overwhelming rush of love for that woman, Youre beautiful I remarked, interrupting the conversation she was having with Dianna, which was probably normal and boring anyways. 

Oh wow, thank you! she said. I dont think Id make the same observation in a sober state - this girl had crooked teeth, unruly frizzy hair, and was slightly short and stubby. Yet she was perfect, naturally effortless in her harmonious self, and I couldnt hold it in from her. As she walked away, she recommended some website for...something? Like a natural-remedy doctor, I think. I didnt know, neither did I care too much. I kept watching her small feet stumble through in heavy, dark boots. How could I tell her how faultlessly she moved? Your color is green! I announced as she headed in the subway. She frowned, and was probably a little weirded out, Ah. I guess Ill keep that in mind!, she said skeptically. Maybe she thought I was stoned. Maybe she recognized my condition! 

Dianna laughed loudly as soon as the girl was gone. And your color is teal! I said to Summer. This color assignment wasnt really based on anything more than my personal state of mind. I dont normally think people have colors, and nor do I see auras or anything... everyone simply had a color that communicated their personality.

How I came to those conclusions, I wouldnt know. It was some trippy synesthetic association I embraced, not much more to explain. 
The girls agreed with me, and quickly jumped on the bandwagon, Whats my color, Len? asked Dianna. I looked at her, her big, welcoming smile and tall, yet delicate, frame. Youre like, a light... light blue. She nodded slowly, probably trying to envision herself as a light blue, Yeah!, she acknowledged my judgment. I can see that too, Summer added. Dianna suddenly looked at me and emphatically remarked, Youre definitely red. Like an intense, blood-red. I smiled, Crimson I translated. I stroked my leK wrist, where my King Crimson-themed Larks Tongues on Aspic taToo lied. Man do I love that band. 

Then, finally, we walked inside CVS to get something to eat. Lucys distractions were entertaining, but we still had a goal. Humanity pulsed within that store, which I never notice on a daily basis. I always thought that CVS, Walgreens, or Duane and Reade were very plastic- looking places, sterile conglomerates for munchie-related needs. But in that moment, it definitely wasnt. They were still places for our needs, of course, but they were human, and life flowed within them. The music that played, some sort of 80s female-sung pop, was being chanted by a human, for humans. The magazines I looked at depicted humans, and other humans read them. CVS represented the mirror to my little human reality - a small corner on the small universe we inhabit. Tininess was incredibly comfortable, and incredibly human. Yet, not many of the commodities in the store made sense to me; in fact, I was still having a hard time processing the point and reality of objects around me, but I was still connected to this world. Undoubtedly so. Sadly enough, Dianna immediately realized that she the food was barred: Guys, the food is barred down. Lets go up she proposed, running towards the escalators. I knew the chances of us finding food upstairs were slim - the second floor mostly stocked up drugstore beauty products and pharmacy-related health items. But I wouldnt have missed the escalators for the world. Only the one going upward was properly working, and it felt amazing to be basically lifted up; so different from the everyday, almost chore-like, feeling of upward escalators - I was ascending. 

As we thought, upstairs was just makeup... and I had already too much of that, so we went straight down. Going down wasnt as magical as going up, since I actually had to use my legs. It was heavy-handed and slow. As I tiptoed my black heeled mini-boots on the pavement, I felt like I was a mammoth approaching. Yet, wed just crossed another bridge on our quest... it was taking us somewhere else, which made me thrilled and excited. 

Time was not one of our concerns on acid, so Dianna suggested us heading to Grand Central Station. I think she had some sort of asian or indian food craving, and told us that they had all kinds of restaurants inside. Off we went, just to check it out, first and foremost. My friends and I like to keep our options open when we go out: we rarely make plans or agree on timing, but in that moment, it seemed like we had all the time in the world, to see all it could have offered us. 

We entered the subway with dwindling conviction. I marched onwards, assertively leading the way, while Dianna followed in a haze of longer steps, but Summer seemed to hesitate behind us. As soon as we arrived underground, she stopped to look at us in the eye, I dont have my phone, she remarked. Dianna smiled, adding Neither do I! 

Summer turned to me, Len?, she called. I had considered taking my phone with me to blast some trip tunes as we walked along, but it felt unauthentic. So far, acid had warped the reality around me in a way that I had never experienced before, and I wanted to see what it could do with the natural sounds and rhythms of the city street-life. Reality needed to bend itself, in order for me to be legitimately surprised by it, and if I was listening to music, I would have altered the process drastically. So, in answer to Summer, Nah, no phone on me. 

One of us should have a phone. I think Ill just go get mine from upstairs. Its also a good idea to let Louise, Frey, or Mark know that were going out she said. Her argument seemed reasonable, but I was able to tackle it, for the sake of our destination, Frey and Louise are probably asleep, and Mark totally crashed on that bed, though. Do you think we really need to wake them up? Were just going to go to Grand Central, grab a bite, and come back. I made it sound so easy, and it was... for people not on psychedelic drugs. 

What followed was the most lingering moment of the Trip, the most annoying part of it all - climbing the stairs up, and down, up, and down. Dianna and Summer could not, for the life of themselves, make a sensible decision over whether to get the phones or not. I wasnt going to go, regardless: Id made my decision, and I needed to progress and move the night forward. What frustrated me about them two, in that moment in particular, was the fact that they were messing with the flow of time and events. They kept going back, and forward, wasting precious minutes, and unable to decide upon a direction. Thankfully, under my council, we decided to all ditch phones and embark on our little technicolor adventure. 

If I had to choose one single adjective to describe sitting in that subway, Id pick climactic. This is interesting, since taking public transport is one of the most bland things we do, on an everyday basis, or so I thought. I mean, if I were to take the subway today, Im preTy sure Id still feel preTy bored with the experience, but there is something undoubtedly fascinating with sharing space amongst strangers - united by the need for a destination. The subway appeared to me as a metaphor for my trip. It was a very paradoxical and meta-moment. 

I looked around, wondering how frightened or foolish I looked, as I couldnt help but feel extreme amazement: American trains were so different from the ones in my hometown. The digital destination maps, the clear lights, the improvised ads... it all made me curiously compelled... because, yet again, none of it made any sense, or mattered. The subway was a powerful metaphor, of course, but I still couldnt process it in terms of its separate components. I remember, particularly, how startled I was by the mechanics of transportation. It seemed like such complicated subject matter that I felt a deep respect towards whomever was in charge of taking care of it. 

On a more personal level, I suddenly started to stare at the two middle-aged men sitting in front of me: one of them looked Hispanic and pensive, while the other was a sleepy Asian. Such different people, probably with different lives, and different destinations. Yet for a few moments, they sat next to each other - closer than they must have goTen to the ones they actually longed for. We were all heading somewhere - to progress, to paTerns, to dreams. Their destination was just the same as mine, fulfillment. 

I honestly cannot find the missing link between this consideration, and what then evolved to become my seventh realization on acid. I immediately knew, the more I looked at those men, that I wanted no more secrets in my life, no more games, no more lies. I just wanted to be clean, out in the open with all of my feelings and emotions (something Ive always kind of struggled with). Secrets seemed like such an immature and trivial convention, with their scope being solely to prevent bonding, and deeper connections, with others. The only way to form these relationships was by being raw, and true to myself. To all of me. And that made me smile a lot. 

I thought about the mess that took place back home, before I leK, and once again, I felt surprisingly good about it. Originally, I was apprehensive and almost threatened by the possibility of that incident enticing bad thoughts, but it really didnt. I felt clean about it, because I had come clean for what I did. I had confessed and stated the truth, and I was so happy that it had actually taken place, because it gave me a chance to realize who my real friends, through it all, actually had been. I felt lighter, more genuine, more real. 

Once our stop was up, we exited right at Grand Central. No surprise to me, the station was closed. Oh crap!, Dianna exclaimed, I forgot its 3:30, and it closes at 3! she added, looking alarmed. But just as we were about to lose our peppy, wheat-blonde torch to light up our nights attitude, her sunshiny smile came right back up on her face, Lets go to Times Square! 

Without a word, Summer and I both knew that was exactly where we had to go. The premise of being in the most famous visually appealing place in the world, on the most famous visually appealing substance in the world, was alluring the three of us in the same exact way. And, at that point, we also had a similar level of lucidity within us, which made it very easy to find the right way towards midtown, just some twenty blocks away. 

I cant even begin to explain the satisfaction of reaching such a fun, bright-looking, spectacular part of New York... mostly because I was unable to process it myself. I was back in sponge-mode, taking in and absorbing all the feelings I could take in and absorb. Visually, it was a really heavy part of the trip - not because of any hallucination, but because the colors were so rich and vibrant that they made the city look alive. Another bit and trace of human soul, of human visibility, and humanity itself. Every single color told me a story, and transmitted a feeling. (I wish I could make more clear associations between colors and moods, but I never wrote any of it down, so Im afraid I have forgoTen exactly what vibes I got). 

A highlight of our ocular tour downtown was the enormous and flashing Desigual store. Some animations were being displayed on giant LCD screen panels; nothing fancy, just color blocks flashing and alternating - an epileptics nightmare. The shades were all neon, and all kinds of them appeared, but one particular succession that stayed with me was red-yellow-green, which filled me up with hope and happiness. I guess I do remember one of the associations I made, green = hope. Forever and always. 

When we got close enough to see the actual clothes, I was stupefied. On a central, headless, white plastic mannequin was placed a 60s-cropped dress, embellished by an optical illusion checkered black-and-white print all over it, which seemed to shake at every movement of my pupils. That dress was the staple definition of my old Literature teachers style, and I was sent back in my memories, as a cold tidal wave of old experiences washed over me.

Let me explain, for a second. This teacher, whom well call Ms. Potter, to make life a little bit more interesting and magical, was never particularly fond of me. I have never been famous for my native-language literature abilities, but the exam grade I received, at the end of my two years of IB Program, had definitely proved her wrong and exceeded my every expectation. But it wasnt in hatred that I thought of her, no. It was because, one particular afternoon of early 2012, when I was an overweight, fifteen-year-old brunette, as she was explaining the way humans relate to one another, she had advised us, If you want to learn how, and what, things you say can affect the meaning of whats being understood by those around you, you should study Communications, like I have. The topic had never particularly intrigued me, but Potter had a very considerable amount of knowledge on a vast array of interesting subjects. Unknowingly, I realized I had followed her footsteps, and I was studying Communications. Me, the now-skinny, eighteen-year-old blonde had demonstrated her that she had misjudged me, and that I did have a lot to offer. I felt complete - almost to the point where I wanted to send her an email when we went back to Diannas. Eventually I smartly decided against it, since my last aTempts at prose were pretty horrifying. 

Dianna, Summer, and I eventually found a deli that was open, and seemingly low-key. I picked up a box of hummus and pita chips, Dianna a croissant and a burrito, and Summer didnt get anything, since she claimed to have been eating cookies all night long. I knew that wasnt true, but I respected her decisions and well-being, so I let her be in harmony with herself. Really, the food and eating it turned out to be the most uneventful part of our commute back through the subway. I noticed that Dianna was studying the jelly texture of her brioche incredibly amusing way: she would squeeze it up in a nut-like shape, and then turn around to me while giggle-whispering, Doesnt it remind you of a vagina? (which yes, it totally did, by the way). 

Once we were back in the Union Square subway, Dianna paced up her walking and straightened her face with a pensive thought, Sometimes I feel like Im not doing anything here... she wondered out loud. This one hit me, like a slingshot in the back of my brain, and I had a brand-new weapon to argue against her: my eighth realization. 

That is absolutely not true. Youre doing so much, all the time. Even now, youre walking, youre breathing, youre talking, and thinking! Thats a lot, and its all simultaneously. Its amazing how much we can do, without realizing. Were constantly doing something, moving, accomplishing, progressing. We cant help but do. I definitely wasnt that eloquent when I commented, but in a nutshell that was my thinking. This is true, sometimes I still take for granted the amount of things I do - reminding myself that every action, every process, every succession is important, fundamental for my sanity and well-being. 

Despite the fact that mine was a response to Diannas complaint, the person who was most impacted by what I said was Summer. She seemed visibly shocked - her eyes widened, she shook her head, looked over and proceeded to thank me for saying that. I, like a good old snarky asshole, simply smirked and encouraged not to thank me for saying the truth. I liked my newfound wisdom, it built in me solid confidence and strength. 

On our way out of the station, we saw an elderly woman, who wore an all-black outfit consisting of leather pants, a cowboy hat, and cowboy boots. Her straight red hair was up in a tight ponytail. She noticed the giddy looks in our faces, and immediately smiled back, telling us, You three look beautiful together! For how long have you been friends? 

I dont know why I felt entitled to answer that question the way I did, I let my soul speak, Forever. I knew that that experience had made Summer and Dianna think the same, so, in their discrete laughter, I sensed newfound comfort in our friendship. I loved how at ease and in- sync we finally were. 

She smiled, small, golden teeth emerging from thin, purple lips, How long has that been? Seventeen, eighteen years? Nineteen or twenty? she asked. Dianna smiled and confirmed, Yes, more or less our whole lives! 

Well, you do look pretty young! How old are you? she asked again, but before Dianna could say a single word, the woman went on, No, wait! Ill guess it. Wait! I found that woman hilarious; we hadnt even moved ever since shed stopped us! She began to close her eyes, rubbing her palms together, and followed by asking Dianna a series of questions regarding her mountainy preferences, to then suggest a series of unlucky guesses, Is it Novembah? Octobah? Its gotta be late-Octobah-early-Novembah! her New York accent came through with its full force on the last desperate guesses, No, not really, Im sorry! Dianna added. Like it was her fault. 

She, then, moved on to me. One penetrating look, with her almond-shaped, glassy brown eyes, was enough to declare, Oh you girl. You girl, LOVE a camera. And the camera loves you. I wonder why she didnt even aTempt to guess my birthday, which is what she immediately moved on to try with Summer. I didnt catch what she asked, because, as Summer was supposedly beginning to answer back, we felt the cold, aseptically artificial breeze of a new train racing by. Oh thats my train. I will see you, girls. Stay friends! Please stay friends!, the woman said goodbye to us and ran downstairs, her small legs shaking furiously along with her frantic exposed tongue. 

We leK it unspoken, but all of us felt that was another sign, one that indicated how helplessly wed been bounded through this experience. Who that woman was didnt matter; the fact that she was terrible at guessing birthdays didnt matter; what mattered was the fact that we heard it from another voice: Stay friends! Please stay friends! And we were going to. And we are going to. Besides that, that interaction was just funny - it was just so obviously spiritual that it made me automatically take acid less seriously, as I nonchalantly commented, Damn. That lady was tripping harder than us, guys! Dianna smiled and asserted, Oh next time, well have some of what shes been playing with. 

By this point, both Dianna and Summer were coming down. Dianna still seemed preTy out of sync with reality, and I could see the cloud of acid-weirdness still dissipating over her mind. Her movements were still a little racy, and she was restless, but didnt seem to be too involved with herself anymore. Summer was a little more complicated to figure out, because her accounts of the story differ. In an upcoming part, I will provide evidence to support the fact that she was still pretty high, but throughout the whole trip, and while reviewing her experience in its entirety, she generally claims to have not experienced much, visually at least. Im not sure how true this is, but this report focuses on my story, my feelings, and my observations - so I will note my inferences. 

On another note, two half-blotters werent guaranteed to be particularly powerful, no matter how expensive and pure the acid we got, presumably, was. We were looking at about five hours of tripping and two of comedown on first-time users, like Summer and Dianna. I had had a full one, on the other hand, so I was nowhere near being done. Oh no. I was about to explode. 

VI.

When we came back, everyone in the suite was asleep. Summer and I sat by the living room, while Dianna was determined to wake up Mark, and test sex on acid. I was beyond thrilled to finally get to my snack - and am happy to report that eating with Lucy makes it even more fun! Even a pre-packaged and uber-processed hummus treat was heavenly, mostly because of the creamy texture. I was fascinated by how the crispy, hard chips mercilessly drowned in the dense sauce, and I moved it around multiple times, just to watch it dissipate. Eventually, I ran out of chips, and proceeded to dip and feel the sonftess of the chickpea-flavored condiment hands on - oh yeah, I used my very own index finger to ravish anything leK in that plastic box. Food was meant to be eaten and enjoyed, and I oughted to appreciate every last bit of it. 

Deciding we werent sleepy just yet, Summer and I turned the lights of the common area back on, and pulled out my laptop, to relax on the web a little bit. I was still convinced we were all coming down, so I visited a website off of my saved Reddit thread of cool links to check out while on LSD. The first one brought us to a remarkably trippy interactive visualizer, made up of retro-pixelated blobs of vanishing colors. As I moved the cursor, the particles of turquoise, bright yellow, and green hues would break apart in tiny red and pink ones, something which totally astounded me. I felt like my brain was melting as I stared at the screen, completely lost in those visuals. I guess that the thought that made me realize I was still feeling the acid was the simple fact that I was being entertained by that one single animation for too long, and a bit too intensely (Im usually one of those tab-whoring, three-hundred-miles-per-second, avid multitaskers, and have a hard time focusing on only one webpage, when Im at the computer). 

I tried a few songs to accompany the visualizer, but nothing was weird enough. I wanted something fucked up - something so completely uncanny and off-sounding that I could have rejoiced at its peculiarity. Summer gave me a few suggestions, but everything sounded too conventional. No, I need avant-garde shit! I said. And as soon as I did, I knew a record that was uncomfortably smooth enough: Tim Buckleys Lorca. I remembered it because of a particular comment on its Rate Your Music page, along the lines of Ive heard stranger things before, but this is the one Tim Buckley people will frown at you for playing at a party, and I really wanted a party of heavy frowns, right then and there. 

We stayed like that for some time - again, I cant tell you how long precisely, but it was quite consuming. The blobs on the visualizer began to look like lilttle faces even more than usual - I have extreme pareidolia on any kind of substance: I see faces in everything and everywhere, except for peoples features, where, ironically enough, they should actually belong. All the colors were turning into separated units of light and expressions. It was a kind of ordinarily divine, but I still assumed it was the end. It was very similar to feeling really stoned... nothing too out of normal highs. 

When the album ended, I found myself at a loss of what to do. The visualizer had been entertaining, but Id had enough. In the mean time, Summer had been writing haikus and lyrics, which made a lot of poetic sense, and I felt very jealous of her ability to create things that were so beautiful. I shook it off immediately, and invited her to sponge-out with me, Have you ever heard of ODDSAC? I asked. 

Nope, she answered, facing the screen. I smirked, Oh youre in for a treat. Its this movie made by the members of Animal Collective, a few years ago... its like a visual album. They even screen it here in the city, sometimes. As an avid AnCo fan, I knew about the short film, but Id never considered watching it while high. I knew it was weird enough to do the trick though, so we tried it. 

Its not my place to describe, or figure out, what exactly is going on in ODDSAC. Its a glorious mesh of visual, and hypothetical, scenarios that I recommend you check out for yourselves - so I will not spoil the surprise. I think we were about ten or fiKeen minutes in, when a very giggly Dianna and a tired-looking Mark emerged out of the room. For the movie, wed turned the lights back off, and their tall shadows announced to us they were going to be taking yet another shower. Summer decided to take a nap, as she felt very sleepy, and I was ready to follow her. 

We lied down in the dark of Diannas room, in her roommates bed. Summer was quick to settle into sleep, but, as soon as the lights were back off, I was in another universe. The springboard darkness gives anyone tripping is formidable, to say the least. When youre voided, your brain just works to fill it all back in with visuals. My dose was preTy weak, so thats why I think I was able to maintain my cool for so long, when out in the open. There was no chance I was immersed in complete darkness at any point before that part of the trip, and as I had already noted, closed-eye visuals were much clearer than open-eyed ones in the light. 

It all started with little sparkles of rainbow light, flying around in front of me. I didnt realize they were hallucinative in nature, at first. I just thought that it was late, I had been up and running for a long time... this must be some sort of trick my eyesight played on me, after brain had been processing information for a long time, which does happen sometimes. The truth, preTy literally, slapped me in the face approximately ten seconds, when the sparkles began to move... tiny little freckles of multicolored, intangible rain. 

And the more I looked, the more concrete they became. From sparkles, they became hairs, then wires, and then threads. I saw the colors flowing within them, pouring pigment sliding from end on end - it was all extremely hypnotic, I mean, I felt like I probably had this staggered look on my face, as I saw everything flying, and turning, and twisting. It was mesmerizing. 

They kept getting thicker, and thicker, until they turned into little pencils. They broke apart, and turned into classic B orange pencil-shaped rockets, which launched across the room in constant takeoff. As soon as they were in flight, theyd disappear, and new ones would form and fly. It was a spectacle, and it made me understand that I had taken acid, and that I was tripping, pretty badly, too. 

My stimulation prompted me to experiment with closing my eyes again, and my lord, am I glad I did it - it was insane. At first, I got the same hazy, dark fractals from before, but they seemed much more detailed. Still hazy, but detailed. They didnt stick around for too long, as the mandala I saw broke apart, and turned into a tunnel I was catapulted into. Thats when I got why they call this tripping. I thought I was in the front row of a roller coaster, which would take me to different sights, and stop at certain locations for a few seconds more. 

One of such stops was a discotheque. Not a club, not a bar, not a venue, but a disco-disco. There were bright magenta lights, and I saw a gorgeous african-american woman dancing. She had long, smooth legs and a sick, huge afro. She definitely didnt match my initial expectation of what I imagined Lucy must have looked like, but is now the most concrete envisioning I have of her - she was the acid! 

The roller coaster took me closer to her face, and as she waved her body from leK to right, I saw her big, velvety lips becoming larger, and larger. Then I radically turned leK and saw even more lips. There were lips of all kinds appearing before me: illustrations, animations, the Rocky Horror lips, my friends lips, the Flaming Lips... just so many mouths smiling and frowning, smirking and crying, through their teeth. Surrealistically majestic splotches of red and pink light bathed the scene with spice and gusto. It was great. 

Then, it all got really dark again. The roller coaster took me to a lot of spooky sights. I saw multiple devils, and interpretations of what the word demonic meant. I saw pure evil, and all that it embodied, but I wasnt affected. All of the skulls and skeletons (which, let me tell you, Ive been terrified of in the past), and smiling crows, and dolls turning their heads... they just didnt affect or scare me, at all. They were just inevitable. It was like, oh yeah, theres bad stuff in life, but it is part of life itself, so I couldnt avoid it. Nor did I want to. I wanted to face my evils, like I knew I was supposed to everyday, in reality. 

At one point, Summer leK to go talk to Dianna and Mark, who were out of the shower, and chatting in the common area. I was too immersed in my trip to care to hang out with others, so I just stayed in the room. I went back to the rocket-pencils and threads of light, which were now all happening at the same time, and it was glorious. They were joining together and spinning in circles, creating rainbow ferris wheels that circled at 3000 miles per second. 

Unfortunately, I, yet again, wasnt really paying attention to fact that an outer world existed, so when Dianna stepped in, announcing Summer was going to return to Blue C, I wasnt too thrilled. Summer encouraged me to stay and take a nap, but Dianna reiterated how worried she was about the possibility of her walking back by herself. We were just three blocks and half a street away, but I sensed that I was being kicked out. 

Yeah, Id definitely feel better if you went along with her Dianna said. Sure, no problem I responded, wide-eyed. 

I went back to the common area and picked up my boots again. Putting them on wasnt exactly challenging, but I definitely made no sense. I was overwhelmed by the reality of objects once more, and everything amazed me, in a way it never had. This state was probably reflected on my face, as Dianna brushed by my shoulders and asked, Len, are you okay? 

Wa-wa yeah! I responded, feeling like a little kid. I am a child, Im a lover being born, my mind sang lyrics, and my mouth clipped sounds. I was feeling fried, Girls, I dont think Im done 
tripping just ye-et! I announced excitedly. Dianna and Summer looked down at me with worried looks, and, as Summer helped me up, she spoke the words I could have never, No, youre definitely not. 

VII.

Summer seemed tired as we made our way downstairs again. My little computer of a mind was trying, more or less helplessly, to process the elevator, the exit, the cooler air outside... but still, nothing made any sense. As soon as we were in Union Square again, I asked Summer how she was feeling: Are you still tripping? 
She gave me a smirk, Nah, I was done for hours ago! 
The fact that she was in a post-trip mindset, and knew I was still way up, made my shield of vulnerability weaker, and I put down my guard to tell her exactly how I felt. I was scared I wasnt going to remember it, and would never be able to share it with her again in the future. That moment was all that mattered, and I needed to get emotional immediately, before I would have been European and proud all over again. 

Summer, I... I... I... I just love you so much. Youre just so important to me; youre like my soulmate, and after this, but, but even before, really, nothing is going to keep us away from each others lives! I addmitted, excited. 

Her eyes lit up, with an acid-enhanced glimmer, Oh stop! she requested, flattered, Im so thankful and happy that youre here, and that we did this together... you know what it is? Ive been trying to find it for a while, and now I know. You bring color, thats what you do in my life, you bring colors, Im aware this sounds like acid talk, but trust me, for Summer that is the most natural and effortless thing to say. 

She continued, Especially with your hair all curled up like that, you remind me of Penny Lane from Almost Famous! she remarked again. I was just as happy and hugged her tiny self. Wrapping my arms around her, I felt my bulky headphones weighing down my handbag: music. I needed music again! 

After a five-minute long, heartfelt embrace, I excused myself, and plugged in the headphones to my phone - which is my main source of music streaming. I was still way up there, so I conceded myself an artificial, soundtracked, short walk back to Blue C. I decided to play some traditionally acid-y modern music, so that it wouldnt have felt en[rely out of place and touch with my times. 

In terms of processing reality, this was the most intense part of my trip. As soon as Why Wont You Make Up Your Mind by Tame Impala, began playing, nothing made sense. Nothing made sense on a whole different level, a level so overwhelming and so intense that I just had to accept it, and succumb to my mental impairment. Trying to find an explanation on the most everyday - or, in this case, everynight - elements that I encountered down the street just was too much. 

I immediately recalled seeing one of Wests friends, about two weeks earlier, on magic mushrooms. He kept mentioning how reality seemed like too much, but I wasnt able to understand what he meant by that. Now, I definitely did. The paradoxes and problems with everything seemed all-too clear, and shapes and sizes uniting together made everything even more complicated. 

The intensity of those sensations was so heightened that I had to vocally express it, like when I was back in Diannas room, slamming my fist on her roommates bed. I released my energy by spinning around, twirling down the street, delightfully exhausted. As I saw cars passing, I felt even safer seeing the world continue running, and never stopping. This was my world, and I belonged, and knowing that was all I needed to entice an overwhelming wave of happiness, that, coupled with the phazed-guitar of the song, turned off my mental intelligence completely. I began expressing that sense of comfort with very loud, strange noises. They sounded like moans of pain, the ones we make when were stressed out and need to release stress. I mean, I definitely felt all-too relaxed, if anything, but my brain was so puzzled by what was around me that I couldnt help it. I couldnt hold it in, MMMMM... AAAAAAAAAH....MMMMM!!!

As we reached the market in front of Blue C, and I noticed some workers moving around, carrying grocery stocks in large, metal carts, I smiled at them, and at the blaring lights of the store preparing to open. A new day was dawning, and it was beautiful for me to witness it. Looking back, I guess Id recommend acid for people with depression, or whoever feels tired and useless with the world they live in. It is such a revelatory experience for all that we take for granted. Even a store opening up just didnt make sense, as a whole: it was all made of small parts - the connection between every single task was what made us able to perform activities. I was never an existentialist, but in that moment, I understood entirely what the philosophy entailed, and it was the truth. 

Acid has changed me in that sense: I cant be the nihilistic, life-is-just-a-giant-absurdist-salad thinker I used to be. Sure, I still love Camus and Nietzsche, but I regained so much more belief in human relationships and connections. Especially in terms of how much we all need each other to carry out our lives, and this assigns meaning to our actions and activities - our motivation to deepen the affinities between us, and others. 

When we walked inside Blue C, Summer made sure I had my University ID prepared at the entrance to enter in the building. Yet, yet again, I wasnt impaired. Tapping the card and pressing the digits that represented my birthdate wasnt difficult, it was natural, it was all that I needed. I remembered my birth, and where I was now, and the recurring thought of how far Id come from my Nowhereland made my knees weak with joy. 

Quite literally, seeing as, as soon as we entered, Summer felt the need to sit at the columns that supported the three massive towers of Blue C. It was our courtyard area, and despite the air getting gradually cooler, as fall grew harsher, I wasnt bothered by being outside. No, I was glad I was. Summer was sitting in front of me, her knees in her hands, her head resting on the wall. She looked at the cloudy moon we were having that night, and I thought about how her round, pale face was a moon of its own. It was all I could focus on, and as soon as I set my eye-spotlight on it, all the posters and signs that were up started to melt again. My brain rejected anything 
that I wasnt intently making the object of my attention, I observed. My reality was too intense and complicated, and I couldnt even focus on it anymore. 

Because of my state, Summer offered me to go to up to her suite. I accepted eagerly, seeing as the loK, which I clearly didnt belong it, was most definitely not where I had to be. When we stepped in, Summers suite mate, Amaya, was still awake, video chatting with some of her Indian friends. She was originally from Mumbai and oKen missed on sleep to keep in touch. We asked her what time it was, and she replied, Its six thirty AM now, I might go to sleep soon!. 

For some reason, seeing a new person and a new environment revamped my acid-minded state, to the point that all I could see of Amaya was her radiant beauty. She emanated a sense of well- being and my eyes widened as I stared at how regal she seemed: her tan skin, large brown eyes, and rich black hair made her look like an Indian goddess. I remembered how once, when I was telling her about Seth, she told me that I was actually perfect, and that I needed to find someone who would appreciate it. In that moment, she was the one who was perfect and beautiful, and I felt like I had to tell her. So I did. 

Amaya, youre so beautiful! I said, in an unusually high-pitched singsong voice. Just like everyone else, on acid, she had a color, Your color is like an amber orange gold. Youre so beautiful! I repeated, startled at my sight. As I spoke, I paced back and forth all around the suite. A place that I was so used to seeing seemed so different, and I thought that if I explored it all through I would have regained the familiarity. Amaya, initially amused, looked, to an extent, concerned and said, Oh my gosh, youre drunk, arent you? 

She helped me into her room, Sit, sit, youre drunk. Sit! I wasnt surprised she misunderstood what substance I was on, mostly because Amaya doesnt really give into the outer-wordly, psychonautic ventures we partake in. She quickly introduced me to her friends on the other end of the globe through her large computer screen, and I waved excitedly, Guys this is Len, she's drunk... shes a little off, but shes fun! 

Nah, May, I just dropped a tab of acid I remarked nonchalantly. I had never been in Amayas room, so a new place helped me settle down. Immediately as I said, I heard a loud collection of delayed gasps coming from her computer, WHAAAAT! her friends exclaimed in unison with her. Why did you do that?! she asked. I smiled calmly and said, I dont know, it seemed like a fun time. Its great, really I awkwardly responded, looking around all over her small dorm. 

Summer briefly walked in to inform me that she was going to sleep, as she had to take a train to Long Island to see her friend Lola, later in the morning. I decided to follow her, but as soon as I asked her whether I could crash there, since her roommate was absent, I had the horrible sensation she wanted me out of there immediately. I kept insisting I had to leave, and that irritated her to no end. She finally exploded on me and accused me of acting like a bitch! 

It was just a split second of rage, but it was a kind of rage I had never seen on her soK features. Immediately after the release of her emotions, she apologized, affirming she had been consumed by what had overtaken her. I didnt care much of it, since the room was dark and I was distracted by the visual patterns that were forming on her pale face. Her bed, which was positioned way up, was hard for me to reach, so she helped me up, and we sat watching her roommates polka-dot comforter change into a variety of shapes.

They melted and moved downwards, falling into the endless ground, and breaking apart to regenerate again. They were black, and the rest of the baby pink blanket formed a series of tubes that would connect rainbow pipes from dot to dot, sparkling as they moved. The beauty of that vision had me entranced. 

Im so glad we listened to West and decided to take the acid instead of the shrooms, I said. That prompted Summer to ask me a vaguely unrelated question, Would you ever do West again?

I thought about it, but it was hard to come to any sort of long-term conclusion on casual relationships on acid. Deep within me, I knew my relationship (and I dont mean romantic) with West was more or less meaningless; it was something I had thought about while I was sober. Yet, on acid, I had no opinions, no desires, no sense of what made sense and what did not, so, I ended up repeating I dont know at least fiKeen times. Yet again, I was a neutral sponge.

That was when my ninth realization washed upon me: everything fluctuates, especially moods and feelings. Nothing had remained the same, and nothing ever would. Life was about bonds being formed and destroyed; people bridging out into our lives and then leaving, often without a physical trace. No single thing ever really stays, it all becomes something anew. From the bed, I looked to my hands, and my chipping nail polish, and I saw beauty in it too. The beauty of breakdown and decay, the beauty of the real end of everything. Not because it revealed my naked nails and prompted a new canvas, rather the decadence itself had a particular fascination about it. I was intrigued by life running its course, tangibly and emotionally. 

I was overtaken by emotion and found myself retreating within, so I leK Summer alone to get her sleep and walked over to the mirror. The last time Id seen myself was before wed leK for Times Square, so I wanted to check on how my lipstick and wild hair had been doing. It seemed amusing to me how people dont recommend looking at their own reflections in the mirror on acid, yet I would have been way unhappier with my appearance if Id been sober: my hair had fluffed up significantly, and all that was leK of my dark brown stain was a dry-looking line along the outer edges of my lips. I looked so different than I used to on a daily basis. 

My pupils were almost occupying the entire rim of my iris, and one could barely tell what my eye color was. The more I looked through that thin stroke of hazel-brown, the more I penetrated my soul and saw within me. The trip I took inside myself helped me better articulate my fourth realization, turning into my tenth. My essence, now displaced and unfamiliar, seemed absent from my reflection. I could be without my body, because all I needed was clothes and accessories to define my iconography, as opposed to my soul.

It was an ebbing sight and feeling, to know that my commodities seemed more representative of my persona, rather than my character. I knew what the purpose of my trip had been, right then and there, I needed for my soul to be sole definitive factor of me. I needed to feed my spirituality in order for that to become the only nourishment that mattered. 

I kept breaking through the surface of that mirror: fucked up hair, barely any makeup, no underwear... and I saw the truth beyond me; everything I ever meant and represented, and it had never been any clearer. I was just there, as myself, as the one, true me. And I could only see it through, and because of, acid. 

After that, I was ready to let my mind hallucinate me to sleep. The paTerns that I saw would have been my lullabies, I thought. I went inside Amayas room, in order not to disturb exhausted Summer. She was preparing to sleep too, and, seeing as her roommate Maria wasnt there, invited me to crash on her bed. I readily accepted, and watched as she turned off the light. I looked around myself, saying goodbye to my acid-sight, and ready to feel it all falling back into everyday place. 

Obviously, its not like I had tremendous amounts of control over what I perceived, and Amaya did have a night-light, or some derivative that reflected light, and the room wasnt pitch black. I was able to see her Suits large poster hanging off the wall: it showed two shadows of tall men wearing suits, both black, blurred out silhouettes, against a purely white background. I saw them melting and morphing in front of me. I felt like I was watching an optical illusion, as they blended and harmonized with such a contrasting, solid, backdrop. 

I kept my eyes open for a few more moments, and as I listened to Close Chorus by A Sunny Day in Glasgow, I saw the threads of light return, and become little nals, that flew around all of us and made me feel peacefully, dizzy. They began to quietly explode, becoming fainter and fainter, until I had to squint to properly see. They were the sleep-inducing fireworks of the night, a perfect way for me to finally close my eyes. At that point, I saw magenta-pink and black fractals, nothing too generic, and always dark... until I lost myself into sleep, consumed by the fantastic trip Id had. 

VIII.

I estimate that I fell asleep about an hour after I arrived at Summers, at 7 AM. Considering we dropped our doses at 8 PM, I was really satisfied with my eleven-hour-long acid ride. Especially if we factor in that it was just one tab, it still gave me a rich, but not-too-intense experience, a great introduction into the world of psychedelics. 

At about 9:30 AM, Maria came back. I dont really know much about her, but she seemed nice as she requested me to sleep on the couch, which I was more than happy to do. I had a horrible headache, so I was excited to continue my resting phase. When I got up, I could tell Id definitely come down, and there were no more visuals or intense feelings, but the world still didnt make much sense. There was something just off about the world, at that moment. 

I actually woke up at 1:30, with a deep desire for a rich brunch. Not really because I was hungry, but the idea of scrambled eggs seemed familiar enough to stimulate a link back from the off- world. I said goodbye to Summer, who lamented being extremely tired and still having to visit her friend in Long Island, and joined Amaya downstairs to get a meal in me. I am not going to lie: I was [red. I was exhausted. I could barely process what the next day was going to involve. 

I was definitely down by that point, but I still struggled in processing everyday furniture. I dont know why objects were so tough on me, but they just looked complex. As we prepared to head to the cafeteria, we passed by the courtyard which had circular tables and benches all connected to each other, and those still seemed weird to me: why; what does this mean? What does it represent? It doesnt make sense, I concluded. 

Eating was peaceful enough, and as Amaya met up with some other Indian friends, I leK to go back to my loK and do a reading. Concentrating without falling asleep was hard, and at one point I saw the words wave and dance around a bit, but it was all tiredness and brain chemistry feedback from LSD. I decided to pick myself up and have dinner with Remy, as we were supposed to exchange psychedelic stories. It was raining faintly across the sky, and it was that rain that represented my spiritual growth. 

As Ive mentioned, Im very sensitive about my hair. Not only was I rocking my wavy locks, but I noticed the raindrops were soaking me - and I didnt care. Their delicate texture reminded me of the threads of light, and as my phone screen got wet too, I saw the drops becoming rainbow- colored on the screen, a totally regular, everyday thing. Yet, to me, it became something more. A flashback to my unforgettable experience: it made me want to cry; it reminded me of happiness, and belonging within the universe as a part of the human population. 

Now, whenever I think about being on acid, my heart thumps and drops a little bit, as I struggle to remember what feeling all of that love was like. I want to learn how to love more, and hate less; how to incorporate this richer knowledge and peace into my life. Now, whenever I think about being on acid, my heart thumps and drops a little bit, as I struggle to remember what feeling all of that love was like. I want to learn how to love more, and hate less; how to incorporate this richer knowledge and peace into my life. It was a life-changing first, and definitely not last, experience with LSD.

LSD Parklife

This experience happened to me about a year ago, March of 2017. I was young and stupid, and I had been experimenting with lots of different drugs at the time. This was the third time I had ever consumed LSD, and very stupidly so I did it in a park in broad daylight. 

I had managed to pick up about two 100ug tabs off of a very nice dealer that I used to know (he's dropped out of the business unfortunately), and I intended to drop them in the middle of a park, ride it out and go home later that night. My reasoning for doing this at a park was because I couldn't really afford to drop it with my parents in the house (again). I still to this day have no idea why I couldn't have just waited for a better set and setting, and do it with a friend that I trust. I have ADHD, so my naturally impulsive behaviour may play a role in my quite frankly stupid decision making at the time. 

So I popped the two tabs under my tongue, did the usual 'if it's bitter it's a spitter' routine. No taste, seemed to check out fine. I managed to find a nice quiet spot in the middle of a park to relax, and just have a good time. I waited in anticipation for the acid to kick in (Roughly 40-45 minutes for me). It was a really sunny day, the birds were singing their songs and I generally just felt quite pleasant. 

Effects (The Interesting Part): 
So the first thing I noticed was that the clouds in the sky started to morph, and I managed to interpret some cartoonish faces. After the LSD had entered my system the effects were quite acute and sudden in terms of onset. I managed to sit up and observe my surroundings in the park. The ground seemed to move in waves like an ocean, with the grass changing into a multitude of different colours and patterns. It was like I was in an ocean of pure bliss. The sky and ground seemed to move as one, sort of like a conjoined entity. I saw a couple walking in the distance, and felt like I could connect to them both emotionally and experience the love that they have for each other. Now at this point, I realised what I had gotten myself into. This was getting pretty intense for me, due to the fact that my sense of reality had already started to distort. I managed to find a tree nearby, and sort of telepathically connected to it. Asking it for guidance without words (in a way). Now, this tree seemed to tell me that I needed to go home and sit this out in my bedroom (Which to be honest seemed to be quite a sensible idea, tripping balls in a public space like that could have gotten me in serious danger). Rather than make me panic, I managed to retain myself and wandered to the entrance of the park. At this point everything was warping around me and it's probably a miracle that I managed to make it home unscathed. The concrete below me was 'breathing', and I sort of felt interconnected with everything. I stumbled onto a bus and hitched a ride home. 

I instantly ran into my room as soon as I got home, stripped myself down naked and just completely lost control of my body. I collapsed into my bed, and proceeded to melt into my bedroom. I felt this sort of spiritual energy flowing through my room and me (almost a bit like the force in star wars), and essentially let go of my consciousness and let it fly away from my body on this 'wave', like an ocean current. I had some sort of higher being connect to me telepathically again, but this time it seemed to tell me the language of the universe. It made me see and understand how the world works, and that all of my worries and regrets were complete bullshit. It taught me that the world and all of the crap that comes with it is merely a social construct. When it comes down to primal instincts, none of it matters. It transported me through a galaxy of wordless philosophies. Things like this are only explainable when one actually takes the substance. 

Towards the end of my trip, my mother walked into my room to find me without anything on, tripping balls and seemingly unconscious. She called my father and a paramedic, fortunately I was coming out of my journey at this time. When I came to my senses, I had never felt more ashamed of myself, at how stupid I was. How could I disappoint my mother like that? Nevertheless, it wasn't a bad trip at all. It's just the disappointment I experienced afterwards.

After doing shrooms, and ecstasy numerous times I had been wanting something more intense, something that would change my whole aspect on life. I remembered my dads stories about lsd and when he was my age, and thought to myself I need to try it.

I asked around for months for this substant and know one had any idea where to get some. Until this one day one of my friends told me he had just took some the weekend before that was named Sunshine Acid.  My heart instantly started racing when I heard that. That day after school, we went to the dealers house and finally got a hold of it.

Me and another friend took our doses that coming weekend at about 6 o'clock at night, and headed downtown on our skateboards to the skatepark.

One and a half hours of skating had gone by and we had hardly felt anything, so we started thinking it was bunk.

Another half an hour had went by, and I could feel a weird , but good body high come on to me. I looked at my friend and told him we better start heading out....

We were walking by the park which had alot of trees, almost like a forest. The trees started reaching over us on the road and the grass on the ground started turning bright colors. This was still the begining

After another hour of skating town, not knowing where to go, we realized we were way to high to skate, so we decided to head to a friends. When we showed up there, there was loud music being played, Tool I recall. When I got inside the peak hit me. I was zoned out to the walls mealting down to the floor too faces coming out of the wall.

Zoned out to the walls for about a half an hour, I told someone to plug in a movie. They put in chronicals of narnia(crazy on lsd). I had never seen that movie before, and the only thing I remember from it was wolves coming out of no where, and they freaked the shit out of me. After an half an hour of that we decided to get a ride home.

It was now about 10pm, and we were still peaking, heading home in a car. They dropped us off a block from my house, and made us walk in the dark.  I remember walking up the street and seeing big cracks in the ground, and orange stuff coming out of the cracks, almost like lava. The trees around us were spiraling up high in the ski, and were white with little color on it. Everything had seemed so detailed. Finally we had arrived in my house.....

I instantly layed in my bed with the lights off and just zoned out. In my head I could see shapes and patterns changing color, and I kept hearing car horns, and other strange sounds. I had then thought I had lost my mind completly. I kept telling myself that I had lost my mind.

After being scared for about an hour my friend asked me if I wanted to play some video games. I usually didnt like video games until I decided to try it out on acid. This calmed me down way more. That and the weed. 

We played games until we seen light out side, and decided to go to bed before my mom woke up to go to work.  We sat in the room trying to go to sleep but it just wouldnt work. I'm always moving your body around. We ended up pulling and all nighter not getting any sleep.

First of all I've been in love with this substance the first time I tried it about a year ago its absolutely incredible...

This was my second time to trip on lsd... I took two hits with a girl I dont kno and with sum friends that were rolling(x)...we were at my friend M's house which is where every1 usually goes to trip...

So my trip kicked in and I was lovin it of course and my friend M had one of those electric light things when you touch it the electricity moves with ur finger and is all in different colors and some go with the music ur listening to...well me and this girl became absolutely mesmerized in the beauty of this thing and played with it for around an hour or more and watched the lights dance and follow our fingers and we also saw dancing men dancing around the world in it...

After a while of playing with the light I thought of something to do which was start a bonfire outside in M's backyard, M was like hell yea lets do it but I dont have any wood. So we ended up using this wooden dresser that no one used and me and him had to carry it down the stairs outside and got the other girl that was trippin with me (I'll just call her shelly), we got outside and we were still mesmerized with the beauty of everything and we left mark to set up the bonfire while me and her stood and stared at the grass for about an hour and a half...the grass was like a whole new spiraling world of mysterious beauty it was wonderful...

About maybe 4 hours into the trip me and shelly walked back inside to see the 2 ppl rolling sittin in the kitchen me and shelly walked in there for sum reason which I cant recall and I'm sure we forgot anyway but we looked at each other in the eye and started talkin to each other through our MINDS! It was telepathy and we were like holy shit can u hear me and she was like yea I'm hearin u and I was like this is insane!! And she was like omg this is craaazy but this was all said in our heads and the two ppl rolling were looking at us like wut the fuck?! (me and shelly were talkin back and forth with our minds but also using lots of hand gestures and just looking at each other)

Me and shelly continued to stare each other in the eye and read each others minds, our eyes and minds were completely connected it was so weird I dont know how to explain it and when our eyes were connected all we saw were each others warped faces, our faces would stay where they were and I watched her body float up and dance in the air with her head still as it should be...it kinda reminded me of one of those cat clocks, where the cats head stays still but its body ticks
I was sick of being inside I had such a yearning for the outdoors so everyone else stayed inside and I went outside and sat at a table by myself and watched a tree/bush across his yard for a while....the bush started swirling into infinityand it changed into a dragon swirling a few times it was wonderfully beautiful, but after about 1:30 or so I went back inside to socialize...

It was early in the morning and I was starting to come down now, but patterns and colors were still swirling and making their way in my field of vision.

All in all every trip I've had has been wonderful I dont think theres a better drug out there, LSD is magical and purely spiritual...I feel so at home and at place in the world and pretty much all knowing (or at least I do)... LSD is beautiful and should be treated with respect...theres nothing better or a more incredible feeling than being on it... Me and my friends have never had any bad trips by keeping open minds and stay happy, no worries, and wel have the most beautiful, amazing, enlightening experience ever!!!

I was at a party with my friends and we were waiting on E, which eventually never came around, so our buddy offered us acid for $10 a hit. I took my first hit around 9:45pm that night. At around 10:45 I barely felt anything, but had extreme euphoria.

By about 11:00pm, me and my friend 'Jack' decided to take a walk up to the goat farm up the road. We always went up there drunk looking to kill a goat. I took my second hit when we got up there. I got up to a goat and just started to pet it as I looked at 'Jack' and said 'Do I punch it?' We both decided it didn't seem right to do so. About that time we heard a loud crash that started echoing in my head and ran.

Back at the party around midnight we went on the roof and played with the shapes of the clouds. The visuals made it possible to separate them in the sky with my fingers. Back in the house I saw Jacks girlfriend walking around like a ghost. The tracers got really intense from then on.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

Around 2:00am, me, Jack, and Mark decided to go to our friend 'Mary's' house. We drove up the road as it swerved left and right. It was coming at me in all different directions. We got on the highway and all the lights were neon streaks. A Maryland State Trooper drove by us so we decided to go left into a parking lot to get away, even though he already drove by. It seemed like a good idea at the time. So for about 20 minutes Jack and Mark are trying to direct me out of the parking lot as were just going in circles. Eventually we exited after nearly going into oncoming traffic.

When we finally got to Marys neighborhood it was like driving in fairy tale land. All white houses with white picket fences. We pulled into a long driveway and kind of got lost there. We went back and forth. When I realized I was tripping out too hard to back up, we looked for a place in this driveway to turn around. Mind you its past 2:30am in some neighborhood we barely know. We thought there was a field to the right I could turn my truck into, but it looked like it dropped off into a cliff. When neither of them would get out to check, I put on the brake and went and petted the grass to make sure it was level. It was, so I proceeded to go through and turn around.

When we left the neighborhood we went to Dennys where all our friends were. Only 4 of us went in, and thats where I really started to trip. I sat at the marble table as it seemed to smear and fold all over itself. The hairs on my arm started waving like I was under water. When I decided Im tripping to hard, I just walked out freaking out hardcore but maintained to keep my cool. When I attempted to drive back to the house with Mark, I stalled the truck out twice. Driving an automatic would have been the more logical thing to do.

When we got back, I took another hit and the rest is history. My mind was pretty gone. I dont know how I was able to walk around at that point. I vaguely remember chewing on my shirt and beating a drum along with staring at myself in the mirror for over and hour because of how crazy my face was changing. My shadows made me look like Jesus and I smoked over 2packs of cigarettes in less than 6 hours. I tripped for a good 14hours.

I recommend tripping if youre NOT DRIVING. Granted it was the most fun thing Ive ever done in my life, it was probably also the dumbest. I really SHOULD have died with my friends. DO NOT DRIVE.

Before this I took LSD about 5 times, starting with a microdose, gradually up to 240 ug. 

My friend N. Pick me up and I took 3 tabs of Kali Yuga x 110 ug, claimed by vendor at 99% purity, made from the swiss bliss crystal.

T+20 min: I felt that it is going to be the deepest trip in my life. 
T+40 min: I was sitting in a car while girls were shopping. The gray fence in my right was dancing like a snake and was my last connection with reality.
T+1 hour: somewhere from a distance I observed our company arriving to a wonderful loft apartment in the middle of the city. N. asked me to take a bag from his car, but I stared into eternity in response.
T+1:30: I remember lying on the couch, as usual, and N. tried to set up music.
T+2 hours: immediately after that I saw him lying on the floor and screaming with a smile: HOW DID WE GET HERE? WHO AM I? as his wife was nearby and calming him down. Then he stood up and asked: How do you like this, guys?

*** there was me, N. And his wife, Also we were expecting D. and his wife S. was already with us. ***

Somewhere at that time I was completely sure that I was dead, I was observing N. having the best time in his life as S. asked me - is this okay? I told her that N. is god now. Then I told all them that I almost could not see them because I was seeing only fractals and eternity. There was no understanding of time, who I was, what was my name and if I was doing something in my life. I understood that there was no point in any fear, even of death, because even if I die, I will be reborn and I will meet exactly these souls in their mortal shells, and we will get whacked as usual. And this already happened countless times. This was the moment I realised that at 330ug we really need sitters, but there was no fear. Fear was pointless. 

I saw future and past, I was a god. I was beyond particles, I was energy. Then we all danced in joy, drawn with crayons and listened to our favourite music. Our bodies also needed to eat and to drink. Of course we also smoked weed and drank wine. We were dressed in comfortable clothes, we were shamans.

When D. Finally arrived, he was running to join us, shrefding his suit and jumping into sweatpants as I was crying from happiness that he finally arrived. Than N. waited until D. was hit by LSD and told him:

'D. Remember your worst childhood nightmares and face them' to which D. responded: 'There are none, I am god.' Then we ate pizza and ice cream. 

All this looped for eternity as we explored the apartment, revealing new rooms and activities. I was thinking that I wanted my girlfriend to be here with us, but she was not ready yet. I also realised that I love seeing people so happy and I was willing to break law and morals to see people happy. Their tears of joy shined upon my mortal body and cleansed my soul.

Next day 11 in the morning (now tripping almost 20 hours)
I have not slept all this time as sleep was meaningless. When my body felt tired, I just had to shift my attention to my hand that was drawing tantric symbols, as I was trying to compose my personality in silence. N. took his car home, as he then told - he was driving completely safe, his body was just going home automatically. 

About 16:00 next day I came home, threw my clothes on the floor, turned on video of guided meditation by Alan Watts and went into a meditation that lasted until 22:00. Then I ate some rice, checked my email and went to sleep, smiling at my future and being so intrigued of what will happen after I die. I knew that the best part is ahead.

TIME : 7.15pm 02/06/2018

DOSAGE : 2 blots ~350 mics

I have done acid 9 times before this. I have had my experience with cannabis, alcohol, MDMA one time, datura one time. I am a above average college student pursuing Computer science and I am very interested with Artificial intelligence, philosophy, chemistry and science in general. 

I made up my mindset before this trip by no one ever could have ever ready me for what I was to experience in the journey ahead. I took 2 blots with my friend who is 2 years younger than me. He took half a blot as it was his first time. My school friends A and F stopped by my home just after I took the blots. I told them to not to give any bad thoughts beforehand. 

At about 7.45 pm I felt the acid kicking in. That surge of LSD through my brain rendered me anxious and excited. I started smiling uncontrollably. 

At about 8.10 pm my friends  left my place and me and R were sitting down in front of my laptop listening to music. The visuals had already begun to take hold. I couldn't place my thoughts in an ordered way so I let myself roam. After about some time, R was taking about this new feeling he was getting that he never felt before. I wanted to guide him properly but I couldn't properly shape the words as per I wanted. We were looking at my abstract wall painting. It has wavy shaped strokes in a ocean blue color. We discussed what we saw in that pattern and turns out we saw the same things, many women were embracing themselves in a protective way. I was baffled by the pattern conditioning pattern and suggestive power of our heads when on self drive. After enjoying the visuals, we decided to go to his place as he had good quality speakers at his place. So we displaced from my place to his.

I had been having temporal alterations at this point. We reached his place and we put on some music. I let him decide the songs as I was still trying to get back control of my mind. After some time, one hour or two, I was starting to get back behind the wheel... the best time in the acid trip. It's when I am still tripping but I can control the trip what so ever. We ate something and talked. 

The one thing that hit me very hard was when he told me 'we are all one, and we are all connected'. I realized this thing by my second LSD trip but he got that in the first. I was really proud of him, and I think I guided his trip successfully while tripping myself, The Tripping Trip Sitter. Anyway we talked about life in general, pondered a little about life and death, what lies beyond this realm. We made up a theory about how people get crazy or deemed crazy. It's like there is an astral plane we can't see, but some people due to some inbuilt reasons or drugs, get into this bad negative or the shattered plane and their brains can't process this much 'disinformation', so they are permanently stuck in this plane and cannot get back to the reality plane. This makes them to be deemed crazy and they live through this living plane while their head is still stuck at that plane.  Another theory I thought about is there might be a higher intelligent being who formed us and made us experience this consciousness, and what makes us humans human, is something that also made us so that we cannot comprehend what lies in that plane that the being exists. And we humans are coded in such a way that there are this 'bugs' in our codes, and those 'bugs' are the things that makes us human, i.e, unique in different ways. But yet we are all the same and have the same form of energy.

In this search for closure and knowledge, I hope I can at least get near to that higher consciousness. I hope my thirst for knowledge doesn't drive me crazy because my journey has only begun. I hope my thirst for knowledge doesn't drive me crazy because my journey has only begun. There are so many things to experience yet, so many things. This ego of our keeps us drifting through this ordered chaos in the same aforementioned way. Stay hungry Stay happy.

Now, this is about 11pm. This was when things took an unexpected turn. My mom had come from work. I came back from work and I was more talkative than usual. Finally while we were having dinner my mom knew something was not usual. I was also sweating. I revealed that I had taken LSD, and parents being parents, that too my mom being a doctor having an orthodox view about these substances and drugs, lost her cool. She became chaotic and we had our infamous 'fight'. I tried my level best to make her explain that I know what I am doing and I didn't take drugs without doing the prior research. But it was in vain. I also cried thinking about death and how it is approaching my grandparents. But finally I calmed her down and she went to sleep. 

I couldn't sleep so I drifted through my thoughts and wandered. In the morning I got myself ready and went to our hospital's new unit's inauguration. I was in an impatient state and to go out in the real normal life while not being so normal, it's hard to keep level-headed. But somehow I made through it. It was ironic that I was on drugs, and I went to a hospital. But finally, somehow, after what seemed like ages I was back home, and I went off to sleep. When I got up I was still my extra conscious, but I was back to normal self, the old patterns and habits started taking hold. Yet in a certain way, every time I trip on LSD, I change parts of myself in a good way. But we have to be really careful with substances like this, as there is only a fine line between the vast unexplored planes of the consciousness. My next trip will be after a long time. Peace to everyone out there and keep spreading knowledge and information.

I am a 21 year old female with very little drug experience. I've smoked pot and hash for 5 years now, and just recently started introducing Shrooms and Acid. This experience is about the second time I had acid, the first time was really not so intense or worth documenting on here, and the second is still fresh in my memory.

The evening began with the intentions to do shrooms and go to an all night drive in with one of my best friends K. K had called her dealer and realized he could only get LSD, so I we decided to get it anyway and see where it took us. We bought 2 hits of Acid and went back to her house with some pot, the film Waking Life, and my paints and canvases. We couldn't make it to the movie so we were having a night in. I took half of my hit at 9:30 and listened to some music, waiting for our other friend to show up. He had a car and was not on anything and wanted to go in to the city to get fast food. We listened to music and waiting for our friend S to show up. It was 10:30 when I took the other hit, and just kind of forgot about it as we went for the drive in to BK.

Like the first time on Acid, everything was positive up until this point. We were laughing about everything and I remember having such a warm fuzzy feeling all over. My face actually hurt from smiling so much. I did start to come down slightly when our friend dropped us off, as we realized it was 1am and we were alone on Acid in her room. We had paints and the movie to distract us. For about 2 hours we played around with the paint and watched the film which was mind blowing, I've seen it many times but never on Acid. 

The reason I am actually writing this experience comes down to the point where my friend fell asleep and I was left there to fall asleep. It was 3am and I was probably at my peak. I tend to worry a lot and have been on meds previously  (I went off paxil 2 years ago) for depression and anxiety. I am a lesbian and have not come out to my parents so I lots of emotional baggage, which I was quite aware could end in a disaster for my trip. The exact opposite of a disaster is what I experienced. I rehearsed what I was going to tell my parents, I worked out problems with my love life, I consoled myself and actually formed some self esteem. I felt like I was someone else viewing my life and reassessing it, I realized that so many problems I thought were so bad actually were quite fixable and small. I cried, I even threw up and saw eyes in my puke. The visuals I had were amazing, I stayed and layed in my friends spare bed from 3am to 9am when a repair man came to fix her water tank, where I fell asleep to the sound of him banging away at metal. I didn't want to fall asleep knowing he was going to show up early, but as soon as he did I was actually soothed by the loud noises. My friend woke up at 11am and had an intense headache which lasted far in to the evening. I think it probably had to do with the fact that she didn't have the brain activity that I did, I'm sure if my brain tried to sleep as it was so fucked up I would have had  a headache too.

I know I will only take half next time I do it, as the visual and nausea was not very pleasureable. I did like the therapeautic affect the LSD had on my mind, It really helped me throught my problems. I know that it is dangerous to use drugs when mentally unstable but sometimes it helps you see your life in a different perspective.

This happened in 2015 on a beautiful day in November (it's 2018 now). I live in a place far up north, so there was plenty of snow. Prior to this I had tripped on LSD once, taken MDMA once and I smoked weed regularly. The one LSD trip I had under my belt had been really frightening and I thought I was going to die, so I was nervous as fuck when the day of my second trip finally arrived. The guy I was going to trip with was a friend that I became friends with at the school we were attending, a school where you sleep, eat food and play music all day for a year. We were both 19 at the time. My friend, who we are going to call V, had tripped on acid twice before and had the best time of his life both times.

So to the day of the trip. It was a sunday morning and I woke up at 9 a.m. and went to have some breakfast. I made myself a huge plate, thinking I wasnt going to eat for the next 10 hours or so. I tried to keep myself calm, but I couldnt get rid of the thought that I was going to have a bad trip, like last time. I sat down beside Vs roommate, too nervous to even say hello. After a while I blurted out a beautiful day, huh?. Vs roommate looked at me and said why the fuck do you care, are you going fucking skiing or something? He had no idea.

After eating I went down to my room and texted V, asking where the hell he was. He said he was almost ready, and would meet me at my room in 10 minutes. That was the worst 10 minutes Ive had in a while. I thought i was going to have a panic attack. And I was sure as shit that there was no way I wasnt going to have a nightmare trip thinking this way. V finally showed up. He didnt give a fuck about breakfast so we went outside right away. As we were walking to the little forest where we were going to drop the blotters, V managed to calm me down a little bit. He also mentioned that his roommate had autism. We found a sweet spot, and V  took out the blotters, handed me one, and I put it under my tongue. The dosage was 150 micrograms. The nervousness came back and once again i thought I was going to have a bad trip. V asked if we should smoke a joint. I declined at first, thinking that that was the cause of my first bad trip. But he lighted it anyway, and I took a few hits. This turned out to be a great decision! After just a few minutes my nervousness faded away, and I was calm again.

After about 30 minutes we decided to go buy a pack of cigarettes. I started to feel the acid creep up on me. After walking for about 10 minutes we turn around a house, and BAM: we see the ocean. It was really beautiful. There was a few pine trees there too, and the way the sun was shining through made it all look like a scene from a movie. I giggled and said to V I think I'm feeling the acid. Then we stood there for a little while, laughing like idiots. 

We arrive at the gas station. I remember it was a funny feeling coming inside. It sort of made the trip more intense. We stood inside for a while, not knowing what to do exactly. We started laughing again, and I began to wonder how fucked up we looked. I suddenly remembered why we were here, so I went up to the desk and said give me a pack of cigarettes. For some reason this was hilarious to me, and I really tried hard not to laugh my ass off. I got the cigarettes and payed, and we walked outside. I felt a little embarassed.

On the way back we walked over a bridge, with a river from the ocean running below. We stopped and my jaw dropped. Some of the river was frozen, and it looked like the ice was moving. As I stared at the ice I could se stars and planets, and it looked beautiful, like the universe. I explained to V what i saw, and he agreed completely. I also stated theres no way in hell that ice isnt moving!. Of course it didnt.

We went back to the school, and I decided to have a shower in my room. This is were the acid peaked. As I was standing in the shower I started to see some weird shit on the shower curtain. I saw a beaver, standing on his hind legs with a crown on his head. I found out he was a king, and that his army was going to war against an evil lion. It was like seeing a movie. Suddenly I came back to myself again, and thought to myself that I was really tripping. I tried to focus on the shower curtain again, and this time I felt like I was in a space ship. I had the feeling that I was racing through space with an enormous speed. It started to feel a little too real, and at one point I thought I saw some aliens behind the shower curtain. I became scared and turned off the shower and layed in bed for a while.

I began watching a movie, but it seemed so fake to me. The only thing I could think of were how much the actors humiliated themself playing such stupid characters in such stupid movies. And how our society glorifies and look up to these clowns. Ive never watched a movie in the same way since.

It was about 5 hours since we took the LSD when V texted me, asking if I wanted to jam. I said yes, so we went over to the building with all the rehearsal rooms. I play guitar, and V got behind the drums and started laying down this really groovy beat. I felt like I was playing like a god, and that we had an almost telepathic connection: every time I began playing a different melody or riff, V got the mood I was going for immediately. I felt like Santana at woodstock, that the guitar was a snake I had to tame. I could really feel the music, and one time we both started playing slower and slower, feeling like time became warped and we entered a different dimension where time didnt go as fast as here on earth. 

After jamming for about an hour, the effects of the LSD really started to diminish. It didnt happen much more worth writing. During the trip, there were times I felt safe and comfortable, and other times I felt really fragile and scared. But at the end I really felt like I had accomplished something, that I hadnt let the fear win. So all in all a good experience, which we repeated a few times, and eventually got kicked out of the school, but thats another story! Hope you enjoyed the read, and stay safe!

Last summer, I was 20 years old. My friend and I road-tripped a week down to my other friend, who got us the acid. The three of us dropped together, and kept up such a strong positive vibe the whole time. Since then, I listen to music better. I 'get' it now. Music is the purest expression of the existence each of us manifests, and I had to take LSD to realize how to enjoy that.

It was almost surprising how stereotypical the effects are. Bright kaleidoscopes and sense of oneness. But this really is just the way.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

It was a beautiful day and G, R and I had just bought a strip of Dragon Ball Z acid the previous day. We called it this because or plug only sold LSD on sheets with the DBZ logo. Due to the weather, we decided it would be a perfect day to drop and we each took one tab of 200ug strength. We then drove around the city and pulled endless gbs as we waited for the acid to kick in, (dont drive on acid we are stupid). At about 30mins in I began to feel the familiar warm euphoric glow and I knew I was in for a great trip. Another 30mins had passed and we headed back to G & Rs apartment as it was really starting to kick in for G and R but for me the warmth and euphoria had only grown stronger and I had yet to experience and visual. This was odd as I usually begin to experience visuals early on into the trip.	Overall 2hrs had passes since I had first dropped the feeling of warmth and euphoria was still steadily building and had become so intense that it was almost overwhelming.

Then suddenly while lying on a couch in the living room I felt a pop and it was as if reality went through a paper shredder and those strips of reality were sucked away into the top right of my vision. Those strips were replaced with complete blackness that eventually gave way to a mystical dimension void of space and time. While I was there I lost everything that I had always perceived as me all I was reduced to pure tranquility and I can vaguely remember vibrant reds, yellows, oranges, and purples. I dont remember much about this place other than this. Im not sure how long I was gone but while I was there it felt like eternity. I returned to reality with a wide grin, G and R asked me what happened and it took me a while to gather my thoughts all I could do was just smile and laugh like and insane man. I eventually gathered my thoughts and told them what had happened. They didnt seem to believe me as they had never experienced anything similar on acid. I believe this to be my first ego death experience. 	

After I was able to collect myself I walked over to the mirror in the room and stared at myself for a while. At this point I was tripping sack and was curious what would happen. At first I looked normal, slowly, my skin became pale, eventually grey, my eyes turned a deep black, and my hair was moving as if it was alive. This startled me at first as I was not expecting to morph into a foreign being, but although eerie the being standing before me did not appear to be menacing. Since this first experience I have continually perceived myself as an alien looking entity. As the acid began to slowly ware of I saw fractals of lessening intricacy and vividness as I eventually returned to baseline, and was greeted the next day by a lovely afterglow. Sadly, I have yet to experience anything like this since though, I have tried to return on multiple occasions but to no avail.

I dont know why I am posting this, I really feel I have no need to, but at the same time I also feel as if the experience I had must be shared.

I am a semi experienced LSD user, I have done it multiple times, and  it has always been a very enlightening experience.  This time was different, It was not a bad trip, but what I felt was that I had somehow come to an understanding of the world, and that the understanding had somehow slipped away. I dont know how to explain it, so i'll just go over the night.

I took 3 hits of liquid acid on the toungue at about 930PM.  We drove back to my friends house and went inside and began to listen to music and hang out.  I had not spent much time with these people, they were new friends, but they were very nice and they all made me feel very comfortable.  

I began to feel the initial effect about an hour after injesting.   
The sence of anxiety, of knowing whats going to happen.  About 2 hour into the trip, I began to get some very detailed and fascinating open eye visuals, I went into my friends bathroom, and stared at his shower wall, I felt like I was swimming in the sea, no sailing the sea, the acid ship was at my control.

Later we went over to another friends house and I sat and played video games for quite a while, I was really enjoying myself, everything was funny as hell and the video game, super mario cart for gamecube was trippy as fuck.

At about 5 Oclock AM, the effects were still very stong,  but something began to become strange.  I was the only one awake at this point, and I was now just sitting and staring into space and thinking.  And thses thoughts kept coming into my head. As I looked around the room, I see all these people, just passed out from a night of doing drugs and partying, and I looked at myself, and I felt this overwhelming sadness, I felt like nothing more that a junkie, a knew that thats all I was, all I am.  

I went outside, and started at the city and the now lightening sky, and thought about how insignificant I really am in the whole perspective of the world, and an overwhelming sadness came over me.  I then knew that I needed to do something, that I needed to change my life around.

I would have to say that LSD has helped me realize things about myself. The unfortunate thing is that I wish I had realized more, I feel like I missed something big.

LSD is a powerful drug, used wisely, it can do a great deal of good, but it can also be a monster, and destroy.

I used to do acid whenever I could get my hands on it in high school.  (Generally every weekend).  I loved it and always had a great time for about the first 2 years of doing it.  I never really had strong visuals, but would come to meaningful conclusions about the world and have powerful realizations.  I also enjoyed laughing my ass off at the insanity of the human race.  After a while something changed though.  I began to have bad trip after bad trip.  I would get paranoid and had trouble trusting the people I was with.  I thought that they were laughing at me and staring at me, wondering what was wrong with me.  I also developed anxiety problems.  I'm not sure what changed but I can no longer handle acid anymore and I'm kind of sad about that, but well, there's always mushrooms.

I had done LSD four times before this trip, but the most I had ever taken was two tabs. I had some money and a urge to have a huge trip with one of my best friends, so I bought six tabs. My guy said they were really potent and to be careful with them. I ended up taking three and my friend who had never done acid took one. About an hour and a half later I started feeling really fried and started seeing some of the strongest visuals I have ever felt.

We were at my friend's house smoking some weed when my little brother called me at around 8:00 PM. He sounded worried and said that our dad was supposed to pick him up for basketball practice but wasn't there. I told my brother to walk home and that I'd be there soon to check on my dad. The trip started going bad at this point. My friend and I had to walk through a very sketchy area at night surrounded by crack heads and goons. We were pretty creeped out but we had to see if my dad was okay.

We made it to my house and it turns out my dad had just gotten drunk again. My brother got home and was railing against our alcoholic father for forgetting that he needed to pick my brother up. I started really tripping in the next room and felt really embarrassed. 

My friend went home and I felt like the night was ruined. I was the highest I've ever been in my life and everything was moving and changing colors very rapidly, and I couldn't stop thinking about the problems in my life. I closed my eyes and I started hearing this old Chinese flute music, and all of a sudden I was in this beautiful place full of colorful trees, rolling grass mountains and a river at the center. The river had rocks in the middle and I could hear the water flowing, it was all very detailed and felt real. All of a sudden I felt some type of presence. I looked to my side and I saw a young Bruce Lee. This kind of creeped me out but made me happy at the same time, because Bruce Lee is a huge inspiration to me. Then I started speaking to him.

I said 'Damn, Bruce. My life is all types of messed up. I have an alcoholic dad, we're losing our house soon and my friend just had to see all the shit that just happened.' Then Bruce looked at me in the eyes and then pointed at the river. He said, 'Your life is just like this river. There may be rocks and obstacles in the way, but it keeps on flowing just as you will. You are 17, you will be an adult soon and all will be well.' Immediately after he said that my eyes flew open and it was like a huge realization moment. It calmed me down so much and after that the rest of my trip went very well. 

To this day if I start getting stressed I think of that place and moment and it calms me down greatly. It was the most rich psychedelic experience I've ever had.

 I Report on a Specific Danger

Abstract: 
I, Wodin-One-Eye, still believe that LSD offers a unique avenue for Lamarckian human evolution: changing one's own DNA to an improved form. This property is (IMHO) unique to LSD and is not shared with the other major psychedelics. However, the process involves a specific danger: when the first stage is accomplished, which is marked by a cosmic trip of a particular character, a waiting period (which I estimate at one month) is required before taking more LSD. Failure to observe the waiting period (that is, taking more LSD the next day) resulted for this user in a trip to Plastic Fantastic Land, an extremely undesirable result. This is probably the bizarre psychosis mentioned in some of the stuffy and uncomprehending literature written by idiots in white coats. I recount my experience of Plastic Fantastic Land and offer some observations and conclusions. It seems to me most important to warn younger users of the specific mechanism by which I stumbled into Plastic Fantastic Land (where, I assure, I would not desire to go again).

Experience: LSD Day One: I see God. 
I was a musician from infancy. When in 1974 I discovered that listening to music was enhanced by LSD, I determined to learn to play music on LSD. Over the course of a half-dozen trips in 1975, I was led by Spirit to choose a set and setting of a week alone (November '75) in a remote family cabin on a lake. After several days alone I took 500 micrograms (?+-) on the Thursday, before dawn, some 30 hours after the lunar eclipse (lunar phase, I believe, could be a factor influencing trips) and four weeks before the winter solstice.  

As I sat in the kitchen waiting, the morning sun came over the horizon; across the lake somewhere someone started a bulldozer motor, and the vibration of the sound entered my left big toe and vibrated my body and lifted me to my feet. I grabbed my guitar and rushed outside to sit on the porch in the sun.  My eyes crossed and I entered a complex hallucination in which I heard an orchestra tuning. When the vibration was at maximum, a bee flew from right to left across my field of vision, and my right eye followed it, turning 90 degrees to the left into my nose where it remained. My left eye remained straight ahead looking at the fingerboard. I began to play. In my right eye, a hallucination formed: God, the angels, and all of my male ancestors stood and listened. At my left, I saw my deceased mother being carried down to the lake in her coffin. Also at my left, I heard the Goddess moving (not speaking, not visible). I momentarily broke the spell to look to my right and see if anyone was really there  there wasn't. I snapped back into the hallucinatory space and continued to play for perhaps hours?? and learned a great deal about music which I was able to retain, although it took many years to work out the details. I will not dwell on the many beautiful details of this few hours in Paradise. Toward the end, I got out a music stand and some sheet music. Then a Wind came and blew the sheet music off the stand, and said, Now! I put the music and the guitar away and went out in the sailboat.

The cabin possessed a styrofoam sailboard about 10 feet long. The rudder attachment was broken, and on the day before I had crudely repaired it and taken it out in a mild breeze. Now, the Wind blew, and I took the boat out again. Not a sailor, I did not know to tie a loop in the rope which held the sail (1/4 nylon twine). I held the rudder with right hand and wrapped the rope around my left hand. The Wind took me rapidly out into the lake, sailing against the wind. The rope cut into my hand. It became very difficult to hold on, and so, I quit. I had the thought, I should go practice music some more! I turned the boat around. At this moment, embarrassing to recount, I had a sexual release and wet my pants. I could no longer control the boat, and was blown about for the entire rest of the day by the Wind. At the end of the day, at sunset, the wind died when I was 50 yards from shore near the cabin, and I paddled in. 

Experience: Day Two: I visit Psychedelic Hell
The next day, I understood that the Wind had intended to take me somewhere. So, I took another two LSD tabs, same as the day before. But it was pouring rain. I sat in the kitchen and played the blues tripping. Then I thought, this won't do! and I went outside. Suddenly the Wind came back and blew the clouds away  and, bingo, I was in Plastic Fantastic Land (to be described below). I got the boat out again and went out on the lake. The wind and waves were rough and shortly the rudder broke off and the boat capsized. When I righted it, the mast and sail came loose and sank. I paddled to land miles down the shore. I was barefoot, and it took me the rest of the day to walk home on the dirt shore road carrying the boat. During this walk, my head was divided in half: two separate entities inhabiting my brain, and not too happy with each other. My left testicle seemed to be painfully pulling away from my body. I got home at evening and wept. 

Plastic Fantastic Land is attested by two sources known to me: a series of drawings by Robert Crumb published in Zap Comix in the early '70s shows the visual imagery: trapezoidal interlocking acid patterns inhabited by reptilian humanoids, completely hallucinatory and non-living. The state is also accurately described by Marty Balin's Jefferson Airplane song, Plastic Fantastic Lover. Although Balin dodged the question of its meaning when asked, it appears to me that he and his lover had a cosmic trip together, probably making love, decided to take more LSD the next day, and went to Plastic Fantastic Land. It is not a nice or desirable place. My experience matched the elements of these two artistic renderings of PFL, leading me to believe that this has been a common experience, which arises because of this hubris: wanting to have the same trip again, which I now believe to be a serious spiritual error. No matter how cosmic the trip, taking more LSD the next day (although often reported to be useless due to tolerance) after such a cosmic trip, may lead to Plastic Fantastic Land. What it definitely won't do is recapture that cosmic trip. 

In Plastic Fantastic Land, my brain felt divided into two separate entities. In Plastic Fantastic Land, my brain felt divided into two separate entities. This was clearly related to the eye-crossing state of the day before, and to something involving the relation of right- and left-brain via the corpus callosum. In retrospect, I believe that I had on the first day re-organized the structure of both my brain and my chromosomes or DNA. (Cf. Barbara McClintock's work on spontaneous chromosome rearrangement in maize.) However, on the second day, the created structure of the day before was simply melted and destroyed by taking more LSD. It is my belief that I would have consolidated the gains from this experience by waiting for some time (a month or more: maybe a year?) before tripping again, and that I could have built on the experience.  I don't believe that there is any permanent brain damage from PFL that is not recoverable through rest, exercise, good diet and meditation. However, the psychological effect of a visit to Plastic Fantastic Land is devastating, and this is also a challenge to recovery. Sadness at Paradise Lost stayed with me for many years, and I never again was successful in achieving a set and setting that would support another such experience. For months to follow, whenever I smoked cannabis, I flashed back to PFL. 

The following spring, I had an unfortunate experience: severe mercury poisoning. This was unforeseen, and from an unexpected source  I will not say more about this so as not to generate controversy. It was a private tragedy. I was brain-damaged, and lost much musical ability as well as the ability to play chess well, and many other lesser details. My family, needless to say, blamed LSD, as the mercury poisoning was invisible and unrecognized. It took many years to recover, and during this time I also blamed LSD for this sudden dysfunction (which took several months to develop to its maximum), although I was at a loss to explain the mechanism. It took me 40 years to (a) recognize my symptoms as those of mercury poisoning, and to (b) unravel the difference between the effects of LSD and mercury poisoning. This I finally achieved by taking more LSD in my old age, which allowed me to definitively say, LSD did not cause this-and-this particular type of dysfunction. However, I admit that this is a subjective opinion. On the other hand, I believe that hidden mercury poisoning is quite common and may be responsible for some symptoms blamed on drug use. For instance, before that, I never had reefer madness style hallucinations, but afterwards I had them whenever I even smoked cannabis. In the event, I was compelled to stop taking LSD: I entered a yoga ashram and stayed several years. 

Conclusions:
After such a cosmic trip, a recovery period is necessary. Good diet (including saturated fat! IMHO!), rest, meditation and hatha yoga appear to be beneficial. Lacking a coherent recovery program at that time, I became a burnout, but this, I believe as stated above, was seriously complicated by mercury poisoning, and the effects of that lasted so many years that I was unable to pursue these questions any further. In sum, I believe that the cosmic trip is an evolutionary opportunity for both the individual and for mankind, but that it involves necessary learning processes for such ignorant young dummies as I was, and that these learning experiences must be repeated in order to learn how to ride that tiger. There was an immediate pitfall which I fell headlong into, which was not to sensibly wait before taking more LSD. If one could avoid that dumb trap, it might be possible to build on a series of learning experiences and find out what Spirit really wants to offer us. I have also taken, later in my life, mushrooms and ayahuasca, and I find no hint that they offer the same unique DNA-shaking and DNA-changing trip that LSD did on that occasion, but then, neither do they lead to Plastic Fantastic Land, making them much safer. I also consider it highly probable that some of what I experienced with LSD may have had to do with stage-specific brain developments in late adolescence, which no longer occur or can no longer be stimulated in older people such as I am now.

Rare LSD Effects

As always, my LSD sojourns into visionary experiences receiving so much praise by others evaded me.  In the past, absurdity itself dogged my mind/body interpretation of all sorts of experiments that gave others what was expected, from Budweiser to Slivovitz, from Leper Weed to Ecstasy.  Even so,  I was surprised by the unexpected skull crushing sensations on my first LSD trial and the writhing during later trials into floor positions with muscles graced with astonishing energy.   Soon, I learned from Dr. Grof himself, that the alarming skull pressures ascending from the roof of my mouth, moving into the maxilla, climbing across my nasal bone and shearing my forehead in opposite directions was a birth memory of one born by Twilight Sleep, an obstetric procedure abandoned thirty years after I was born.  My initial resistance to this interpretation finally gave way to the unmistakable correlation between the LSD memory and what the fetus would feel as the doctors first two fingers drag the baby out of the birth canal by the roof of its mouth, producing obvious distortions of the skull in the expected sequence.  This was a real memory, it was resurrected by a very small dose (25ug) of LSD and it happened only once, disappearing totally after several days of exact encores in the form of flashbacks.    

Later trials with higher doses (100-250ug) of the same street lot of LSD produced effects of an entirely different kind, in which a two-minute spike of heart rate, blood pressure and oral temperature was followed by several cycles of twisting into fetal positions with intense flexing of all skeletal muscles.  

A glorious change came over me in the following two or three days, in which I was highly aware of my surroundings, as if they were new.  This was accompanied by a new state of relaxed movement without any sign of fatigue, reminiscent of the ease in which a lion or leopard walks, confident in ability.   More LSD trials produced the same stages of LSD effect and I reached unaccustomed levels of ability in sports activities.  This blissful state would not occur unless I fully participated in the muscular work during each session. This blissful state would not occur unless I fully participated in the muscular work during each session. 

What does one make of this?  To a biochemist, the idea that a tiny amount of drug just sufficient to cover the head of a straight pin would elicit an unforgettable nine-hour trip was, to say the least, impressive.  The temptation to account for the birth memory and for the struggles in later trials was irresistible.  A hallucinogen started a process to open a memory site for release of its contents into conscious awareness after >four decades of hiding.

I smoked a couple bowls before I headed over to my friend's dorm room at about noon. When I got there, I already knew I was going to drop three tabs of acid. This was extremely stupid given how strong the tabs were and that it was only fourth time on the substance. I remember taking them and my friend taking one.

I knew of the spiritual and mind-changing possibilities if LSD but hadn't truly broken into an ego-death experience I was about to have. The real reason I was taking the acid that day was not one someone should be taking a dose of acid like that for. I was taking it to have fun and 'trip balls' for shits and giggles. I don't remember it kicking it in and don't remember being aware of existing in reality until a little after four PM. During this time, all I can reoccur is seeing photon-light particles of all colors, way more colors than exist not on LSD, fanning out in every direction from what I later figured to be the Big Bang. As I was drifting in and out of even being in the present moment of reality, there was this kid in the dorm-room who was sober and thought it would be keen to mess with me, at least I thought.

I couldn't recollect anything I knew about anything and everything I knew about real life seemed like it was fake and a far-off concept. I would remember things like my name and where I was, that I was a physical object and existed with everyone else and take those thoughts as grand realizations. A pattern started to arise in my statements, 'But when'? All of time, and I mean infinity, every phenomenon that has happened or will ever happen was happening right then. I then connected the Big Bang I had envisioned earlier that day and thought I was experiencing a separate Universe, an entire Big Bang sequence that I would ride to expansion and come back the next day. As the day wore on and we were hanging out with people, they started noticing I wasn't talking much. This is because I was deep in the halls of introspection and participating socially wasn't really on the docket. By around midnight I was still tripping nutsack.

I ordered an Uber home and watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and then 'Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia' until the morning. The issue was that I had dosed almost 24 hours ago. I had work at noon. I was still disoriented and definitely mildly in the trip. Time took forever to go on at work. And paranoia took over. I thought for sure I was permatripping and I was trying to figure out a way to tell my family I needed to be checked into the mental hospital. I held it together on the surface the whole time, but I was extremely confused at work and was seeing things differently, I could smell a distinct smell that I figured was the trip. When I went home, I still couldn't go to sleep. I smoked and that had my thoughts racing even faster. The last I could remember was thinking about how I now had to live with Schizophrenia and how to deal with my psychosis.

After over 30 hours tripping I had finally passed out. I woke up once and was still a bit confused. I wasn't tripping when I woke up again but the paranoid thoughts are very consuming. The second time I woke up it was with the sunrise and I knew the trip had worn away. I turned on Pink Floyd's 'Time' and cried with urgency and gratefulness.

Three friends and I decided to go bush and take what had been described as very strong clean LSD-25.  Prior to taking it I did about an hour of awareness meditation.

The LSD took about half an hour to come on.  I sat watching the river for a while and became immersed before going out to the old growth forest to watch the trees.  I had never seen this before - they were pulsing and bulging in and out and I could see green auras around them.  I became aware of my primate side, the side that knows instinctively how to connect to the earth - the side that knows how to survive if everything fell apart tommorrow.  Funnily enough it made a lot more sense when I had all four limbs on the ground like an ape.  I definitely had a better connection with the earth when my hands which I know so well were literally connected to the earth.

About 2 hours into the trip I saw what I can only describe as dna sigils interweaving themselves along my arms and hands.  They flowed along perfectly with the contours of my normal physical body.  I also saw slightly different sigils on the face of my girl friend.  These visuals were constant for about 4 more hours.

The visual state and my mental state seemed to be in unison during this time and the feeling was as if I was connected to the earth not as an ape as before, but as a human, but a human who could move and live on the earth in a way that I have never done before.  My posture and presence actually felt different - like another being - but it was definitely me, just me in a way that was unified with the earth.  There was something childlike, but there was also adult and animal, and throughout it all I was aware of the choice to be what I want to be.

I have a fair amount of experience with LSD but have never experienced anything quite like this.

I used to live on the Gulf Coast in Mississippi, and psychedelics are seldom available save shrooms.   I had tried shrooms before eating several ounces, but my results were lackluster. I did not know what to expect, and was taking them for the notoriety of having taken them more than the experience. When I first encountered LSD it was unlike anything I had ever run across. When you hear about something called acid you would expect it to melt your brain, but it does not, not in a literal sense anyway.  A friend of a friend had come back from the Bonnaroo music festival with window pane acid and was selling it for cheap so I bought some. I had tried acid before and was amazed at the superficial visuals and the sounds that seemed to come out of nowhere, but after awhile I began to consider myself a professional tripper.

I began to delve into what made it tick, and why if the drug was so strong in small amounts, why it made any difference at all if I took one more than everyone else (Which I did for bragging rights, I pushed myself even further than everyone else, durdur!).  Started to wonder where the time went, and what I was left to, where I went when  I was away.  In the height of this particular trip on the window panes I found myself in deep contemplation while I watched Robin Williams on Broadway. The things he said did not seem as funny as they did true. Why was everyone always blabbering on about Atomic weapons?  Because they were afraid of them, but why should they be afraid of them if no one will ever use them again? They should not. I found myself sorting through my fears, encountering repressed thoughts ( child abuse and the like), and looking at my friends as human beings instead of these fabricated dolls I had created in my head. I realized how accountable I had been for every action I had ever taken, and how much of my life was up to me. Before this moment I do not think I had really been conscious of my freewill. I dont think I had ever thought or felt anything genuine. Then I realized something potentially life shattering , this was not the drug, but my mind playing tricks and running in circles. I began to consider what life would be like seeing it from this perspective all the time, and I asked myself if I wanted to go back to living in that stupor or continue to feel this way forever. The friends who I was watching the program with realized something was wrong with me so I suggested that we go outside for some fresh air, and so that we could smoke some cigarettes ( because we were so fucking cool).

Outside beneath a large I told them of my revelationthat the drug was not real. They were not surprised. One of them told me he had figured that out several months before, and another aid that he had speculated that to be the case, but that he was not quite ready to believe something like that yet. Then there was a third friend who asked me if I wanted more acid, then he asked me if I wanted to travel to bourbon street, and all kinds of other weird things like that. I told him no each time, but he persisted as if he had not heard anything I had said. It got to the point where I felt like reaching across and punching him, but then I had another idea. Me hitting him was exactly what he was trying to get me to do. I decided to forgive him for his absurdity rather than giving into some animalistic urge. Then he broke down and cried. He told us that his Mustang meant he was cool, and then he asked us if we thought he was cool too? We went along and told him that we did. He cried more and ran through a list of things that made him think he was cool. Finally I decided I would like to go for a walk and stretch my legs in this new world I had discovered. The friend who was not ready to accept stayed with the one who would not, and the two of us began walking down a long road toward some water at the end of my street.

I told him that I wanted to tell other people about the way I felt. Told him that I had been living in bullshit for so long, and now everything made sense. He began to tell me about Christianity, which I was familiar with, but I had long been agnostic. The trip had not changed my agnosticism. It just made me think that I had been tripping on life, and now I was tripping on death. I had made up my mind to stop tripping period by this point. That was until he began to tell me how Christ had died for my sins and all these bible stories. He said after his BIG TRIP ( the one like I was having) the Bible helped him keep his sanity. I thought that he had felt alone after his trip, and the Bible gave him something absurd he could cling onto, but my newfound innocence got the best of me. I began to believe him about God ,Jesus, and Christianity. For months afterward I claimed that what I had experienced was salvation. My soul had been cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ! People noticed a drastic change in me.

I had been selling pounds of pot just days before, and now I was striving to be a good Christian. It was not me, and as things do that are not, my religion eventually faded, and I found myself in a greater darkness than I had ever encountered. I felt that my friend had unknowingly betrayed me. Religion had kept him from feeling alone with the universe, but throughout my life that was all I was ever looking for. That feeling made me feel whole, and now because of this implantation of Southern Baptist doctrine I was lost again.cut off from myself in every sense. Tabula Rasa, a blank slate. Now two years later Ive managed to put myself back together not as much as I would like nowhere near as I ha that night, Substance abuse has re entered my life, though I do not find myself placing the faith in the substances as I did before. LSD on the whole has never brought me that close to something again.

yoga

Obviously there are a million things to be said right now but what I want to talk about it the effects of yoga after having tripped pretty hard for about an hour (which included a bus ride home) I came home.  My mom is a yoga teacher and my basement is half childs playroom half yoga studio.  I asked her if we could do some yoga, I blamed it on being stiff and tight but I soon learned that muscle and your body are all finite ideas.  Anyways we go down to the studio.  All of the lights are off except for the mood lighting.  There was chill music.  What really hit me about the yoga was feeling inside my own body.  All that bullshit yoga teachers always say stuff like 'pinch your shoulderblades back and feel your spine melting' I actually feel it and the ways that the yoga teacher describe things to me make perfect sense.  Things that dont make sense to me normally like 'lengthen your spine' make sense and I can feel it.

I remember wanting to have sex on lsd to see what effects it would have on me and the visuals. So me and my bf has sex and everything seemed normal visually. However, sensually was a different story I could feel everything, every bump, graze and glide. The colour around started to get brighter and move faster and as my orgasm built up so did the visuals. The colours became more vivid and the shapes became more structured and fixed together. Like a perfect puzzle. The closer my orgasm came to be the more shapes would appear and colours that I didnt even know existed tarted showing up around me. And I shit you not at the climax it was like a firework display going off around me. Each shape exploded into what looked like pixie dust, it was all so bright and overwhelming tbh. It took me a while to come back around. I sat there for ages just gazing at the ceiling understanding what had just happened.

lsd is a cure

I suffer from cluster headaches. It had started about 3 weeks prior to the trip. My friend had brought over some acid so I figures why not. Note that I didnt even know this was even possibly a cure for the headaches. Therefore there could be no placebo effect. Anyway, I started the trip and noticed the usual effects. I noticed that about 1/4 of the way along, my headaches which were quite severe that day, had completely gone away. I was astonished to feel better. Never would I think that this is a cure for anything, but it helped tremendously. The good thing is that since that day, I havent gotten any sort of cluster headaches since. Thanx cid!

I had a pretty traumatic experience with acid about 3 weeks prior to writing this. I had tried LSD once before that but it must have been weak or bunk because I didnt feel much. Anyways, the setting was my friends house, just me and him. I took 1 tab at first, and then another an hour later.

The effects of the first tab were just setting in: I was feeling detached from reality and giggly. At about an hour and a half after taking the first tab, I started getting this feeling of intense anxiety. The feeling got worse so I went to sit under his deck and calm down. I thought looking at the trees and nature would help me out. The anxiety became more and more intense as I sat in the chair and I felt completely helpless. I became paralyzed by a feeling of fear. It wasn't about anything in specific but I felt very afraid and anxious. I became paralyzed by a feeling of fear. It wasn't about anything in specific but I felt very afraid and anxious. I had some very intense visual distortions as I looked at the trees. At about 3 or 4 hours after taking the first tab, I started getting hallucinations. I saw a monkey dancing in a tree and a cartoonish type of coyote smoking a cigarette next to me. They were only in my periphery though and would disappear when I tried looking at them. I was paralyzed in this one chair by the feelings for about 5 hours. I couldn't bring my self to get up. I wasn't scared by the hallucinations though. If anything, they distracted me from the overwhelming emotions. I wasn't scared by the hallucinations though. If anything, they distracted me from the overwhelming emotions. When the trip died down at about 5 1/2 hours, I was left with the anxiety. I didn't think much of it at the time, I thought it would wear off.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

I then went inside to take some bong hits and then drove home. When I got home, I couldnt sleep at all that night. I was so anxious and begining to feel extremely depressed and thought I was loosing my mind. For the next few days I experienced intense anxiety constantly. Prior to this experience, I had never experienced anything close to this level of anxiety. I experienced a vivid flashback several weeks later where I felt like I was tripping again. The intense part lasted only a few minutes but I had a detached kind of feeling for aboout an hour.

Of all the times I tried LSD,  this was truly one of the most beautiful trips.. Where psychedelics were beyond..way beyond...n u all know what I mean when psychedelics take over your mind...

It was 31st night 2005 on a beautiful beach in goa at a trance party , 11:25pm,  when I did my first drop of LSD n nothin happend for about 30 mins so I said might as well do another trip... This time it was a blotter a red heart... 15 mins into it and I was on another plane, cos both trips hit me and came on at the same time....both intensely potent I'd realised...

Wow n wow ...dats all that I could say ... My vision was that like I was looking through a fish bowl, all blurred,  into million dimensions, fairies n pygmies dancing among people, stars shooting millions of them...then came the mad hatter to dance...n it well indeed a mad dance...colours flashing across...the earth and sky were one...I didn't know where I stood...space n time seemed infinte... 

I've written a poetry on this beautiful trip...dat I'd like to share...

			Beautiful Madness

Take a little, 
My mind to run and race
To the heightened sounds of music, 
To a beautiful face
Blue and green all mixed up, 
Spirals of light
Liquefied is the world, 
My sense my sight.

The stars have come to say hello, 
Come to say goodbye
No time no space, leaves have gone up,
No earth no sky
My mind is slipping, slipping away, 
U dont fall
Its slipping and then u hear it, 
Have u heard the call? 

Drown myself in its beautiful madness, 
A long road ahead
Different colored faces, voices keep calling, 
Too much has been said
Only to find myself in the puzzled ball of energy that binds us
Where dances of the unseen 
And visions of the unknown,
Have all flown to dust....

Well n like all other trips it came to an end after a long 15 hrs too beautiful is the drug LSD...these colourful memories r the beautiful things I have stored in my head...a sense of completenes...a sense of infinte lives in this energy ball we all live in.....

The first time I tripped was with 3 of my close friends and we all took one hit. This particular blotter acid was a (spider-man) and, obviously had a little picture of the face of spider-man on it. This was a wonderful experience and I felt a sense of closeness to my friends, and it was during the day, cause we had skipped school, and the sky was so big, BLUE, and beautiful. We walked through the woods for a hour just looking at plants and picking flowers and buds off different plants and bushes; I felt a real respect for the beauty and naturalness of nature. Then we came up on a railroad track, and it just so happened that a train came by at that time, and it was loud as hell. And I could feel the ground shaking.  But this isn't the bad experience.

The second time I tripped I really messed up. It was a week later from the previous first trip of my life, and I had gotten 3 of these (spider-mans), and from what I had heard from experienced trippers was that these spider-mans were good, and I agreed considering my first trip. I bought 3, one for me, my best friend who I hadn't tripped with and his brother. We had planned to do it on a saturday night. Unfortunately, my parents had planned to go to a nascar race early the nest morning and I had to be there real early at like 5am,so I could watch my little sister. SO I was at home alone, cause my parents were in bed sleeping, and my friend corey and his brother had decided to go to a club since we weren't tripping. I stayed up late that night watching t.v. Cause I was bored and at 12 started to watch 'Space Cowboys', and I was bored and wanted to have some fun and took one spider-man, after and hour into the movie I felt as if it wasn't really effecting me, and being a unexperienced user of acid; not knowing the power of it; and still questing for that true trip, like in the movies and stuff where u have alot of visuals. So wanting more effect I took the other 2. So now I have 3 spider-mans in me and I'm watching 'space Cowboys', I first started to notice that Clint Eastwood's face looked real weird and sort of twisted, and in the movie they're working on this satellite in outer space that is supposedly this Russian communication satellite. But in the movie its a conspiracy, and the satellite is actually this nuclear warhead satellite still up in space from the cold war. Now when this things goes into attack mode, I felt like I was in a dam I-max theatre, and this thing was giant, and I was like ok I'm tripping now, so I turn it off and go to my computer and start to play a computer game called Counter-Strike, but I find myself just staring off into the screen and like breaking down every pixel on the monitor, so return to the television but only to flip through the channels, and note this was only my second time tripping and the first time I didn't have any real visuals, but this time I was in for some.

I turn on the T.v. And start to watch ESPN and they have a male aerobics contest. Except I cant hear the announcers no matter how hard I concentrate, I never knew acid could effect the hearing. The contestants are jumping around on stage, moving real fast, but he scary part was all their heads were shaping into demons, and they were growling, so I flip to ESPN2, this one is sportscenter, and as they were showing the highlights all the games were in total slow motion to me, no matter how hard I tried it wouldn't stop moving in slow motion, and then I flip to HBO where they were playing 'Lake Placid', the one with the giant killer crocdile, and the peoples' faces kept shifting, and there skin would peel back off their face into another shape, and I saw some scary scenes that I can't really remember, but now at this point I have this deep dark fear, and not being able to handle it  I decide to try to fight it and just goto bed, so I go upstairs and lie in my bed, I remember just lieing there playing with my hands, and looking at feet which seemed to be a mile away at the end of the bed, I felt a fear that I wouldn't come out of it cause I had taken too much and remember thinking that over and over that I was going to go into a permanent trip, and when my parents got up to get ready for the race I was still tripping lieing in my bed tense and frozen like a stiff dead person trying to pretend I was asleep as my mom came in to my room to say by, but she skipped across the room; and I couldn't even understand the words she said, and as she left I thought about how much I loved her and how mad she would be if she knew of the stupid shit that I do, and my little sister came in and layed with me after my parents left and this was like 7 in the morn, and she noticed that I was wide awake, and she asked me what was wrong and I just began to cry and told her she would never understand, then I got up at took a shower, when I got out I felt so cold and body felt like crap so I layed in bed again, and just went into a daze and I don't know if I fell asleep or not but at like 11am I came to my senses, and got up and was delighted to notice that I wasn't tripping anymore, and my eyes weren't dialated and I could actually think. I swore that I would never trip again, but I have many times since then, but nothing ever close to that night.

Before my first trip I had experimented with many drugs. I felt like I had explored the vastness of my mind to the extreme. While having many a high time, I had given up on drugs having the ability to take me to new realities. Shortly before my trip my life was in chaos. I was gaining weight, jobless, self indulgent, and utterly wasteful. My mindset was that of a curious 15 year old, yet I was 21. So this being my reality, a close friend procured some blotter.

I took the hit with an open mind. within an hour my friend and I felt as if we were reading each others minds. Barely having to conjure up words to express emotions. The sensation was all mental with an intense body buss. Soon however, I was in the grips of my own inner demons. My fears and thoughts were out on display for me. I realized how pathetic and immature I had been. Careless and selfish, disgusting. I changed forever that night. I realized I was a man, I had a healthy body and spirit within begging me to allow it to thrive and glow. Begging me to become a man. since this experience my life in general has improved a great deal. I exist in a new, enlightened reality. The trip is over, but just like a trip to the Grand Canyon, it's greatness will always be a memory within me. If I loose faith, I remind my self how strong I am. I believe this experience has probably been shared by many people, We are united through this...we understand.

It was a Monday evening after school when my buddies G and N told me that they just got word from our dealer that he's got 
A great deal on some Storm-trooper acid tabs. My buddies and I were all experienced trippers (so I thought). I tripped around 8 times, N around 10 and G about 7. This time I wanted to take 3 I've only taken 2 at most in the past which I thought was the 
Perfect dose, but N said I should at least just experience 3 one time, so I did. My buddies and I drove up to meet our guy to get the tabs, I got my 3, N his 2 and G his 2. I wanted to wait and trip with my other buddies D and A on the weekend coming up but it was a Thursday morning when I ended up staying home 'sick' I thought it would be the perfect time.

On that Thursday morning I made a dumb decision, I popped the 3 in with a positive but also slightly nervous feeling. I sat on my computer reading through some articles about news and listening to music, 25 minutes in I felt it, I realized then what I was 
In for. It was 6:35 a.m when I took the tabs. Once I really started feeling it I decided to relax in bed and watch the new X-MenDays of Future Past, and boy was that something...the color's were unbelievable, the feelings were amazing this in my head.

Was the coolest experience I've ever had. After the movie was done I got up and just starred out my window looking at the sky, the trees, my pool, the cars passing behind my house. I was astonished by everything I was seeing, and a weird thought
popped into my head. I thought about some of the people I knew and how they had to grind for what they have. I know people who have barely anything with crazy screwed up lives...no parents, no money, barely a roof over their head, but me? Well I had everything my parents were still together, I had money, I had a roof over my head, I was spoiled. All those thoughts just clicked in my head and I started bawling my eyes out harder than I ever had before because I treated my parents like sh*t even though they did everything for me and I realized how lucky I was. All those thoughts just clicked in my head and I started bawling my eyes out harder than I ever had before because I treated my parents like sh*t even though they did everything for me and I realized how lucky I was. This was the life changing part in my trip because after this, I treated my parents with so much more respect and rarely ever talked back to them...they had no idea that LSD was the change to that.

Now on to where my trip went from excellent to terrible in the matter of seconds...it was 7 hours into my trip, I was texting my buddy D and telling him about it, he then replies with 'Bro, how are you still tripping that hard? You should've reached your peak by now?' After reading that text I thought for some reason my brain was fried for the rest of my life, I thought I would be tripping forever...And even though in the middle of the trip I knew that it was just the Acid I couldn't control it...I was freaking out. I lost my mind, I would go from my bed, to my computer chair, to walking back and fourth repeating my name...address...middle name just to keep myself from thinking I'm crazy...At that point I just wanted to talk to someone, I NEEDED someone. My brother, and dad were home BUT I knew if I were to say a word to them they would think I'm crazy, and to me at the time I thought I would just stay in my perpetual loop and end up in a mental institution. It was finally 2:45 p.m when D got home I made him get on skype to talk and help me. D would ask me questions and I couldn't even respond or barely comprehend what he said...I kept trying to explain what was happening but I couldn't even remember anything...my train of thought was obliterated. Eventually I realized I was stuck in my first acid loop that I remembered reading about. D looked it up and just told me that I had to relax. After a little over an hour my mind was once again stable. After that experience I've never touched drugs again.

During the Winter of 2005 I came across some good quality LSD.  I had only tripped on the substance twice before, but I am very experienced with other hallucinogens.  LSD is tough to come by in Northern Virginia where I live, at least with the few connections I have.  So I purchased 8 hits and took 2 the weekend before to test it out.  I tripped a little bit and got a lot of morphing and coloration changes, but no visuals, leaving me a little disappointed.  The LSD was relatively cheap so I had planned to go into school to take a test and then go home sick right after and chomp down all six of my remaining tabs.
I woke up excited next morning, eager to begin my trip.  It had just begun to sprinkle snowflakes on this beautiful Virginian morning.  I arrived to take my test at 8:00 AM sharp.  I brought the LSD with me and had decided that I wanted to be tripping when I got back home, so 15 minutes into my 45 minute examination, I ate my tabs.

T 0:00 - At precisely 8:15 AM, I ate all six tabs, then hurried to finish my test.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

T 0:30 - By the time I finished my test I was coming up strong.  I handed in my test, and scurried out of school.  It was strange leaving, the patterns on the floor began morphing.  I decided to walk into the bathroom to check myself and take a piss before hitting the road.  My pupils were very dilated and I had the appearance of someone high on drugs.  It was still snowing when I got out to my car, so I hopped in, popped some good tunes in my CD player, I think it was United States of America, good stuff, and proceeded to make the 30 minute drive home.

T 0:45-1:30 - The snow has lightly dusted the grounds on the highway that I travel on and the wind is blowing the snow around, giving the road the appearance as though the ground was moving.  Also, I would like to clear one thing up.  The trees are covered with snow, which reminded me of Narnia.  I felt blissful and tranquil, eager to get home and rip out my bong.

T 1:30-2:30 - I arrive at my house and greet my dog, a shaggy, black-haired dog who is always around me.  He has smoked with me on a lot of occasions and I believe he enjoys the habit.  Whenever I arrive home from school, I always take him outside and rip a bowl before my mom gets home.  He sits right beside me and looks up at me, eager to get a shotgun.  It is now snowing very hard, and I look outside to see that my car is completely covered, so I decide to take my bong out and box it up.  My dog is terrified of the snow, so he wouldn't come along.  I enter my car and put in some Grateful Dead to back my trip.  I proceed to smoke at least an eighth of pot, and by the time I exit my vehicle I am tripping exceedingly well.  I decide that it's such a nice day, so I should go for a walk.  I grab my iPod and go walk around my neighborhood, which is a truly gorgeous piece of land, with tall trees, nice houses, and woods surrounding it.  I walk around for about thirty minutes but decide to go back inside cause I was cold.

T 2:30-3:30 - There is a hill beside my house that is pretty steep that has since been developed on, but ever winter my brother and I make a ramp at the top of it and jumps at the bottom.  The ramp is solely used to collect speed.  I grab my snowboard and go out and mess around for a little while, though I am physically inept at this point and can't land a thing.  I walk back inside and make a few cocktails and watch a movie, the Doors.

T 3:30-5:30 - I'm still tripping delighfully hard.  My own trip experience completely correlated with the movie, which I only realized until after the movie.  I'll admit it, I am an alcoholic, so I found many parallels between me and Oliver Stone's inaccurate portrayal of Jim Morrison.  I was tripping almost at my peak when the band goes out into the desert to do acid.  As I am making more and more drinks and getting a little drunk, Morrison breaks away from his band and starts doing cocaine and drinking to excess, just as I am now doing.  By the end of the movie I'm still tripping, but not nearly as hard as before.

T 5:30-7:00 - I go to smoke a few more bowls to try and get back up.  It works surprisingly well.  I decide to make a fire cause it was getting chilly in my humble abode.  As I look into the fire, I see tremendous colors, brilliant and vibrant colors, colors that I didn't know existed.  The flame turns solid gold and I am absolutely enthralled by the whole experience.  I watch a little while longer then retreat to my room to play guitar.

T 7:00-12:00 - My trip comes to a close in these hours.  All in all it was a great experience, that lead to the creation of my new motto when it comes to hallucinogens: trip hard or don't trip at all.

This was my first real experience with LSD. I acquired a strip of geltabs from a strange man I came across. I have had much experience tripping with Dxm, Mushrooms, Salvia, Ketamine, Morphine etc... I knew that I was mentally prepared for whatever may come during this experience. 

It was about 11 p.m. on a saturday night, I had just finished a long work week and had the next day with no responsibilities. I broke 3 pieces off the strip and put them on my toungue until they dissolved. About an hour later I joined my crew. They were all excited about going on a journey.

I started tripping around 12 a.m. I couldn't stop petting this dog that had a mane and resembled a lion. The next thing I knew we were following these strange people we met to a place they called the 'Land of Moses'. 

We arrived at the Land of Moses around 2 a.m. It turned out to be a graveyard in the middle of Nowhere Indiana. By now I was tripping very intensely. There was a strange woman guiding us the whole way. Her name was Carrie. We walked throughout the graveyard and made it to a giant statue of a man holding a sword. Carrie spoke of the Statue never facing the same direction. We watched as the lights around it flickered violently. Some sort of electrical Fury. I could feel an intense energy that defied any other trip I'd ever had. Soon Carrie's stories had my girlfriend so scared that she was in tears. The look in Carrie's eyes was so mesmerizing. She looked like she was on LSD as well, but I knew that she was not. She spoke of possessions and figures in the graveyard. Several of the people with us saw something walking in the distance and became frightened. The energy was so strong. 

The next thing I saw was the peak of my life. A dream I had previously had kept flashing through my mind. Deja Vu was so strong. I grabbed my girl and held her as close as I could and felt her heart touch mine. At that very moment and train ran by less then 30 yards away from us. It was so bright and loud. I knew that this was the highest peak I'd ever reached. Complete chaos. The train was running by, so bright. Every star in the sky swirling, tree branches moving like life-like limbs. Utter insanity. I cannot describe my emotion.

Soon the train passed and Carrie led us to a bridge. We parked on it, and I realized that it was 3 a.m. There were 3 cars parked here, each containing 3 people. Carrie spoke of 3 being the death hour. This did not frighten me. I felt like something had just been tapped into. Some kind of peak that's so hard to explain. 

Minutes passed and Carrie parted ways with us, She gave us directions back to old Fort Wayne (home), and we were on our way. I spent the rest of the trip in complete awe, just absorbing the memory of that moment when the train ran by. This was definitely the highest experience of my life.

This trip happened at a huge music festival. This was my first time that I tripped really hard and it was overall a very positive experience. My and one of my friends took 2.5 hits at about 1 PM. We sat around and talked for about a half hour, and when we both started to feel some initial effects come on we started walking to the festival area. We decided to split up from the rest of our friends that were with us so we could be free to go off and adventure without being tied down to a big group. 

By the time we got to the festival area we were both starting to feel very upbeat and giggly. After walking all the way there we sat in the grass near one of the stages and waited for the show to start while we checked out the schedule and planned our day. We cracked some jokes and were laughing really hard. When the show started, we went up to the front. The band was awesome and it felt great to move to the music. 

After a few songs, we figured it would be a good idea to go see one of the crazy side-shows going on at one of the tents. By the time we got there we were starting to trip pretty hard. We sat down in the tent and waited for the show to start. We had a really interesting conversation with someone near us about how crazy the whole festival experience is. I felt like I was speaking really profoundly and me and my friend were both cracking up. There were decorative chandeliers hanging from the tent that seemed to sway back and forth. The show began and it was immediately very visually appealing. The opening act had 3 women dancing in golden clothing and they were waving around golden cloth that seemed to shimmer. The colors, lights, and music were all very vivid and spectacular. 

We left before the show ended and we both felt like wandering around and just watching all the people around. It felt amazing to walk and my legs felt a little rubbery. I noticed I was sweating and the water felt very strange on my skin, and I loved how slippery it felt on my forehead and between my fingers. I couldnt hold back a huge smile from my face! We started talking to some drunk girls at one point and we were both laughing because they had no idea what we were experiencing. Conversation was difficult and required a lot of thought, but I felt I could still get a point across normally with some added effort. I felt like I could walk forever. We ended up going all the way to the main stage and caught a couple songs from the band there. 

As we walked to another stage to go to a show that was starting soon, we randomly ran into the rest of our friends. When we saw them, they looked very different to me and it was very surreal. We talked a little bit with our other friends, but conversation was becoming more and more difficult. I felt like I wanted to talk with my friend who was tripping about what we were both experiencing, but it became more and more difficult to put things into words. My reality was starting to fall apart a little bit and I noticed that all of my normal judgments about things were suspended and I could think about them in a different way.

It was liberating and confusing at the same time because I was starting to realize the complete subjective-ness of all experience and my brain had nothing to grasp as solid ground. This is an extremely difficult feeling to put into words, and it really opened my mind to different possibilities and ways of thinking. I also thought about how awesome and free the whole music festival scene is, with so many people into so many different kind of things, all having radically different subjective experiences and mindsets. It made me realize how true it is that there is no objectivity when it comes to human experience and behavior. I realized how deep down were all so different from each other, and that its not only just o.k. to do your own thing but its also amazing!

We walked over to another concert nearby and arrived right on time. The band started to play, and after a minute I realized they werent playing any real songs and were just improvising. They were really gelling and were playing some very spacy, atonal music. I was hearing how they kept subtly surprising each other and exploring different tonal areas seemlessly. If I focused my attention, I could hear great intricacy in the way they played every note. We left after about 30 minutes to go catch another show. We sat down towards the back and had a conversation with this really bubbly, free-spirited girl who I think was also tripping on something. Her voice was very calming and I enjoyed the conversation, though speech was still difficult. After she left, I laid down in the grass and stared up at the sky. I was getting very intense visuals looking at the clouds and they appeared to swirl around and I could see waves go across the sky along with the music. I told my friend to do the same and offered him my sunglasses. We laughed about the common experience and how it made absolutely no sense to our logical brains but nonetheless it was very real in our minds. This was a strange duality to me of being completely out of my mind, but yet still present, collected, and completely able to communicate!

After that concert ended, we walked along a trail that goes through a small forest with really cool looking trees. There was a man doing sound therapy for donations there and we laid down nearby to take some time to recharge a little. The sound of the gongs he was using were calming and I felt deeply at peace. Laying down in the woods and staring up at the trees swaying in the woods was blissful. I wanted to stay there forever, but my friend wanted to go see the next concert and we had to leave. 

We went up to the very front at the concert and found our other friends who were there. It was very crowded and I felt uncomfortable. Shortly after, the concert started and I was really enjoying the music for the first few songs. One of my friends sparked up a joint and passed it to me. I was feeling really good still and I figured it would be a good idea to hit it, but I turned out to be way wrong. The next song the band played was a very heavy, aggressive song, and it freaked me out a little bit and I started to feel bad vibes. After the song, the band started smoking a blunt on stage, and then threw it into the crowd near me, and one of my friends caught it. Instantly, it was a frenzy for everyone around to get a hit off of it, and I just felt caught in a vortex of bad vibes. My friends all passed it around our own circle and smoked most of it before passing it to anyone else around us (which I thought was a huge dick move). I passed on it, not wanting anything to do with it. At that point, I just wanted to get out of there, but it was so crowded that I was pretty trapped. I couldnt get into the music after that, and my mind was getting very negative. I was pissed that I had smoked and that it was giving me a bad trip. Thats when I had a huge revelation that I dont even like smoking anymore, even though Ive smoked regularly for years, often daily. I realized that it has always just brought me down more than anything, making me paranoid, self-conscious, and lazy. This was a very liberating discovery to me, and felt like a weight off of my back, even though I was still not having a good time. 

I was so glad when the concert was over, even though it was a band I normally like. My friends couldnt stop talking about how amazing the show was, and I was having a hard time explaining exactly why I didnt enjoy it. I was able to put it behind me, though, and I enjoyed the rest of the day. It started to get dark and there were now brilliantly colored lights all over the place to check out.

I was no longer peaking but definitely still feeling effects. We went back to our campsite later and I had a blast just improvising on my guitar. I felt like I played more rhythmically and creatively than I ever have, which was cool. I started playing the rhythm guitar part for Dark Star and jammed on it with one of my friends and it was a blast. All in all, it was a really great trip and I felt like I benefited from being able to see the world through a different lens for a day. I was able to more objectively look at my life and my personality, and I feel that was of great value. I feel like there is so much more that I could write about it, but its so hard to put that type of experience to words.  I think music festivals are perfect settings for doing acid I look forward to doing it again some time down the road.

I remember the first time this happened to me. It was a night of madness. We all ate the acid inside the house and waited for it to kick in. then we continued smoking marijuana like crazy, as we were doing before, the whole afternoon, and drinking beer, hanging out.

Man, it was the strongest trip everyone had ever had. As I was the most drug hungry, I took twice more than them. It was sometime at night already, and we were being very noisy with the music playing really loud and everyone screaming to talk to each other. The new sensations and thoughts we becoming more apparent and we perceived quickly that something was changing. We were all going mad. At some point I forgot I had taken the drug.

I went to the kitchen and became fascinated by Portuguese tiles on the wall! Oh my, were they beautiful! Patterns of interlocking rings of the most vivid blue, each one slowly turning, clockwise and counter-clockwise. My resting right hand melted against my forehead, and the Pink Floyd album playing on the background was my only reality. What are these weird and exquisitely beautiful noises?! I didn't even remember who they were, or that there was any way out of that sound. And that was just the first wave.

After that, my friend asked me to roll us a joint and I couldn't really recognize his face, only stare at it. It was so beautiful and expressive! Midway rolling the joint, I caught myself wondering where did that green thing come from and what was it for and why they were so eagerly waiting for it. I couldn't finish the joint and handed it away to my friend.

I felt the whole house we were in was alive. Everything breathed.  I had no concept of me. I had no idea who I was. I tried at some point to hang on to the memories or places or duties that were familiar to me, whatever I thought would made me, me, because I was terrified. All in vain. I was gone.

When we all went out the backyard to have the smoke, one of my friends commented that soon it would be the break of dawn. Only then, I realized time was split into daylight time and nighttime. I didn't even remember that! Then, my friend handed me some bread and I just stared at it. He said: Eat it! Do you know how to do it?! Haha! I got a kick from it, because indeed I had forgot we human beings eat! And that reminded me that we are all animals.

So much had been experienced that I was getting exhausted of everything and was wondering a way out of that. All that existence. I thought, Maybe if I sleep, Ill be able to rest from all this... But then I realized theres no way out. Sleeping wouldn't satiate my need. I needed a break from existence.

Then we heard the cops siren! Everyone went crazy. We all started running nonsense and they shouted from the outside: Stop right there! Man, that was the rush of my life! So I froze right there at the corridor, totally frozen, and waited. One of my friends went up the stairs and saw through the balcony a police car and two cops arresting a shirtless man on the street. On our street. He came back and told everybody it was going to be okay, that they werent raiding the house and we wouldnt go to jail or get killed.

After that, we chilled a bit, and I came down very fast. The sun shone and two of my friends went to the bake house and bought us all some orange juice and freshly baked bread for breakfast.

Fin.

Over the past three years I have experimented with various drugs but only delved into the world of acid this year. 

My first ever experience with acid was fairly tame as I think the tab was not very potent but I felt very euphoric and had good visuals. 

It wasn't until my second acid trip that I truly felt the power of this crazy paper magic. I dropped the tab with two friends around 7pm summer time so it was still going to be light for several hours however I anticipated that I would want to stay inside so we chilled in my friend's bedroom. Almost as soon as the effects kicked in around 30 minutes later I felt an immediate need to go outside. Only one of my friends wanted to join me so we went for a walk and this was absolutely amazing. Everything danced and formed patterns, I felt elated and mesmerised by all the colours I could see over everything and the earth looked as though it was breathing. 

Things stayed pleasant and amazing for a while until we returned home. My friend's house is filled wit ornaments, toys and crazy wallpaper which all wriggled and changed colours. Being inside at this point was very overwhelming and I had to leave again. We all went outside and things started to get weird. I slowly began forgetting who I was, where I lived, what I do in life, what me and my friends were doing and I was obsessed with knowing where we going even when we had chosen to sit and relax. 

I forgot I was on acid, I felt like the same people kept passing us as we sat on a park bench and I struggled to see if things were really close or really far away. I knew something was weird but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I felt like I was in some dreamy state, I couldn't talk and I couldn't really get my head around what other people were saying. I could understand each individual word but the whole sentence sounded like jibberish. 

It was actually quite stressful and overwhelming until I finally remembered we were on a drug It was actually quite stressful and overwhelming until I finally remembered we were on a drug and that this crazy weird feeling would stop and suddenly my trip returned to being blissfully happy and entertaining. 

As I started coming down I took a second tab and went home. In my room, I listened to music and laid in the dark with my eyes closed enjoying the closed-eye visuals but annoyingly I fell asleep about 3 hours later. I don't really know how, I just suddenly woke up in the morning and felt like I had wasted the tab as I barely reached the second peak!

I have done acid a few times since but have yet to experience any spiritual awakening or reach any great epiphanies which was my main goal in doing acid but I think I will try two tabs in the future. 

From my experiences, bad trips are easy to trigger but equally easy to avoid and easy and easy to turn around. I think I just needed to do it a couple times to be able to know what to expect and how to control a seemingly out of control experience! 

I am planning on doing LSA Morning Glory seeds soon for a second time and LSD in the near future.

This experience happened about 4 months ago. I had only tripped on LSD twice, both times around 2 tabs worth, so I was still pretty inexperienced with psychedelics at the time. My roommate on the other hand has dropped dozens of times with absurd amounts. I believe the most he took at one time was around 1400ug. I'll refer to him as M. We both got a little more than we were asking for.

It was a Monday night at my home and my roommate had picked up some LSD tabs from a pretty reliable source. He cut roughly 3/4 of a tab and tested it with a reagent kit to ensure it was legitimate, and then ate it. He asked if I wanted a tab, and I said no at first as it was a Monday night and I had classes the next day. After about 20 minutes, I thought about it again and decided to take it, since I wasn't sure when the next time I was going to have an opportunity to drop again. 

Both me and my roommate sat in the living room waiting for the come-up. Maybe 20 minutes after taking the tab, M looks at me and says I've never tripped so hard in my life!. At first I thought he was joking. He hadn't even taken a full tab, and I assumed it probably lost a lot of potency with the reagent kit. He then goes into his room, and I turn on the song Echoes by Pink Floyd. At some point during the song, I started getting extremely intense visuals. The wrinkles in my jeans suddenly turned into a wavy ocean. I was both amazed by how a substance could do something like that, but also fucking terrified. I only had gotten tracers and some mild movement on my 2 previous acid trips. The music was able to keep me calm for a while, as it is my favorite song of all time. If you've ever heard echoes, you'd know that it gets extremely dark right in the middle for about 4 minutes. This is when things started to get really crazy. The whole room went dark and began changing shapes; the walls were warping and I started trying to hold on to anything that I could use as a reference to real life.

I eventually had enough intellect to turn the song off. I eventually had enough intellect to turn the song off. At that point the vibe became a lot brighter, but not any less intense. I eventually went to my roommate's room hoping that some company would help me keep some sort of grip on reality, but it really didn't help at all. Every time I looked at him, I saw dozens of rainbow fractal versions of his face, but they weren't really visual. It's almost like I was halfway in my head dreaming about this, but still seeing it at the same time. 

I then lost touch with reality completely. I have no idea how far in the trip this occurred, as I had the thought process of a 2 year old at that point. If I wanted to fly to another part of the room, I could do it. I would be lying on the couch, but in my mind it was an extremely vivid feeling of flying to the other part of the room. My thoughts and imagination were differentiable. I honestly thought I permanently went insane. 

I started to finally get a grip on reality again after some time. I started remembering things from my physics class, and I knew that laws of physics can only exist in the physical world. At first, I lifted my hand up and let gravity take it down. I slowly started to establish what was real and what wasn't real. I started feeling the couch, recognizing that it was a physical thing and not something I made up in my head. This went on for a while until I was completely grounded again. I still had intense visuals, such as seeing shifting in brick walls and objects warping, and this actually went on through the next day. M said the same thing as well.

I've tripped multiple times after this, with my highest dose being ~350ug, and that trip didn't even come close to the intensity of this one. I asked other people that had taken the same batch, and they all had similar experiences from just 1 tab. Moral of the story- don't underestimate 1 tab. It could be VERY overlaid.

I took my 175ug tab at 10:15 pm. I was sitting on a chair on the back porch surrounded by my old pals that I hadn't seen in months. I let the tab sit under my tongue and swallow it after about 15 minutes. I thought swallowing the tab could decrease the intensity if this were a dose I couldn't handle. (I was probably wrong but I felt safer this way). 

I just sit and watch my bud play DJ hero and have some laughs. After about 35 minutes I find myself on the ground mesmerized by the carpet. I notice the fabric move around almost like worms (take with a grain of salt). 

Now I'm an hour in, and I head outside for a cigarette. I'm starting to come to terms with how the chemical feels. I lay on the ground with music on and watch the stars slightly fall before me. I head inside and just chill while they watch videos and smoke dabs. Though I know trip sitters should be sober, I made this exception, seeing as I too had taken just 2 small dabs. The feeling now was almost strictly bodily, like I was completely sunk into my comfy chair. I make small talk with my close friend's brother. I have one more smoke and head into my friends basement at 3am. 

I get behind his piano and fiddle around, really try to get my pent up music energy out. At this point I understand this 'at home' feeling I've read about. Every other moment feels welcoming, like a new perspective has brought me warm hospitality. Now close to 4am I lay on the couch in my friends basement while he rest on the couch a few feet away. I put on some of my favorite music including bedroom pop like Starry Cat and some Explosions In The Sky. Visually, I found myself lost in the album covers on the tv screen. It was like one still frame was a whole psychedelic masterpiece. if I notice a certain pattern, it tends to be repeated and repeated. I can somewhat control where my visuals take me. 

I learned a lot of information on acid. Lots of answers to questions without thinking too hard, answers seem to roll off my head. Like art. Art was one of the most important realizations during this trip. I realized that life was created somehow, just as art is, simply created, making universal consciousness art itself. I realize that the mind is the most sincere form of art. 

Another effect from the trip was out of control bodily movements. I lay on the couch for hours letting my mind shut off the best it can and my arm moves high across my cold face. I tend to be moving and rubbing my clothes a lot. This movement keeps me grounded throughout the duration of my experience. This lead me to become connected to the universal pulse that moves within us, in our hearts. The music playing from the TV definitely amplified this 'pulse' idea. For awhile I trick myself into thinking if I wasn't moving I'd have bad thoughts, though this subsides.  Other visual aspects included staring at the little specs and glares on the sink and having them completely cover my visual field. On the couch I trace and draw on the fabric for over an hour, with the light from the TV shading the room, while crib mobiles hang from the ceiling. 

The hours that followed were somewhat zombie-like. I presumed this to be the 'comedown'.  I woke up my friend to ask if I could go watch the sun rise on his back porch. The screen doors were left open so I was welcomed with fresh air and a chilly temperature. I wander around viewing the rising sun and just explore around in his backyard. I head back inside and wrap a big blanket around me on the couch. I let the hours pass as I feel a bit burned out and sweaty, fairly aware of my altered mindset. I concluded that Acid can really hurt my brain if I try to gain control, it's like my conscious will try to push Lucy out of the driver's seat and it will disturb her greatly. Every time I thought 'I'm on acid right now?! I didn't really need to do this did I!?' I'd feel a pinch in my brain and readjust myself.

This substance is made for people who can easily watch life go by without worrying or putting in maximum conscious effort. I see now why meditation is an important skill to have. Overall this was a pleasant and somewhat enlightening experience. Though the comedown the day after is difficult to overcome. Still slight feelings of disconnection and numbness but definitely a more open mind and a better acceptance of my outer and inner universe; especially now after puffing some grass. 

I plan on using this substance only few times in my life, because now I'm aware of the beneficial yet overwhelming at times chemical.

It was time again. Every couple of years Tom felt, he would tell his closest friends, 'acid calling'. Wondering whether these intuitions were the product of self-hypnosis/delusion or just some cultural hippie norm he had picked up subconsciously, he got into the car with with two of his traveling companions to drive a few hundred miles to a contact of theirs. Being of the persuasion, that there are essentially two kinds of acid, the acid approaching purity produced with a lot of care and the mediocre nonsense that he had found to be of less worth than the piece of cardboard it had been dropped onto, he didn't care as to whether this belief was factually true or not. He just found that procuring a bottle of Acid  in an alcohol solution from a specific contact was 'appropriate in effect' for the circle he found himself experimenting with in that time. Better in subjective experience than the blotters and sugar cubes even after an expert had maintained 'acid is acid, man... it either works or it doesn't'. It was a pilgrimage to procure the bottle, with battles and problems that had to be confronted or laid aside along the whole route: traffic jams, stormy weather, route changes and adjustments as well as no place to stay at their destination. All this trouble and stress to procure a little bottle of madness juice.

On the journey back home the three of them had decided to visit a botanical garden that was displaying a rare carnivorous plant in bloom. As Julia was a plant person, this stop was mandatory and the botanical garden was rewarding and what Andy liked to call 'authentifying'. At the entrance however, the group was told that the flower had just fallen. The bloom lasting only around two to three days, the plant's flower had finally given way to gravity about an hour before the arrival of the returning pilgrims. 'It's clear what happened here... the acid did that' was Andy's response 'It dissolves everything, even this monster flower at a distance, so when we approached with the bottle...'. The day was one of those breezy summer days and the botanical park around the greenhouses was filled with strong old trees; the kind that have character and beards of moss that are softer than mattresses when they aren't too wet or too dry. The place was relaxed, beautiful, and quiet enough to tolerate a session on the part of this group and so a toast was made to the security guards; their ability to stay out of sight was a skill that the so-called guardians, protectors and police people of our society could learn from. Tom hoped that no 'hooligan druggies' would ever find this place to necessitate more security and trash cans and coke machines and fast food stalls and that kind of what he considered to be consumerist crap spoiling nature's performance.

Only 20 minutes after a glass of Mango juice with 2 drops out of the bottle, Tom found himself wrestling with the day's first issue. In his late twenties, a part of himself had always thought his career would pick-up sooner and was hurting him. An impatience was brewing inside of him with all the compromises he had made and all the concessions his art had to suffer in the process. Instead of studying music and working for diplomas in teaching, he felt he should've just went for it and become a full time singer-songwriter. He blamed himself for being a typical hypocrite coward to walk the 'safe route'. Then the mp3 player jumped to his Playlist with songs by Charles Ives for piano and voice. The turning point in this episode was remembering that Ives had actually become an insurance executive instead of trying to live of his music. The reason for this was simple: Ives didn't want to be in a situation wherein he was forced to sell his baskets. Instead, he made money in business and bought his own freedom along with helping many young composers feed themselves and live. When he was free in this sense, he was able to write the most original, experimental, and courageously beautiful songs. He was not the bitch of any audience or crowd and he didn't have to accept pay from idiots that knew less about music than children know intuitively. 
Beauty to Ives was not simply prettiness, sweetness, darkness, coolness or any other limiting aesthetic criteria and it certainly could not be adequately grasped by language. But most of all it was something that we don't really know. 

Tom had always felt jealous about not being popular enough or people not recognizing his passion and had thought that success in a commercial and career sense was something admirable and something absent from his life. Acid on that particular day changed that negative emotion. Instead of successful singer-songwriters and famous bands and musicians deemed to be excellent, he saw a bunch of empty idol worship. After all, Pavlovian research had shown 100 years ago that all that is needed to like a song is repetition and 'getting used to it'. People can be hypnotized to like any crap as long as you repeat it often enough; just look at how people vote or believe the news that they see on the net or on TV. The problem here to Tom is overly reductive thinking: when people reduce themselves to liking certain styles, or genres and keep rationalizing that with 'everybody's taste is different, you can't argue about taste' and that 'this music/band is part of my personality' they deceive themselves in that they think they know what it is they want or seek. At this very moment, Tom felt, a person goes blind. What they perceive to be openness for a style, an artwork, a book, or a music is inversely the closed-mindedness towards everything else. A truer openness is constantly shifting, probing, fluid, and at the same time strong, with integrity. An open aesthetic person makes bad aesthetic judgments and adjusts accordingly. Beauty and truth not as some formula that you know and that is part of your style; but as a wild animal that requires a lot of chasing after, a lot of seeking, a lot of questioning, purifying and readjusting of your methods and strategies. 

For the first time in a long time, Tom felt happy about choosing the Ivesian route or at least he believed his own lie without cynicism. Hollywood and signed bands are for the masses to which he said goodbye and spoke a chant ending in something like: 'I love you guys, but I know better than to open my mouth when you don't want to listen and for this reason my stage, music, creativity is reserved for my loved ones. There is nothing I want nor care to prove to strangers.' To Tom, in his delusional intoxicated state, the mango juice had removed a huge weight and with his mischievous grin he said he was gonna make some serious cash and become as fucked-up as everybody else. His next toast went to Ives.

	The way someone would most likely describe me would be Hippy. Good, bad, I take is for what it is. I love the Earth, animals, and the sense of deeper and subconscious learning. Ive had past substance experience with (approximately): 
Mushrooms 25+ times ; Ecstasy 10-12 times ; LSD 8-10 times ; Extensive pharm experience ; Habitual Marijuana use over the last 3 years ; Ether for a few weeks;
GHB 3 times ; DXM 20+ times ; Cocaine 6 or 7 times  ; Salvia twice ; Diphenhydramine once ; 2C-(B or E) ; Morning Glory ; DMT: a resin rip with subtle effects.

Looking for something as inconsistent as LSD can be a deterring factor in the continuation of the search, But when the storm is right and the road to psychedelic enlightenment is paved, you have Bliss and a babys head.

	Yeah man I have a friend who can get that, its ridiculously pure though, so its gonna be $15 a hit. Oh I see, How about if I buy 10? Same thing ...

After debating, I figured I trusted the kid enough for him to deliver on his word, and after all acid is quite the commodity. After the usual long waiting and anticipation of pre-trip, my friend called, setting a meeting place where we could pick this wonderful magic up.

	At last, a baggy filled with 10 Sweetarts that set me back 150 big ones. Oh well, I was excited. Before I go into each trip/experience I always give myself a few minutes to reflect on what the upcoming event could hold in store for me, and try to induce mental clarity. At around 10:30pm I ingested the first piece of candy along with 4 other friends. Slightly metallic taste, hoping it was stronger than its taste had suggested. I still felt confident. 

	I noticed the first effects about 30-45 minutes in, nothing profound or too extreme, just mild color distortion and a slightly fuzzy head. Driving, looking for a place to burn some trees the acid was coming on nicely. Before departing from the car to partake in the sweet embrace of Mary Jane, we each take a second hit. Its about 12:00.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

	On the walk down the dirt path to one of our favorite smoking spots Im struck dead in awe staring at the moon. Watching it as it slowly descends toward the mountains only to watch ascend once more. I pointed out the moon to my friends, and there we all are, stopped dead in our tracks staring. The moon had finally reached all the way to the mountains creating an epic lunar show, where the moonlight would reflect off the mountains in a series of bright patterns. We continued to stare in disbelief of this cosmic event until the moon had completely disappeared behind the mountains.

	We had eventually made it to the bench to smoke. After we did everything of less-than-bright quality had temporarily gone from my vision. Seeing only an array of streetlights and stars. We got back into the car (not sure the intent of this was, if any) We were driving, bumping music, late at night, on Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, in Utah nonetheless, yet there was this sense that nothing could go wrong, like I was protected from harm and any other terrible event that could befall on me, other than my own psyche I guess. While in the passenger seat of my friends car, I had let out a loud gasp of terror as I clutch my mouth in horror. And pointed at this terrible thing as it lay in the road. Landon (the driver) exclaimed  You saw it to?! 

	I couldnt speak, I was at a total loss for words. My friend had just seen the same morbid, disturbing image I had seen, without knowing that I had even seen it. All I did was nod my head. 

	You saw that babys head in the road to? 

	It was like hed ripped the words from my mouth. As we approached this decapitated infants head, it had turned back into what its true form had been, a brown lunch-bag twisted at the opening to create a spherical bottom with grease stains down the sides, looking like bloodied hair. Such an elaborate trick my mind had played on my vision, it was too real for such a awful image. What I took out of this, is that the immensity and realty of this substance can create structures in the worlds beyond infinity. Its power should not be taking lightly. It is a sacrament.

	To the park was our destination. Swings! What an idea! Back and forth I go with my face cocked towards the stars zoned out to Floyd(as with most of the night) with a grin bigger than the Cheshire cat. 

	At a different park (not sure why), my brother comes to buy a sack from my buddy. He comes over talks to me for a bit. Leaves, then I hear him calling back at me with a sort of excitement in his tone. He runs back over to show me some pictures of some newly budding plants hed been working on. I must of got the excitement from his vibes. I immediately have this huge smile on my face as he explains his photos. I could feel the light from the phone on my skin, and it was as though the light being reflected on me was exuding from my every pore. With a body high of nothing I have ever felt. 

	We continued on up into the wilderness section of this park late at night. I remember the lure of a wheat field, I had to go spin in circles with my arms stretched out from my sides, brushing my fingertips against the many plants. My friends got a good chuckle out of this, but it just felt too right not to! 

	Reaching higher and higher in the park we settle near an old bench. Staring out at the skyline, just staring. And it happened. The line that separated the foliage from the sky and all the colors switched on me. It was almost as if things had gone into Negative vision. 

	Still zoning to Floyd, I take a seat on the bench just beginning The Wall. My eyes are closed with my forehead resting on the edge of the table. The Thin Ice comes on the child crying gives me a little scare, and I pop open my eyes as result. Not 2 feet from my face underneath the bench, this hideous child with eyes wide as saucers is staring at me while simultaneously I hear it crying through my headphones. It was there as plain as day. My heart stopped. It was too real not to be.

	The night continues on at the same park, and in a wide field we all notice a giant pole sticking up from the ground. We all look in wonder, until one of us starts running over to it, with the rest following close behind. Turns out it was a telephone pole (Go figure!). I was barefoot during this whole ordeal (Hippy nature I suppose) as well as most of all last summer. I felt this soothing, soft, almost perfect scratch against my feet. I would pick up handfuls of this sand I was standing on, and just let it slowly drain from my hands. During this repetitive action the thought kept running through my head of there being as many planets in this existence as there are grains of sand on this Earth. Staggering realization when you feel like you can actually put somewhat of a tab on the possibility. 

	It had become early(5-6am) and the LSD was subsiding. Mostly now was the left-over self-reflection period where youre usually are making a lot of conclusions about life and trying to interpret what you had just seen. The bridge back to reality. 

	We had watched the Lunar light show of the moon dropping behind the mountains, and now here we were watching her counterpart, the sun, bring light and life to the world around us. I had seen the cosmic systems workings for a night. Absolutely stunning. Truly the work of design.

	We had made our way over to a Harmons(?). I had made the comment while looking at a bushel of roses, that it would be considered quite peculiar for me to go and start smelling all these different flowers. The thought invoked the action, and there I am at 7am smelling the flowers out in front of a grocery store.

	 It sounds really(10x) corny, but we all need to stop and smell the roses every once in while, and truly take in what has been given to us in this beautiful (mess of a) world.

We cannot grasp existence because we have no means to describe it.

This was the second and possibly last time i took LSD. I say this because i dont think any other Psychedelic or drug related experiencene could ever top this one.

Me and a few close friends went too an illegal rave in a castle in december, the people there were completely alternative, there where no idiots there trying to sell coke or anything. Obviously there were some insane people there, combining alll sorts of things and getting wasted to the point of no returjn, but there always is.

This wasnt a flaw tho. This njust enhanced the experience for me, it was incredible. WE got there early and had a few drinks, and i brought some salvia and pipe which made a few friends to start with! a couple of my mates took mdma fairly early so me and a few other mates went hunting for acid. Of course i now knpow what people mean when they say that You dont find LSD, LSD finds you. This all seemed alot like someone who had spent too much time on LSD, but it makes sense now.

If you look for it i imagine you'll find it in an uncomfortable place to take it, but if you wait and go somewhere like this, it'll be readily available. Me and my friend took too drops of liquid, which we were told was very weak (we later realised that there is no such thing)

This didnt kick in immediatly so we wwent for another drop which we bought for £5. The trip began slowly, and we had a bit of fun. There were typical wall pulses and things, and we had a dance to the awesome psy trance that they were playing. At about 10 o'clock the organisers of the rave brought us a suger cube laced with the stuff, which i was reluctant to take at first, cos i didnt wanna push it. but once my friends had taken it, i felt i wanted to be on the same level as they were.

It was strange at first becaus eit was my mates first experience with psychedelics, or any other drugs for that matter, and i felt i had the responcibility to look after her. So i sat with her in our dorm for alot of the time, talking and walking around, it was perfect, she was fine and we both said alot of things that we needed to say, i was happy here. This was what i wanted from my trip, to really sort out my head cos i was in a bad way with alcoholism, and acid alwys gives you the thinking you need to tackle your problems in the non-psychedelic realm. And it helped her i think too. We bonded that night, we went around the castle grounds and got frightened, inspired, wiser and became better friends for going through this together.

Id taken acid before, but a much lower dose. Which is why i thought i was at my peek at this point,i was wrong :)

When it really began to kick in, it became a little uncomfortable but still, there wasnt enough time to be frightened of this experience, your mind was working too quickly, there was too much to take in at the time. AT the highest point of the trip we went for a dance in the bottom room where they played the harder psychedelic stuff, and this is where i had the most perfect moment:

After dancing for a while i began some sort of ego death, in which i was omnipresent in this room full of otheres who were on the same level as i was, there was no predjudice, just an unconditional brotherhood amongst these people i didnt even speak too, these people id never met, iy was perfect. I felt out of control of myself, and that we were all one in control of eah other. Ive heard of people seeing god on acid, but i felt like i was god. It was perfect.

After this i went to the ambient room, and sat and watched the drapes hanging from the ceiling, covered in paper butterflies which moved there wings gently to the music, it was a perfect moment. The dimensions of the room where beyond comprehension, there was a girl near me juggling or something, my memory betrays me, but it was the most beautiful thing.

We then went back to the dorm, because my mdma taking friends were coming down hard, and so we all sat in the dark listening to pink floyd dark side of the moon. I had some great closed eye visuals here, the visuals just played around the song and held relevancy in them, one part i remember was watching rainbow dollar and pound signs fly by me as the song 'Money' was playing. It was fantastic. Another point i remember was listening to my friends in the bed furthest from me (They are a couple) giggling and laughing with each other, only to realise that it was just the drum beat of the song, and tha id interpreted that in my head that it was the two of them chatting. It just reminded me of how powerfully mind bending LSD is.

I know, this is just another typical trip report, but for me it was perfect. And i conclude that having a bad trip is impossible if you can just find the right place and do it with the right people. And make sure your in the right frame of mind else it could go wrong. But its also an important experience in life, to realise that there are other dimensions that your senses cannot comprehend withot lsd and psychedelics. lsd illegal? The world would be a better place if it wwas compulsary.

BODY WEIGHT:

	We took off at 7pm on a Friday evening. There was me, and the other members of the Explorers Club, that is S, J, and L. We began our night in my apartment, where our non-partaking roommates had deserted, understanding that there would possibly be four deranged individuals doing the Acid Drugs- probably imagining us shooting pure LSD into our carotid arteries and trying to jump out windows or cut off our hands. Nothing of the sort happened of course, because this is real life, and not an episode of Dragnet.

	Anyway, Hearing that this was good shit, I had decided to start with one and a half hits,with the other members taking either more or less, depending on their confidence in their ability to hold themselves together. I had attempted to make our setting as pleasant as possible- colored lightbulbs, blacklights, cool artwork, Pink Floyd and Flaming Lips records were prepared. There was also a music visualizer playing on the TV, and we had some bubble-blowing toys and some colored tissue paper to play with.

	After a while of letting our tabs soak sublingually, and without noticing any strong effects, I was not hesitant about taking another half a hit, taking me now to two hits.

	Started to feel like something was beginning, so we tore up the colored tissue paper into confetti, and started throwing it at the air conditioner, which would blow it up into the air in a messy Easter-colored tornado. We were beginning to feel that slight squirmy electric feeling crawling all over our beings, when the outside roommates made their way in. They drank some water, and stared on in horror as they saw four young adults writhing around in colored paper shreds on the floor, quoting spongebob, blowing bubbles, and handing them gifts of small fabric pot leaves. 

	After they left, we began questioning why we dont always play with confetti. Why dont we always blow bubbles? Or jump in piles of leaves? ... An idea took hold...

...

	Soon, we were out in the cold October night, standing in piles of leaves, which was most satisfactory.


	Later, we were up on an elevated platform on top of some buildings on our campus. We had gone there expecting to see lights from the buildings pulsating, geometric patterns in the dark sky, and the platform itself stretch out for miles as it had on our previous trips. This trip, it was doing none of those things. I began to wonder if we were even tripping at all. There was just a sense of childish playfulness, not a cosmic awakening as I was half-expecting (again, based off of prior experiments). 

Im afraid I might have left the strip out too long- the sun might have diminished its potency, I said.

Ah, dude., said S.

I dont know... this is kind of nice, like, I dont know, said L.

J said nothing, but chewed on a blade of grass for quite some time.

I have an idea. Lets go back to the apartment, take another half a hit each, drink a lot of orange juice, and smoke a lot of pot. We wanted to get high tonight, so lets try to get as high as we can

The Explorers Club agreed.

	We cut up the remaining two tabs, and took them with some Sunny D rip-off swill that declared itself 100% Vitamin C. (this brought me now to two and a half hits)

Flavor be damned I thought, Its those vitamins that will do us good.

	So we all took our seats in the bathroom, and pulled out our bong, The Space-Time Continuum and proceeded to smoke the most I have ever seen anyone smoke in my entire life. I took no less than seven full rips before we ran out. The room was lit green, and we had some incense burning, as well as The Flaming Lips At War with the Mystics playing from an iPod dock. By the time Free Radicals came around, I noticed that in the dark parts of the room, there was color that should not have been there. My mind was projecting imaginary but brilliantly colored lines radiating outwards form the edges of objects in the dark. The ambient psychedelic music blended well, and for a few brief moments, the room seemed to turn into a rainforest, trees beyond my field of vision, exotic animals lurking, and everything gaining a layer of warm tropical moisture.
	I have no idea how long we spent in there, but at some point we walked out, and sat on the couches of the living room. It was difficult to understand what sort of state we were in. It was like I would change from feeling entirely sober, to really high, to tripping, to tripping and high, then back to sober again.

What am I right now? We all seemed to be thinking.

And almost as though it heard us, it was like at that moment the acid said:

 You want to know? You want to know what two and a half hits of acid and an uncountable amount of bong rips is like? Well, here you go, shithead. This is what you bargained for.

	S asked Are we tripping?

	I thought about it a little, then looked at the kitchen. I made my observations and promptly screamed:

	LOOK AT THAT SIDE OF THE ROOM! LOOK AT THAT SIDE OF THE ROOM! Yes! We are tripping! Holy Shit!

      I had never been this far gone in my life before, and it was a little unnerving to say the least. The vibrations seemed to be turning on me, I thought. The pink lightbulb cast forth eerie shadows from oddly undulating cabinetry in the kitchen, where i sat, perched precariously on a leaning barstool, spending years slathering Nutella on a slice of one dollar white bread. Though I was not necessarily hungry (Lucy had seen to that), there were certain food rituals I have become accustomed to (thanks to Mary). And perhaps I was just looking for some sort of way to come to terms with and feel some level of control over this insane world which had never made its presence know to me before, at least not to this magnitude. This was especially difficult when I found myself wondering the ulterior motives of my non-partaking roommates: are they doing something in secrecy? Is this some sort of jealous and perverse attempt at a one-upping? All of this was made worse when Joe began circling the room, dressed nearly all in black, and his  mirrored trip glasses reflecting the green glow of LED Halloween decorative Spider-lights, gave him the appearance of a vulture. The spirit of judgement! I thought, And of death!, My mind recoiled in fear as I smeared another layer of chocolate-hazelnut spread on my mattress-sized sandwich. I thought, this is LSD. You do NOT fuck around with LSD. Who the fuck do you think you are, taking two and a half hits of this stuff and not expecting THIS to happen? You might have been fucking around before, but were not fucking around now.

	Things were really wild. Flat images seemed to be made of a series of floating layers, some of which moved ever so subtly. All objects had some sort of sound, and I was pretty certain I could hear electricity flowing through the strands of electric lights. Time was gone. Logic was gone. Proportion was gone. Distance was gone. No objects were set in place, and they could freely change size if they needed to, and sometimes things would breathe. Faces and animals were appearing in the pile of confetti, and I felt it was my artistic duty to make the image of a squid eating pink and blue things from these paper shreds. 

	Even though we as a group could not scrape together much more than the sentiment of What are we doing? we had decided to take a second exodus outside. Which may or may not have been a good idea- J was headed in a downward spiral. He had fallen very quiet, and I had noticed that he had put his right hand on his face, and had not moved it for perhaps an hour (and he would not move it for the rest of the night). On our long and confusing journey, he would often ask us to slow down, or remark that he was unable to get a hold on which dimension his existence was in. We couldnt help, seeing as the only thing we could say was What are we doing?

	So we returned to our apartment again, and sat amidst the now wrinkled and sad confetti bits with our minds absolutely blown to bits. My mind was a blank slate, and I couldn't think of a damn thing to say. But  this whole trip was like a metaphor for life: starting off fun and playful (childhood), moved on to exploration of the world (teenage years), then violently thrust into a strange world, with no other options but wander around wondering what we were going to do next (adulthood), until we got tired and wrinkled and eventually fell asleep (death).

Overall, it was a cool experience, but I would have appreciated a bit more of a come-up, and the ability to reflect afterwards.

The setting was a very large psytrance festival in Europe. Nearly 30,000 brave souls had gathered for 5 days in a beautiful setting on the shores of a lake. The festival featured a huge psychedelic temple, fire dancers from four continents, amazing multi-story light shows and art instillations, lazers that bounced off the clouds, and a troupe of stilt walkers with extremely intricate costumes who I made friends with the very first night. For four days and nights I had been partying hard. In the previous 48 hours I had consumed mushrooms, LSD, peyote, MDMA, MDA, 2CI, 2Cb, 2CT7, 5-meo-DMT, and Ayahuasca (the Ayahuasca wasn't that strong, everything else was stronger than I had ever had). 

For the final night of the party I had decided to eat a ten strip of Albert Hofmann blotter that I had been saving. I remember dancing. I remember the lights. The sound of fire spinning around. The smell of the earth itself as thousands stomped the ground, raising a cloud of dust. At some point (I think it was around midnight) I asked a guy on the dance floor next to me if I could have a drink out of his water bottle. He told me to help myself, that it was in his bag that was sitting under the speaker next to us. I found it and took a very long hard swig, planning on refilling it for him at one of the water spigots that were set up. Just as I was about to finish chugging his water, he ran up and grabbed my arm, asking me 'does that water bottle have a black line drawn on it'? I looked at it and told him it did. This is when he began a low maniacal laugh that I will remember for the rest of my life. I asked with some trepidation what was in the bottle. His answer: 'Man, I hope you like LSD and speed!'

This in itself would have been fine, but the 10 strip was just kicking in, and I knew I was in for a bit of a ride. The next couple of hours were a bit of a blur. I remember trying to get a bottle of water at one of the bars and trying to jump over the bar. The guy running it was extremely patient with me. I think. Sometime later that evening I ended up sitting on a speaker box as the beat tore through me. BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM at 138 beats a minute was rattling my soul. The world was an infinite latticework of energy, my consciousness a tiny node on a psychedelic shimmering net that stretched from alpha to omega. Time and space itself were my playthings. I could look at some person dancing on the other side of the dance floor and with the mere will for it to be, I could see into their souls. It was too much to keep my eyes open, so I lowered my head into my lap and began to watch the light show inside.

It was at this point that my stilt walker friends must have seen me, sitting on a speaker with my head in my lap, rocking gently back and forth, and known EXACTLY what was going on. The came up to me and formed a semi-circle around me. With stilts on their hands and feet. In gorilla costumes. With grunting speaker boxes hidden on their chests.

I opened my eyes and looked up. Directly in front of me were a half a dozen gorillas grunting with great apparent concern for my wellbeing. Behind them were thousands of people dancing under a huge psychedelic temple to pounding music. One of these two things could not be happening. I had to make a choice.

After a few seconds my gestalt shifted. My world view changed. Finally, I realized what was going on. Clearly I was on drugs. I must have eaten something funny. My pack was concerned for me. Oh, did I mention that I must be a tripping gorilla who had hallucinated the entire human race? I got down of the speaker box and left the dance floor. I climbed the hill behind the temple to have a better vantage point, and for at least the next couple of hours I sat their, watching the dance floor pulsing, marveling at the ability of my ape brain to create such a complex hallucination as mankind. It wasn't until just before sunrise that my peak subsided, and I realized what had been going on. It was, to this day, the most intense trip and comedown I have ever experienced. I wouldn't trade it for the world.

The following is a recall of last Saturday.  Me and a friend did an experiment involving marijuana, LSD(acid), at Cedar Point.

7:30 a.m.

A vibration pounds on the side of my mattress, ripping me from my peaceful sleep. C calls and wakes me up.  Today is the day we do the adventure to Cedar Point on acid.

8:15-8:55

I get to D's house to pick up C and S.  S hands me a large bag of marijuana and gives me the box of blunts I forgot to take home the last night.  I understand without being told and split a blunt, empty the tobacco and refill it with marijuana. We then stop at the gas station to stock up on food (Doritos) and Drink (Dr. Pepper).  C steals S's spot in the front seat.


9:10-9:30

I have now been driving on the highway for about fifteen minutes.  Spencer pulls out the blunt I rolled earlier and we smoke it.  The blunt hits very harsh, there is more paper than marijuana and I'm slightly disappointed.  The blunt gets me pretty high nevertheless and the drive becomes much more enjoyable.  I even turn up the music and giggle a little bit.  I feel very excited and hopeful about the day that's about to happen.

10:00 - 10:50

In the past half hour we have gotten on a toll road and started to roll more blunts.  I decide that since I am driving I should let C roll the blunt because it's his weed and even though I've never really seen him roll a blunt, I figure he can do it because he rolls good joints.  The blunt he rolls is very odd looking and not very pleasant but it's definitely smokeable.  

I have my own weed and a very strong desire to have a good blunt available while at cedar point so I tell C to take the wheel and roll a very decent blunt that will hit good, stay tight, and even a nice little mouthpiece.  After we finish rolling the blunts we have a large open space to finish driving to ohio, about 40 minutes if I had to guess.  We have a bowl and marijuana but me and C agree that bowls will ruin the very nice blunt high we have going right now and decide not to smoke bowls until after the day is over.

11:00

We are about 15 miles away from our exit and the end of this terrible toll road.  This road makes you stop and get tickets then stop and pay money.  It confuses me and angers me as I've never been on a toll road before.  Since the driving portion is almost over me and C drop our acid.  He takes 2 and I take one because I'm driving.  S has no acid to take because he thought it would be a bad idea and took his the night before.

11:20  
T+00:20

We come to the toll road and the woman asks for $4.75.  I check to make sure she meant four dollars, then continue on towards cedar point, pissed off that I had to pay to drive.  Why do I have to pay money to pay attention, keep my car from going off the road, and not hit anything?  I think that I should be getting paid for doing it successfully.  The world doesn't make sense I decide.

11:45 
T+00:45

We have finally made it to cedar point and we are now waiting in line.  I can feel the beginning effects of the acid kick in.  S tells me that it took a long time for it to fully kick in for him, 90 minutes as he described it.  I don't believe him at the time, but I would soon find out he was right.	I see a man walking around and talking to random people and wanting to know whats going on I ask him what he's doing.  He tells me this crazy story which I couldn't follow and then offers me 2 tickets for 25 dollars each.  I think wow that sounds good, they are 42 at the gate.  	'Do they work' I ask him.

'Yea they should work' he states

Needing no further explanation Me and S buy the tickets.  I could tell that C was hoping he would get them and realizes he still has to pay 42 dollars.  His acid must be affecting him because he didn't give the man any money and he still tried to grab at the tickets. After walking in the gates C chews up the map and we are lost for the rest of the day.

12:20 p.m. 
T+01:20

We have now journeyed to the first ride of the day, the power tower, because of the small wait.  While standing in line I break two more hits of acid off the strip, giving one to C and taking one myself bringing my dose to 2 and his to 3.  I knew that it hadn't been an hour and a half and my acid hasn't even started really kicking in yet but I figure if it's taking this long it must not be very strong acid.

Standing in line is fine right now, killing time is easy by just talking to C and S and taking in the scenery.  I feel very happy and still excited about the day.  I remember saying	'I knew this was a good idea'.

12:30
(first hit)T+01:30
(second hit)T+T+00:10

Finally we are loading onto the ride.  The first hit of acid has gotten much stronger in the last ten minutes and as C begins to sit where I can't see him I protest and make him switch seats so that I'm sitting next to people I know.  We all take our shoes off and wait to be shot upward hundreds of feet.  It happens.  Going straight up that fast really confused me and I felt a huge adrenaline rush go through my body.  This felt different than anything I've ever done, but it filled me with happiness and energy and I ran from the ride sliding down the railing wanting to go ride more rides.  S was not tripping acid though and wanted to go to the beach to smoke one of the blunts that we rolled.  I couldn't argue that.

12:50
T+01:50
T+00:30

It has been a long walk ever since the power tower and we are just now passing the Corkscrew.  Exhausted and confused I tell S and C that we have to ride the corkscrew right now while the line is short.  The wait is perfectly fine with me still, just me hanging out with my friends, talking about stuff.  The ride is pretty fun, but nothing mind blowing.  The acid still isn't causing any obvious visuals, or audio distortions.  The acid is making me think different and enhancing my mood, but anything else was still very subtle.

1:00
T+02:00
T+00:40

The acid is getting stronger by the minute and I warmly accept it.  I am really completely fearless right now and willing to do anything.  We stamp our hands at the cedar point gate and walk along the sidewalk near the beach.  Suddenly I decide I want to be different from everyone else and jump the fence separating us from the sand.  I step back and with little warning run, jump, climb the fence, jump, and fall.  And fall.  Turns out there was a very big drop off from the sidewalk to the sand.  I collapse as soon as I hit the ground and roll onto my stomach. Luckily the sand doesn't hurt me and my friends follow.

After walking through the sand as far away from the park as we could get without getting wet, we light up the blunt and hope that a cop doesn't walk by.  People are everywhere and I kind of worry but I go for it anyways.  Maybe we can burry the blunt before anyone gets here and run for it.  Hitting the blunt makes me feel very different after the very first hit.  Everything seems so crazy all of the sudden.  I start telling my two friends how marijuana is such a big part of my life, even though they know that more than almost anyone.  I start to realize that ever since I took the acid I haven't felt the marijuana high very much at all, the acid was completely taking over the feelings of dumb happiness and making me think very rapidly.

Before taking my second hit I look over to the Lake.  (Or ocean I'm not really sure what it was, it was a large body of water).  The water goes all the way out to the horizon and merges with the blue sky, and I notice how incredible the clouds are.  I inform my friends that the clouds are moving, and I am just astounded.  I start walking towards the horizon, not knowing what it is I want to accomplish, only knowing that I want to be as close to this amazing spectacle as I can.  Before I step into the lake completely clothed my friends drag me back.  I turn to C and say guess what.  I hit the blunt and suddenly he remembers that were smoking a blunt in public and his eyes get very wide and he holds out his hand to take his turn.

1:30
T+02:30
T+01:10

After a while C becomes exhausted from walking through sand and sits down with the blunt.  S tells us that we are sitting right next to a path and we are only separated by the hill we are sitting behind.  The blunt is getting very small and I don't think it would be worth it to try to get C to stand up in his state of mind.  S walks off with the blunt and I chase him down and get it back.  I convince him to wait until we can get C up and we finish the blunt as C gathers his items and works his way to his feet.

1:40
T+02:40
T+01:20

I sit and gaze at my surroundings.  The acid has completely kicked in and I am tripping out of my mind.  I love the beach and want to continue sitting here for the rest of my life.  I stare at the seagulls and I see a small patch of land a little past the tide.  I run towards the water and jump landing right on the patch of land and scaring hundreds of seagulls away.  I'm sad that I scared so many lives away and negatively impacted them, but happy that I am completely surrounded by water.  It's a very peaceful feeling.  Suddenly S informs us that we have been at the beach too long and I begin to panic.  Do people know we're on drugs?  Is anyone going to tell on us?  Am I going to go to prison and be stuck in Ohio?  Terrible things start affecting my brain and the only thing I can do is ask S what we can do to fix everything.  He says we have to go back to the part and starts walking away from the beach.

'Wait!' I tell him 'I'm not ready to leave.'  S and C both leave and I am stuck either chasing them down or staying at the beach alone.  I chase down C and ask him why we have to leave.  S continues walking.  C gets confused and suddenly tells me that the sand shatters when you walk on it.  I look down and he was correct.  Every step we took caused the sand to create strange patterns all around us.  Seeing me have such a big impact just by walking was an incredible feeling and we started walking around very slowly watching the sand make patterns.

I realized that S was no longer with us and looked up to see if I saw him.  As soon as I looked up I saw the clouds and there were rainbows everywhere in the sky.  My vision was made up of a bunch of colored diamonds that were shrinking and enlarging rapidly.  I started to hear noises from people in the park.  I could hear everyone who was in about a quarter mile range and all the voices were echoed and distorted so I couldn't make out what they were saying but it started to scare me.  I begin to worry that this could be a bad trip.  I ask C if he wants to stay at the beach with me and he's confused and says we can't waste this trip by staying at the beach.  I agree for some reason and we make our way to the sidewalk.

Walking through the sand is now a very unpleasant feeling and suddenly I am seeing everything repeat itself in time.  I am watching myself do things that I have already done yet everything else continues on.  This worries me because I can't change my actions and everyone else can.  As suddenly as this wild feeling of deja vu kicked it, it suddenly left me as though it never happened.

Note:  I will do the best I can to remember the times of the following events, but at this point I was afraid to hold my phone because I thought I would break it so I stopped checking the time for about an hour.

1:55
T+02:55
T+01:35

Me and C have now made it back to the sidewalk and we sit down at a bench.  I am way messed up now and the acid is still getting more and more intense.  I wonder how C is doing because he took a hit more than me.  We decide that I should lead until we find S.  I try to call S and when I talk to him he sounds very confused and can't tell me where he is.  I hang up because I'm frustrated.  We try to call back and he doesn't pick up so we walk back into the park.

2:00
T+03:00
T+01:40

We are now wandering around completely helpless around Cedar Point hallucinating, disoriented, lost, and un-functional.  C suggests we ride a ride and I tell him we need to find S.  I try to explain that we just took someone from a different state and dropped him off at an amusement park.  C doesn't seem to grasp the idea and continues suggesting we just ride rides and don't worry about it.

2:30
T+03:30
T+02:10

I give up looking for S.  We walk into the entrance closest to us and get ready to ride a ride.  I walk through the metal thing that turns and get in line.  Suddenly I realize how long this line is and how long we have to wait.  I feel like everyone in line is staring at me.  I freak out and without saying a word to C I push about 6 people out of my way and squeeze through the metal thing and continue walking.  I realize a few people had shouted at me and suddenly consider the thought that other people have feelings too.  Up until this point I had completely forgotten the concept of the human being except for C and S.

2:40
T+03:40
T+02:20

I apologize to C for causing such an embarrassing scene.  It wasn't that I was afraid or anything, I just never considered the fact that other people wouldn't want to be pushed.  I could easily have stayed in line, I just didn't want to stay there that long with everyone staying with me, and it seemed perfectly logical to do what I wanted.  C asks where we are going and I say I don't know, maybe we should look for S.  He tells me that it's S's fault for getting lost and we should ride rides.  We see the corkscrew for the second time and I decide that this is the perfect opportunity to gauge how the acid effects the ride.

3:00
T+04:00
T+02:40

In what felt like hours of waiting (actually 20 minutes), Me and C finally made it to the front of the line.  A woman turned to me and asked if I wanted to go before her daughters so she could go at the same time as them.  This made me extremely happy and very thankful for the woman's kindness.  Minutes were taking eternities to pass and even knowing that we will get to ride a minute or two sooner than we would have originally was plenty to make me overwhelmingly happy.  After thanking the woman me and C stepped up to the gate where we waiting to be seated.  I noticed how the 3 men running the ride all had microphones and were talking to each other trying to crack jokes.  I noted how bizzare the human race is that we actually need to hire people to keep patrons entertained because the park is too boring otherwise.  This was a turning point in the trip and I started thinking about the people that own Cedar Point and how they are treating human beings like they don't have emotions or thoughts.

The man begins giving instructions after we are seated in the large metal contraption.  He says we have to fasten our seat belts and after fumbling around for a minute or two I finally figured it out.  C remained completely oblivious to all instructions.  A man came up to C and said please fasten your seat belt and pull on it.  C said nothing and continued staring forward in a stupor.  Confused the man just ignored C and cleared us to go.  C looks over me and says 'Oh, were we supposed to do something?'  

'Dude, think of how smart the guy who owns this place must be' I reply 'He convinces people from all over the world to pay money just to enter this giant park, then makes you wait in lines to be put into a quick ride.  People from all over the world.  Wow I just realized how insignificant we are compared to all of this.  Even if people do know we're on acid it's not going to matter because they all have better stuff to do than tell on us.'  I began seeing the world through other people's eyes and realize that in their eyes I am a nobody.  Suddenly my body is hurled up then I'm thrown into a loop.  The roller coaster seems to be moving extremely slow and all the sudden I just got really happy.  I start laughing uncontrollably.  The roller coaster does a corkscrew and while we are upside down I feel like I could just fly away.  The ride stops suddenly and I am very disappointed, wanting the ride to keep going.

We exit the ride and begin wandering around the park again.  At this point Spencer has called me multiple times but I stopped using my phone because I thought I would break it so it stays in my pocket.  The first thing I remember coming to as we left the corkscrew was a railroad with the gates down.  On both sides of the railroad tracks are huge packs of people, each wanting to go in the other direction.  As soon as the gates go up everyone pushes forward, me and C follow not wanting to stand out.  Everyone looks very sorry and hurried as we push through the bodies.  I see a woman pushing a stroller through the massive pack of people who looks very scared.  I feel sorry for her and want to stop pushing and just let everyone pass through me, but I know I will cause a scene if I do anything and just continue shoving.  This also pushed my trip in the wrong direction, making me feel like a terrible person, and making me hate Cedar Point even more.

3:30
T+4:30
T+3:10

At this point we are near familiar features such as the fountain and the arcade room.  C suggests we go play video games to try to calm our minds down.  Willing to believe anything to gain a bit of sanity I follow him in.  The instant I set foot in the arcade I knew it was a terrible idea.  Flashing colors were everywhere, and millions and millions of computerized sounds echoing off the walls, all merging together and creating one very strange and unpleasant hum.  I knew there were people in the arcade but I couldn't distinguish any bodies, I could just hear the voices echoing in my mind.  The first game that has a seat I plop down and stare at the screen in front of me.  I feel very awkward sitting inside the tiny car video game, but I feel that it's too late to change my mind.  I find quarters and put them in the machine.  C helps me start the game but soon he is playing a game of his own and I am left to figure out on my own.  I sit and stare like a retard until the game starts on its own.  I realize that I have to drive a car and press the pedal.  I'm moving but moving extremely slow.  The colors on the video game look extremely unrealistic and they start swaying and bubbling.  After about two minutes of staring like a retard I put the car into second gear.  I like going fast.  I start laughing very loudly but I can't stop playing the game because I haven't finished yet.  After about 10 minutes of me and C laughing hysterically playing a racing game we stumble out of the arcade and finally agree to look for S.

3:50
T+4:50
T+3:30

After sitting in one place for about 5 minutes (It seemed like hours, we even got up for almost a minute then remembered we were supposed to stay) S was able to locate us.  I'm happy we finally have found S and I ask him if he would like to ride some rides.  S seems disconnected from the world I'm in and I realize that communication is impossible.

4:20
T+5:20
T+4:00

Waiting in line for the 3d dissapator or something, suddenly I'm given new hope for Cedar Point.  I realize that we have already rode a few rides and done a lot of drugs.  I would rather have ridden more rides but maybe people will go home and we will have the park to ourselves I think.  Once we get inside the building waiting in line isn't such a chore anymore.  Before now, me and C were completely silent in the lines and just stared at each other to make sure if anyone was staring at us, at least we wouldn't be staring back because that's how I got myself into trouble on the ferris wheel.  The acid had me very paranoid and I had to gather myself each time before getting very close to people (like waiting in line).

The indoor section of the line was very dark lit and had a lot of bright colors and 3d effects everywhere.  It was very pleasant but my visuals had stopped and it was nothing too insane. After the line moved forward a bit there was a green substance splattered on the wall that appeared to be crawling.  I asked S if the green thing looked like it was moving around to him and a few people gave me sketchy looks.  I smiled to myself.

The ride itself was cool, but it was very dark lit and no strange visuals occurred.  The ride was fun, and probably scared me more than normal, but now the effects of the acid were mainly mental.

5:40
T+6:40
T+5:20

Me, S, and C have now all made our way back to the beach where we this time walk to a very secluded area to smoke another blunt.  After the 3d ride we got lockers and put our hoodies away.  At this point my jean pockets are extremely full and I am feeling very overwhelmed wanting to get my hoody back as soon as possible.  After smoking the blunt that C rolled earlier in the car I am unsatisfied and want a nice blunt to smoke.  C finds a new map lying in the sand and hands it to me in attempt to redeem himself for earlier.  I use the map as a tray and roll a blunt.  I then fold up the remaining pot inside the map, not realizing that I could have used it to find my way to rides. 	We smoke the second blunt and this time feel much more paranoid.  Many people are staring at us and this time I don't feel happy.  The sky is starting to get darker and a mood of sadness sets into the park.

6:40-7:00

We walk back from the beach to the park.  We instantly go back and get our hoodies because of the freezing temperature.  After wandering for over an hour I vow to get in the next line I see.  After I get in line I change my mind and jump over the railing and we continue walking.  We have now reached the exit and getting angry I shout 'I didn't come here to walk, I came to ride rides!'  S leads us to the demon drop.  Suddenly I have intense flashbacks to when I was 8 years old and here with my parents.  

Almost a decade ago,  I remember getting on the demon drop.  The demon drop is a ride where you are sat in a large steel box.  The steel box is raised a hundred feet or so into the air and then you do a bar guided free fall.  As the box reached the peak and started moving forward to begin the plunge I immediately freaked out and started screaming.  'Wait stop the ride I don't want to do this!' Instantly the ride dropped and I felt like my body was being split in two.  I came back a few years after that incident and rode the ride just to prove that I was a big boy.

Anyways now I was back, and I started describing my past life to C.  I have a very strange past life as I used to live in a different state and moved when I was 10.  I was always open minded, but I had a complete different personality for half of my life.  Anyways I could tell I was freaking C out by telling him this while he was on acid so I just stopped and waited in silence.  After being seated on the ride C tells me to put my feet against the steel in front of us.  The man running the ride comes over and tells us to keep our feet off of it.  I am instantly angered.  Does he think I'm going to break the steel box?  Does Cedar Point treat all of their customers like that?  Before I can  protest the ride begins and our box starts its ascent.  Not at all wanting to ride the ride I once again think of my 8 year old self.  As the box begins moving forward I feel exactly as I did 9 years ago and It feels like my body is being ripped apart as we drop from the giant metal tower.  After the ride my heart is pounding and  I feel very excited once again.

8:00
T+9:00
T+7:40

We have wondered around the park looking for rides with lines less than 2 hours long and have been completely unsuccessful.  Once we ended up going into a room filled with fog and no light.  There were strange people coming up to us and trying to scare us, and it was working.  After leaving that part of the park all I can do is complain that we had to walk through a ride.  Giving up we decide to leave the park.  Only problem is I'm still tripping and can't drive yet.  I know that I won't be sober in time for the park to close but I know that waiting an hour or two will help a lot.  Willing to do anything to kill time we wait in line for the ferris wheel.

8:30
T+9:30
T+8:10

We have boarded the ferris wheel and it is interesting gazing at the parking lot. It's crazy how this many people will all come to one place to wait in lines.  It feels like I've been at Cedar Point all my life and I'm ready to leave it behind forever.  I tell my friends my decision to never return to Cedar Point and C for the time being agrees.  I start explaining what my day has been like and C tells me we need to stop talking until the acid wears off.  We have been talking about everything for the entire day and it seems logical to take a break.  At the moment I can't even describe how my day went, and just accept the silence.

9:20
T+10:20
T+9:00

The day is finally over I tell myself as I sit down in my car.  C breaks out a bag of chips and a 2 liter of Dr. Pepper.  I completely forgot about them and I start laughing.  I'm having much more fun in my car than I had at cedar point the past couple hours.  S immediately passes out in the back seat.  He didn't sleep the night before because he was up doing the acid that we were supposed to do at Cedar Point.

9:40
T+10:40
T+9:20

I have not yet put the key in the ignition and C points this out.  'Oh I just wasn't going to drive until someone made me' I reply. 'Drive' commands C.  I drive.  Confused I tell C that its his job to tell me exactly when and where to turn for the entire drive back home.  With much difficulty and confusion we exit the Cedar Point Parking lot.  I have almost no visuals anymore and just have a strange head buzz that makes me feel somehow 'different' but not very messed up.

10:30
T+11:30
T+10:10

C asks me if I'm going to stop at a gas station soon.  I ask him why I would do that when he told me he didn't want to go to one. 'Oh I meant I did want to go to one' he replies.  I see a sign that says 'Last stop in ohio!' I tell C he's in luck. It's pretty large store for being a gas station on the side of the highway and I'm pretty impressed.  As soon as I walk in I see a coffee mug with a red bird and the word 'Ohio'.  I know that this cup has chosen me and I bring it to the checkout.  C orders a pizza and a Coffee.  I then order the coffee with the longest name and it turns out to be a delicious frappachino.

After receiving our merchandise we successfully drove home and went to J's place to sleep.  Arriving at about 1 in the morning we immediately tried going to sleep.  Me and C still had acid in our systems and stayed up playing Super Smash bros. Meelee  until 2 am when he passed out.  I didn't fall asleep until 4 am. The next day my legs felt like they had been run over.

Stuff of interest that I left out

The entire day C wanted to get food but every time we saw the line we changed our mind.  On acid we couldn't convince ourselves to spend that much time doing nothing.  We ate out of vending machines the entire day.

Me and C only separated once for about 5 seconds when he left me at a drinking fountain.  He told me that everyone started moving really fast when he couldn't find me.

Stay away from mirrors.  They mess with your head.

All in all I have to say that it was a good experience.   I would never do it again purely because standing around doing nothing is boring and being on acid makes it even more intensely boring.  This is definitely the hardest I have ever tripped in my life and it has possibly changed a few things about my thinking.  I don't think I would really recommend this trip for anyone, as if I would've freaked out at all I think I would have gone insane.  We really weren't expecting the acid to be any good so we really just dosed to fast, so if you think you could pull it off go for it, but be careful.  Give your acid plenty of time to kick in.

Anon acquired 5 hits of supposed lsd.

Abt. 9:30a.m.: Drop 1

Abt. 11a.m.: A not quite euphoric high begins to build, w/ slight anxiety

Abt. 12p.m.: Rising high stalls and almost disappears until 1p.m.

Abt.2p.m.: Heavy 'stoned' feeling sets in w/o usual psychedelic character. More a narcotic, opiate-like stoned, only slightly trippy. Not dysphoric but not esp. 'happy' and lightheaded like LSD is (for anon.).

Abt. 3 p.m.: Peak. Kind of an LSA/alcohol type inebriation, w/o LSA nausea. Neither deeply meditative or fun, rather boring really. No visuals aside from subtle color variations and waving (but not exactly) effect on objects.

3-5 p.m.: Pretty even plateau. Gradual drop off until sometime after 12 a.m. Slept poorly. 

Conclusion: CERTAINLY not LSD. A wild guess it was some RC, a phen maybe, tho. based on reading only, anon has no exp. aside from mesc. The blotter was unperforated and an off white color...anon pitched remaining blotter.

This/Last (today is Sunday that I am typing this) Friday I had the fun experience of trying acid once again. I was hanging out with my usual friends, and my parents were out of town for the entire weekend so I had planned to have a small group of friends come over and smoke pot, snort cocaine, and drink. Well I got news that we could get acid, a guy had 20 hits of blotter paper, so we went out and bought the entire sheet. I bought 2 hits of acid for 10$. I was kind of had a pessimistic outlook on it, because I had been ripped off before. But this acid was real, *very* real. I am very glad that I had not started out with 4 hits, as that would have been way to much for me - even 2 hits was a very visual, intense trip. Here's how it went.

At around 9:30 I took the acid, left it on my tongue for a while, flipped sides, then eventually chewed it up and swallowed it. All my other friends took the acid at various times. All of them took 2 hits, except one person who took 6 hits (a more experienced tripper). When we got to my house, I just got ready to trip. I turned on my black light, and put on some Pink Floyd. 30 minutes or so later, after smoking a joint outside, things started to happen. I went inside and looked on my computer screen, my desktop picture (of the moon, starts, and nebula) was moving - as if it was a screensaver. It seemed as if the picture had different 'layers' to it, and each layer was moving a different way. The sun in the picture made me squint, even though it was not real - as if the picture was real!

Things started getting crazier and crazier every minute. We experienced some confusion as to what was going on since everybody in my house was tripping - rather funny, we could not stop laughing not matter what we did. A little ways later, I went into my room alone when everybody else was in the living room, laid down in my dark lighted room with Pink Floyd playing and stared at my scenic pictures on the wall. All of a sudden everything round the pictures disappeared and turned into black space, and the pictures seem to be '3D'. The frames of the pictures turned into fluorescent rainbow colors, and seemed to stick out, as if I could touch the back of the pictures on the wall. Truly an amazing sight. For no apparent reason I started laughing out loud, in my room, alone. The music sounded *amazing*, Pink Floyd was truly made for tripping. Totally euphoric.

I then went to talk to my other friends. The guy who took 6 hits was totally out of it. He was going nuts, in a good way. All the wall paper on my walls, and just about every surface was either breathing or moving in some sort of weird way. We were outside for a bit when it started raining, and that felt very good. I could go on countless hours about the visuals I saw, which were so amazing, but I won't. I called a sober friend of mine, just to see what she would sound like while I am tripping. That kind of kept me in a 'peaceful' state of mind since I knew that everything was not going crazy, and that I will still come down when it is over which kept me in a good mood. She stayed on the phone for nearly 4 hours with me, listening to me babble on, even putting the phone down for 20 minutes straight at 3:00 in the morning! That is truly a good friend, as I know I was probably scaring her with everything I said, but she enjoyed talking to me while I was tripping and I did too.

I peaked and did some just plain weird things. I hid in my closet with the lights off for no apparent reason, then scared the living shit out of one of my friends who walked into my room alone when I jumped out, he screamed and nearly freaked out. Later, after we came down a little bit, me and a friend went outside and wrote 'trip' in shaving cream on a friends wind shield just to do something. The trip was amazing, highly visual, and euphoric - but the next day was horrible. I felt like I was 'out of it' the entire day. Probably because I got no sleep, and smoked a bunch of pot all throughout the next day. I was afraid to even talk to my parents on the phone because I would stumble on every word, but alas everything turned out fine when I woke up Sunday at a friends house and was totally fine and feeling good. I would repeat that any time, just maybe during the day next time, a little earlier, so I will be down at night time and be able to sleep at my normal weekend sleeping times so I would wake up in the morning actually feeling normal enough to talk to authority if I needed to.

It was my first LSD trip in a year. I had two sugarcubes, each one imbibed with two drops of some reportedly strong liquid LSD. My plan: to take them in my mom and stepdad's apartment while they were at work and be coming down by the time they got home.

I woke up at 11:00 AM on a Saturday. Got up, got dressed, meditated for about a half hour, turned down the lights, burned some incense and candles to set a contemplative mood. Finally, I crunched the cubes down and put on some music: The Grateful Dead's 'Infared Roses'.

About a half hour later I could feel the acid coming on. I decided to put on some more uptempo music so I popped in 'Demetertainment', a Twisted Records psytrance compilation. Beast - 'Spawn' was sounding a might fucking nice! ;) The acid was coming on and I kept repeating to myself: 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - 'Mr. Mojo Risin' - as I felt my mindstate elevating.

The music was playing and I was grooving around my living room and noticing that this was indeed some strong LSD. Mind manifesting indeed! I felt like I was walking around in my mind. I felt some kind of weird aura around my body, maybe just a heightened awareness of the somatic energies in my body. I don't know but I felt something.

I started looking at some Sandman comic book called 'Dream Hunters' and was marvelling at this Japanese artist's watercolor/hand-drawn art in it and then I turned on my laptop and started playing around with that Fractint program for a bit (the whole trip I was seeing MAD fractals every time I closed my eyes. Fractal OD!) I started reading some stuff I'd written that was on my computer and was disappointed I hadn't finished one of my longer poems, but reading it was fun because I didn't remember any of it. It was as if someone else had  written it and I was reading it for the first time. Shortly after this I had a phrase come into my head.....my quote of the day: 'The universe loves AHA's!'

I then started to look at some of the art my friend had done on this comic book project we were collaborating on and it looked amazing in my heightened state and I started wondering why the fuck we aren't rich bastards yet so I decided to page him to urge him to get to work, but his pager number had changed and I kept getting the wrong number. I called his house and his dad told me he'd moved out (he just got a new apartment) but he didn't have his new phone number yet, he did, however, give me a new pager number....but I wrote it down wrong!!! I just kept getting wrong number tones. It was imperative that I talked to my friend at this point. I took it as a bad omen that I couldn't page him or talk to him.

I had planned on not leaving the apartment because I have some annoyingly nosey neighbors in my apartment complex which made me nervous, but I had to go outside to see what it looked like. It was a beautiful day, sunshiny with not a cloud in the sky. I saw my landlord J*** and decided to say hi to him (I was on the 3rd floor balcony and he was down in this little courtyard on the ground floor cleaning a barbeque grill) I said hello, but he didn't hear me. I kept saying hello but he still didn't hear me (he's an old guy) and for some reason I thought something might be wrong with him the way he was standing there so I thought I'd go down and talk to him to see if he was okay. There goes my plan of not leaving my apartment.

So, I go down and there's my landlord and I say 'Hi there, nice day isn't it?' and he gives me this little elderly grin and a nod and says 'Oh yeah, 80 degrees, perfect day.' Very, very prophetic words, I felt. We both looked up into the sky, admiring the day. It was a moment. So, anyways, there I was talking to the landlord tripping balls on acid and I realized I was still holding the cordless phone from when I was trying to page my friend, which must have made me look weird. I then walked out to the front of my apartments (it is a gated apartment complex with one entrance in the front) and I went outside the gate (another violation of my plan to not leave my apartment, an unwise move) and I went and sat down on the steps in the front and just was checking out the trees and plants and stuff. I tried to go back in and realized I had Forgotten My Key! D'oh! I was locked out. I tried to go around but, being as it was a gated community, there was no way inside. I tried to get the attention of the landlord but he had left the courtyard. I saw a guy walk past me on the sidewalk and he looked sinister...I thought he was evil for some reason, but didn't really feel threatened by him, I just got bad vibes. He looked at me oddly and I just said hello and gave what, to him, must have been a weird looking smile. I was still holding the cordless phone, I noticed, so I put it in my pocket (I have big pockets.)

Finally, one of my neighbors let me back in the gate and I went in my apartment once more. I was glad to be back. I wasn't going to leave again. It was a bad idea in the first place, especially since I was alone. I put on some music, this time a progressive trance mixtape by a DJ named Brad called 'Mother Earth Sound System' (very good trip music I would say.) I kept getting these dehydration type feelings so I drank a big glass of water and felt good instantly. Every cell in my body celebrating my ingestion of good old H2O.

This is when my trip started to get weird. I was laying on my sofa and just zoning out. Zonked, if you will. I still haven't sorted out everything I was thinking but it had something to do with how every machination of my consciousness was a lie somehow and that at every thought, and impulse of thought, I was leading myself astray from my 'normal reality'. I was being given 'messages' in my head that everything is infinite and every thing is connected to it's opposite and that everything WAS it's opposite because everything taken to it's extreme had the potential to become it's opposite, which, in hindsight, was some pretty basic yin-yang type stuff.

Time was totally out of whack. I did an experiment to see how long it felt like a minute passed and I looked the clock and counted to 60 and it seemed like I was counting forever. I kept getting these weird linguistic babblings in my head (I always experience this on upper doses of LSD and it actually kind of bugs me) it's like unpronounceable sentences revolving in my brain. I figured it was some kind of distortion in the way my brain was processing language so I took the time to say the alphabet a few times to make sure I still had my language faculties. I did! Whew! No brain damage for me! (?)

I started zoning out some more and just felt totally weird. I was thinking some very far out shit like, because I was thinking certain ways and certain things (things I can't exactly remember), the day would not end. Night would never come and it would be perpetual day forever. Time lagged on and seemed to reaffirm this notion. I somehow managed to remember that my mom and step-dad were supposed to be coming home and if they DIDN'T come home as expected and day DIDN'T end, then I would have something to worry about...until then I would just not worry about it. I also was thinking about some of my family members and all the dysfunction in my family and how I was seemingly trapped in the karmic cycles of my upbringing. For me to explain this I would have to tell my whole family history, which I'm not going to do.

Eventually, my parents did come home and I felt better about that and I just sat on the couch watching TV like a cosmic retard, trying not to look like I was on drugs, just being low key and quiet. Eventually, they both left to go do some other stuff and I was alone again, but by then I was feeling a bit more 'normal'. I was trying to remember all the stuff I was thinking about just hours before. I felt like I'd lived a whole lifetime in one afternoon. I felt energized. Shakti/Chi/Energy was coursing through my body. Moving around was effortless. I felt like I was floating. My pupils were huge and I went outside and looked at the sun going down and the moon becoming visible. My mind roared silently. Libra moon. Glorious. 

After a while a friend came over to my house and we went out to eat and I told him about my trip. All in all, it was a pretty intense experience.

So my experience begins on a cold New England night.  The sky is clear and the stars are shining brightly.  It's about 8:30pm when I decide that I should take the remaining acid from a 10 strip I bought a while back.  I was alone in my home, parents had gone away and my brother had wondered off to who knows where.  I felt that being alone for a trip could be a growing experience for me, since almost all my previous psychedelic experiences involved fairly large numbers of people being around.  My intension for this trip was to explore myself, my mind.  

So I slip the blotter onto my tongue, with that pre-trip tension in my stomach.  Then I go downstairs to my living room, and pop on the TV.  It's about 45 minutes later I notice the first effects.  The windows in the room had white lacy curtains with flower designs.  These flowers began to swirl majestically, while the curtains swayed in the acid breeze.  Then I looked at my couch, it was divided up into perfectly symmetrical squares that were all rotating counter-clockwise.  So I thought, 'well here I go'.  I only watched TV for another 10-15 minutes before I decided I should go to my room, throw on some music, turn the lights off, and lay in bed.  

I chose the new Tool album Lateralus as the soundtrack to my journey, and this suited the trip fine.  The album flew by, its almost a full 80 minutes long, but for some reason it went by very quickly.  So instead of time slowing like it should it went much faster at least for that 80 minutes.  But during that time I saw some of the most beautiful CEV's that I could ever have imagined.  The only one I remember vividly was what appeared to be some sort of a fish creature, that had no real head, and its whole body swayed through the liquid colors.  Around this time I began to think about my life.  I came to many conclusions about what I should do and where I should direct my life.  I also figured out what I percieved God really is, but I won't go into that.  I don't want to rant on about things that I think are nearly impossible to explain.  If anyone knows the album I was listening too, the last track 'Faaip De Oiad' is a creepy phone message from a man talking about aliens with loud jarring music.  When this came on I felt an incredible fear rush throughout my body, but it went away as soon as the song ended.  

After the cd was over, again it went by so quickly, I turned the lights in my room on.  My god I was tripping hard.  Everything was divided into symmetrical shapes, and were spinning wildly.  A poster on my wall, a print of a Alex Grey painting 'Praying', was very cool.  The persons veins in the painting were pulsing, the person seemed to be living. I then put on a Sonic Youth cd, listened to one song, got a jacket on and went outside.  I layed down inthe grass facing the sky.  The stars were absolutely stunning.  They were sparkling, and each star would change color frequently.  And if I focused I could make the sky become symmetric, divided into 3 sections.  I spent quite a while out there.  But when I came back to my room...the same song was playing on my cd player.  I guess the cd was on repeat, but that totally shocked me at the time.  I thought that I had walked outside, layed down and got back up, all in the span of a few notes.

The next few hours are pretty hazy, I know I watched some TV.  And I also know I felt no need to explore my mind anymore then I already had that night.  I felt I had all the answers I would ever need.

The trip really did change the way that I actually thought for a a few weeks.  It is hard to explain, but the way I thought was actually transformed.  The biggest effect was that nothing petty even fazed me.  I never felt like arguing about anything with anyone for any reason, that all felt below me.  But I noticed that that effect wore off over time, and I feel like my old self.  I don't know if thats good or bad though.

Overall this was a great experience, not my first, and definately not my last experience with this powerful drug.

Kid A and I decided to finish off our vial. Initially I was hesitant. That vial was supposed to last the whole summer, and was already half gone. But he gave an extremely convincing argument. Let's just do it all now, and go completely insane, it'll be so cool! I had to agree with him. It was going to be the greatest trip ever. 

So late that night, I took roughly 30-40 hits as did Kid A. I have yet to meet someone in person who has done this much! 

My visuals were simply amazing. Nothing has come even close to them. I was flipping through my Dali book, when suddenly, Dali's artwork seemed to take over my visuals. I ran to the bathroom, and in the mirror, my reflection was still my face, but it was my face painted just like Dali's own self-portrait in the book. Incredible. The whole world seemed to enter Dali's surrealistic fantasy. I was lost within the visuals and seemed to be consumed by them. I began conjuring up different images, and they seemed to flow from my mind in intricate, detailed patterns. 

Suddenly there was a noise. Kid A told me to shut up. I thought it was from within my house and turned off the lights, in case my parents were up. He told me to stop moving around...the sound was coming from outside. I didn't believe him, but within a few minutes I heard what he was talking about. It was coming from outside. 

Terror struck deep within me. What other-worldly entity could be stalking my friend and I? Had we accidentally opened a portal with our insanely huge dose of LSD? My initial response to this terror was to turn back on the lights. I needed to be able to see what was going on outside. WHAT WAS THERE?! 

As I got up to turn on the lights Kid A screamed, 'NO! That is a BAD idea!'. And suddenly I saw the incredible error that I was about to make and the horror that would be brought upon us. I inherently knew that if I were to turn on the lights the whole world surrounding me would dissolve into a primordial ooze. It would be lost and all that would remain would be a clear light with my soul being lost within its power forever. I knew that all would be lost, and I would be alone. I felt that LSD had created a cosmic hole in my head, and the entire universe would be sucked into it leaving me completely alone. 

Kid A and I lay in our separate beds, scarcely breathing. Both of our hearts racing, Kid A countlessly uttered, 'I'm tripping so hard, oh my god, this is really scary'. I too was feeling the intense effects surrounding me. My mind was awash in visuals. I was struggling to discern what was real around me, and was extremely grateful for having Kid A there. He helped ground me, and allowed me comfort in that I wouldn't be lost in this psychic journey. 

Slowly the terrifying presence seemed to take less of a hold on us, and actually became a little humorous. We decided to blast some Jimi Hendrix out my window. His righteous wailings on the guitar would surely scare the evil force that was residing on my front lawn. And it did. The intensity subsided quite a bit after this. But I don't exactly know when Kid A and I stopped tripping. We definitely had residual effects for the rest of the summer. Thinking back on it, I believe that I had tripped my way into an oblivious transcendent state. I felt enlightened, and appreciative of my life and my surroundings. What ensued after our crazy summer was perhaps the most productive and happy times of my life. I truly felt that life was beautiful, and every moment was to be treasured.  I was truly aware and happy. 

A note on this trip. At no time was this trip actually scary. I mean it was, but it was also incredible. It was extremely enjoyable. I loved each second of insane terror that was induced. It was almost too much to comprehend. I never thought that I could feel anything to this extent, and being able to almost brought tears to my eyes. It was a trip that reminded me that life is beautiful. Beauty is within everything. Don't believe me, just look at a tree for a minute. You'll find it and wonder how you could ever miss it. 

oh yeah, and the noise, it was a raccoon.

This is a first time dream of LSD.  One microdot (approximately 5mg in total weight) was imagined sublingually at about 5 minutes before 1am, at an underground (literally and figuratively) rave event, the microdot having been acquired some days before.

A few minutes later, the DJ is spinning a track, 'Being on LSD is like sailing Mt. Everest...' or something similar.  Very interesting synchronicity, but I that seems par for the course with any psychedelic material.

After an hour, nothing is happening yet, and various people with experience of these dots have been saying that they are not very strong and require multiple dosing.

About 2:20, I'm not sure I'm feeling anything at all even now, maybe it's threshhold and I can't tell because of all the stimulus around me.  Anyhow, another microdot is chewed, dissolved in my mouth and swallowed.  No real taste to speak of.

Maybe a half hour passes and I think I'm definitely off-baseline now, but this is very different from any tryptamine or phenethylamine psychedelic I've previously imagined.  I am talking to people and notice I've started to become brutally honest.  My coordination seems to be somewhat impaired.

From here, the effects continued to grow, and by another half hour I was definitely sure of the action in my system. This material was completely clear and free of seeming mental warp, but my attention is extremely focused and my ability to think about things without reservation or mental strain is enormously enhanced.  In this, the effects for me are similar to MDMA but without the empathetic aspect.  To the contrary, I have become extremely analytical and critical, without much emotional feeling at all.  I realize I need to be very careful not to hurt people's feelings with my brutal honesty right now, because I know I would not want to do so in other contexts, and I have to make an allowance for my present state of mind.

A bit later, I run into a girl I know, and my normal shyness being absent I tell her I think she's really cute.  She's with some other guy tonight, but I get her phone number, anyhow.  I find some other people I know in order to make sure I can get a ride home later.  I spend the next few hours, walking, contemplating, talking to various friends and strangers at the party, staying very clear and comfortable throughout.

About 6am my ride is leaving the party, I'm still up, but I have to say that nobody would likely be able to tell at all if I didn't say something about it.  I am at least as coherent as normal, and probably moreso, there's probably some eye dilation going on but it's still dark anyhow.  I have some interesting geometic closed eye visuals.

7:30 or so we stop for breakfast, and meet some others of my friends.  I give them my brief bioassay report, that I think the dots are probably a low dose of LSD and not LSA as some others had suggested they might be, as I've tried LSA before and it was more sedating and less clear.  I guess this might be 50ug or less of acid per dot, though.

9am, I'm home.  Wonder if I can sleep.  Amazingly enough, by 10am, I do.  I can't sleep on most any other psychedelic material I've imagined.  I wake up about 3pm, and seem not to want to sleep more, but I think I'm down now.  Some visual focus issues persist, and continue an hour later as I am now writing this, perhaps my eyes are still a bit dilated.

Note on pain relief: As I've written in previous reports, I have tried various materials for their pain relieving benefits, this one seems to work very well indeed, but I've had a few small twinges that suggest it may not persist more than a day or two. Obviously it is premature to judge that, and many substances have a strongly dose-dependent benefit.  For example, 5-MeO-DiPT at levels below about 14mg doesn't help me much, but at 16mg provided dramatic relief for at least a week.

I fully intend to find some more of these and try them in a larger dose sometime.  I'd also like to combine them with MDMA to see how they interact with regard to the enhancing qualities of both materials, and perhaps with preservation of emotional effect.

about 3 days ago my younger brother ken, dad, and i traveled to a concert where the dead were playing with willy nelson. when my dad told me about it, the one thing i was thinking about was if we could find any lsd... we were walking through the parking lot to the concert (which was just a giant grass field) it was about 85 degrees out and everybody was walking through rows of cars looking for anybody with the drug of their choice. at about noon, i was walking with my brother between rows of cars and many, many tiedye shirts and i saw a very pretty girl with colorful tatoos on her  mesh fabric and fairy wings comming out of her back walk by dotting the tip of her toungue with her index finger. 'ken, look its the acid faerie!' i whispered to my brother and turned around to follow her.

we bought about five doses of lsd off of the girl and took it at about 2:00 in the parking lot. the concert started at an old field near our parking field at 3:30 and my brother and i had just started feeling the one hit each of lsd in the form of a subtle visual clarity and warm buzzing feeling in the emotional column of our body and spreading throughout. we walked through the crowd of tiedye, dreadlocks, and smileing flowing people right up to about 15 feet of the stage. the ancient smile of willie nelson filled my whole existence as i watched him play and sing along side of phil lesh of the dead and i smiled with the most emense understanding and colorful love i had ever expirenced. the towers of speakers on the sides of the stage were spilling out a music that felt like it had been poured over my brother and i in a thick atmospheric wave of color, sound and emotion. i looked away from the stage after having totally suberged myself in something that clearly seemed to me to be deeper than any one persons life. as i looked through the crowd around me, it didnt seem tightly crowded...it was more as if all of the space had been taken up, yet there was no tension. noone pushed into anyone else, they just seemed to flow around each other in a way that was closer to a liquid than i had ever seen a group of about 100,000 humans act. in my mind, these people were beginning to encompass a visualization such as the spiecies of tree that connect their roots underground...but at ground level, just seem to be completely different organisms. there was almost no need for anyone to speak. there was a communication on a unanymous level that even someone at a complete outside perspective could sense strongly. at about 6:00 i averted my attention down to the ground. where the grass had been trampled by thousands of people the straw laying over the dirt began to move and mosaic into a beautiful pattern that seemed symetrical yet creative on every level of my being as i absorbed myself in its magnificence. my conciousness moved like an observer come to life, and when something interesting caught my attention, the observer followed it as if it was being tangibly pulled in that direction. and so a buzzing distraction in my mind demanded attention. i quickly realized that it was just part of me that wanted to see the sky. so i looked up out of my developing ground world through the layer of liquid people and straight out into the heavens. it was about 8:00 by now and the sun was setting in an intensly vibrant shapeshifting view that seemed to open my soul until i could feel one with the universe. i could feel...as if tangibly...that my senses were diffusing into one another and that my whole inner universe and body was diffusing into the whole of the outer universe. i began thinking about what my old line of pereseptions felt like. i had almost forgot id lived my whole life in a systmatic, 'normal' world and felt sad. 'i cannot beleive i couldnt grasp that this world even existed before now.' (at this point, the concept of 'now' felt actually quite alien to the truth) as i began to fold back to earth i asked my brother with a grin on my face, if he could stop smiling. we both stood still and twisted our lips superficially to try and frown then burst out in laughter not 3 seconds later. a little while later, my soul diffused into the music again.

by about 1:00 in the morning, as willy nelson and the dead bowed to the giant cheering sea of color, people, and the sweet musk of hashish that filled the air, i breathed out a sigh and my chest seemed to collapse back in forever, as if the whole experience was one breath of holy understanding. i guess the theme that seemed to umbrella the entirity of the trip was that understanding in itself has lead directly to the thing being understood, and if there is any other inhibitive emotion, then there is something left to be grasped. i thought this right at the end of the concert when walked away aching with pleasure as id been standing for about 13 hours strait and my face hurt from smiling for so long!

This experience happened quite a while back. It was by no means my first or last experience with acid, but hopefully it conveys some of the reasons why it is my favorite drug.  Enjoy.

My boy E had just returned from a trip with an entire fifth gallon of liquid.  It was yet undiluted, and he graciously gave me 10 drops of it, equally distributed onto 5 space treats.  Although it was already past midnight, we glanced mischieviously at each other and knew it was time to ride.  We quickly got my girlfriend H to agree to the mission, and for the fourth traveler, we phoned my friend B.  We told him to go back to sleep and await further instructions from us in person.  E, H, and I hopped in my ride and took a 15min ride out to the country.

At 2am, we awoke B, who lives next door to one other house.  It was a cold, winter night and we shuffled indoors to stay warm.  Once indoors, B greeted us with some organic tea.  We lit candles and made ourselves comfortable with some Dj Cam.  We each took just 2 hits (later to become an inside joke), and centered ourselves for what was to become the energetic apheleon of our lives.

Although lsd usually takes an hour to come on strongly with me, I was beginning to get serious teeth chatter and body shaking within 15 minutes.  The tea made me have to piss, and when I stood up from the circle I tried to walk down the hall to the bathroom.  Already quite confused, I stumbled in the hallway and landed on B's bed (fortunately).  My friends were very concerned about the noise, but I assured them that I was OK as I burst into nervous laughter.

In the bathroom, the lights were out but just enough candle light came in for me to make out the fixtures.  Within seconds, my mind was tricked into thinking that the walls and doors had become some sort of 'ice'.  I started thinking of how get out, but then figured out where the door was and proceeded back down the hall to rejoin the group.  The group I came back to had been rapidly accelerating as well.  We joked about how crazy this was already becoming within 20 minutes of ingestion.  Little did we know.  The next hour or so are pretty vague in my memory.  First of all, an ice storm began to rage outside (literally).  We were marvelling at how the weather was mimicking our mental meteorology.  All of a sudden, the power went out.

We weren't too upset about the light because we were already on candle power, but the music went and the heat went almost as quickly.  This led to some confused negotiations about leaving or staying B's tiny and cold house.  We were pacing about the place, and in and out of the front door.  No one had any destination or idea what was happening.  B suggested we sit in his pathfinder to warm up for a moment.  We all piled in and the heat felt good.  While seated in the back with H, I was being taken down a tunnel into darkness at high velocity.  It looked as though I was levitating and flying over infinite rows of seats in a theatre with a luminous screen.  There was no sense of actual body.  When I tried to realize sensations, for example my hand, then I would trap a very vague concept of hand along with some mixed signals of whether or not I could feel my own.  The visuals were extremely intense and there was definitely some concern from B as to how to handle it, as he had never gone so hard or deep before.  Colors were literally pouring out of molecules of thin air and vaporizing into fractals of tangible reality.  There was very little difference between eyes closed and open because it was all becoming one concept.

B's confusion became sort of pathological and he wanted it all to end immediately.  E and I, the most experienced out of the Four tried to calm his fears despite our own dealings.  He got paranoid that the neighbors would hear us going in and out, and that the music was too loud (remember, the power was out).  In an effort to make it all stop, B told us to leave, as if he could just go back to sleep and pretend we never showed up with the liquid launch pad.  He literally locked us out, and we heard him rummaging around inside.  We tried to convince him to let us back in and that his idea wasn't going to work, but he wouldn't listen.  E, H, and I had no choice but to drive home.  Woah.

Now some people might get concerned that three travelers in our state of mind would take to the road in an ice storm.  H and I seriously questioned whether this was even conceivable, but E assured us that he had it as long as I could back out of B's long, steep driveway.  My black car loomed before us like a dragon, huddled together against the cold.  It breathed and swaths of paisley camoflauge spun off its back.  We got in and began to leave.  E took over the controls once on the road and I in shotgun.  We pumped the drum and bass on my system and let the heat flow.  The experience of moving at high velocity was breath-taking in our heightened state.  Everything visual and tactile was so warped.  Suddenly, H grabbed my shoulder from the back seat and squeezed the hell out of my arm.  With great fear in her voice, she told me she was falling into nothingness.  I tried to calm her down and told her that we would take care of her, but she was really on her own.  Her energy spun me for a loop and I could no longer tell where we were.  I thought seriously how crazy it was getting in B's house, but didn't understand anymore that we were in my car.  E had his shit on lockdown though, cuz we were all of a sudden in my parking lot.  Scared H wanted my keys to get in the house, and I sat back to see if she could figure out how to get in.  She almost started crying but I ran up to show her how to use them.  She looked at me like I was some sort of magician.  

Indoors and with power on, we continued to experience massive amounts of spacetime distortion.  While talking to H in one room, I explained how strange it was upstairs and she told me I hadn't been up there yet.  I started to geek out at how confusing it was on this unprecedented level of tryptamine infusion.  We couldn't decide on what was really happening, so at some point we just chose to surrender to the hyperreal vortex of particles and energy.  My sober roommate awoke to have us turn down the music.  We just started laughing at how he floated in and out of the universe we created.  Until we saw him, no one had even considered the possibility that there were others in this place who weren't experiencing the same thing.  In my mind, there was absolutely no concept of sobriety left, and all sense of ego was dissolved.

We went to my room to sit and enjoy the ride.  H dissolved into the bed and didn't move for the longest time.  E and I just looked around the room and felt.  My room, lights on, was transformed into a 4 walled patio with a perfectly clear and starry night sky overhead.  Don't ask how, it just was.  B called my house and said that he had calmed down and wanted some company again.  We told him to ride on over if he felt comfortable driving.  He was down and 20 minutes later was at the door.  Upstairs we all synthesized some incredible energy flow and transfer.  H finally snapped back into our consciousness with a big smile on her face.  She said she had gotten lost in the bed, but was glad to be back.  The positivity we felt after getting through the first few hours was incredible.  For an hour in that room, we just sat in silence and looked around.  It was the surface of an alien planet in a time when none of us existed.  The speed and variation of the visuals was sooooo intense.  One thing I remarked about using lsd of this concentration is that the crystalline structure of my visual field was composed mostly of large pieces.  This is one reason why it made it so difficult to discern what the physical world was.  LSD of a lesser concentration seems to appear as smaller particles which allow one to see what objects are versus space.  

After what seemed like eons, we realized dawn was breaking outside and we wanted to go for a stroll.  Up we walked on the slick street behind my house.  The trees were totally encased in ice down to the last twig.  The sun reflecting through this giant prism was unforgettable and amazingly beautiful.  All of a sudden, we heard a loud 'crack', and an enormous tree (70' oak) fell across the street right behind us in slow motion.  The noise and sight were unbelieveable, drugs or no drugs!  We were so awe-struck, that we questioned whether it had really happened or not.  After a minute of playing on the tree, we chose for it to be real.  It entirely blocked the street and narrowly missed crushing two parked cars.  We continued walking.  Sometimes I felt too conspicuous to be outdoors whilst blowing up so hard.  I thought that I was throwing up my insides and turning back out in a continuous cycle of mental v physical awareness.  It proceeded like a hollow, flexible and crystalline cylinder at light speed through the universe...continuously rolling and sliding in impossibly complex patterns, such was my consciousness.  The meditation was intense and beautiful.

Later in the morning, we tried to eat at a restaurant.  My buckwheat pancakes were more interesting to look at then to eat.  They tasted like air, but were hard to swallow.  On the surface of each blue-violet circle I could see new worlds forming and dissipating.  I remembered reading about how it would look if you peered out of a black hole into which you were falling.  Before the event horizon, you would see galaxies' birth and death in firework-like speed and splendor.  E, being the old master that he is, ate my breakfast as well as his own.  After another hour or so of kickin it back home we all split up.  H and I showered together and then hit the bed.  E and B flew away for the time being.  In bed, we made love with pure and energetic spheres of radiance around us.  The soft one and I drifted off into a light sleep with surprisingly little resistance, exhausted and clean.

I awoke around 3pm with a start after a 4 hour nap.  The visuals were still very noticeable although nowhere near as intense as the peak hours of madness.  I had an overwhelming feeling of calm and purity to the point where I cried lightly a few times.  We just kicked it inside my lovely little apartment smoking high-grade herb and snacking on real foods to replenish ourselves.  E and B later came over to revel in the afterglory.  It taught all of us alot about ourselves and brought us even closer together as friends.  Throughout the previous night and forever afterward, we would ask E how many hits he actually put on our space treats.  With his mischievous smile he would reply 'just 2'.  Later he would ask us, 'just 2?', and then laugh his ass off.

I recommend taking smaller, known doses for the uninitiated.  For the experienced traveler...well, sometimes you just see where or when the path leads you.  Overall, it lasted for ~20hrs before totally leaving us, thus the day after was still very interesting.  That night of the ice storm is called 'lsd death night' by H and B, but E and I call it 'automatic ice'.  It took me to the edge of sanity for a long time.  I loved the person that I found there, and we emerged together with a profound love for life and the Earth.  The harmony of existence is infinite.  Here is something that made me cry the next day in light of the experience, I hope you enjoy it as I did:

A heavy snowfall disappears into
the sea.  What silence!  Knock on the
sky and listen to the sound.

The beginning of summer in 2000, memorial day weekend to be exact, I consciously left my body on journey of an alternative reality.  My setting was a music festival in California.  I thought I was injesting 10-20 hits of good liquid LSD.  I find out later I got a 'Chunk' in the last of the bottle.  A tiny little Crystal of LSD.

I really don't think I was in the appropriate setting for this type of extensive interfacing but there I was.  In the Moment.  Past Present and Future lined up into one and created a lattice work of moving eternity so I jumped on.  I went through many synchronicities lining up people in my life events coming into place.  At one point in the reality I was in I Birthed universes for the future or past or the infinte.  Time has a funny way of bending and contorting in this altered state.  

The birthing process brought me closer to oneness.  I had a hard time re-entering my body.  Everything turned to ones and zero's and negitive one like on the internet.  I actually felt like The planet had a big net over it and to re-enter I had to go through it.  Very unpleasent in a digital way.  The most interesting thing happened to me after this experience.  My eye color changed for three days.  I have green eyes and after this experience I had bright piercing electric blue eyes.  People around me were commenting as well as my boyfriend.

I have made an explanation to my self about this.  How scientifically sound it is I don't know.  I know lighter eyes let more light in them.  So on my journey I believe I interfaced so much with so much light(truth) that my eye color adapted to that frequency of learning on that level.  As far as set and setting, the universes I birthed there was me pissing my self here, I ended up hanging out with rock med.  I would not trade my experience for ANYTHING.  I also woundn't take such a high dosage of any thing in a festival setting with out someplace to go where you can let it all out if need be.  It is important to have acess to a space on this demension that can haddle your body mimicking what is going on in other demensions you may be traveling. I use this and all other alternative reality experiences every day to further the study of self. 

It is funny how one experience can impact you so intensely that it is still teaching you in a year.  This memorial day weekend I attended MINDSTATES2.

This was about my seventh time Tripping on LSD. After doing many purple geltabs, which i found to be very powerful, and not tripping off the papertabs I've taken, i thought papers were useless. But I was wrong, I just hadn't found the right ones yet. That is until this weekend a month ago.  A friend of mine had a little house party in which 10-15 people come, drink, smoke some maryjane, and socialize. He throws these get-togethers often. Well.. I am 17 and was almost a full blown alcoholic, so I eased on it and got into LSD, MDMA, etc... So me, and 3 other friends decided to get some Acid, while everyone else drank. (Something we do quite often)

Me and JB road over to a friend of his, getting a total of 20 hits. (10 were for money-making purposes to pay for ours.) This was Jonathon's first time tripping. While at the dealer's house, he specifically said, 'I don't care how much you usually take, do NoT take more than two of these.' This means alot coming from him, a daily tripper.

Well, I'm not one to follow standards, so i took my 5. Derek took 2, and Jonathon took 1. We lost JB somewhere along the way. I went to a bedroom alone and turned on the strobe and some techno. Regular house shot mostly. I waited a half hour and just had that queezy feeling I always seem to get in my stomach before I trip. I was trying to make myself trip, by staring at things in the room hard, and zoning out(when will I learn to just sit and be patient). Well after that half hour i got up and went to the living room where everyone was watching 'body shots' a clubbin' flick. Although i didn't like this atmosphere of no music or pretty lighting effects, i layed on the floor and watched on.  Then the shit hit me so hard, I haven't ever felt like this before. For the first time in my life I got the thought for a split second, 'maybe I took a few too many'. But that thought disappeared within about a minute. Things in the house that usually only became visual for certain periods of time were constantly flowing and moving. The carpet was seemingly alive, and I found myself to be doing odd things. 

This Acid was so different to me, It gave me a very strong body trip and mental trip, along with more visuals than the other acid I've done.  My body was feeling very weak yet so amazingly tingly. Like a shiver, but constant.  The sky became a flat purple color, and trees were flat black and cartoony. I am not used to this, but I was enjoying myself. We ended up having to leave ( drunk people need sleep) around 2am.  Driving was so scary yet completely amazing. I've ridden while tripping before, but this seemed different. We landed at an abandoned trailer on a backroad right behind a wild animal park.  The sounds of peacocks were so odd to hear while tripping.  Then my vision became completely altered, I was seeing things in like a purple writing, but shaped the way they really were supposed to be. Like comparable to the writing in the film 'MATRIX'. I was stunned, and this made me and LSD a closer companion. The night went on till about 7:30am, which started at about 11pm. The outcome was, we lost Derek along the way, and it was me and Jonathon at a gas station about 45 miles away from home. We had the ridiculous idea to follow a semi on the interstate to see where he was going.  After it war off, I had no come down, or even a burned out feel. I was amazed, and because of this I love LSD more than ever. 

Ever since my first trip I had a different outlook on everything. Ever since this trip, I didn't have a comedown at all. So, I found a great companion.  Enjoy your LSD everyone, and please be safe. Driving is not a good idea and we shouldn't have done it. Thanks.

well, when i took my second trip, I did 5 hits while walking in the forest, and as i was coming up, and walking over a bridge, i drew the lsd molecule on the railing and wrote 'albert hofmann is my father' as a joke. i'm not gonna go into too much detail on the visuals, because they weren't too much different from last time, and i'm sure anyone who's done acid know about 'em already... mainly mandalas and and peoples faces moving around. I watched trainspotting with my sitter (he was somewhat concerned due to the disturbing imagery, but for some reason i've always found that movie to be kind of life affirming and good), but i couldn't really keep track of what was going on. while watching the movie a made a few realizations: 

The first was that evolution is a self anihilating concept, in that the species which becomes dominant inevitably destroys itself, allowing the process to start over again. 

The second, which i realized as i pet my dog and was overwhelmed
by the vast amount of pure, unconditional love pouring from him, was that we are all one being, experiencing itself for the sheer joy of it, which led me to the third revelation, that the point of life (or at least mine) is to be happy and to make others happy. which is why i can't stand those who disregard others feelings and only persue their own pleasure.

As my sitter left, we talked a little, and i was nearly brought to tears by his kindness in watching me, and allowing me to be myself. I now feel very lucky to have him as a friend, because he has never judged me and he's always supported me in all my decisions.

Later, I went to take a shower. I looked at my body and realized how ape like humans really are, and i realized that as much as we revel in our physical achievements, and our physical form, we are, as a people, ashamed of our simian heritage, although many of our postures are those of apes, and squatting on my feet, i could almost feel a tail extending from my spine...

overall, it was a very good day, and i hope to repeat the experience before too long, but those 5 hits were the last of the 10 that i got in october and i don't have any money at the moment, so i'll probably end up taking another 3 month stint of sobriety...

I recently had a chance to find myself switching roles in an experience I had had on LSD.  I had some younger friends over, who were relatively inexperienced on LSD.  Only two others were on LSD, the other three were just drinking for various reasons.  We had acquired the LSD from a reputable source that evening in liquid form dropped onto sugar cubes.  The two novices took a double dose there and then another an hour later after returning to my house, which I like to think of as a good chill space.  I took one double dose about the time they took their second.  I set up a series of music that I knew would be enjoyable and mind bending, particularly in the acid head space (Orbital, Banco de Gaia, etc).

The LSD was very clean and high quality.  It snuck up behind us slowly and then wacked us over the head, sucking our brains into the spirals that wouldn't stop for the rest of the evening.  When I felt mine come on, I just let myself go.  Being slightly off timing of the other two, I settled more into an observer state than trapped into their spirals (tho that would ensue later).  I found it quite humorous to see them trapped in the mindset that we (and they to each other) were 'fucking with them'.  It was funny to me because I remember one trip I had where, even being somewhat experienced on LSD, I felt like the people I was tripping with (whom I had only known through online communications) were messing with me and we were all messing with each other.  In that case as with this, it was never anything malicious or disturbing, but was well summarized in the quote 'Ok, who's fucking with me, is it you or me?'

It just made me realize that one shouldn't always try and define or explain the acid head space.  It often leaves one confused.  I enjoyed just observing and letting myself go.  Having come to many interesting understandings in Aikido recently about spirals, shapes, energy flow, and the like, I was able to fit these same thoughts and identify with the same concepts affecting the flow of the LSD space.  The ever elusive point (singularities are a bitch, always gotta remain on the tangent), circular thought patterns, infintite spirals (they're the same whether they are spinning in or out), movement of body, mind, and energy, etc.  It was difficult to explain or put them in a rigid framework, so I just let myself experience them as they came and manifest them in whatever form may be at the time, whether it was dance, thought, manipulation of others (like I said, there wasn't neccessarily any fucking with others, often it just seemed like it, but that doesnt mean it didn't happen, cause it's fun when you get it right), or Aikido shapes/forms.  

It was just interesting to see the same strugglings that I have been through, evidenced in these two, and to provide the chill space where one could just deal with it. I'm not trying to sound like an elitist bastard (albeit I am one), but I take the lessons from LSD to my heart, and they do help me integrate my reality and how I interact with it.  My presence of mind is greatly aided by a dissolution of self and the reconstruction of intent and structure. It was refreshing to see where I had come from, and where my mind and self have developed since then.  Not to say it's not possible for me to get caught in the same spirals, they're always there.  It was just fun to play the observer.

Meep,
Beaker

I've recently read about Trey's experience on mixing LSD with mescaline, something about his recollection struck me as to how similar it was to mine, only I had just taken LSD alone.  One afternoon myself and a close friend did some acid, and experienced the usual tale of warped images, however approx 6 hours later when I thought that the effects were begining to dissipate, I was astounded to see something which was amazing and uncontrollable - and ultimately emotionally stunning. No matter how much I tried to change my focus on to something else, the things I were seeing remained.  These things or thing, was in fact a jelly like sheen which coated my whole body, which I could only detect by sight (at first).  It looked like what I imagine a drop of milk would look like suspended in geletine, sort of forming a minute yet complex white misty cloud, it hovered about an inch above my skin (not my clothes)  As I began to explore this occurence more closely - by looking at my fingers, I saw fleeting electrical sparks, the smallest I have ever seen, these electrical sparks seemed to be thinner than the finest hair and lasting only a fraction of a fraction of a second.  

I later began to feel a strong electrical presence in the room (no sound) just a kind of what I would describe as a 'biological white noise' This white noise grew immense and loud - this is not auditory loud, it's more of a loud silence, maybe the opposite of sound?  anyway, I felt it engulf me and take me to the most euphoric place I have ever been, I sensed that this place was unlike the 3 dimensional life that I knew of, but more of a place where everying is purely emotional - purely thought - no mass no space.  Whilst in this place, I was convinced that the other presence formed part of me, and alway had been with me. Like Trey I felt that this presence was happy to know that I could finally acknowledge it.

It all started off innocently enough.  I was going to St. George, Utah, to pick up a friend and go to Vegas for a fun filled weekend of smoking weed, cruising the strip, and a Phish concert.  Prior to this trip I had never even considered taking acid.

Friday morning we left St. George and headed for Vegas.  We smoked some shwag on the way down the canyon and jammed to the Doors, and talked nonsense till we got to Vegas.  When we got to Vegas we met up with some mutual friends, one of which attends UNLV and lives in the dorms, which is where we slept.  Friday night everyone found tickets to the Phish show, so we all went and had an awsome time.

Saturday morning we woke up late and sat around reminiscing about how cool the concert was.  We all decided we would try to get tickets to the Saturday night show.  Then my friend D pulled out a little bottle and smiled at me.  He asked me if I wanted to do some acid.  It was a very interesting thought, I had never really considered it before.  I had only smoked pot about three times before this trip.  I asked everyone what it was like and about all I could gather from them was that it was 'crazy,' 'intense,' and that I would be a different person after.  I thought for about fifteen minutes and decided to go for it.  D put two drops from the little breath freshener bottle on my tounge.  I rubbed it around my mouth and swallowed.  'That's it?' I asked.  'Thats it,' D said.  The friend I drove down from St. George also took one hit.

I asked why no one else was doing it and they explained that you develop tolerance and they didn't want to have to do twice as much to get the same effect.  I had no idea the night before that they were all tripping.  At first I had the feeling that nothing was going to happen.  They just told me to hold on and it would work.  About a half hour after taking the acid, things started to happen.  The first effect I noticed was that a blue chair in the room seemed much more blue.  It was strange but not alarming.  Then I laughed my ass off as I watched my friend B roll a joint.  It was so funny that he had these finely tuned 'joint rolling skills.'   Then we set off on what would be the strangest journey of my life.

As we set off across the parking lot the sun was high and hot, about 1:00 in the afternoon.  I could sense things much better.  I could feel the heat from the pavement and the sun was brighter.

There was quite a while before the show, so we decided to just chill and walk around the parking lot amongst all the Phish heads.  We picked a nice grassy hill partialy in the shade and by a big 'friendly' rock.  This is when I started to peak.

I sat among my friends, on a small grassy hill, partly in the shade of my friend the pine tree, and by my friend the rock.  I looked around and the trees started to dance and the grass seemed to flow like a gently, peacefully, rolling stream.  All the people relaxing around me were very beautiful.  It was one of the happiest moments I've ever had.  Everyone and everything were happy to be there sharing in each others' company.

Someone suggested that we go exploring and I was happy with doing anything.  We walked around all the campers and busses and did some people watching.  It was a very surreal experience.  Walking around thinking crazy stuff, all the dealers wispering 'acid, shrooms, extacy' at us.  Then it happened:  I was lost.  Four hundred miles from home, tripping balls, and I was lost.  I tried to stay calm and was fairly successful.  I just remembered I was on drugs and they would go away sooner or later.  Finally I found my friends without incident and we went back and chilled on the grass which was very relieving.  We didn't find tickets to the show but I was content for I had had my own little 'show.'

I think I will definitely do acid again some time.  It is quite an experience, but do some research before you try it.

I was not at all an experienced drug user. It was my freshman year in high school and I had been smoking weed for approximately 2 years and I drank, but that's as far as my drug use went. Well, I had been wanting to try harder and better things for a while and then my friend gave me 2 geltabs (I cannot recall what kind, but someone I know who has tripped over 120 times told me it was very strong!). Well, it was after school and I was alone so I decided not to take it.

The next day in school I realized I still had the 2 tabs on me. I was really bored and it was right after 2nd period, 10 am. I told my druggie friend what I had and she told me to take it. I thought it sounded like a good idea since I figured she could take care of me if something went really wrong, and I was really bored. Well, I popped both in my mouth. Not much later, I started feeling crazy and out of control. Everything looked really funny. They took me to the locker room in the gym and I sat there and started bugging out. They knew it was a bad idea for me to go to class, so I just sat there. I started seeing all sorts of crazy things, even though none of it was there. I was really scared and I realized I was fucked up badly. The teacher came in to yell that we couldn't just sit there, we had to go to class. I saw monkeys dancing around and a dog on the floor. 

My friends realized that if an official saw me they would know I was fucked up. They tried to take me out of the locker room but I was too busy crying that the dog couldn't come with us. They picked me up and dragged me out of there. They decided to bring me to lunch where I could sit and relax. But the walls in my school were really curvy and there are like a million turns. I kept feeling as though the walls were going to get me and hit me. Then I finally got to the stairs and they totally bugged me out. I refused to walk and began to crawl up the stairs. Then they heard the dean start to come to scream for us to get out of the hallways and into class. They knew they couldn't have the dean see me crawling up the stairs so they brought me to the bathroom. I started bugging out in there. 

They decided to bring me to my bio lab class and I could sit there because the teacher already knew me and my friends were druggies, so we knew he wouldn't care. I sat at my table just staring at it, thinking there were all sorts of colors even though it was white. The teacher just ignored me. Then I got real hot and went to the window. I was so hot I stuck my whole body out the window and almost fell out. Then the dean came into my class and said they had to speak to me. I was so scared. I left the room and said I wanted my friend that was with me in class to come with me. So they said she could come. They brought me to the bathroom and started questioning why I looked so funny. I said I had been sick and vomited and also had an asthma attack. They said ok, they were going to go get the nurse and to stay there. 

Now, I wasn't really seing crazy things as much, but I was so scared and nervous and paranoid they would figure out what was wrong. My friend kept trying to calm me down but I just started crying and couldn't stop. Then the nurse and the dean came back and they were like, what's the matter, are you okay? Why are you shaking so much? I said I just didn't feel well and that after my asthma attacks I start to shake because I get myself so worked up and scared, and that I would be fine and I wanted to go back to class. They said no and took me downstairs. They said my friend had to go to class, though. I really didn't want her to leave and started crying again. They took me to the office and made me call my mom. 

I told her I just hadn't felt well and I would be fine and she was like, you want me to come pick you up and bring you to the doctor? I was like nooo, because I knew a doctor would figure it out. Well, to make this very long story end, they let me go and suggested to my mom that I get drug tested. After that I was fine and felt better the rest of the day. I learned a lot from that day. I put myself in a bad situation. You should not do something where there is a chance you can get in trouble around a lot of officials and school is not a place for drugs. 

If you want to try something or do drugs, don't do them in school. Also, I should have learned more about the drug and the effects and I should have been more prepared for what could happen. I have since done acid again many times and have now done many other drugs as well. I have never again had a bad trip or any other experiences or problems like that and have never come so close to being caught again. That was the worst experience of my life and it taught me a lot of life lessons. It prepared me really well for the drugs I have done since then.

Hi, my name is R, I'm 20 years old and I'm not of English origin so I apologise in advance for any typos or misspelling.

I practice yoga and meditation every once in a while, I belive I am in good physical condition and I eat well, I have experience with MDMA, cocaine, ketamine, speed paste, LSD, mushrooms ;), and some research cuemicals that were sold as MDMA and LSD although I don't do coke any more nor will I for the rest of my life as I realised it's absolute crap and I don't really get what I'm paying for and yes I've had good coke.

It all started at 1:45am when I was waiting to get picked up to go to a psychedelic trance rave some kms away from my house. As I wait I stretch for a bit. I get picked up and driven to the place, none of the other people in the car went with be but they had some acid and I had some money so I bought 5 hits. I drop one as soon as we arrive there which was at about 2:15am. As I pay my entry and observe what's going on, I go upstairs to the balcony and immediately run into an aquaintance of mine and I give her a big hug and spin her around ahahah it felt great.  

At this point I was starting to heavily come up. The acid I was doing were Hoffman's, they have been advertised as 300mcg but I've done good LSD and from personal experience I know it's not the case but nevertheless they are good, the only downside to these Hoffman's are that they don't produce much visuals but the high is great! (The tabs had no taste whatsoever).

I start running into my friends and since I didn't have any weed on me I asked them to roll us a joint, which they did, they even let me roll it, at this point I was already tingling and in the mood to dance so we smoke the joint and go back downstairs. The music is great. I danced the night away and in-between 2am and 6am I dropped 3.5 tabs and gave the rest to my friends. in-between 2am and 6am I dropped 3.5 tabs and gave the rest to my friends. Almost everyone in that party was either on MDMA or acid and the music was great.

The only visuals I got during the party was when I was looking at the screen and it had strips of red and blue and green triangles Wich made this trippy cornucopia and kept changing between the two I saw the triangles overlapping the red stripes and when it switched back to the triangles they were in hd and the colour was very vivid. When we left the party we went to smoke some joints at this place that was sheltered from the wind and cold, this happened during November in southern Europe so it was cold but not so cold. After daylight breaks we leave to go to the gas station that was about 2 or 3kms away.

Some wierd stuff happend during the process of all that. One of my friends had a bike and I rode it every now and then during the walk to the station and every time I did I started seeing patterns on the ground but not your usual ones like geometric shapes, oh no. These patterns were telling some kind of story that I really didn't understand but ok.  

I got home at about 11am, took a shower and went to sleep. I slept for about 3h give or take.

When I woke up I had breakfast  and rolled myself a spliff and went to the local park. I smoked a cigarret first, which felt and tasted better than usual then the joint. As I came up from the weed I got a bit of the acid high back and just enjoyed it. At 6:30am I went to church with my family and had a really good experience. At 6:30am I went to church with my family and had a really good experience. I have done this once before on 1g if mushrooms and had an amazing experience. I believe in Jesus tough I am not Catholic. My church has no saints or any images we just sing and praise the Lord almighty. 

When I got back home I ate  smoked my other joint and went to bed early at about 10pm, read a chapter of the Bible and went to sleep. I woke up about 15 hours later feeling kinda tired but very relaxed and in a positive mood. I am currently writing this at about 5:30pm on a Sunday.

LSD or How to Learn About Myself

After reading all these experiences it made me want to share one of the many experiences I had with LSD or acid as we called it.  I have to say that I was lucky and always stayed within the limits of reasonable dosage when using acid.  This fact is probably the reason why my usage of acid had a rather positive effect on my life.  

It was summer, I was about 15 or 16 at the time.  Me and my buddy Francis have already done acid a few times before.  In other words it was one of the first times I tripped on this.  I came to his house around 5 or 6 PM.  He already had the acid and was ready to drop it.  So we did.  

After half an hour or so I started feeling queasy an anxious.  A little time after that I started to laugh like crazy for no apparent reasons; basically I just looked at my buddies face (and he was so stoned!) and started to laugh and laugh...it was really funny.  After this insane laughing trip I started looking at some books and thats when the visuals kicked in.  It made no sense.  The letters were moving back and forth fucking up my perception.  At one point I thought I was reading thoughts from my unconscious. At one point I thought I was reading thoughts from my unconscious.  I was amazed by this feeling...overwhelmed I would say.  I felt like a... Recipient of ice cream, and I could dig inside myself, digging out secrets I didn't know of but were there after all.  After putting the book down I started to see things which made me ecstatic.  I had visions of big city landscapes.  I could see it clearly; buildings and skyscrapers in front of me in a distance.  And this is kinda funny 'cause a couple of years later I moved out in the big city...kinda strange.  

After a few hours my buddy got tired of me and kicked me out.  So I called up my dad and he came and picked me up.  The ride home was hell: my father was casually talking to me as I was seeing the street lights growing bigger and bigger.  Everything was kinda yellowish and the light poles were deformed.  I also had the feeling that the car was going very slowly but it as rolling at a normal pace.  

Finally when I came home my dad went to bed but I was still wide awake.  The rest of the trip was in my room.  At first the ceiling fan made me trip for awhile.  Then colors in the ceiling started to appear.  But the thing that made me trip the most is when I passed in front of the mirror.  I stopped and looked at my face only to realize it wasn't my face!  And it was constantly changing. Faces of people I never seen before appeared in the mirror Faces of people I never seen before appeared in the mirror with a kaleidoscope effect.  Then my face morphed and melted.  

When I think about this trip and any other acid trip I made in my life; it always made me realize something about myself or our beautiful mother earth or the universe.  This particular trip made me see I had a changing personality.  Which is true.  As I grow older I can't help but realize that I am an unstable human being constantly changing and evolving...Anyways every trip was a revelation.  I love it and I can't wait the proper moment to do it again!

I took notes during a recent LSD trip. This is the transcript. 

5:00 p.m. Take half a tab, instant light high.
5:20 p.m. Everything is visually sharper and more vibrant than usual, some floating neon patches of color.
5:45 p.m. Colors even more vibrant, heart racing, warm feeling in chest. 
6:15 p.m. The effects seem to be getting stronger with each mood boost that comes over me The effects seem to be getting stronger with each mood boost that comes over me (the strengthening in intensity definately seems to be caused by the mood boosts, not the other way around). I choose to go outside.
6:50 p.m. After locking myself out of house, come back and peak 
6:57 p.m. No longer doubt if 'it's working.' I'm riding my bike and it feels like the pedals are getting taller and shorter, very intense.

8:08 p.m. Yep, everything makes sense now, I'm sitting on a bench by the river listening go the JCS soundtrack and smoking a cig and I feel so good, everything is perfect. 
9 p.m. Oh it's HERE. 
9:20 p.m. Renewed zest for the trip. 
9:40 p.m. Vivid patterns in the darkness, lose some sense of spatial reality (dreamlike) 
9:44 p.m. Grasp the magnitude and power of the Willamette river for the first time ever on the Autzen footbridge.
12:21 a.m. Don't try to communicate with non living beings, success would result in a complete psychotic break. 
1:43 p.m. Haven't slept, still having tactile hallucinations (things I'm wearing or touching melting into me) the visuals are mostly subtle.
2:57 p.m. I swear the objects are creaking more than usual. 

3:01 p.m. It feels like most everyone else is just saying 'come on, get on with it' when it comes to collective consciousness, but only for fleeting moments. Everything has been synced up all night Everything has been synced up all night (my thought patterns with the noises coming from the inanimate objects, as if to punctuate the thoughts) it makes some of what I'm thinking seem very meaningful. Reinforces my belief that psychedelics activate some sort of extra sensory perception, or that taking them encourages other forms of consciousness to attempt contact. 

3:39 p.m. Good healthy shudder 
3:40 p.m. I'm comfortable again.

Took two doses about 5:30 p.m. on the familiar 'ride up' I knew this liquid was going to be very potent. 

My buddy turned on some Grateful Dead and I was comforted by the familiar sounds. M put that music on at just the right point because just as I was starting to peak the music turned into an orchestra of twisting clocks. My eyes were closed and this shift in music made me very uncomfortable.  My mind was reeling in on itself to an almost unbearable pitch. 

Just when I felt like I might scream uncontrollably everything cleared away effortlessly.  My body-mind became light and buoyant. I felt a peace like no other wash over me softly, and as it did the top of my head opened like a lotus. I felt a peace like no other wash over me softly, and as it did the top of my head opened like a lotus. This was a very odd feeling looking back, but at the moment it felt perfectly natural. My spirit or energy or consciousness or whatever float  upwards out of my body into space. I felt at total peace gazing out at the stars and all of creation. 

Then out of the inky blackness a small point of something appeared. This small point grew out symmetrically into these beautiful delicate hands that seemed to have a rainbow aura. More hands radiated outwards some were open with beautiful strange eyes looking at me some held things some held many things like somehow multiple things could fill one space. Outward until a full image of a magnificent being of golden light with many arms and hands appeared.  

This was more than a bit scary to me. It was simply too much to behold. I opened my eyes and I was almost completely sober!

11:11pm Make a wish. Dropped the tab [1 acid tab ungrateful dead]. 

11:47 pm I thought I wasnt feeling anything but my neck feels odd. I almost feel very lightly nauseous but I know it will pass I think its because I didnt eat much before only pizza about 5 hours ago. My hand eye coordination is staring to lag as noticed from typing on the computer and talking to a friend. 

11:58 pm Pupils larger. Feeling weirder. Starting 2 trip.

12:09 am The ear thing. (whooshing)

12:17 am Done texting. Time to let go. Hard to type. I just feel weird. Everything is on a slant.

12:19 am Hearing and seeing trails if that makes sense. Hyper aware. Slipping further into it. Pupils dilated. I cant tell if I have to pee or not lol.

12:29 am Woahh its only been 10 minutes lol. Im deff tripping now. Grinding my teeth a lot. 

12:43 am Staring the movie Waking Life. Tired of electronics. 12:43 am Staring the movie Waking Life. Tired of electronics. 

2:38 am Waking Life was intense. Really hungry I wish I could sort that. Im surprised I can type. Everything is moving in little circles. Trying to play Grand Theft Auto now. Really super sensitive to all the ambient music this thing makes. Everything is melting like in Waking Life loll. 

4:06 am Starting to come down. Pupils still very large. 

4:46 am Still grinding teeth, ears still keen on music and my Dream Sequens' by NMESH cassettes. I wish it wasnt almost 5am. I have to remind myself I can get it again. Watching Prevue Guide clips and smoking weed. 

5:52 am Staring into the mirror I somehow became third person. For a second my audio and visual seemed completely static I became the reflection somehow I became the moment I saw the reflection of myself in the mirror and I became the reflection staring back for a second.

I did some more dabs and peacefully drifted off to sleep around 7am or so.

 O.K., Been tripping for five years on cid and shrooms, lots of shrooms.This particular experience, happened to be the strongest dose ever.Myself and seven other people, all close freinds, had gathered together for a trip session. A very special occasion since we never get to see each other.A week before, me and three of the others had got the acid and we sampled it. I took one and then another after I had peaked.The best trip that I had ever encountered.Smooth, clean the greatest visuals.Just the three of us on the fourth of july watching the fire works explode in to cosmic angels, chillin with my gal, and haveing revolations beyond my normal symbolic mindscape.Great I thought.The second trip, with all seven of us, had started out different.I thought , hey what the hell, I handled the last one like a pro, why not toss back three or four.No big deal.A few of the others had taken large doses as well.I can feel the first vibes run up and down my body about twenty minutes later.We all were sitting in the living room of the small two bedroom apt.I could barely understand what anyone was saying, I could here their voices but their lips did not move at all.We all experienced this same thing, as we discussed this later.

I remember I was afraid that they were against me for some reason and I was afraid to say anything for fear that it might be true.I must have been quiet for an hour into the trip before I got the nerve to pull one of my best friends to another room and make sure that I wasnt insane.I had been trapped in my own fear and insecurities for a long time.What felt like an eternity.I was relieved to find that I was not the only person that was experiencing this.I went outside on the porch to breath the fresh air and get a grip on myself.Soon as I got out there I snapped out of it.I Went back in to discover that my cousin was running around the house swithing the lights on and off saying, Im Jeremy Im going to bed.This would of been fine if he had of stopped.He was stuck in a loop.Thats all he could do, he said the same things over and over again, and could not sit down, as if he could not figure out what he should be doing.LSD unlocks you from the dreadful repititions of boring habitual tendencies,that seem to consume our lives.He wasnt ready.Finally he was convinced to take an enormous bong hit and that did the trick. He snapped right out of it.We all had a giant learning experience that night.First, know what your taking,how strong it is and there is no need for taking more than is necessary.Two, plan out your trips.LSD is not for shits and giggles.

It can be negative in a negative environment.LSD is a tool for evolution, and can be used effectively as such. Planning a session, taking the time to do it right is important. We were in a crowded room, we couldnt be loud , we were in an apt.The first time I tripped on this cid it was only the three of us and we were comfortable there. With seven people in a small room , not enough things to occupy us.Ive tripped hard as hell at parties where I almost lost it because of unfamiliar faces and uncomfortable surroundings.Bad tripps are not the effect of the drug, but the effect of the surroundings.

Well, this trip started with none other than the overwhelming happiness that always ceases to amaze.

I dropped 1.5 tabs at about 4 in the afternoon, turned on Bebop, and I chilled

About an hour in I start smiling, this lasts the whole trip.

Another hour passes, I walk upstairs, which I love doing because  it involves most of the 5 senses (including my new sixth sense)

This 'sixth sense' I refer to is the sense that converts normal senses into other senses.

For example sound and touch blended into sight.

A kalaidescope of color with the consistency of water flooded my vision.

With every new touch, sound, smell, this trip was increased

My sixth sense lasted about four hours

The third of these four hours was most intense.
As I looked to the walls of my house while moving through it, I noticed a nob in the cherry-wood that actually morphed into none other than a full-blown skull.

This skull started laughing as I grew more and more perplexed with visual.
I then start laughing with it (as the body buzz is intense and makes me feel happy no matter what I do)
Then, a patchwork of demon-heads, all about the size of a fifty-cent piece formed around the skull and laughed in unison at me.

I then went upstairs and decided to come down while talking to my friends.

In the last thirty minutes of my extra sense, the watery colors faded and my hands began rapidly changing colors(beleive it or not thats less of a trip than before)

Anyway about ten minutes after that my pupils went back to normal and trippiness was over.

Ten strip of really clean, good strong acid.  The best I've ever had. Well this trip went on for a long time, and a lot happened.  But to me, the most interesting part, the most moving part, is described below.

I am flying over the ocean.  Not really in a body, just looking down at the ocean from high above.  There's a ship down there.  I'm not really paying attention, not too concerned with whatever is happening.  Somehow, I know that this is the Pacific Theater of World War II.  Somewhere near Japan or the Phillipines. Somehow, I become aware that I am a man on the ship.  There is a violent explosion in which I am killed.  It is very disturbing, I look away, horrified.  It's terrible, terrible.  My body is ripped apart.  It's awful.  I turn away. I'm up in the sky looking down.

Now I am in a dark underground cave.  There are many people here.  We are all dead.  A huge crowd of dead people, standing around, frowning. It feels sketchy here.  Not like we are in Hell, but this is not a nice place.  I think, 'This is Sheol.'  It's like a waiting room.  I want to leave. It's like a waiting room.  I want to leave.   But you're not allowed to.  There are these monsters guarding us.  They look like big disembodied mouths, with snaggly teeth, drooling slime and blood, hovering above the ground.

I go right up to one and assert, 'Angels are real!  Angels exist!'  I don't know why I said this.  I was not raised religious and did not believe in such things. It says something to me in an aside, like it doesn't want anyone else to hear, 'Well I don't doubt it.'  And then it stands aside and lets me walk out of there.

Now I am floating, ascending upwards through many red and gold spinning pentagrams. I pop out in a vast open space.  There is bright light everywhere, so I can hardly see anything.  I feel like everything is totally peachy.  I feel great, not scared at all.  This is a wonderful place.  If I was a Christian I would definitely say I was visiting heaven.

There are creatures here.  There are no other human beings, as far as I can tell.  The creatures are enormous, the size of a two-storey house.  It's hard to tell what they look like, because their flesh is like looking at the sun.  They best I can describe is that it was like an enormous lion with wings, but that's not really what it is.  It had eyes.  I saw its eyes.  There was more than one of the creatures. They were very benevolent.  They said something to me, to the effect of, 'You can stay here with us forever, if you like.  But we want you to go back.  We want you to reincarnate.  But you don't have to.'  

I remember clearly, thinking, 'Ha!  You'd really have to have a screw loose to agree to do that!'  It felt so good to be there, I would never want to leave.  And I certainly wouldn't go back to being a human on Earth!  All the fear, confusion and suffering.  I'd have to literally be insane to agree to go back there.

And then *click* all of a sudden I was me again, back in my room, sober. And then *click* all of a sudden I was me again, back in my room, sober.  Guess I agreed.

Footnote:

I was curious about what that ship was, and asked about it later when I was tripping.  I saw a man wearing one of those caps that veterans wear, it was blue and it said 'USS ----------'.  I looked it up and sure enough, the USS ---------- was a ship in the Pacific Theater in WWII.  In the early 1940s there was an explosion in which men were killed.  Strangely enough, it happened on my birthday...

Wow

I was a High School Freshman boy and was very naive and intruged at all the stuff High School had to offer. I thought High School would be boring since I was only a Freshman and not very popular, but people at this school were very nice and friendly, so getting into crazy stuff was pretty easy.

I had an older friend Ill call X. I gotta thank X. He would pretty much do anything for me and this other dorky Freshman and expect nothing in return. One time, me and X were and this other kid were playing Watch Dogs pretty high on weed. We were playing the digital trip and I asked X if we could do Hallucinagens sometime. He said sure, and next weekend he had LSD for us both. 

The first stage is the giggles. Everything seemed funny, and I notice the slight effect of my friend moving faster. While giggling hysterically I smushed my face in a pillow. When I looked up from the pillow... It happened. Just like that I was tripping balls. The high is hard to explain. But it is very intense. So intense that it may have even been a bigger part of the trip than the hallucinations. The best way to describe it is that I feel this disoriented, depressed, euphoric, overwhelming, dreamlike, meaty, and spiritually mysterious feeling. That doesn't really give it full justice. I can't really describe it.

A lot happened, so I will just give you the most interesting details in no particular order. I very interesting experience was star gazing. Lines formed between the stars forming constellations. But the were not any constellations. They were 3-D. To add even more complexity, they were not actually 3-D, but were made of 2-D lines that gave a sense of depth, like when you draw a cube. To extenuate this perspective effect, the stars were different sizes, so that the bigger ones would be were they would be closer tho the viewer if the shape was 3-D. Another interesting effect was an invisible buffolo on a monocolor TV screen. If you think about it, an infinite variety of shapes make up any shape, because any shape can be cut out of any shape. Well I saw the silhouette of an invisible buffolo on this surface. It was not a different color than the rest of the surface or separated with a line. The screen was still monocolor, but I just saw where the buffolo would be.

As well as the visual hallucinations, I also had situational hallucinations. Keep in mind, that hallucinations are not dillusions. You can tell hallucination from reality. But I had a hallucination that X was my dad. I knew he wasn't, and he had no characteristics of my dad that could be detected by the five senses. It more just felt like this whole thing was a dad/son adventure. Music was also very odd. After every lick, it would end out of tune. But even though it was not in tune from a conventional standpoint, it sounded very good in its own unique way.

Another amazing thing was that I could not tie my shoes. I knew how to tie them. I was physically able to. I wanted to. I had the willpower, but something was missing. This was so interesting cause it made me consider that there may be many more parts of our brain involved in even mundane tasks that we are not aware of. And I only became aware of one of these parts when it was turned off. I heard there can be much worse side effects, but fortunately the only side effect I had was feeling extremely stuffy. Thankfully we had a bucket of water right by our side, but it mentally felt like I was covered in way to many blankets. That is not a metaphor. It was the physical equivalent of that, but in my brain. But other than that small discomfort, it was pretty fun.

Greatest Experience of My Life

I had recently purchased 1 trip of liquid acid from my friend. I had always wanted to trip on acid. I bought 1 trip and 3.5 grams of hydro weed. So, I rolled the weed into 2 blunts. I smoked one with my friend. He left shortly after so I dropped the acid.

About 45 minuted later I was tripping. It was night time and my and my friend left the woods and the leaves and trees gave off a metallic glow. Then I felt psychic. My friends were at a school sitting down when I called them. I said 'the cops will come meet me at arrowhead park' after that I had a vision where police dogs arrested all of them and I was there getting maced. So I sat down at the park and meditated. I saw lots of closed eye visuals including a green 'W' which was everywhere.

Then people started shooting off fireworks and I got scared and ran away. After that I had psychic visions of God,Moses, and all religious dietes telling me that I was the chosen one and to lead the enslaves people to The Sea of Tides. I was also felling very happy, the greatest I have ever felt. I smoked my second blunt and thats where the colored trails set in. The were everywhere. Then I started spacing out and I saw a glowing larve come out of a door with a huge eye in the middle. The eye was telling me to join forces with it in the battle against evil. It was weird but also cool.

I went home and started playing 'spyro The Dragon' for PS1. The dragon was flying out of the tv and around the room. Then I started to come down about 4.5 hours later. Aparently it wasn't the best acid but it was all I could get ahold of. This was by far the greatest experience of my life.

I was 22. Had just moved in with my boyfriend into a building that was being gentrified from a former crack house to the standard yuppie apartments (we had bullet holes in one window). As the renovations were ongoing for our time there it was rarely quiet and often workers walked in and out of our residence unannounced. But the day previous they stated they all had Sunday off, so that was when we decided to do our acid.

Unfortunately my mind set was much as it is now and always has been. Depressed, anxious, paranoid, and pessimistic. I try to keep all that at bay and enjoy my life, but its difficult. So that Sunday morning with a freshly neat and cleaned apartment my boyfriend gave me two and half little pieces of paper. I put them in my mouth and left them for half an hour. He did the same.

At first it was nice. It was sunny out. A warm late spring day in the midwest. Sun was streaming through the windows. I was with the man I loved and would eventually marry. I felt nice and cozy. The cat was on my lap purring. Just laying there purring. I wasn't even petting her. We decided to paint. Make some music. Draw some. Just do as we pleased.

I honestly have no recollection of how it happened, but I found myself naked as the day as I was born and just laying on our bed. I was perfectly content to stare at the textures of the ceiling. Then someone knocked on the door. It seemed impossibly loud. My boyfriend hurriedly put his pants back and on and went to the door. The workers decided to try and get some time and a half pay. They were working Sunday.

I heard all this while cowering naked in the closet and desperately clutching my confused cat for comfort. My man came back and tried to calm me down. It did not work.

We returned to the bed (I had replaced my clothing), the cat sticking by my side for some reason, and tried to again find the calm comfy place we were. I couldn't find it. I could hear everything at once. Screaming children, running faucets, footsteps, conversations, the pipes being worked on downstairs and it all came from everywhere and nowhere. It was horrible. I started to cry. I thought of the sharks sticker in the bathroom, the bullet holes in the window, the phantom image of a toddler running by it I had experienced much earlier and while not all drug impaired. I decided then that he had been shot to death and cried even harder.

The cat nuzzled my face and emitted a worried little meow in my direction. This for some reason struck me as hilarious. I then proceeded to laugh hysterically for approximately 15 minutes. 

At the site of my mate's worried face I then flipped into sobbing mode for a few minutes. Eventually the groaning, whining, screeching, and banging caused from the plumbing work below began to disturb him as well. It sounded like it was in our bathroom. The footsteps seemed to be in our hall. We looked but no one was there.

We relocated ourselves to the front room and sat in front of the big windows and just basked in the sun for awhile. I was feeling pretty good. Then I heard a woman scream. Heard a kid being smacked. Heard a baby cry. I looked out and saw the beautiful tall old trees, taller than our building, and thought of all the horrible human mess below. I then proceeded to cry non-step for more than half an hour.

We tried listening to music. It sounded like the musician was standing next to me, singing the words directly into my ear. I could not stand the sensation. We shut it off.

Somehow I gave in to my man's request for sexual intercourse. I found myself naked on the bed again. I felt like I was going to sink into the mattress like someone sinks into quicksand and I assumed I would be suffocated. It took an intense effort to keep myself sane enough to recongnize the fear as completely insane. Then he was doing what guy's do and I was enduring it. I usually love it. I felt like my limbs were shrinking. Like rapidly deflating balloons and that my skull was collapsing. I thought he was going to meld with me like two plastic pieces being melted and stuck together forever. I felt like my limbs were shrinking. Like rapidly deflating balloons and that my skull was collapsing. I thought he was going to meld with me like two plastic pieces being melted and stuck together forever. We'd be like siamese twins conected at the genitals. I focused on staying calm. I heard footsteps, but disregarded them. I heard a man laugh. A man say, 'There indisposed.' Then a door close. I still do not know whether or not a worker walked in and witnessed or drugged copulation or if it was a hallucination.

For the remainder of the trip we retreated to a newly empty room of the house. My man's schizo brother had moved back in with his mommy and taken his stuff with him. The large empty minimalist space soothed my mind and my racing heart. We sat on the floor and just stared at each other. Waiting out the unpleasantness. We seemed to read each other's mind. I leaned on the window while he went to use the toilet and was horrified at how I actually did want to do the cliche. I felt my body wanting to toss itself out the window and I fought with my hands to not open it and help me through. It was no death wish. There was a crack dealer standing below. It ocurred to me that it would be hilarious for a drugged chick to land on him and smash him.

Fianlly, after 9 horrible hours the trip ended. I had never felt my depression, paranoia, and anxiety at a more intense level than when I was on LSD. I'm 26 now and still have never taken it again. And I never will.

I'd like to talk about my first, and thusfar only LSD trip. To set the mood, I'll say that this was at college, on my birthday (a bit more than a week away from the end of school), we were still living in dorms, I had only just the week prior heard that we might have access to LSD, and I was the only one of my friends brave enough to try it (everyone was worried about flashbacks, but the research I did suggested that they really wouldn't be too bad, if at all). We're a strong group of friends, tightly knit. These were the guys that introduced me to weed, etc. My first true friends, due to my awful experiences in high school.

Anyway, I awaken for my birthday, the tab already stored away in my fridge, I picked up my brand new grinder from the post office, I check through my mail, and I've gotten an email from a Google recruiter (quick opportunity to call my mom so I don't have to ignore her all day). Oh yeah, and it was an absolutely GORGEOUS day - high of 62*F, sunny (so it was absolutely comfortable to be out in pants and a t-shirt), this was looking good. I emptied my pockets of all but my wallet and keys, and popped the tab in my mouth at 12:00 noon. (so that t+1 would be 1:00, etc.). I chilled on my couch with a few of my friends waiting around for the inevitable, all while wondering if I had just eaten a piece of paper...

Fast forward to about 1:00. Still haven't felt any effects, although I obviously didn't know what I was looking for exactly. Until the shadow behind the towel on the wall started to shift and colorcycle just slightly. It wasn't much, but I knew I was in for a ride. At that point, I only had fairly vague visuals (things colorcycled, but only within a small range of colors), and I could feel my mind starting to run in interesting ways fairly quickly (Two good quotes from me: 'I was going to ask you what color the poster was, but then I realized your answer could not be satisfying to me.' and 'How come words don't look like words upside down, they look like upside down words?'). I enjoyed staring at the walls for a bit, but then decided to start my adventure.

First stop, my friend who lived across the hall from me. She showed me that IBM video explaining logarithms - basically it's a shot of zooming way out on a couple enjoying a picnic, all the way to the universe scale, then zooming way in to the subatomic scale. That absolutely captured me, and did color a lot of my thoughts throughout the day. A few other videos weren't as appealing, and we all decided it would be a good time to go outside.

It's me and three of my friends, we make it out of the door of the dorm, and we run into our RA in short order. I crack up, thinking about how she has no idea what's going on inside my head. We run a little later into more RA's doing an area program involving, as far as I recall, watersports and freezepops - neither of which interested me at the time. One of my friends goes off to get a freeze pop, and I think at that point had to go to class, so goes off towards academic side while the rest of us head off through the woods. I should mention, that in my mind, it's absolutely amazing looking at all the people around, thinking about what they're thinking, thinking about how visible I am to myself, and how basically invisible I am to everyone else, and being put into a damn good mood by everyone talking about how they were basically done with classes for the year.

We head off to the woods, and I don't know whether it's because of the LSD, or the weather, but it seems to me like everything is just a hell of a lot more GREEN in there. Everything was growing in, and I really hadn't noticed until then. Plus, although I wasn't feeling much in terms of visuals, all the green that was there was definitely a lot more vibrant a green than I had ever seen before. We take a walk through the woods (often used by stoners, by the way). I notice how damn big one of the robins is. I'm distracted by the movement of just about everything in the forest. We go over to one of the more popular spots in the woods, 'Narnia', which we hadn't been to since I got caught with a bong between my legs about a month back. We had nothing on us, so nothing to worry about. I run through those events a little bit, although in a totally great mood. We also run through the time we met up with a schizophrenic girl back there, and we figured out which tree she jumped out of. A bit more nature enjoyment, and we're off - we keep walking and we catch up with the road around campus to get back to the dorms. Here's where a bit of auditory tripping comes out.

Up to that point, everything had been fairly moderate - probably a +. When the auditory trip kicked in, I'd say it went up to a ++. I all of a sudden stopped walking - all of my mind was just as 'there' as it had been all day, but I noticed something funny. I could just barely hear the cars driving right next to me, but the sounds of the forest, the wind blowing through the trees, the birds chirping, etc. all were intensely loud. I started losing my ability to think like normal, and started thinking in 'LSD mode' (which I'll explain a bit later), and came up with some funny idea about how important nature was, and how unimportant the real world was... an idea it was almost impossible to put into words. After a little bit, we keep walking, and we head right back up to my dorm.

Physically, at that point, I was red and overheating, people commented that it looked like I had gotten a bit too much sun, but after resting a bit, sweating it off, and keeping with my liquid intake like I had been so careful to do all day, I went back to normal. I should stress this - I was VERY glad to have a ton of those 23oz green tea cans around - I went through alll of the ones I had left, and that was good. Just keep drinking.

Back in the dorm, we met up with a few more friends who had been in class up to that point, talked for a bit, and such. My concept of time is a bit fuzzy, but my guess would be that this was around 2-3pm.

Basically, chilling at this point involved my sitting on my couch, mostly thinking, occasionally talking with people, and my friend who was watching me playing a videogame in my room, while playing music on my stereo. I don't know how much time passed around then - it feels like a lot, but at the same time, I can't remember enough events around there to justify it being a lot - that's a common theme, asking my internal clock about what time it was, and my internal clock responding three different answers at the same time depending on how it figured it - one was way slow, one was dead on, and one was way fast, although I had no trust that any one of them was correct. 

At that point, I'd classify my baseline as ++. I was getting used to my thoughts shooting off, etc. I still held myself fairly grounded, though. It was then that I determined that I wanted to try to let that go a little. Basically, I lay down on my couch, stared at the ceiling, and through a process very similar to trying to get to sleep while being a bit curious about what happened while you go to sleep, I let myself drift off into a deeper trip. This was the peak of my visuals, and while I let it, it certainly felt like a +++ (although was still a ++ since I could easily come out of it). The walls started to melt around, distort into absolutely intangible shapes, all while my mind did things I can no longer comprehend... what a cool experience.

Part of that, was one of the coolest things I've ever experienced - I saw the double helix of DNA in the sky, much, I imagine, like Francis Crick did so many years prior. Feeling a thought begin to form, I asked my friend to play Longview by Green Day - with a bassline conceived from an acid trip. It fit exactly well. I realized just how similar all of our thought processes were, and really felt connected to everyone else in the world.

Anyway, I guess at that point it was a bit before, or actually more likely, a bit after 4:00. We decided to go out into the woods again, this time with a different assortment of people, and the tiny bit of weed that we had between us. The goal was for two of my friends to study for a math test coming up, while getting high, and I was coming along for the walk. We went to a lesser-known spot in the woods. My original plan was to not smoke with them - I wanted to experience as pure an LSD experience as possible.

They talked a bit about math, and I thought a bit about other things - well, at the rate I was going, everything all at once. Here I'll explain what my 'LSD mode' is - it's what really made me realize how much of a stimulant LSD really is. My thoughts would start somewhere, then, instead of just going linearly from one thought to the next, they seemed to bounce, for some reason I want to describe it as back and forth always moving up, always moving towards more abstract thoughts and concepts, always towards the same sorts of satisfying conclusions (one of which was the idea of the logarithms - that many concepts we had that are rated on some scale are really logarithmic, not linear, and that everyone has a different 'zero point' - a different spot on that scale. I can pin that idea on the video I had watched earlier). The disturbing part about the thoughts were that they continued faster than I could have them - I felt like I totally understood each point they were bouncing off of, but at the same time, if I tried to actually conceptuallize any one of those points into communicable or even just 'normal' thought, it took far too long, and I missed a few of the points ahead. I was able to, with intense concentration, commit a few of these steps in a single thought to short-term memory, and after a while, to talk about them to my increasingly high friends. They couldn't fathom how I was thinking, so they thought it pretty funny. I did too.

I'd like to mention a few of the more poignant thoughts I had at that point. First off, I should note that this really felt like another peak of my trip, and it was just like my previous auditory and visual trips, although this one was in another sense. I thoroughly believed that there were, for sake of argument, 4 senses - visual, auditory, tactile and the last one, which I'll call chronospacial. The other two 'normal' senses, smell and taste, were part of chronospacial and tactile, respectively (although there was certainly some overlap). I believed (and it would come mostly true) that I would experience 4 seperate major trip events, like the previous two, and that this was the chronospacial turn. Basically, it messed with time, space, and primarily thought - the things involved with this sense that I had come up with. At this point, I was sort of bouncing fairly quickly between this strong +++ trip and my baseline. After that thought came through (well, I was chronospacially tripping, so order really wasn't important to me. It may have been before, I'll talk like I knew any sort of order, but it may not be right), I really started to feel the LSD jitters - I got a very funny feeling in my legs like I had been all day and on a previous trip on LSA, like they had just about fallen asleep, and the bloodflow was returning; I also physically was jittery at that point - my jaw particularly was vibrating pretty violently. I had heard that weed was good for this, and I decided to try it. The others had already smoked a bit, but they were more than willing to pack another - in this case, since we were pretty much out of everything else, a kief pack of my friend's pipe. He had to leave at that point, for either work or class, leaving just three of us on that little hill in the woods. It certainly helped calm the jitters quickly, and sprung my trip back up.

Earlier in the year, one of our good friends had taken a leave of absence from school, and wasn't going to be back until at least the next year. We really missed him. For today, in wishing me a happy birthday, he mentioned to 'smoke a bowl for him.' The type of request that I would usually think about, but never to the degree that I did right there. In smoking that bowl, I was brought right back, almost completely right back into the experience of one lazy saturday morning wake-and-bake with him and one other friend on that same little hill - at that point I was on a t-break, but I still managed, with little effort, into coaxing them accidentally into smoking far more than they were expecting to - 5 big bowls from a BIG bong. I remembered all the details of the experience - although my visual, auditory, and tactile senses were still back there in reality, my chronospacial sense was right back in that old experience. That was absolutely amazing, and truly a great sense of smoking a bowl for someone. I had never missed him more, and I felt great in a reminiscing sort of way.

One more thought I had that I shared with everyone else was about our perception of reality. After a recent salvia trip, I had realized suddenly the difference between perception and reality, and a big part of my current theory on what reality truly was, and how we'd never even be able to come close to comprehending everything in reality, and that the 'reality' we're in - this universe, etc. was just part of our perception of actual reality. Anyway, I wasn't talking about this idea - we'd already talked about this some time prior. First, I had a funny thought about how we'll never really be able to replay experiences ever again. We can remember quite a bit about them, but we can't go back and relive the whole experience - we can't be there again. I thought about the salvia trip I had, and how, although I can imagine what I saw, I can't see it again, and furthermore, how I'd be able to recall the experience at that point, but I'd never be able to have the experience, to feel the same way, to think the same way, etc. After that, I talked to my friends about a funny idea, almost fear that I sometimes had, that I was living life like the main character in A Beautiful Mind - basically, that my friends were all in my head, complete schizophrenic hallucinations. It was thought-provoking, and to satisfy myself, I came back to a conclusion I got during the perception vs. reality discussion from the salvia trip - that it didn't matter, that all we all had was the approximation of reality we see in our perception, so it didn't matter what was real, as long as the perception we lived in was the best we wanted it to be.

I can't recall whether it was the cause or the result of that discussion, but at one point, we seemed to have an entire discussion about some topic, none of us actually using real words for a while, seemingly in each other's heads. It wasn't just me - the other two agreed with me that that had happened successfully. It was odd that it mimicked the way I was thinking so well (in progressing thoughts with and without understanding any of them, at the same time).

Another big theme I felt there (again, all this is totally out of order, but order doesn't really matter when you're brain is in that state), was almost like deja vu. While I was sitting there, looking down, I could see my legs and arms, and I was aware of the sunglasses I had on my face (I was wearing them all day, I liked them, and they came up a couple of times), and it felt... right. It all felt familiar, I guess it felt like it had all come to this point, this was the greatest point ever. I kept thinking about the word 'LSD' at that point, and just seeing how well it fit. It agreed with the shape of my face, the shape of my glasses, the clothes I was wearing, the color of everything, it all felt so familiar as what I can only describe as perfectly satisfying. I hope that made some sense, because it made perfect sense at the time. Also, I felt a totally positive self-image. I had lost about 50lbs from that point last year, I felt healthier than ever, I had only started smoking, and truly expanding my mind in that year, and I really only gained friends, these friends within that year. I absolutely loved every part of me at that moment, and I even appreciated greatly that I appreciated myself so greatly.

Anyway, after some time of that, it was probably after 5 at that point, we decided to walk over to an eatery at the other side of campus, and we'd meet up with another friend there, since she was just finishing up class. The walk there was quite intense, since I was still strongly chronospacially tripping. A common thing that would happen would be for me to continue walking, with no idea how I was doing it, since it felt like my head and my thoughts were just sort of floating around. Random things in my peripheral vision, including the ground, stopped existing in my view of the world, my arms felt weird, time felt weird, etc. Again with that three different answers for time deal, I honestly thought it took an hour to walk there, I knew it was only about 10-15 minutes, and part of me wanted to believe that it was basically instant. Walking around people once we got out of the woods was interesting - it was the same experience with them as it had been earlier, only to a greater degree, and also I had no idea where I was, every knowledge of where I was, and my periphery was going in and out of existence. For parts, I felt like I could, not see, but know the entire path of where we were going and coming from, all at once, and other times, I was just floating thoughts again. At one point, while we were walking past a few buildings, I had entirely believed that we were one path to the right of where we were - it's not that I was visually tripping, but I had entirely interpreted what I had seen completely wrong. That's where I learned a lot about how our other senses relate to the chronospatial, looking back.

We eventually made it. I wasn't hungry (I wasn't expecting to be), although I did need a drink. This was going to be a challenge. This facility was a few different types of food all in one, with different cashiers and lines for food. I'd been there maybe twice before, but this time was really a challenge - I have always had social anxiety related to not knowing how to do certain social processes, and I realized, after wandering around for a tiny bit like an idiot, that I had no idea what to do. I ended up waiting in the Mexican food line with my friends, although I didn't want any food. When the lady asked me what I wanted, I told her that I just wanted a drink, and she said that I didn't have to wait in line, that I could go right ahead to the register. I still had no idea how to do this without cutting a line, so I told her it was alright, and only looked like a bit of an idiot. The most important part was that I not look like a tripping idiot, and I think I pulled that off. Anyway, I bought the large drink cup finally, and went over, wanting unsweetened iced tea. I filled an entire large cup with sweetened before figuring out how to get unsweetened - in retrospect I should've asked one of my friends to help me with that. It was alright, the artificial sweetener was bad, especially in that quantity, but it was liquid, and that helped.

We sat outside, in some of the most comfortably proportioned wooden chairs that have ever existed, and talked about the day, about how done we were with school, etc. There were a lot of people around (it was the start of the dinner rush), and they were all talking about the same things. I spent most of the time half listening, half letting my thoughts bounce around - to the outside, it looked like I was totally spacing out half the time. That period of time lasted for a while, that friend we were meeting met us there, and as it approached what I guess was 6:00, my other friend left to go to that math test. Around then, we realized that the sun was going to set pretty soon, and that we should totally go somewhere to enjoy it fully. We eventually decided on the hill not far from us that was the tallest hill in the county, and where the city's radio towers were. After another seemingly both forever and instant walk back to dormside, we got ready to go. At this point, that was sort of my last big peak, and was on the comedown from there.

5 or 6 of us packed into my car, and I took shotgun and let one of my friends drive. It's a somewhat powerful (above average, at least) car, and while we were on our way, at one point, I told my friend to gun it in second - and was immediately brought back to the first test drive, the first time I got to experience just how fun that car could be, sitting shotgun because I couldn't even drive stick back then. I also remembered a bit of woods on the north side of campus that I wanted to smoke in at some point that day, and made a mental note of that. We made it to the hill, which I thought was fairly cool. I had wanted to make it up there anyway, because I had always been a bit of a radio geek, and tower farms have always interested me. I really enjoyed walking up the hill, and thought about both the time the last year, my senior year of high school, on our senior trip to the Poconos, and how strikingly similar an experience it was - this sort of end-of-year experience that wasn't all the way at the end of the year, etc. I also thought about how I had never truly appreciated hikes like this with my family. We looked out on the landscape, which was beautiful, but it was hard for me to put into place exactly where everything I was looking at was. It was interesting seeing how still most of the landscape was, and then seeing the highway around the city, and all the streets, totally full of motion, like little ants scurrying around. I thought about what it's like to be in one of those cars, and what it's like to look out and see the whole picture (again, like the logarithms from before). I thought about the fact that I could see this tower farm from my window in my dorm, and tried to find campus, but couldn't figure exactly where it was. We took a look at the sunset, but couldn't get a great view, since it wasn't on the right side of the hill to get a good overlook. My friend who drove did take the opportunity to take some great pictures with the light shining through the woods, and got what is still one of my favorite pictures of me (fortunately, I can show it to people, because you really can't tell what I was on). We chilled up there until the sun went down a bit, and then headed back (the mosquitos weren't as strong as they'd be in a few weeks, but there were some bothering us). We drove back, this time I sat in the back, and I thought about how satisfying it was that the sunset wasn't a satisfying cutoff, I thought about what it was like being in the back of my parent's car as a kid, not knowing the way (although I did have to give directions a few times), and so on.

We made it back, at which point it was late enough that pretty much everyone was out of class. We all headed to my room, since it was the most comfy for holding a lot of people (with the couch and all). Everyone talked about the day, again about how they were done or almost done with school for the year, etc. Just good solid, happy conversation. Also, at one point, I got just a tiny bit of a tactile trip - I started feeling the texture of my pants, the shape of my sunglasses, and so on, and feeling absolutely wonderful for every bit of it. A few of our less close friends showed up to and chilled with us for a bit, there was a little bit of beer left (I didn't take any), etc. There were talks to try to acquire more weed, but that wasn't going so well at that point. After a while, pretty much everyone wanted to play kanjam out on campus somewhere - I didn't want to join because the plan was to also drink and smoke while doing that - I didn't want to risk getting caught like that, so I stayed back for a bit.

It didn't take long to get antsy, I packed myself up my bong and everything I needed to go along with it (at this point I'm maybe feeling +, but convincing myself I was totally sober, although I had the biggest urge in the world to smoke). Since we as a group were basically eniterly out of weed, I had to borrow some from someone else - it's great that everyone on my floor is super friendly, and I'm totally willing to smoke him out later, I just REALLY NEEDED to smoke at that point. It's hard to explain that urge. I'm on my way out, and I run into my friend who had been at her sorority thing of some sort all night thusfar (I hadn't seen her since the first time I went outside), and she happily agrees to go with me to the woods. We head to that spot on the north side that I had made a note to smoke at earlier, I talk about my experience up to now, she talks about her day with the sorority thing, etc. I smoked most of a pack of that bong by myself, as she was still new to the weed game.

The first really bad thing to happen all day was when we were almost done (oh yeah, and smoking was really bringing my trip back up), and we hear some people going around the woods - I bag up the bong (although it's totally set up still), and try to figure out what's going on - nobody ever came out to the part of the woods we were in, so we both sort of assumed it was public safety looking for us. A bit of freaking out later, and it's just some people starting a fire a little further away. We finish up, then get word that the other group was in the woods on the other side of campus. Cool, we'll meet up, hang out, it sounds great.

We leave the woods, and I make sure to stop for a second to look up at the stars - I had wanted to lie down, but the grass was very wet. It was a very clear day, and you could see tons of stars. Two things happened to me during that.  At one point, I totally heard a rave that didn't exist going on around there, and sort of had the experience in my head to some degree - definitely auditory hallucinations, and a bit on that chronospatial, but not too much. Also, for the first time I totally understood constellations. I had always been able to pick out the shapes and such, but this time, I was actually able to see the horses, the people up there, superimposed over the stars. That was pretty cool.

We continued on our way, and made it to the woods, although we weren't yet at our destination. As we were finally approaching the spot, we, and everyone already at the spot, saw a flashlight, followed be somebody in a deep voice yelling 'Hey, there's kids in there!' The way they were talking, it was as though it was the cops, trying to give us a chance to get the hell out of there, because they were looking. I wouldn't have freaked out, since everything I had on me was away, and I felt confident in my ability to refuse a search and whatnot, except that I entirely believed they had drug dogs with them. I panicked pretty badly, along with everyone else, and was trying to decide whether to ditch my stuff or not - I believed the most rational thing to do was to run. I tried to make it to another path that eventually led across a stream and back to dorm side, but I missed the entrance to that (nighttime in the woods is just about the worst situation for trying to get any input from your senses - which led to it being terrifying in both instances), and ended up cornering myself basically in the swamp. All along, I was thinking, if I didn't have all that stuff on me, I was going to check out the situation, see if it actually was the cops, and maybe end the panic altogether. I was really hoping that someone would do that, and not long after thinking that, it sounded like someone was doing that, although I had entirely believed that, from the sounds of it, it actually was the cops, and that there was no way out of it for me. I should also mention that, since I had already been caught earlier in the year, if I got caught again, I was basically out of school, which basically meant I was afraid for my life. Just a little more of that panic, before it all came out that the 'cops' were some drunk third-years who were playing a bit of a prank while they were looking for one of thier friends who had made his way through the woods somewhere. I was not the only one to thank them for the experience - now that we knew it was totally safe, I realized that I had not been that absolutely terrified in a long time, and in retrospect, it was thrilling. I honestly believed that I was not safe, and that doesn't come up often.

We made our way back to the dorms - I can't recall if we went out again after that, so I'll say we didn't. We all talked over what had happened for a bit, and then, because it was still a weekday, slowly started going off to bed. At that point it was around midnight, and I myself made it into bed.

The next day, I was mentally exhausted, did hardly anything, and still went to sleep early. Both that day and the day after, when I smoked, I was brought back very slightly into my trip, although even at its strongest, it was barely a ++. I have not experienced any other flashbacks since.

I'm 15 an I live in manchester,england and I had a fucking weired experience on holiday in majorca.I was out on the beach one morning when a guy came up 2 me and asked if I wanted sum 'stuff' he then whiped out a bag of skunk and some blotters,I was aprehensive about the acid as I had never tried it before but I decided to buy a couple of trips and some skunk.Later at the hotel I met up with a friend and had a couple of joints out of the window.I then took a tab in the lift.When I got off I saw a hypnotist in the bar asking for volenteers,so naturaly I got up there.He told me I was going to give up smoking, so he sat me down and he told me to  close my eyes and let my mind drift,which was easy as I was stoned and hallucinating slightly!!! I then found my self in the most relaxed 'floaty' mood I have ever experienced in my life.The colours were drifting round my face,I wasnt sure if I was in a trance or tripping.Next thing I remember was waking up in my room 6 hours later totally awake and alert. I was told the next day that the hypnotist couldnt wake me and a doctor had been called!I have recently tried to recreate this experience with no effects near the ones I experienced before.

My name is Casey, I go to college in Oklahoma. All the years of highschool I had wanted to trip but in our little town, acid is unheard of. I finally got the chance last Feb. 13. Lucky thirteen!

The day before the trip I get a phonecall from my friend Slim, he informs me that he found some acid (obviously knowing I would be interested). I was excited. I told him I wanted to drop early in the morning, so I could see the sunrise. Which was supposed to be the cool 'trip' thing to do, according to my friends. 

I arrived at his house about 5am, he was already up and ready to drop (this was his first too). He presents a piece of wrinkled tin foil about the size of a playing card, he unfolded, and inside I counted six little scooby doo heads. I couldn't wait!!!

We decided to split it up down the middle and go for broke. We drop our hits at the same time and stare at each other, for a moment before laughing at each other. We were nervous and very excited at the same time.

About 5:30, the sunlight is starting to show a little. I feel nothing, slim says he is starting to feel it. He said he felt like he was in a rollercoaster. This was the last thing I remember him saying for quite awhile, because at that instant the sun peaked up over the hills, and my trip began explosively. The sun came up, and it was the most glorious thing I have ever seen, I heard the william tell overture throughout the suns magnificent arrival to our day. The sun radiated off waves of light in synch with every symbol crash of the symphony going on in my brain. This lasts what seemed like hours but being perfectly content with it, I didn't mind. 

Im interrupted by Slim saying something about the sun winking at him. I stare at him for a second, and begin laughing hysterically. We both fall on the floor laughing and talking about what we saw during the sun's appearance, acting like a couple jocks winning the championship. It was the most amazing thing I had ever seen in my life. I was in love with LSD. I have since tripped maybe 500 times, I have never had a bad trip. I have never felt better in my life.

At the time of my experience I had been experimenting with hard drugs for about one month but so far had only taken ecstasy and cocaine. On this night me and a few of my friends had planned to buy some mdma and have a fucked uo night. The person who supplied the mdma did not have the ammount that we requested however but we bought what he had which was 0.6 grams. I dropped 0.2 grams of the mdma and thoroughly enjoyed myself for a few hours.

My friend, who had taken lsd before, informed me that he could get some if I wanted to do it. We headed off to get the acid and once we got it I dropped a tab.

Once we had returned to my friends house I began to trip pictures and people in the room swirling in mad patterns this was amazing.   For me, LSD the affects can last for hours and eventually after destroying pumpkins, laying against a wall, eating mass amounts of sweets and pulling endless toots the acid began to get very boring and eventually I wish it away.

Soon after this me and my friends decided to try and sleep I remember trying to watch the film the devil's rejects but becoming confused every few seconds as to what was a trip and what wasn't. I layed down and tried to sleep and all that I can remember where two red lights dashing around the ceiling and seeing a young girl running towards me with a hand full of flowers. There was nothing but white and she began to hit me with the flowers. I then awoke and in a very confused state sat up and questioned my friend as to  'what the fuck we did the night before. His answer was one that I will never forget 'I don't know but for some reason I'm wearing a bra.'

I wanted to experience whatever LSD gives you, and this may have been the only chance I have to do it in a very long time, so I decided to drop two tabs. Apparently these tabs were Pure L and 250 ug each. I got a little nervous after having heard that, but I didn't panic. I did it with two friends, and my girlfriend. One of the friends, along with my girlfriend, dropped one tab, where I dropped two and our more experienced friend dropped three, (fuckkng 750 ug)

So at first I didn't know what to expect, and then euphoria came. Everything was funny, and I mean everything. We just looked at dumb memes on this huge tv that was in the room and laughed our asses off for about two hours, and then shit got weird. At some point someone turned on dark side of the moon, and I was laying in bed watching the ceiling melt. My girlfriend is an artist, so she had s bunch of her pieces hug up around her room. They looked so Trippy, especially the self portraits, I thought the paper was melting off the wall. At one point my experience friend said he was seeing waves so my new friend starts explaining longitudinal and transverse waves to him, asking what he was seeing, and eventually he comes to the conclusion that he was seeing surface waves. There is a napkin with waves drawn all over it, along with the words help, night vale, and the number 17. We started watching these videos, these Trippy as fuck videos like double King, fever the ghost (source) and elephant garden. I thought they were super cool, my new friend got freaked out by them. In one of the videos there's a pair of dancing shadow guys with masks. And I swear to God I was seeing them in the corner of my eyes all day. This was the best part of the trip to me, nothing was really making sense and all that we were doing was laying on the bed or looking into mirrors. The house is actually an apartment, with two floors. We agreed to stay in her room for the peak, but I really really wanted to go outside for like 10 seconds to look at the sky, unfortunately it was a gray and cloudy cold as fuck day, so there wasn't really anything to see.

About two hours after that we all eventually came to a consensus that we wanted to go walk to the park, something that was about a 15 minute walk away. My girlfriend kept trying to say stuff like 'oh it's gone now' 'I'm not high anymore' but then I would ask 'is the sky still moving' and she would accept that she was still tripping balls. We got to the park, no body was there. My experienced friend and I were just playing this this musical xylophone thing built into the play ground. Every now and then I would hear the song from that video, and I would see the little mask guys dancing in the shadows somewhere, at first it scared me but then I realized they're nice and I started to like it. This is when my girlfriend and my new friend started to have a bad trip. They both got filled with anxiety and were super nervous for no real reason, they kept saying that someone is gonna catch us, something bad is gonna happen, even though we were just some teens at a park. I calmed them down a bit and made them start enjoying it again, but then my new friend started to black out.

We immediately went back to my girlfriends place, making sure that the new friend did not fall or pass out. As we were walking me and the experienced guy started talking about some super weird shit, and now there is s video of me walking down the street sayin 'wub wub, wub wub wub' as a sentence and then getting a response of wubs from my friend back. At one point I said 'one wub unto the many' and we thought it was the deepest shit ever. Anyway eventually we got back to the room and chilled there. My new friend curled up in a ball in a chair and started talking about how much he misses his girlfriend, so we gave him a stuffed animal and named it his girlfriends name, which calmed him down a bit.

We went back to the park a few times, nothing too weird happened, colors changing and shit being weird, the usual. Then it was 10:30 pm, when we had to go home. We had already agreed not to drive, and we left the car back at my place and took the bus to my girls in the morning, but now we had To go back. The bus we took earlier was not running any more. It was 40 degrees Fahrenheit outside. It was raining. I was on acid. So we start our journey to the train, cold and wet at balls. We get to the train station and my experienced friend says 'gotta take a piss Brb' so he jumps the train tracks to god knows where to go piss. He gets back like 30 seconds before the train gets there, that made me nervous. We take the train to a transit center, then wait for THIRTY MINUTES at MIDNIGHT, TWENTY FEET FROM COPS, while its raining and cold. Some homeless people try to finagle us out of our money, but they give up eventually. That was the longest thirty minutes of my life. Eventually we get on the correct bus and get back to my house, where it took me like an hour to fall asleep.

So, I didn't have an epiphanies, nothing really deep realized about myself, it was just a fun time. My girlfriend didn't have the best Time, but she was nervous because we were at her house, she she's willing to try again. My new friend doesn't want to do it ever again, he just wants to stick with weed. My girlfriend realized she's too uptight about stuff and my friend realized he's An anxious piece of shit, and I just had fun. Hopefully that's not a bad thing for dropping 500 ug after never drinking smoking or doing any drug ever before.

My First Acid Trip at School

It was about 10:30 when my friend gave a me 3 tabs of the acid(1 for me and the other 2 weere my friends)my friend took a corner of hers right away to try it out...3 periods after I decided to try it out so I took about half of it at like 12:30 and kept it under my tongue for 30 minutes and about 40 minutes later after I took it, it started to kick in. I felt really happy and giggly, my entire body felt like it was tingling  and the. Last period came so i took the rest of the tab and so I was in Spanish just watching home alone laughing.there was 20 minutes left till school ended and I got called up to the assistant principles room.

Once I got there he said I heard some rumors about u and some kids trying acid...I said no and the nurse came up to look at pupils...that's when it really kicked in and her face looked like it was melting..they let the buses leave and they started checking my pockets and back pack bc my pupils where the size of the fuckin moon. I ended up getting detention bc j had a vape in my pocket. They grabbed my pockets and totally missed the acid so that was good but then all three of the assistant principles were in the room asking me what I took...I said nothing and they brought me to my asistwnt princluples office where they called my dad...the carpet was beutiful and and patterns and colors everywhere where amazing. He had me sit in a conference room until my parents came to pick me up. I sat there just amazed staring at this chair stretch and shrink, move closer and farther and there was this window with this huge tree that just looked amazing. The whole room was turning green and red and orange and there were flowers all offer the floor and I look at myself in a glass window and my hair was like floating up and glowing. Supriseingly I wasn't scared or anxious at alm throughout this and when my mom heard I was on acid she told them my eyes where big because I took an adderall that day so they would let me go home.

I got home and just took a shower after I had this convo with my mom...she didn't care too much that I was on acid bc I had good grade in school and am mostly mature (she might have thought that I had only ate a pot brownie) The shower was amazing and there were patterns all over the tiles and my dad was playing the drums downstairs and so that was cool. After I got out of the shower I walked out of the bathroom to find my sister, her friend, my mom, and my moms friend talking them not even knowing I'm on acid tripping hard. I danced around my room for a little bit and had so many thoughts flowing thinking about life. 

Later that night at like 7 my friend who also took that day came over and his face at like tribal symbols over his face and we just talked about the next day and what we were seeing...I ended up falling asleep looking at the closed-eye visuals which looked like this rainbow of intense colors my eyes have never seen before.

The musings of an idiot.

As I listen to kate bush
I feel the beauty of one who experiences beyond the fringes of normality.
Such beautiful music and passion . I am left strengthless to tryto explain.
She has found what isimportaint to her and has managed to make a living at it.
How fortunate she is How jealous I feel!
Andyet howcanyoustay angrywhenyouaredisarmeedby the beautyofthemusic.
Andshe managed to capture those moments that you aspireto. Yet cant find the time to create these momentsyourself. Or if you are busy trying to create such moments
You have no need of the means, but why deny it? Why Hide it.If you cant stick at anything for morethan a few seconds than all it needs is to be posted on erowid
With a dosage and bodyweight, likethat was supposed to influence anyone whomiight be one triip away from a permanent vacation.

The truth will be explained later, if only it were that simple. If the answers to all of your questions were so fucking obvious when you werent tripping your nutsoff then maybe we would all be betteroff.(thestickyspacebar syndromekind of addstothe effect doesnt it?)


Yes its all beautiful, ifyou want to close youreyes to the decaying mind and body of the user,addict.
I will never deny that I am a user.
I will defendit to my grave. Which I feel every trip I take will hasten such a journey.

Yet I relish in them more than I should.
To put it plainly is never difficult ifyou are tripping. Yet tryto put relevance to those thoughts to anyone whomightgive a shit to and. 

Absolute
Definite
What kind of bullshit are youtryiing tofeed me
The only thing that is absolute when youcomeupwith this shit is your  (Insert world altering phrase here)
Eg. Insanity
Lack of sobriety
Candor
Sense of futility
Helplessness
Despair
And yet.. If I stop the pnk floyd album..

Hope
For the future of mankind, or at least a tiny private bit of my sanity that is all that I can hold onto until the next trip.

amazing experience

I began to feel the effects an hour after ingestion of a liquid hit dropped on a sugar cube. At first I saw mild distortions of shapes and objects began to look funny. Shortly after I had stopped writing in my journal because I believed it would be better to fully enjoy the experience and forget about logging the details.

My senses were mixing with everything around me. I tasted lights. I felt as if everything around me was a flowing texture of sensory data and emotion. I felt heavenly. Everything felt right. I felt like I was doing the right things with my life, and that I was treating people the way they should be treated. I could not understand at the time how someone might have a bad trip on this stuff.

I had visual hallucinations but the emotional charge on objects around me was what moved me the most. I had visual hallucinations but the emotional charge on objects around me was what moved me the most. I ignored most aspects of the visual hallucinations and focused on what intrigued me the most. It felt extremely spiritual.

This was a very profound experience, but I was in a safe setting and it lasted 12 hours.

The next day, I felt charged. I feel like quitting drinking, and I feel motivated and goal-oriented. I feel 'fixed'. I am confident. I do not regret it the least bit.

[Erowid Note: 
The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] 

I have taken LSD several times, usually between 2 and 4 'hits'.  With this particular batch, I felt the hits were fairly potent.  I decided to take 9 in my dorm room.  (5 days ago, I had taken 4 hits, so I probably had a light tolerance built up)

The experience was similar to a 4-hit trip, except the visual hallucinations were more vivid, perhaps more synthetic(?)  Far more interesting for me was the audio.  I had not noticed it until a good 5 hours or so into the trip.  I heard a faint creaking in my mind, sort of like rapid pulses of sound like a modem noise over the telephone.  I found that as I concentrated on this noise, playing it up in my mind, it grew louder.  I could hear distortions of this sort of 'data stream' noise analogous to the settings in an audio program such as Pro Tools or Sound Forge (modulation, frequency, wow-flutter).  Very bizarre and very cool.

Up until this point, I had doubted the notion that LSD could produce auditory hallucinations greater than the sort of 'whirr' that accompanies most serotogenic trips of mine.  Here, the LSD seemed to generate its own stream of sound, independent from all sounds in the room. Here, the LSD seemed to generate its own stream of sound, independent from all sounds in the room.  I tend to view LSD as the most natural-feeling of the 'synthetic' hallucinogens - however, the sounds I heard reminded me more of the synthetic character of, say, 2ci.

I first took the hit in front of the mirror. I went out of the bathroom and held it under my tongue for about 30 minutes then swallowed. I started looking up at the ceiling and saw bugs gathering around the ceiling fan. The patterns on the ceiling looked really intricate like a top-notch old western painting. I knew it was just the Christmas lights reflecting off of the tree. I took LSD for my first and last time that day. It was Christmas break and everybody else took more hits than me so it was like they were in a different world. I wanted to be alone so I went out to my car and when everybody else got in I thought they were trying to set me up. I knew that they were my friends but I just wanted to trip by myself, as I though that was the best way to trip so that I didn't have any distractions.

While I was in my car I stayed up the whole night from 11pm to 12am and went to work while I was coming down. I made pizza and that was the easiest job to trip while I am working. During that time in my car I lost half of my ego. I thought that I turned into somebody else and I had to tell all of my friends that I wasn't really human. I believe that is the true feeling of dying. I turned into something else other than an earthly body. My soul carries on. People may think that the reasoning behind LSD is to seduce people. But the true good trips are those that make one loose their ego and bring one back down to reality. Reality is just an finite spec in time.

LSD is the whole universe thrown into a drug.

The clouds where made of lsd

Every thing is breathing, can you hear it
Every thing is moving
Every thing is soft, hard, and soundless
Melting....
Deeper...
Deeper...
I wish everyone could feel that I do
Skin...
Soft...
Floating away...

' we were waiting for it to kick in, and by the end of the night we were like,' oh thats just a space ship. Thats all.'

We took our drugs around 10, as soon as they kicked in we became wrapped into the movie we were watching, it was snowing in my room, the cold air of the atmosphere, steamed on our skin, like pouring cold water on a hot frying pan.. The room was breathing, walls were bending, we could tell there was a war or something like it going on outside from all the flashing lights and shaking of the room.. I had to pee all the sudden, so I got up to go to the bathroom, the journey 4 feet seemed like a walk across the desert, once inside the bathroom, I could see that my reflection was not me, I thought, who am I, is this what I look like, and why is my face dripping, I'm not sure if I ever even got a chance pee because I became intranced by the character that supposely was my reflection.. I remember thinking to myself, this is my reality, and if yours is anywhere close to mine, then your fucked...

Lsd and the spirit

It was A gloomy October 31st...yes it was all hallows eve. Me and my friend who will be called J set out on A journey. Our minds clear and deep we purchased some acid. Everything started at 5:00 Pm darkness had just sat in, we are in my apartment we comsume the blotter pieces at 5:30. 45 minuites later my body felt light and I sat up to shake it off. After this time had passed I felt like I have never taken a drug before. My friend J was also feeling the same effects. We decided to go out and walk the town as soon as I set foot outside I suddenly became strangely inebriated. The external world became changed as in a dream. Objects appeared to gain inrelief; they assumed unusual dimensions; and colors became more glowing. Even self-perception and the sense of time were changed. When the eyes were closed, colored pictures flashed past in a quickly changing kaleidoscope. After a few hours, the not unpleasant inebriation, which had been experienced whilst I was fully conscious, disappeared. I came back to reality for a moment and relized there were two cops talking to me saying son what have you injested? I said Lsd; I thought to myslef he cant do anything he cant prove anything so I told my story. He took my firend and I back to our apartment and we walked in and sat and let the Lsd dive into our minds.

End

I took the hits around 7 p.m. on a perfect spring day.  About 20-25 of us were hanging out in a field waiting for it to kick in.  After 30 minutes, I started to get an ongoing rush in my chest, and I went across the field to my friends house and jumped on his trampoline for awhile.

Once I got off the trampoline, I started to feel pretty weird.  I met up with my dealer so I could buy another hit for later.  Me, him, and one other person took off on bikes.  My dealer stopped and looked at me and when he turned around he looked very wavy and he told me to give him the money.  For a second I thought he was robbing me, but of course, he was just going to get the stuff.

Me and the other kid sat on the curb waiting for him.  While I waited I looked down at the curb next to me and one of the stones there turned into an ant, and then another did, and another, until the ants were crawling all over me.  I started brushing them off and eventually they soaked back into the cement.

On the way back to the rest of the people, we took the train tracks.  As I walked along, I started to hear the increasingly obnoxious crunching of my feet on the coal, only when I looked down, I saw piles of brightly colored glass.  I didn't want to get a flat tire, so I picked up my bike.  We got to the end of the tracks and we had to climb down a small hill.  I got to the edge and slipped.  I started to slide down on the glass, but once I reached the end, I was fine,  I never even fell.

Eventually we made our way to another friends house, and after a little while, everybody showed up.  We put in The Wall, and fell into a deep couch.  As soon as the first note was played, I got burst of air in my face.  I leaned over towards my friend and it seemed like the wall of the living room followed me, and I could now see through it.  Another kid walked in, who wasnt tripping, and he sat in the front.  The DVD player shorted out, and without saying anything about it we all yelled at the kid that just walked in.  He stood up and everybody started to make fun of him.  He was really just trying to fix the movie, but I thought he was trying to act like daffy duck and put on a comedy skit.

After that was over we went for a walk.  Me and three others split off from the huge group and went our old middle school.  We sat for there and just tripped face for about an hour, then we decided to go back to the house.  We came to a hill that led down to the road, but we were all afraid to go down.  I decided it would be best to get it over with and jumped in.  I quickly jumped right back out because I thought the tall grass was stabbing me all over.  We found a path down, and we walked the sidewalk back to the house, and on the way, me and my one friend dodged across the street right in front of a cop, but for some reason, he didnt say anything.

When we got back, we just sat around watching horror movies while we were coming down, because it turned out to be Friday the 13th.  Needless to say, that was the craziest night I experienced up to that point.

Acid From Hell

So I had just dropped 2 hits of acid questioning the real strength of this drug and oh boy was I wrong about it

Dosed at midnight, by 1 oclock I was playing halo 2 on my xbox 360 when I got this sudden burst of energy and then I look around the basement and I see all these colors pertruding out of the ceiling tiles. Just to let you know this waas my first time and I was in my basement without any1 to watch me. So then I hurd my dad coming down the stairs so then I ran to my bedroom which was dark and hid uner the covers and closed my eyes. Then I get very sweaty and panicky and started hearing these loud sounds as if my dad came down and through evreything to the ground, and then I questioned reality thinking mayb I was throwing evreything to the ground and I just wasnt seeing it kind of like an out of body expierence, and this terrified the hell out of me so then I opened my eyes and looked around my basement and saw evreything was normal and that ended the peak of my trip

The next couple of hours sucked the worst, I couldnt go to sleep, tremors, loss of appetite and my body tempature went up about 10 degrees and this lasted for the next 16 hours 

I am lucky my trip wasnt worse and the come down of lsd is sucks and I needed about 3 days to recover from it

Tripping

It was friday night and me and my buddies had planned to do acid for the past week. My buddy Shaun supplied the blotter tabs. I had bought four and was only planning on taking two (since this was my first time), but my friends forced me to take them all at once, so I did. It seemed like forever waiting for the acid to start working (45-60 min). When I started to get high I felt like my legs were soaking in a hottub, it was very relaxing. After about 10 min I started to feel the stronger effects, I couldn't stop laughing, even when I thought about hurtfull, depressing events that happened in my life all I could do was laugh about them. 15 minutes later I was still laughing, but I started to see stuff now. The walls of buildings would seem to sway and buckle, trees would seem to sway but there was no wind.I could hear a disturbance all around me (almost like static). I wandered around town like this for a while. There were times when I felt scared, like I was loseing my mind a very overwhelming feeling. I had to find cover so I went to the teen center. I stayed there and tried to watch T.V. In the back room but I couldnt pay attention so I turned it off. The tv then began to almost split apart but not quite,like it was trying to split apart. I then noticed the floor was doing the same thing. I left the teen center and wandered some more. I had lost my friends so I had no direction. I was so obcest with perfection that I lit my swetter on fire outside the fire station cause I had found some dirt on it.I then went home and layed in bed all night trying to sleep. I look forward to acid again.

LSD Experience
Last year in September I took some acid. I was 22 years old and a skinny guy. I purchased some 3 x small card board tabs
Unsure of print or  Pattern. Me and a group of friend's were attending a music festival, I took my 3 tabs about 30-40 minutes from the festival at about 11.30am. I also should say I am a fairly experienced user of LSD with this not being my first trip.

I started to feel the effects as we walked threw the gates and past the boys in blue. It really did hit me hard, I walked with my friends and my one mate who I had tripped with before guide me into the festival, I remember a lot of things going ' klaidescope ' of whatever the spelling. It was really intense, everything was wobbly, and morphing like good acid should be, for a good 2 or so hours we walked around, meeting new people gathering supply's and just exploring, in that time I was just a mess, I don't remember much in that time. I don't remember much in that time. 

We came to the blue stage where some friends went one way some the other so me and a couple of people decided to sit around and wait. I remember sitting there talking to friends and constantly touching the grass,  at this part I remember two things:

1) there was a photo frame set up for people to stand in and it had the stage in the back ground, there was two girls dressed up, I would call them fairy girls,  I asked them to take my picture, one girl replied  'do you have a phone' I didn't really know what I was thinking I just wanted my picture taken and had this thought about me being in a picture in a picture. Lol. I salute the fairy's and sit back with my friends. 

2) Was my trip guiding friend saying something to me, I can't remember what it was but it cracked me up, so much I was in hysterics, I couldn't stop laughing for a good five or so minutes, the proper giggles it was good, what ever my spirit leader said did what he attended it to do. Good fellow 

From there we went and got food, I purchase two sausages rolls and tried to eat them both at same time whilst laughing with myself following my group around, another half hour passes and I come to a point I realise everyone else is dancing and I'm trying to eat sausage rolls. So I THROW my rolls down and dance in victory over those delicious pastry's.

Some time past partying and killing time we came to another stage sitting on the grass, at this point I fairly sore and was laying up and down looking at the clouds and feeling the grass, the clouds were making  triangle patterns into each other. Also there was another moment where I sat up having a cigarette with my eyes closed hallucinating the warmth of the sun made me feel like a golden orb of some sort. The moment past we danced some more seen more people walked around did plenty of things. My trip started to settle a bit and when we were standing at the back of the stage I could see the clouds all flare up like in a time lapse in a big circle all around the stage. It was magical. Over time my trip settled and I could have conversations more and just function normally.

Later in the night towards the end I dropped a cap, I was told to be MDMA, I had a mad rush of heat and threw up about 3 times I had a pretty bad experience from then feeling mainly sick. I surely did feel the M came up and was somewhat peaking on the ride home more then usual it was weird.  I got back to the hotel 12-1am that night and got warm. 

Thanks the end

12 Month old LSD, Doesn't work?

I have taken LSD for around 10 years, smoked Cannabis for 14 years and have tried most other soft drugs. I was at my friends house, we talked about various drugs and the effects, smoked a bit of grass and watched a few videos. Just before I left to go home he said he had some old LSD tabs (about 12 months he said) he brought out the packet, it contained 10 tabs with piece signs draw in red. Goody Goody I thought, ill go home ring a couple of mates get a few vid's in and we'll have a bash. 12 month acid probably won't work anyway I thought.

Got home called 2 of my best mates, it was about 7pm when they arrived. Sat down smoked a bong with hash and downed a Tab with a can of Lager. 30 mins later and a couple of joints nothing was happening(LSD wasn't working) we each ate another LSD tab and smoked another bong, we waited for another 45mins 'nothing'. Must be duff acid, by this time we were pretty stoned so time was starting to be difficult to pin down. It was around 9pm and me and one of my mates ate another acid and smoked another bong, BANG it was almost as-if it was waiting for us to take that one extra. I have had some excellent trips before but this took the biscuit, my friend who had the 2 acid left the house in a hurry saying he had to go(poor guy didn't no what hit him). Thats left me and Dave to finnish the acid our selfs, it get patchy and hard to describe as I'm not great at writing, but I will try, while sitting on the sofa with TV in corner and CD going, my vision became completey detached from what I was looking at, the room was gone, although it was gone it used the same lines which I could see just different? Weird shit. 10 hours later after a bad trip with spiders and fireplaces and curtains we started to surface and get back to talking to each other.

A Tattoo On Acid...

Two days ago, I went to get my second Tattoo done and my first one retouched, and decided, since I don't get tattoos often, and I had a tab with me, I should eat it, and I did, and let me tell you something, NOT A GOOD IDEA, at least not from the acid side, I was so concentrated on keeping the pain away, that I didn't peak on the acid, only after the tattoos where done and I relaxed, I got the acid working, and it was After Peak, I was comming down, and I was never really up, the good part is that I was able to keep most of the pain away thanks to the acid since when I relaxed, the pain also came flaring back with a Bad attitude.

So... Tattoo on acid, A good idea for the pain, A bad Idea for the Acid

The night I did two cubes was a crazy night, the experience was absolutely amazing. I had only done one hit befor I did these two, so it was quite a leap in dosage. In the beginning of the night I was having an amazing amount of fun, riding a bmx around, jumping off stuff, times where good. After maybe 2 hours my peak began, and it was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. The hallucinations where absolutely insane, stuff like trees swaying in the non-existent wind, and clouds forming really beautiful shapes. The most odd thing that I had experienced was what I call 'cone vision' where the middle of my sight seemed closer to me than it really was, while the outer sides of my sight was farther away than it really was.

The whole thing was really an odd experience. Then the anxiety hit me, I cant quite remember how scared I was that night, but I know that the fright was overwhelming. I soon realized, after my trip, that the reason I got so scared was because of the place that I took the cubes in the start. It was new to me, so during the trip, everything seemed new to me, too new, and thats what scared me the most... I think atleast.

First time LSD trip for a constant shroomer

On a clear night, I went to someone's house I didn't know that well with a new good friend of mine from treatment. I have gobbled tons of boomers in my lifetime but I had never experienced acid.

I felt like I knew what to expect: maybe to get a little uneasy  because it would be very intense. But this was not so.
Yes, it was more intense. Things seemed to move much faster than on shrooms. I ended up having sex on acid. This was something that was not planned! I saw stars, tons of them, beautiful stars,slightly deformed stars--- and the scenery was always immaculate. I studied everything, because there was so much demention, and it didn't have any similar hallucinations to shrooms. This was an individualized drug, I must say. Completely unexpected. I remember looking at a Kurt Cobain poster. Kurt was winking, smiling and even slightly flirting with me through his stares.I laughed at lot, this drug is so beautiful, I seemed to be seeing chinese dragons in trees and such, it was SO beautiful. Everything was.

The next 2 days I felt a little dead/emotionless but it all comes back.

Me and a friend had taken many hits of LSD before this intense experience. I was very educated on the drug and had a sincere passion for its effects. We got our hands on some LSD-25 blotter papers made in Switzerland. I took 3 and a half and he took two. We layed down on the end of my dock around 6 oclock looking up at the sky waiting for the LSD to kick in and the sun to start setting. About 1 hour and a half after taking it the most ridiculous things started appearing in the clouds, we saw many faces glaring at us. The clouds moved to form a huge spiral in the sky covering the entire sky. My mind and spirit left my body. I felt like I had no control over myself or anything else around me I went wherever the doses took me. Many other things happened during my trip that by the way lasted 16 hours. LSD is fun.

I can hear the music harsh rattling whirr and thump - marching human automaton technology rattling the ceiling up the stairs places crazy living noise party on the upper floors of the high-rise, banners draped from the uppermost windows block the light to the top half of the building. The lift doors all open into the black shaft makes a great image in the mind falling falling through the void crack! My head catching the steel girders of the shaft in hard fast deathpain clanging silence still falling. Real blackness now that would really whack bounce right off skull cracking on that steel edge. 

In this corridor is an old joystick arcade machine smashed screen behind circuit boards and panels are visible - a row of glowing oblong panels shoots from behind me just past my right eye and into the distance - click click - whirrr - patterns like Mayan idols line the outer extremes of my vision, dancing - morphing with solid liquid technology of mercury and hard frictionless plastic tac - seeds dying and reborn inside patterned in spiral matrix - in the party people are decoding - parts breaking off into reams of numerical digits and light - split like bad tracking - blips inherent in my system blocked messages of violence images seem to skip and freeze randomly - eyes roll in the sockets - lesbians with space cadet jackets held down below the shoulders mooch around sporting booze and fags, rat-hair matted layers give her extra. Huge rubbish piles and abandoned hoardings rot and overlap damply in a corner - in one room sun shines brightly through a solitary exposed window white as someone touches my neck inaudible whispers coolly into my ear Im watching the fenced road scarred concrete block landscape wracked with steel and synthetic frames the planet is a concrete and steel ice crystal in all directions splaying, growing outwards - cheek touch in the shiny milk light of the room. 

Another room steel sounds rain down force from the ceiling big black bags around this guys eyes like coal sacks all the way to the ears cap peak coming over straight darkening mechanic. Another room dusty, dark, empty time delaying. Another room he comes down on his victim heavy with a fist I see it all blood spurting out of his nose and mouth - sledgehammer - smash the huge lump of metal crashes up through the edge of his jaw shattering tooth and bone across the room man drops death gurgling head coming apart - Get out! Run! Leave the building blood from the victim splattered on my shirt mind spinning sickening turns - get away from there! Go! Darkness spinning in from all sides.

Last year, when I was 16 years old when I did acid to trip for the first time, previous times I had did 25I-NBOME which I identified by its strong metallic and bitter taste. The only reason I know this was truly LSD was because I had got caught at school smoking and they searched me, they found the LSD tablets on me and gave them to the cops to be tested, I later discovered through the police department it was indeed LSD. Also to note I dont remember a whole lot from this trip so I apologize for the choppy sequence of events. 

I was stoked to do acid for the first time and I was hyped for spring break, I chose my room as the place to trip. I took one tablet of 200 μg LSD the day I got out of school for spring break. I let the paper sit on my tongue for about 30 minutes and then I chewed it up and swallowed it. It was around 8:30 pm and I kept looking in the mirror to see if my eyes were dilated, they werent. I kept waiting as I layed in my bed. I cant remember whether I was meditating as I waiting for it to kick in or what. 

Eventually it did kick in and the first thing I remember doing is rolling around in my bed, laughing to myself. Then my sister came into my room, apparently I disturbed her by rolling around too much in my bed or something. To my surprise I was able to talk to her normally and I told her I was sorry and Id try to keep to keep it down. The reason why I was rolling around so much is because I loved he way the acid made my body feel, silky and elevated, and my head felt just wierd, but I enjoyed every second of it 

The next thing I remember doing is stripping out of my clothes and walking around in my room stark naked. I think I might have been dancing for a few seconds too. After a while I got horny and decided it would be a fantastic idea to jerk off on acid. It took a bit of effort but it was worth it because when I orgasmed I closed my eyes and a explosion of color took life under my eyelids and the orgasm felt sublime. 

After masturbating I laid in my bed, and decided just to let my new found euphoria take over. I was rubbing my hands up and down my body and I just kept drooling, I let it roll down my face and down my neck. I let my mind wander as I laid on my bed, It felt like I was floating but not at the same time. After a while I decided to get out of bed to use the restroom, before doing so I decided to put my clothes back on incase someone saw me. I took a piss and it felt strange peeing on acid, I felt it run through my entire system before leaving my body. After that, I just sat on the toilet seat and noticed my skin looked very stange, my veins looked like snakes slithering underneath my skin. As I left the bathroom, my mom was standing outside the door asking me if I was alright, I said I just had to use the bathroom really bad and she believed me.

Around 1 or 2 am I picked up my D.S. and started to play New Super Mario Bros. Quite frankly I was disappointed that it didnt look trippier on acid. And after that I decided to go to sleep. The next morning I felt the effects had completely gone away. However I look back on this experience as a positive one and I would do it again.

Hello guys I just thought I would share the best trip of my life that happened the other day

I ended up getting a Vial of LSD from a friend of mine containing a few drops of L. I ended up using the drops of course and was left with an empty Vial. This was some very strong acid and when I did it before 2 drops on a sour patch kid send me to another dimension. Little did I know what I was in for with this rinse.

12:00 p.m. dosed 4 mg of Klonopin and went to my friends. 

12:45 p.m start feeling the effects of the klonopin, my body is feeling loose and relaxed this is when I decide to light up a joint. 

1:00 arrive at my friends hung out with him and his family and smoked a few bowls before I had to leave. This is when I was feeling great.

2:00 p.m. arrive back at home and begin contemplating on enjoying a trip but did not want  to waste the acid due to the klonopin.

3:00 p.m. I finally decide to trip, but how? I have tabs and the coal but I decided to use the vial to see if a rinse is as strong as everyone says. I begin to pour a small amount of bottled water into the vial. I begin to squeeze it on the cap repeatedly and shaking it as hard as possible . I decide to put enough water in it for 2 doses and that was a great idea for me because if I did it all I would have lost it. I began to put half the liquid in my mouth and swallow. 

3:30 rolled a joint to smoke before the trip began, but I'm too late. I was already tripping hard. I begin to smoke and the acid is heavy. I start to become paranoid because I have never felt a come up this strong.

4:30 begin to peak hard. Tracers are everywhere. No matter what I look at it is morphing and tracing into multiple objects. And the colors wow was this a colorful trip. I was feeling so amazed by this drug. I feel like the acid is massaging my body, I feel so comfortable. I texted my friend and wanted to go hangout with him since I was tripping hard all by myself. The road looked like a cartoon. The trees were swaying everywhere and since it was a rainy day the rain literally was red, green, purple, and pink.

5:00 arrive at my friend's safely. We began to play games and he decided Cuphead would be perfect for me and boy was he right. The cartoon game was full of colors and tracers. he took a glance at my eyes and there was no color. I looked in the mirror and seen myself but it looked like my whole face was covered in eyes, weird. We wanted to smoke but I left the weed in my car so I went to get it. It must've took me 20 mins to find it even though I knew where it was. My mind was everywhere. It was dark outside and the rugs to my car seemed like arms reaching for me. This was scary but then I finally found it and went in to smoke. We smoked some bong packs and it was blast off time again. I stayed at his place watching Rick and Morty and playing Cuphead it was fun but it was midnight now so I had to leave. I was coming down slowly now but the dark seemed to have light. The rain was still colorful even in the dark. I make it home and decide to watch some music videos.i began to feel tired around 3 a.m. and I had to work at 7 a.m. so I decided to lay down. I close my eyes and wow I see so many things. The closed eyes visuals lead me to a dream like state and I finally fall asleep. 

I feel as if I got the full effects from the drug and saw the world in another way. I have tripped many times but this was the best. Please be safe and I hope this was a good description but it's hard for me to remember the details.

SO last night I decided to take acid for only the second time in my life. The first time I was 18 and I hated it but I have read a lot about the therapeutic benefits of LSD and thought it would help me to heal. I was on my own in the flat and put some calming music on.

I took half a tab at 3pm, and then didnt feel anything so took another half, half hour later, and then again another half, half hour after that. By 5pm I was wasted, I couldnt see properly or stand up, I ended up falling into my bed and just closing my eyes, I cant remember anything that happened, only my mind was racing so fast, I couldnt sleep, I was tossing and turning, so hot and sweaty and uncomfortable, and then finally at 4am I started to feel a little normal again. I was meant to go to work this morning but I was a right mess after no sleep. I'm feeling ok now, 24 hours post drug injestion, but I was just wondering what other peoples experience was. Did I take too much, was the environment not good? I must say I never want to take it again! I have DMT and find that a much more powerful and healing experience.

I woke in the summer morning at my parents cape house and had the urge to have an LSD experience. I took 200ug after waking up not worrying about being around my parents whilst on the substance. I sat on the couch in the living room listening to music and watching the tv waiting for the substance to kick in. Within 30 minutes I could feel the effects coming on. It felt simply wonderful. I was relaxed, excited, and enthusiastic about the experience to come. I felt at home as the psychedelic headspace began to take hold as I've had many experiences before and know how to navigate through the experience. I was eating a banana and enjoying a cup of coffee when I started to notice tracers from the motion of things and people. My thoughts were clear as ever and the effects felt simply wonderful. I had no qualms about being around my parents. As a matter of fact, I felt more at ease around them than I usually do, which was great. We decided we were going to have a beach day. The car ride to the beach was fun. I sat, composed, listening to music. It sounded wonderful. When we arrived at the beach, the visual effects were noticeable. The clouds had geometric royal-esque appearances to them. Watching the birds fly around above the water was amusing as the sun shone down on the shore. The headspace during the experience was wonderful. This was no doubt the correct dose for the occasion. The landscape was perfect for the experience. Colors were vibrant and the landscape were fantastic to view. Sitting in a chair on the beach, watching the scene in front of me couldn't have been less grand. It was an experience for the ages.

One day when experimenting I decided to drop some LSD, not necessarily for recreational purposes, and not to ever be intended again but to expand my consciousness and realize that there are other things to be known out their other than what we can see, also for spirtitual awareness, I theorized this whole concept that everything is connected we are all one, we all link to each other and all exist together as god. We are all god this experience was so amazing that it changed my life forever I realized that the world, universe and life is black and white, not literal yet figuratively. There is always an opposite of something no matter what one thinks it is there is something somewhere that is the EXACT opposite of anything one can think of. I experienced this whole world and shared my own experiences with others. I look at LSD not as a drug, yet a tool for knowing and prepairing for what we will be when we leave this plane. On my trip fractals also came in to play and the literal circle of life hallucination, which was EXTREMELY spiritual and I will never forget for the rest of my entire time spent on this plane. I realized that fractals are found everywhere in the universe which other scientists have also discovered but I realized that the infinite of these fractals are forever because the answer to the question of life is always going to try to be found in everything including the earth, which I believe is a living animal just as us. Fractals are these questions left to search for the answer for life, forever and ever searching for this logical explanation, which will never logically be answered. Since my life was changed that night I knew that their was another plane other than where we are living, that is the complete opposite of this material plane, scientist have also discovered something known as anti-mater which has been created in huge pipe tubes at labs underground, scientists discovered that when they get electrons traveling fast enough they put it through and anti siphon filter that turns the charge of the positive electron to a negative. This negative electron is known as Anti-matter and thus is basically a mirror image of the original electron itself this anti-matter is exactly what matter is not. There is a whole other world out there that does exist that we cannot see but 
is very real, as a matter in fact even more real than matter itself here on earth that we are all eventually going to experience.

I've taken acid quite a few times in the past. I've had many good trips, such as wandering in what seemed like an enchanted forest with friends to extremely bad trips like hours of not being able to breath properly with my heart pounding in my ears. I've never had a trip even remotely like the one I had about fifteen years ago.

I took some with another girl. She ended up scratching her skin to bloody pieces thinking things were crawling all over her. I totally felt like I perceived another reality. I couldn't move my body as it was just a bunch of molecules moving around. I couldn't see our three dimensional world at all. The air around me was alive and moving, and I saw many dwarf-like beings moving around intently doing things, but unaware that I could see them. My body was melted into the atmosphere so I couldn't move. To this day I'm convinced that the drug somehow opened my awareness to another dimension that we normally can't sense. Ever since that trip I feel like perhaps there is other life out there, but with our human perceptions, we can't begin to understand them.

Do you think I'm crazy? Was it lsd that I took? Have you heard of anyone else having a similar experience? Why did the other girl have a dif experience? Did we take dif amounts? Were we poisoned? I don't recall the specifics, other than we were told the tabs were saved from the '60's and there might have been two different kinds. The thing I will never forget is that was the most far out trip I've ever had, and it altered my belief systems and brought a whole new way of thinking. After all, we are just a bunch of molecules, perhaps somehow all joined together...

My First Time

I had gotten the purple microdots from my friend Tommy who had taken them before and agreed to be my guide.  At about 9 pm we dosed and then just chilled and listened to music as we waited.  What happened next can only be described as full on hallucination of mind body and soul.  Vision of pure fantasy, feelings of pleasure and joy and an awakening of my soul to the universe.  These visions lasted for only three or four hours before I could tell that they were waning. 6 am was the greatest sunrise ever.  All that day after my face hurt from all the smiling I had done the night before.  Flashbacks lasted for many months but never eclipsed that first experience. There can only be a one first time and one should always use a guide.

A friend and I took one tab of a new batch that I got recently, looking forward to a nice trip with a walk in Central Park. Unfortunately, even though I purposefully didn't take my meds that morning, it wasn't enough time for them to dissipate enough to actually get a real trip out of it. I *felt* slightly trippy (eg a tiny bit queasy) and if I let my eyes relax and stared at a tree or whatever I could get a little bit of visuals, but my friend reported a really heavy, good trip with lots of visuals and I didn't have that at all. 

I looked the next day and apparently it takes 16 days for Abilify to be out of your system, and 5 days for Wellbutrin. I had thought because they're not SSRIs it'd be enough to just not take them that day and they wouldn't dampen the LSD, but I was wrong, oh well.

I'm somewhat new to the psychedelic drug world.  I've done mushrooms a few times, with decent results and salvia divinorum with no results.  Having been blasted with the idea that LSD is the ultimate psychedelic, I was prepared for intensity of my first trip, which never came.

The drug simply made me think, for a really long time.  I was awake for hours having these seemingly in depth conversations with my friend.  At one point at about 6:30 am, we went outside to watch the sunrise and I was awe stricken and humbled by the heavens above.  At one point a jet passed by and it was so intense I fell to my knees.  I was simply humbled by the drug, and was not getting any visual affects from it.  My friend took the same dose, and he's done LSD many times before, and he tripped pretty hard, so I know the acid was good.

When we went inside, this was pretty comical.  We ran into my friends father who, of course asked why we were outside at 7am, and we calmly explained to him that we were on acid and couldn't sleep.  We had a brief conversation and proceeded back to my friends room.

It was only at this point I noticed any visuals at all, perhaps because of the changes in lighting from outside to inside.  I noticed his floor waving like water, it was a blue carpet.  Most noticeable was his face began melting and moving in ways similar to the animation in the movie 'Waking Life'.  I mentioned it to him, and he laughed, happy that I had any visuals at all.

Next time, he recommended smoking marijuana to increase the liklyhood of a visual experience.  I may do it again, but not very soon, it's really not worth it at this point.

Nothing..on acid

My friends Chris and Alex were over at a good friend of theirs' house one friday night, and I had to work. I was planning on going over there and dropping acid for the first time after work, but things didn't work out well. I ended up over at Chris' apartment the following Wednesday, and I dropped my two hits then.

My history with psychedelics is as follows: I have eaten chocolates on several occasions, I frequently eat DXM, I have tried morning glory seeds, and of course I smoke herb on a daily basis.

Anyway, I popped the two hits in my mouth at around 7:30 and sucked on them for a good 5 minutes, making sure that they were soaked into my tongue, and then swallowed them. I jammed with Chris for a while, not really paying attention to anything. About an hour later, I realized that I was not experiencing any effects. Alex suggested that my onset was just slower than most people's. I didn't want to believe it, but I did and went outside to smoke a cigarette. At 9:45 I was beginning to think that Alex had fucked me over with fake acid, but I watched him cut my hits from the same blotter him and C had done the previous Friday. I kept waiting for any psychedelic effects, but they never came and I finally went to sleep around 4:30.

Let me also say that I have eaten chocolates before to extremely minor, if any, effects. Meanwhile, Chris always trips out of his mind when he eats those.

I don't understand why I could eat these psychedelics and not feel a damn thing?

Just me and a friend in my apartment. Took 2 doses and it came on quick. My friend turned on some Grateful dead and we sat with our eyes closed. Now about the time that space came on I was in a world of pros and cons. I was looking at every action and it was spinning off into infinite possibilites. I have been to this place many times and I was totally comfortable here. Then a sound came into my being. It was disrupting me. In that moment when I thought that I couldnt take it anymore and I was about to pop a very funny thing happend.   My head opened like a lotus, and I ejected into space. For a moment I was sitting weightless totally content and at peace with the infinite. Then infront of me a vibration started. It was was almost like space and time was ripping apart. I started to become restless and afraid. Then out of nothing something started to appear. At first it was just a speck then out of that speck a hand fractled out ward untill there were infinite hands all with eyeballs in the palm. The a body and a head followed. I looked on in wonder at the sight before me. Then I could do nothing but open my eyes, and when I did I was totally sober. LSD IS a hell of a drug!

Secrets written by the Blind
Make more sense when He learns to read.

The Tears of the Soul
Revealed by its Cry.

The Eternal Eye
Hidden in the Heart
Chained and buried
In the Temple of 'I'.

Rendered Blind, Deaf and Dumb
Fighting against the Unknown
Surrounded by Invisible Walls

The Man who Hid His Heart
Sitting in The Desert Of Egoism.

Haunted by Unquenchable Thirst.
The Blind Man Licks Stones. . .


Mercy From Above
In the Form of a Drop
Show the Man the Walls
That Keep him Enslaved.

There is no Door to Freedom
Only a Ladder and a Window with bars

The Man looks outside
And Touches Perfection.

The Temple Door Has Opened.


Yesterday's Poetry

So, I recently just found a very reliable acid connection. It being something that I always wanted to do I went and bought some the day I found out about it. Instead of waiting for a good day when I could hang out with friends I chose a night that I had to sleep in my own house. Having experimented with salvia before and loving it I had real high hopes for acid.

So I took it and sat down in my room to watch Dude, Wheres my Car. I  got to the ostrich scene and still nothing happened. I was pretty angry. But then I got a phonecall and my friend invited me to go smoke with him and some other kids. I went outside and then I just felt a little bit off, I couldn't really put it into words. I saw lots of stuff flying around in the sky but I still couldn't tell you if it was birds or not.

I actually have a lot of sober hallucinations, I constantly see people looking at me or walking around staring at me. Its been going on for years, so I'm just used to it now.

But anyway, I met up with the kids and smoked probably 4 bowl packs before I got dropped back off at home. There were no increases from when I left my house, so I figured my source wasn't as reliable as I had thought. I turned on the crazy asian flick Battle Royale and fast forwarded it to when they are inside the school. Then all of a sudden from the top right corner of my vision it turned bright lime green. I could see the light reflecting on things around and when it very quickly dropped to the bottom let corner of my vision.

I sat in awe for a moment because I didn't think it could happen so suddenly. Then everything started to glow and change between blue, green, red, purple, orange, and yellow. Then everything had its own individual pulse, everything just pulsated for so long. I started to watch the movie in complete awe, and realized I was so into it that my eyes were watering almost the entire time.

I finished with that and wet into my basement and played with my pure white persian cat. He wasnt pure white when I was petting him, but he still rocked. For hours that went on, then I finally fell asleep.

I love acid.

I met a friend at Marsascala and I took half a hit at 8pm. 9pm nothing, 10pm nothing, went home, nothing.

10:30pm I took the other half hit.

11pm: I was in front of my computer, I began to see all the colours of the rainbow then time had no meaning. I became aware that I was 23 years earlier in side my mother's womb and in 70 years at the most I would be dead and buried. What is the significance of 70 years when 70 years from now, there will be only the past and no future. I felt that there was nothing after life, we are only mammals ant that thought was horrible. I always thought that there was life after death and that's what is beautiful. But now I realized the opposite. There is nothing, we are only a bunch of chemicals and we will get dissolved into nature. Just as there was no I before 23 years ago, there will be no I after I die.

I thought: what's the great thing if I die? So much people have died! There are so many people who will live.

Well after the 3 days I spent in this state I became involved in a religious movement that promoted life after death. I want life after death! If there is no life after death its not worth living.

It was my first time. I took some really good shit. I got really hyper and talked more than I ever have in my entire life. I was also really loud and talked so fast that no one could understand me. I wasn't in any kind of controlled environment and there was nothing safe about where I was. I was with some friends though. I remember that I wasn't paranoid at all like some people are. In fact, we were walking down the street to a party. We all took the same shit, everyone was paranoid except me. Nothing too exciting happened at the party. On the walk home though I got really dehydrated. My friend took me to some guys driveway and I passed out. She got them to get some water. Some how they got me to wake up and I drank the water. I felt a lot better after that but it was really scary. I couldn't breathe very well and I got really dizzy. Also, the only kind of hallucination I had was while walking home (this was after I got dehydrated), a sign grew arms and pulled me towards it. I ran straight into the pole. That hurt like hell. I really like acid and have continued to take it. My only recommendations are that the user drink lots of water. Plus, it helps to drink something like orange juice as well.

I think it opens up a part of my mind that would otherwise stay closed.  It gives me a new perspective on life. 
I have tripped many times, but the time that I felt it the most was when I took 2 geltabs with many of my friends.  First, after about 40 minutes after ingestion, everyone became overwhelmed with euphoria to the extreme.  A smile became plastered on each of our faces.  Everything seemed so funny and I became incredibly happy.  But, we didn't actually start seeing visuals until a couple of hours later.  Slowly, you start thinking of some crazy shit that seems to make perfect sense.  Its impossible to explain exactly what trippin is like, is has be to experienced.

Once the visuals started it was amazing.  I never thought the mind could do crazy shit like that.  And it's great because you think clearly while seeing awsome hallucinations.  First, we went outside and sat under the stars in this vine-covered patio.  Everything twisted around and looked a bit fucked up.  I started moving my hand around this table and it looked likt the whole table was spinning in mid-air.

Another visual was when we were inside.  I sat at the top of the stair looking down at the brown carpet.  The whole carpet looked like a pool of quicksand.  It looked like they, my friends, were sinking into the carpet.  And in the kitchen it looked like the floor was a grate with some goo spilling up through the cracks.  Every slight crack in the wall would look like a huge hole and would pulsate bigger than smaller.  I could also see sound in a way.  The walls would move to the beat of the music, like huge drums. 

We stayed up the whole night and my friend, who's a dumbass had to work the next day.  We convinced him that he had to ride 10 miles to work on a bike because there was no way he could get a ride.  Actually, his mom could have given him a ride, but we convinced him otherwise.  He ended up riding all the way to work on a shitty bike with flat tires at 4:00 in the morning.  It was the funniest shit ever.  I remember everything about the night, but most of it just can't be explained with words, at least unless a person has tried it and knows what I'm talking about.

I have done many many drugs, but lsd has been my favorite so far. This is because I love ethogens, and how they make your mind work.This is what happened to me after I took lsd, how it changed me. I took 3 hits of acid, put it under my tongue, waited, took an hour and a half to kick in, but when it did, everything was alive and talking to me.  Skeletons grew out of my basement floor and we hungout for 6 hours while listened to the grateful dead. But my favorite thing about it was, I could feel love flowing through my veins, for the first time I understood the beatles. Of course, all you need is love! Since that break through, I havent been angry, I've been frustrated, I've been irritated, but not angry. Life is way better now, I used to constantly ask people about what they thought of 2012, and the end of the world, now.. Doesnt bother me. So thats my conclusion, lsd has opened my eyes, made me a new person.

I have taken acid only twice before this trip.  Later that day I have obtained 5 hits from a friend, he said they were very strong. That night I decided to take 4 of the 5 I had, I wanted to go over and beyond. I put them in my mouth and noticed I could actually taste a slight chemical taste as I chewed on them. I then sat back on my bed and waited for my trip to begin.

> 20 min later: getting board and so I start reading.

> 40 min later: start feeling my jaws get tense and teeth feel - somehow different.

> 60 min later: feel jolts of energy run through my body and notice slight close eye visuals and also slight open eye

> 80 min later: heavy closed eye visuals and notice my shades and carpet spiraling and flash colors, music sounds different somehow.

100 min later: started drawing on poster board but then noticed that the sides of the board started to bubble up and start smoking.   I found that my lamp was giving off intense heat and my room felt like a oven.

120 min later:  cat jumps on my bed and his hair starts to singe as he gets closer to the light. I picked up my glass of water and  found I could not drink out of it because the water was boiling be fore my eyes! By this time I saw my bed start to smoke. And my arm start to bubble up a bit.

125 min later: as I reach to turn off my lamp my fingers start to melt and drops of flesh spash on the carpet. I get scared and sit back on my bed realizing that my toes are metaphorically catching fire and as well start to melt off my foot.  By this time the hair on my legs are totally gone and my bed catches on fire!  I lay down again and this time have my legs off my bed extended straight out to watch my toes.  Then notice my knee cap bubles up and catches on fire.  About 4 to 5 min after watching this my leg melts off my thigh it drops but I don't hear it hit the ground.  I don't remember much after this but I remember I tripped for about 6 or 7 hours.

 It was winter in 2003. I was sitting around my house my parents were gone on business. I found an old vial filled with small blotter papers. I knew what they were when I saw them. I decided to take two and see what would happened. Nothing happened. So I took 2 more. I gave up. I went to bed.

Not long after a few hours tops I woke up around 4 am for reasons unknown turned on the light and the world was different. My bedsheet that had little black dots on it was moving up and down and the dots turned into triangles and back to dots. I walked down my hall which seemed to continue forever into the bathroom where I saw my pupils were completely diallated. I adventured to my computer to talk to people online. It took it forever to start. My whole body was knumb I felt no pain. The walls were breathing. I got up and stared at a clock and every 4 seconds in my mind was 1 second. I couldn't sleep that whole night. I stayed up listening to my mp3 player. I had to go to school. My sister gave me a ride she had no clue what was going on. The first thing that happened when I got into school was all my friends knew I was blown out. The tiles on the floor where like a never ending chess board. The lockers on the walls were brilliant colors and everyone was beautiful. In total my adventure lasted 7 hours. 2 hours to start. I've already used up the rest of the blotters foolishly.

The fourth time I experimented with LSD, it was a perfect day on Miami Universities Western campus.  Everyone in our expanded group of friends was tripping.  The happiest day of my life.  Several hours into the trip, while walking down the hallway of my dorm, I began feeling intense energy currents swelling up from the earth.  Walking, dancing, moving with this energy towards my room, I began to wonder if I could do something with this energy, like using the force (star wars).  When I got to my room and sat down on my bed I felt the energy rise up through my body and exit my head (third eye?)  As this occurred my friend Brian was launched several feet backwards, stumbling.  He looks directly at me in sheer amazement, 'Was that you?'  Yes, it was. Part me, part mystery.  My life has since been not the same.  It was a climax of sorts, as I had been moving in the direction of metaphysics and latent abilities of the mind for years.  The question that followed was, why this particular experience happened to me?  What does this mean?  The short answer: reality is way more than most people realize.  But researching psychedelic experiences I have yet to find another story that talks about people using energy to manipulate the physical.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

So this is my first trip report but the intensity of the situation requires it I feel. So to start I managed to procure some really high quality 110ug blotters from the deep web and I had planned a cool trip night for me and a bunch of my friends. Im going to use false names to protect the identity of the people involved. It was I, landon, jesse, spencer, Jordan, Elliot, randy, spencer, and dean. At around 9:45pm I arrived at the trip spot (landons house) and all my friends were there eager to have a cool acid experience, This was landons and elliots first time. 

I had planned in advance to take a really high dose because I wanted to have some revelations and ultimately ego death. The dosages were Elliot-1 tab landon-2 tabs Jesse- 4 tabs dean-2 tabs Jordan-1 tab and I did 5. 

So we all dropped and everything was going good and flowing smoothly and oh boy did I start to feel it. Around an hour in someone requested I pull my car forward but the visuals were so intense when I stepped outside I was honestly impressed, when I sat down in the drivers seat of my car j glanced in the mirror and saw one of the street lights behind me and saw it swirl and there was a strong tracer. At that point I decided that this was a poor decision and I had misjudged the intensity of the acid I had just took, so I hopped out of the car and asked Jordan to back it up for me. 

The problem I knew I was about to run into was flow, I knew I would be relied upon to keep it flowing nicely for the group but I knew I wouldnt be able to provide for much longer I knew I would be relied upon to keep it flowing nicely for the group but I knew I wouldnt be able to provide for much longer so on my way back in I took some really deep breaths and paced myself for a potential anxiety nightmare. When I got back inside everything was still going good, Elliot and randy were sitting there playing madden having a good time and then the visuals and mindfuck hit me so super super hard, I honestly wasnt anticipating it. I'm a pretty experienced psychonaut and I'm aware that LSD is a pretty malleable substance if you know how to work with it, but damn, the situation became really anxious and tense. Randy had a really bad trip and he thought someone died and he was super anxious but somehow I never even noticed and I feel really bad about that. I kept looking up and I thought the situation was just normal and I was just too tripped out to comprehend but in reality everybody else in the group was equally as anxious as me. 

Landon was unable to handle LSD, LSD isnt necessarily or everybody and I dont put any blame on him but he seriously was unable to keep track of thoughts, I'm unsure exactly what happened but there was a really anxious situation and he thought everyone was against him and he got super hostile toward everyone in the room and he ended up projectile vomiting on the floor and just leaving the room to go lay down and at that point shit got crazy. Spencer thought somebody died and was freaking the fuck out and ended up laying down just so he could be out of this mess. In my head I was flying through other lifetimes following an energy beam, the term rolling comes to mind to perfectly describe what I was feeling I swear I lived other lives during that time frame where I was following that energy beam around, the visuals were so intense that I didnt know which reality was the real one. 

At that point I just decided to ride it out and see what happens, there was music playing with a good baseline in the background of the room and there was a bong being passed around but I was way too trippy to understand that. I slightly came back to reality for a second and Elliot walked over to me and lit the bong for me and man was that the most majestic thing I had ever seen, I dont know why but just that sight of him lighting that and me killing it with the bass dropping in the background was one of the most intense things I had ever felt, after I came down enough to be back in reality the vibes in the room were awesome. Landon was back and everybody was vibing and smoking bud, I had my vape out and we were chain vaping. 

There was a moment where randy sat next to me and tried to talk to me but I didnt notice he was in distress and now I feel bad about it because he has a negative outlook on us all. Me and jesse decided to go outside for a little bit to see what everything looked like and it was still so visually intense that it was hard to handle so we went back inside and got some drinks and chilled for a little bit. Something to know about landon is that he always just kind of has this edge to him, like hes hiding something or he has something balled up inside so I tried to talk to him about it, just to strike some good conversation and explain to him that nobody here hates him and the anxiety was just caused by him being in the middle of it. But he just wasn't having it and he thought we all hated him. He instantly showered me with hostility and the whole vibe got anxious again and it became really shitty. So me jesse and dean decided to go outside once again and just sit and chill. Dean is usually anxious in his day to day life, he expressed this to me a while back but I figured if he really wanted to trip I'd involve him in it too, but this wasnt a good plan. While we were sitting outside dean just kept being super anxious and it rubbed off on jesse pretty bad and at that point he got really scared and confused. I went back in the house and laid on the couch and watched futurama but jesse just kept going in and out of the house looking really worried about something. 

Eventually I came outside and saw him sitting in his car damn near to the point of tears, he needed to be home really soon but the drugs still had us both seeing so visually intense that driving would be a huge task. I tried everything I could to keep him from leaving but I know how this goes so eventually I took the plunge and stopped trying to convince him from leaving. I was really worried about jesse, I didnt want him to crash his beloved car or get a dui or even worse die, but I put my faith in him and just laid on the couch super anxious for about an hour thinking about how I'll forever have that on my conscience. I shot jesse a text at around 11am and asked if he got home alright and his exact words were yeah dude how the fuck did I not die and at the moment a huge grin hit my face and I was almost put into tears over the amount of weight that was pulled off my shoulders. 

Around 1 everybody was still asleep and my visuals had worn mostly off but there was still a really heavy body load and I was ready for the drugs to be gone. I hopped in my car and drove back to my house to grab a Xanax I had stashed for the purpose and popped it, about 10 minutes later I felt a lot better. After that I went to hang out with another friend of mine and we smoked a little cannabis and I went back home drank some orange juice and passed out hardcore. I slept for 18 hours but oh man did I need that. 

Overall my experience was good because I finally experienced ego death and saw that rolling energy I've always read about but it was super exhausting, I'm at the point where I've accomplished all I had ever hoped to accomplish on LSD and I think I'm gonna stop with it for now and explore the peaks of shrooms. Overall 10/10

1355 - 3 tabs of acid for breakfast. I was in a good/happy mind when I took the 3 tabs I was sick and miserable so I might as well have fun while I am sick.

1430 - get home started having panic attacks/feeling happy, lay down to take a nap sleep for about 2 hours while I was having auditory hallucinations, when the fan in the room I was in vibrated weirdly. It produced a kaleidoscope fractal effect, and I was exploring the various rooms of my mind. I was talking to it the thing that makes every thing while I was exploring the rooms in my mind.

1630 - Don't remember much, I do remember grabbing the trash can in my bathroom. I was surrounded by darkness, I remember grabbing it. I opened my eyes to a super bright black and white flashing of nonsensical symbols with a pyramid with an eye on the left side of my vision. Lay back down. I remember feeling hot/slightly warm with my left hand feeling cold.

1700 - I wake up feeling terrible my whole body in pain, I drank some water and went into my sisters room. I grabbed a trash can and a fucking ice cream cone, I puked up the water I just drank then downed the ice cream cone. After I was done with it I put a cherry hard candy in my mouth and it was like tasting the color red, I bit down on it and my mouth started to hurt. This was in a red and blue haze.

1745 - It begins I am the master of time I could see 24 seconds into the past and the future. I eat a steak that still tasted like steak had a wierd fuzzy texture. I was in a red and blue glitch world with the ability to control time. After I was done with my steak I was waving my fork around and there was a trail coming off of it and I named it bob the trail snake and with him I started wandering around my house. I drank 1/2 a coke and I threw that up but not my steak. The coke tasted like fucking dirt.

1945 - Bob was gone and I was in a world of vivid colors and spaztastic rainbows. I don't remember much other then I met a dragonfly that was about 12 feet in length made of pure fucking rainbows in all of its epileptic glory. I watched some anime and played osu a rhythm game. It was like I was on adderall and snorted 4 lines of cocaine spazing out doing shit at 400 miles a second. My trip was like this for a while.

0300 - I finally clam my tits, I am staring at my floor rolling and shaking, I stare at it for about 30 min.

0330 - I cooked some macncheese because I was feeling hungry, it tasted weird somewhat like a creamy lemon flavor but wasn't unpleasant so I eat it anyways. I am feeling dirty after I ate so I decided to take a shower.

0400 - Shower time this was really fun the water was ticklely and felt very nice and warm I scrubbed my self and it felt very wierd like a ticklely itch. I rinsed off the soap and dried myself off.

0430 - I am naked and I just sit on my couch staring into the black nothingness from some reason this was very entertaining/ I decided that music would go along great with this and looked from my phone and played some jazz music. I decided that the couch was uncomfy and moved to my bed.

0550 - I am laying in my bed listing to jazz with a blanket over my face, I started seeing fractals again with some other weird visuals I sit there for about an hour doing this.

0650 - I talked about my trip with a person in a discord server I was in. At this point my trip was all but over I was still seeing some tracers and shit but other than that I was fine. I talked to him for about 2 hours.

0850 - He gets off and I just watch youtube videos till I stopped seeing shit. Took 2 hours.

1050 - I go to a store with my mom get some drinks and some gum then lay down and sleep, in my sleep I was talking to it and explored the rooms in my mind some more.

Next day for me
1430- I wake up and remember my dream.

This past Friday I had a repeat experience that managed to stick with me when I landed. I realized it wasn't the first time, but it was the most obvious and the most...um...real.

I came up on two gel tabs....not a large dose by any means, but enough. I usually trip alone and I like to explore the interwebs. While typing I noticed I had, what looked like, a piece of cobweb floating from my fingers. Instinctively I reached to pull it off with my other hand. I could actually feel the sticky pull as I tried to remove it from my fingers. Unable to remove it I took a closer look and watched it disappear.

I know this isn't the first time I've seen these smokey tendrils attached to my fingers or arm, but it is the clearest and most real.

It was a normal night, I was partying over at my buddy's house and we were rockin pretty hard.  Rounds and rounds of quarters and anchorman.  Lots and lots of beer and wine, plus a dance party.  This went on until about 1 am and we decided we needed more alcohol so we went to go get more.  We left with a couple of people I didn't really know well but one of them yelled out, 'Let's go get my acid!' and my eyes lit up.  I've had quite a few amazing trips from acid and it treated me well so I was down.  

We got to his house and he came out with a few blotter tabs.  Keep in mind I was still hammered at this point.  He then proceeded to give the hits out to each of us.  'Here's your hit, here's yours...'  I took mine and could taste the bitterness of the LSD on my paper.  This was usual but I had never tasted it this strong.  I asked him if he knew if it was dropped or dipped or what.  He said it was soaked in LSD and pretty fresh from the chemist.  I got excited and then realized it was 2:30 am.  I was like man I'm tired because I was still very drunk.  So I got dropped off at my house and fell asleep.  

I woke up exactly 3 hours after I took the dose.  It was 5:30 a.m. and I realized I was tripping!  Then I remembered the kid saying something repeatedly through the night...It was that the acid took 3 hours to kick in.  I walked around the house for a while and saw some crazy things.  I also watched a movie until my cousin came into the room and said she was going to work.  Then she looked at me and asked, 'why the hell are you awake?'  I told her my crazy drunken story and she said come outside we'll smoke a cig.  We did and squirrels were everywhere.  They kind of scared me a little, but they were friendly it seemed.  Then I was looking at the trees and they seemed to be smiling at me.  It was pretty wild.  

After tripping for many hours it became 4pm and I seemed to have come down.  It was time for me to go to work.  I smoked a joint with my bud on the way and of course, the trip came back somewhat or was prolonged.  I walked into work with this wild awareness about me.  I did really well on the phones but my cubicle was pretty wild.  The walls were definitely breathing for the most part.  Anyways, all in all, a great trip, just very strange and tired at work.  Acid can be great fun and even better if you take it at a better time than I did haha.  Trip safely and as always love and peace!!!

LSD is a powerful drug.  It can provide the user with invaluble insight or plunge them into the depths of insanity.  It's impossible for the first time user to know what will occur, so do not decide whether or not to use this drug lightly.  I've been lucky, and found the drug to be a window into insight.  I'd like to share my most recent experience.

In university, I was a borderline acidhead.  At the time of my last experience (Jan 2006), it had been four and a half years since I used the drug.  I was in the midst of some major life changes, and wanted to be able to once again analyze my life through the looking glass of LSD.

I dosed with M, a long time friend of mine.  Also present was D, a friend not quite a babysitter as he was smoking plenty of marijuana with us, but not joining the acid trip.  M and I dosed at 3:30pm.

3:30pm- We dose and take a trip to the supermarket with the currently sober D.  There are no major effects during the trip.

4:30pm- We are back at D's apartment, and the drug is starting to noticably create shifts in reality.  We will mostly stay at D's apartment for the remainder of the trip.  Although I used to enjoy the roving, unpredictable acid trip, I now wish for a comfortable environment to explore innerspace.

5:00pm- I'm busy ripping CD's into mp3's when my attention span allows (I was soon to move overseas and wanted to bring my music on a hard drive).  We end up puttin on the Boards of Canada 'Campfire Headphase' disc, which creates an ocean of sonic space for our acid fried minds.  D is now smoking from his bong, and we are happy to join him.  We play a few games of Fireball Island (children of the 80's might know this) and Texas Hold Em'.  Although we are able to stay within the parameters of the games,  there are quite a few verbal tangents and side trips.

5:30pm- We all share some strange threats and confusing words in the kitchen.  It's all in jest, but even this could throw a more unstable mind or first-time user into a state of panic (aka the bad trip).  We get past it and break out the 40 year old scotch.  Of course it burns, but the ambient flavors shine through the lysergic prism.

6:00pm- I put on an episode of 'The Flash.'  Unfortunately, no one really wants to join me through my nostalgiac flight of fancy (in other words, they hate it).  I still dig it.

7:00pm- M and I are reaching our peak.  D is preperly stoned.  We get into some music videos.  The Chris Cunningham clips (especially my first viewing of Aphex Twin's 'Windowlicker') create a disturbing view of the world.  I prefer the Michel Gondry clips with their fractal view of the world.

7:30pm- M throws 'San Andreas' into the X-Box.  It's a fine game, but I don't really think it finds the unique experience of LSD.  Nevertheless, we take turn playing it for the next 45 minutes and immerse ourselves in the video world.

8:30pm- D is feeling sober enough to take us on a group trip to the Arby's drive though.  It's a typical enough experience, but M and I are still having a very strange time.

9:00-11:00pm- Although most of the time dilation occurred earlier in the evening, this is where things become a blur.  The hours are filled with video games, music, Texas Hold Em', and Poker, but I can't recall the quantities or order.

11:00pm-12:30am- I'm back to ripping CDs as I wait to sober up.  Everyone's energy is waning.

12:30am- I'm sober enough to drive so I take M home and head to my own place.  The LSD is very clean and I'm able to sleep by 2am.  The next day I was perfectly fine with no hangover.

Final thoughts-  Unfortunately, I feel I missed some of the insight that I found on earlier trips.  Maybe this was because I arranged such a comfortable time for us all.  My most profound trip was on a camping trip about 5 years ago.  Still, it was a very enjoyable time and I hope it's not my last LSD experience.

Fearless freedom.

I was itching my head
     & spread peace
     throughout the people.

The prosperity of birds
are in chains in
the 'created' democracy.

Life binding life
     Tis the god of us.

True existence
     no space, nor time.
Vibration is the only truth.

In a flashing spell of lingering interior flailing bursts, you remain ignorant to a falling corpse of bleeding lizard dreams. It will blind you, I warn, in a second that tears at your senses like the unending sorrow that bursts you with a flavor of the sounds of a pathetic giggling moose country wizard. It comes from the direction of the deranged infinitely screaming reaper who supervises the stimuli of existence. It overwhelms you; the mind piercing pink and orange exploding from his mouth tastes like a photon blast from hell. Then you fall into a frantic steam of euphoria that tickles at your legs and leads its way back to your brain only to wisp in the frolicking cob webs of your past. The browning shrimp gumbo gives way to the sense of emprisonment the redbird once felt when his feathers were trapped in a sling. Freedom you thought you experienced is now a summit of yellow pleasure the ever famous mockingbird intertwines within your being, and the ever slowly descending popcorn wave is a sea in the eyes of a corn field reaper.

I actually tried LSD several times before the EVENT I am about to descibe (which was on 3-28-89 at the Omni in Atlanta- just looked up the exact date AND setlist on the internet, pretty cool) and even though a few friends and I had experienced some pretty wild things during our frequent acid trips during my 'crazy' college days of 1984-88 this one sticks out in my mind as the 'Big One.' Because Jerry Garcia died in 1995 making it impossible to attend a Dead show as so many did I have fond memeories of the few shows I did make it to, but as far as this acid trips go, this one was diferent because I had never experienced the truly powerful energy being spread around by the thousands of people (all ages although mostly young adults) who were either tripping along with me or were at least very receptive to feelings I was having on acid that I would normally hide

unless in a 'safe' area- Not a concert hall! Anyway, I will start at the beginning...

My friend had some great acid that I had tried once before when we camped on Cumberland Island. That was a very cool trip when we climbed over a tall fence and sat around in a private cemetery trying to 'come down' before walking on the beautiful unspoiled beach looking at seashells and basically appreciating nature at its finest. That had been only a few weeks before this concert, still in March, which in Georgia usually means great weather. I had been to see the Grateful Dead years before while still in high school and hadn't even gotten drunk before, so all I did was stare at all the strange looking people and hoped the band would play Truckin' or one of the other few songs I would recognize. Now, in March of 1989, I had tripped first on mushrooms then acid several times and knew just about every Grateful Dead song there was (I thought) so was truly pumped up for this concert!

My friend and I got to downtown Atlanta at least two hours before the concert so we could check out 'the scene' which was fun- lots of strangely dressed people roaming about but even before we 'dosed' I thought the energy level was positive and attractive. We took the public tranportation (MARTA) which ended up being smart, more on that later. We ate in a chinese restaurant and must have already sampled the two hits (one each) because I remembe rthings getting strange there because the restaurant was crowded with young people in tie-died t-shirts, etc. making the chinese waiters a little uncomfortable. We passed many more dead-heads and all the interesting things to look at, again the dead-heads, made the awkward 'early acid feelings' almost unnoticeable. Standing in line outside of the Omni became intense cause there was a guy beating a loud drum to a slow beat, making me nervous and letting me know that a strong trip was on the way.

By the time we slowly entered the 'arena,'  bought a beer, actually found our row (which we found out later didn't matter) the music had already started. Near the aisles were young girls who stood up as the music played and started whirling around with trance-like faces. They scared me! We gave up trying to find our actual seats after both of us were fully tripping now and could have fallen down the stone steps. Counting the numbers of the rows with the blasting music was too much! The Dead finished 'Let the Good Times Roll' which seemed so-o-o appropriate to the way we were feeling! After settling into some chairs, I somehow was able to talk a little to a pretty woman next to me. She had a beautiful smile and after telling me she flew in THAT DAY from Dallas to Atlanta pulled out a large joint and offered to share it with me!

My friend declined saying he was tripping too hard and didn't need anything to increase the strong buzz. I, however, smoked the whole joint with her and noticed that YES smoking pot while tripping can increase your buzz. I started to regret what I had done during a few of the songs, but when the band luanched into 'Ramble On Rose' I sang along and felt happy again. I remember seeing Jerry Garcia's smiling face during the silly song 'Don't Ease Me In' as if I was staring at someone a few feet away and I got a warm feeling in my heart that all what would be great.

The first set abruptly ended and strong, piercing lights flashed into our eyes. Suddenly the goddess next to me did not seem approachable and I flet like an utter fool. It was cruel to interupt the darkness and a most difficult time to get adjusted to the sudden freedom of having to find something to do until the second set began.

I remember wandering around being lost by the loud chatter that was everywhere. I was tripping hard! The second set eventually ended up being great. We moved around during the show a few times, not caring if we could see the stage, just wanting to be able to hear the music and stare at the wonderful colored lights. Truly psychedilic! The most memorable song was 'Playing in the Band' which lasted the longest and was fantastic with the long jamming. At the end of the concert, the mass of people leaving or being in utter confusion like us was overwhelming. We managed to get into a taxi and leave worry free while freakish young people stared into the window, scaring me. The atxi driver commented on the odd-looking people, not knowing that we were not dressed as strangely but were veyr much par tof that scene! 

My trip by the way had only icreased for three hours! I was still not even peaking! This experience taught me that acid is unpredicatable in the amount of time trips peak, last, etc. This one was intensified because of the atmosphere. When we were away from the concert experience, my peak finally leveled out and except for a weird feeling in my throat and some weird visuals, I managed to slowly come down and enjoy the experience, knowing it would only be a 'normal'  trip for the next three or four hours.

We went out to eat after my friend was able to drive and sat at a restaurant listening to the loud but somehow pleasant noise of the busy street nearby. I was in a blissful state when a passing car threw a beer bottle that only missed my head by inches. It could have been a diaster! But like many of my experiences, it LUCKILY turned out differently. MAY ALL OF YOU FIND INNER-PEACE AND HAVE SUCH LUCK!

August 2002, the night was young, people partying having a good time. Some one approaches, 'hey you want to split a half hit of acid?' I think to myself, not really, but I want to stay in the same mind set as my boyfriend. My boyfriend takes the hit and rips it in half, eats one half and hands me the other. My worst mistake ever. 

The night goes well, I had a fantastic time, and was able to sleep soundly when I wanted to. Next morning as I lifted my head off the couch images of the whole room moved along with my eyes. I shook my head, rubbed my eyes, and the first thing I say to myself is 'oh shit.' I've heard of 'permanant' trips happening to people, but I never really knew what that actually meant. I never thought it would happen to me. I had no clue of what was going on with myself. I kept seeing things move, people that weren't really there, objects appearing really close to my face or extreamly far away, colors, what's happening? 

A month later I was visiting with my parents, the psychosis started slowly; little things like forgetting where I put things, deep vivid daydreaming that I almost couldn't wake up from, then the voices started. I could hear people say my thoughts, the madness of voices in my head, slowly I couldn't recognize my own family and had involuntary movements of my arms. During a lucid moment I told my parents I needed to go to the hospital. At that time the hallucinations were so intense, I'd see snakes crawling all over me, worry that I had bugs (I really didn't), the maddening voices, the constant movement of things around me, it was pure hell. Doctors put me on strong medicine that did not stop the hallucinations but weakend my ability to feel anything emotionally, shutting down all my thoughts. I started noticing if I was in a good mood the hallucinations would be silly causing me to laugh, but if I was in a bad mood I was in for a really rough time.

Through time I have learned to live with this monster. It's been a year now of constant hallucinating. The hallucinations are not as intense as they first were. I still see people that are not there (I paint clown faces on them now), colors, mainly black, go zooming past my eyes, spheres or balls pass from one hand to the other and into other people's hands, balls of light bounce off of people's heads,almost like a thin layer peeled off of actual people in front of me follow wherever I look, images jump out at me, and when really stressed or over stimulated the voices come back. It's not fun, it's just something I've become accustomed to, and it has improved greatly in the past year. From what I've read this could last 5 years (4 more to go), or permenantly, I pray almost every night and hope that when I wake up in the morning the monster will be gone. Needles to say I do not use drugs or alcohol any more. I was an active addict for 15 years. This has scared me straight. The end.

I was able to come across some very potent acid and having had the same stuff before I bought three. I knew this stuff was good but I had no idea how hard it would hit me. My drug background goes as follows, I've had Shrooms, Acid, 5Meo, Salvia, Cocaine, MDMA, and of course MJ. 

I decided to take the sacrement at 7:30am so I could have the house to myself all day. After dosing I took a shower because I prefer to at least start out clean, when I trip. After the shower I was just chillin in my bed listening to some trance on the headphones. This went on until about 11:00. This far in I was beginng to get disappointed because even though I was definitly tripping I didn't feel as though I was peaking. My opinion is that it was due to the music choice. I went outside for a cigarette and my mind started thinking in a different pattern. Before I was more focused on the music by being outside and veiwing nature I began to start thinking about my spiritual beliefs amungst other things. This was a time in my life when I was very unsure about my beliefs. This didn't go on too long before I went inside to my room. I turned on some Grateful Dead  which sounded absolutly wonderful. The music moved me and before I knew it I was dancing around the room. I felt as though I was the visualizer for the music. This was odd since it is unheard of that I dance. At this point I knew I was peaking and opted to lay down on the bed. It was about 12:30. I began to focus on an abject in my room. Let me describe the object as best I can. The base is a cone, and at the tip are four skinny arms that are bent in a certain way. These arms are all different colors, blacklight responsive, and they spin around in different directions. However, the design is perfect because I have found that even when not triping I can see the visuals it makes. Anyway the arms began to move off of their designed trajectories. It looked as though some where falling down, and then it would zoom right back up. After this it transformed in a way and instead the arms looked like they were moving up towards the cieling. Like ribbons of color ascending into the sky. As this was happening the beginning heartbeats of Darkside of the moon began to play. And then, in that instant, the entire room took on a new perspective. It was as if a new connection was made inside the supercomputer that is my brain. Like a light switch flicking on my entire field of vision engulfed in visuals at the instant the music on the first track of darkside hits. Having experienced ego loss prior to this I recognized it instantly. My walls began to glimmer as though they were made of bricks of gold. In my window curtain, I saw Timothy Leary's face smiling back at me as if to say, 'There ya go, now ya got it.'  For the entire album of darkiside of the moon I was transcendent. Many, many visions appeared to me, all with my eyes open. The visions were on the curtains and the walls, and the floor, and anything else in my view. The amazing thing was that all the visuals seemed more realistic than most visuals.  Bright white light shone through the wall straight into my eye. It felt as though it was the awesome power of God.  He comforted me, and reassured me that my way of life was rightous. I understood the mind doesn't need our clunky bodies to survive. It has everything it needs to live on in the afterlife. After that I remained in this heavenly place looking down upon the people of earth with more knowledge of life than I had ever thought concievable. The music brought up topics such as money. I began to understand that Gov't and society was a huge joke. I was shown many more images, however some of which are deeply personal and others I have not fully understood yet. The state of transcendance lasted until the last note of Darkside. I was thrown back into my body on earth and at that moment there was a laughter in the music and I began to laugh as well.

Well. I took acid on sat and I went insane. Then I took it again on thurs and went even more insane.

The day started off in Brooklyn, we were having fun, alot of people I knew. Abuot 15 in all. At least half of them were tripping, probably more. We walked around and smoked and the street started getting really cartoony.  Then the other group of people went off to smoked their blunt and we went to smoke ours. Even though were all friends they just wandered off. 

We smoked, and came back to my friends house. I was tripping nicely. We put on floyd. This would be one of my most insane experiances ever. After a while I was really getting into the floyd and they re-went out to smoke again. I opted to stay and listen to floyd in the warmth...... by myself. Big mistake/but crazy journey. After a while i was completely swallowed by the floyd and I was bugging, I never felt so aware or able to control reality. The walls were moving, the music was part of me and went exactly with it. 

Finally the CD ended. I was completely lost. I wasn't able to comprehend how the music could have stopped. I took out the cd and sat there feeling like a part of me had just been lost bugging out. I started to pace the room and talk to myself for 15 mins. Then I was I need the floyd and tried to get it to work again. I put the cd in and couldn't find the play buttong so i just started pushing all the buttons on the stereo. I couldn't get the damn thing to play. I was tripping balls. I started asking the cd to play itself, trying to cajole it into playing for me. Then I was like ok, Im tripping balls, But there are a limited amount of buttons, i can do this. After another 5 minutes of intense analysis and and examination, and attempting to comprehend my loss, I found the button and was like ahhhhh im back. Then everyone came back, but I wasn't sure if they existed or not. And i wasn't trusting myself to interact with them, I felt like I had been through this insane trip and couldn't possibly even relate to them. 

After a while of listening to them talk, (while I was still tripping) VOOSH, my whole environment changed, and they turned into weird things that were still breathing and talking but some where not human. Greg turned into a chameleon, Hunts was a Big stone human, these girls were sea creatures with flowing green hair, at that point people were trying to interact with me, and every now and then I wouild respond or give them the thumbs up to allay their fears. Then the other group came back and I was still tripping. The feeling I had been feeling before was soo intense I refused to let it go. Then Stew brought me back after a couple rounds of foosball, which he single handedly was owning me and Alex combined. L also helped to bring me back with his girlfriend by just talking to me and stuff. We went back to the room and I was stilll tripping. 

My hand all of a sudden got crazy i dont even know how to describe it except it started opening in a weird weird way. Like one finger would move in a tiny jerk which would be followed by another one and so on. But it took a while for it to open completely, I was still feeling crazy, people were looking at my hand going holy shit, he's gone insane. I dont remember most of the rest of the night, But eventually me and a couple of friends went on the train home. The train was soo trippy, whenever it would start slowing down it would make crazy tripped out noises like voosh coom wowr. I cant really type it, its like those crazy noises that synthesisers make when slowing down and speeding up. I got home at like 11:30 cz we took the cid mid day or early afternoon. I fell asleep at 6 in the morning. I was still feeling it a little throught the whole night.

For a while I had been wanting to trip because of all the stuff i heard about it. None of my friends liked tripping but i was not convinced. One a saturday night, my friend and i went to the Rocky Horror picture show, mainly because i wanted to sell some ecstacy i had. I ended up traded two rolls for a little baggie. In the baggie was supposevely acid. They looked like little purple insect legs. I do not remeber what they were called, but they said they were the cuttings left over from the sheet of gels or something. I was doubtful but trusting because it was my friend's boyfriend. We went out back and she put two of the bug-looking legs on my tongue. They tasted kinda strange. I let them dissolve and we went on with our night.

About 40 minutes later we decided to walk to the graveyard, but halfway there we decided to change our minds. As we walked back, i saw two cats and i pursued them. As i walked toward them, i heard a strange noise from the gutter. ( i later found out it was a frog croaking.) it scared the crap out of me and i ran off giggling insanely. i was convinced there was a monster in the gutter. the other girl that was with us began croaking and i began laughing in hysterics. By this time i knew it was kicking in.  They went back to get some ecstacy from someone while i wandered around. everything was strange and new. someone approached me wanting to buy a roll. but the strangest thing happened. i couldnt get it out of my wallet. everytime i opened my wallet, it was a confusion of colors and madness. i threw the wallet down on the ground. i couldnt understand why i couldnt get it out. luckily, my friend found the roll and my wallet. then we went n a car ride. 

i was by the window. looking out the window was the strangest thing that i had ever seen. the driver had put some trance on. when walked around on clematis for a while and by this time i was real messed up.  my mind was wandering. colors swirling in and out. tall buildings and trees were amazingly impressive. when we got back to rocky, we wrnt to the park ad i saw the most beautiful tree i had ever seen in my life. i decided to sit in it. by this time my friends were rolling and quite worried about me wandering off. We went back to rocky and actually went in the theater. what happened was amazing. the input to my brain was overwhelming. all the sounds, the sights, everything. then we went to IHOP. we went into the bathroom, and my pupils were quite large. i couldnt help staring at the stalls. they were the most beautiful shade of purple i had ever seen in my life.  strange rainbow patters, like a metal grid, covered everything. we got a ride home from the most beautiful guy i had ever seen in my life, and i was quite in love with him. when we got home it was about 4:30 AM. One of my friends who was rolling, had some shrooms. we then decided to go outside and explore. 

we decided to go to the community pool, but we never made it. everyfew steps or so, we would get distracted by something. then i noticed her face. it looked so strange. her eyes were morphing and her face just looked so weird. we were out side for an hour, wandering around. then we went inside and watched the Matrix. it was amazing. I was convinced the guy who wrote the script was tripping. It made perfect sense. After the movie was over, I was convinced i was in the matrix, I ran around screaming, 'there is no spoon!' i really was convinced. suddenly, i was ravenously hungry. i grabbed a sprite and ran into my friends room. 'orange.....AMBIVALENCE!' i said, and we all giggled. i didnt end up opening the can of sprite for about an hour.

afer that we sat on the floor for hours recalling all our memories. it was the most fun i had in my entire life and i would definately do it again. everything was so beautiful to me. it was the most amazing experience in my life and i believe i learned alot from it, just about how beautiful life is. 

unfortunately two days later i got extremely sick and vomited for two days straight, but that always happens to me when i try  a new drug. that will not prevent me from trying it again. it was totally different from what i expected, and anyone who wants to see the beauty in life should definately try it.

This is the story of my latest trip, which occured tonight and continues as I write this. I am 16 years old.

I went to a friend's house this evening at about five o'clock. There, I dropped three hits of white blotter that remained from 20 I'd bought a few weeks before. I went with two of my friends to a restaurant, where I drank water and had nothing to eat.

At around 6:30, I started getting the familiar queasiness in my stomach, but decided not to tell my friends yet. I went into the bathroom and looked at my pupils, and they were really big by this time. We wandered around a while, and they had a cigarette, before we decided to walk to our high school football game. We paid, went in, and sat down with some of my other friends. I immediately noticed the full moon, and the clouds that sometimes covered it.

Throughout the game, I would notice the moon and its position in the sky. I talked to my friends for a while, and they still did not know I was definitely feeling the acid. I talked to one of them about the fourth dimension, and how difficult it is to comprehend something like that, even though it must exist (for reference, look up 'Flatland' and read it...insane).

The moon, meanwhile, crawled across the sky, and it sometimes appeared as if someone had taken a huge eraser and smeared the moon's color across the black sky. By 8:30 or so, my friends knew I was tripping, because I said something about the huge dragon around the moon. We started discussing the Pillsbury Doughboy and how it would be funny if, instead of saying 'Whoo-hoo!' when you poked his stomach, he said 'Fuck you!' This conversation lasted until halftime, when the two friends I arrived with left (one has a curfew with his probation, and the other wanted to go home). I found a glowrod lying on the ground. I played with this and talked to some other people, and occasionally watched the game. The moon continued to creep and bleed across the sky, and shine its bright yellow light through the clouds.

At around 10 o'clock, I went with a different friend to the dance, because the game had ended. I took my trusty glowrod, and took off my shoes. In the gym, I talked to many people and continued to twirl the glowrod. Its mystical green light entranced me, and my friend decided it was time to leave. I had thought we had been there about five minutes, but it was actually more like 45. We left, got in the car, and cruised around looking for a party. I was content to sit and listen to selected tracks from Tool, Sublime, and some other groups I can't recall now.

We found a party: unfortunately, it sucked, so we left. I don't remember whether I even got out of the car or not, but we went to Wendy's and three of the five people got Frostys. We then drove back to the same party, and saw some people we knew, when some old guy told us we had to leave because we were blocking the cul-de-sac or something. Once more, we got into the car, and drove to one other place where a party was supposed to be. There was nothing there, so I was brought home at about 11:30. I talked to my mom for a while (which is always cool and scary at the same time), and then I watched some television. I had a Hotpocket and a Coke, which was the first thing I had eaten since about noon.

I am now sitting here writing this, and I enjoyed my evening thoroughly.

I first became interested in LSD when I accidently stumbled across an LSD article in the dentist's waiting room.  The article told briefly of the commonly experienced psychadelics of LSD.  I had never really given LSD a second thought in the past, but after cross-examining it I felt as if I was missing out on something.  I decided to start researching the drug and also contacted a few individuals that I knew had used LSD.  

I've always been a very careful person when in comes to foreign chemicals.  I would always research a drug thoroughly, seeking both users' and non-users' facts and opinions. After about 3 months of bi-daily research, I had decided I had read virtually every information-bearing LSD website I could find. Thus I decided I was informed enough to ensure safety and enjoyability in my experience.  I went about obtaining some LSD by contacting a friend that I knew had used it in the past, and we planned a trip.  My first LSD trip took place at his house, in which I ingested one sugar cube, and acheived somewhat of a trip.  I was extremely giddy, and the experience as a whole was extremely positive. Unfortunately, the more cosmic, psychadelic effects that I'd expected were absent.

The only hallucinations I experienced, besides the shadow of a branch that I saw as Medusa, were images I conciously manifested with my own imagination.  One of such images were a 'lizard man', a velociraptor with knee joints as humans, that was cloaked and squatting in the corner, flicking his tounge fiercly at me.  Once I manifested the image and it was in my vision, I felt an evil presence.  However, I quickly snapped out of this by reassuring myself that the drug had surely induced the vision. Even though I'd say that the hallucinations were enough to tell about, I didn't experience the complete alteration of time, space, matter, and thought that I hoped for.  I wondered if I didn't take enough LSD, and I presumed that perhaps I was more resistant to the drug than other people.  I decided on trying it again, this time from a different person and in a different form.   

I decided that the way I could acheive the trip I wanted was through more potent form of LSD.  Many people have told me their non-convincing experiences with paper-form LSD, and I decided I had to investigate for myself.  A few months after the first experience, I obtained 4 paper hits, and with my friend, took 2 each.  The effects were very familiar to the first trip.  Once again, I was giddy but no significant mild-alteration was present.  Just when I was ready to give up the quest for psychadelics my friend found another form.  He had met somebody, and he had obtained a few geltabs, thin squares of gelatin spotted with LSD.  I was given another hope.  We called another friend, and planned a trip.  It was to take place in some campgrounds we were to soon visit, a nice place with all the conveniences of the city (fresh water, heat, air condition) and all the wonders of nature.  It was surrounded by woods and a nice pond was nearby the house area.

When the time came, it was me and my two friends, D and F.  I chose not to use their names because I haven't informed them of my plans to document the trip.  We had 4 yellow geltabs, and decisively distributed them among us.  Since F had never done LSD before, he would take 1, and me and D would take 1 1/2 each, us having some LSD experience.  We decided to go inside and play cards while waiting for the wonders to come.  After about 30-45 minutes of cards, I began to feel the same effects as my first two trips.  I looked at the clock, thinking at least an hour had passed, but was wrong.  I was roughly 35 minutes into the trip, and already was lost in thought.  It was if every thought would start a chain reaction in my head, activating more and more thoughts to the point that I was pondering several very different topics at one time. About 1 hour into the trip, playing cards became extremely difficult, as I was being bombarded by abstract and fragmented thoughts and ideas.  With all that was going on in my head, the last thing I was thinking about were the cards in my hand.  Giving my hand to F, I decided to sit and try to calm my brainstorm restfully.  

I was only resting for about 10 seconds before I caught some movement in the corner of my eye.  I saw the ceiling moving, taking on a flowing form, as if it was silk being blown by the wind.  Being the first visuals I had ever experienced, I was awe-stricken.  I sat and watched the movement spread onto more surfaces, noticing that the movement was stronger whenever I looked. I could see movement in the corner of my eye, but only when I looked directly at something would it shift and dance. After staring at the floor for several minutes, I decided to return to my friends.  'D,' I said. 'Are you feeling anything?' He gave me a blank look and cracked a smile at me.  His pupils, almost completely dominating the blue of his eyes, were all I needed to see. 

It had only been a little over an hour, and we were all tripping.  We decided to take a walk outside, to see the newfound wonders of the surrounding area, despite the fact that it was around 10:00pm and very dark. We walked through a dimly lit path in the woods, and each tree we passed seemed characterized.  I felt as if I was walking among strangers, but an easy, relaxed feeling took over.  Despite the fact that I was walking into the dark woods, under the influence of a drug I had little grasp on, I didn't have an ounce of fear in me.  'Is it just me, or are these trees covered with a dark blue fog.' D said. I stopped and looked up at the treetops.  Among the almost pitch black treetops I saw beautiful patterns forming and changing, becoming more complex every second.  D was talking to me, but I didn't notice. I was awe-stricken.  

A tap on my shoulder got me out of the trance.  I turned around, and looked at D and F behind me.  It was extremely dark, and I tried to focus on their faces, but it was not their faces that I saw when I squinted at their extremely dimly lit heads.  As their faces came into view, they started taking on an evil, monster-like characteristic. I immediately thought back to reports I've previously read that described panic attacks upon seeing drug-induced and negative hallucinations. I told myself that it was impossible for them to be anything other than D and F, and despite what I saw I disregarded this and suggested we go back inside. We walked back inside, and upon arriving at the house I was overcome with another relaxing sensation.  I sat down on the couch, and was put into a  kind of a trance. 
As I sat and pondered the situation, one thought branched into a chain of thoughts, followed by another branch of thoughts, and was thrown into a series of mental visualizations that simply blew my mind. I had a similar experience after eating 225 Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds and smoking cannabis about 3 hours later, 2 after my stomach rejected the seeds.

'Lets go to the pond.' I suggested.  A quick walk through the woods would get us to our destination, a shining mirage of paradise in the moonlit night.  I visualized the pond. I saw the bright moon shining on the water, its sandy, beach-like shore (only on one side of the lake), and benches on the sand to relax on.  I smiled. 'Let's go.' We skipped over to D's care and extracted a few bowls of cannabis from his bag and headed blindly into the woods. We made our way through the woods, and upon doing this I noticed patterns on everything, and forming out of everything.  The leaves on the ground formed patterns, and the clouds in the sky formed patterns.  It was amazing.  I was busy staring at the pattern, and we got there quicker than I expected.  

I looked out at the lake, and sure enough, the moon lit up everything.  The reflection of the moon on the pond was shifting and moving. We walked over to a bench and sat down. D pulled out an 'irish' pipe and a bag of pot, and lit it accordingly. I took a couple of hits, and it wasn't until about 1 minute later that the peaking effects of the LSD returned in full effect.  I noticed the colors of the leaves on the ground melt together, the intense and rapid thought process returned. It took me by surprise, for part of the reason I wanted to smoke was that I suspected the LSD was wearing off.  I was mistaken however, because now I realize that they effects hadn't wore off at all, as if I was still on the trip's plateau.  I was only getting used to effects of the LSD... becoming accustommed to the moving surfaces and not thinking of it as abnormal.  I recognized how this could potentionally permanently damage my thinking process, and paid more attention to the psychadelia.

I stood there for a couple of minutes, trying to remember the sequence of events preceeding the present time.  It was then I remembered I had a few 'Sparklers' in my pocket.  Sparklers are fireworks... you light the end of the long metal stick and sparks spew out of it for about 1 minute.  I pulled a Sparkler out, and lit it.  It took a few seconds to light, but once lit immediately exploded into a rage of sparks intensified by my hallucinations.  As I moved it around my vision, tracers followed it in a very flowy motion, and the path of the sparkler in my vision was revealed until the sparkler went out.  When it went out, my heart was racing.  I was amazed.  I turned around and looked at D and F, who were also left silent by the beautiful display of colors.  I lit a few more, and we smoked another bowl before heading back inside.

The walk back was similar to the other treks through the dark woods. Everything I could see was a part of a beautiful pattern. D and F also saw patterns. Upon returning to the house, we all agreed that 4:00am was a reasonable time to go to sleep.  We went to bed, and though I'm still unsure whether they managed to go to sleep, I was in a complete state of insomnia.  I laid in bed for an hour or so before the effects of the pot took its toll on me and I passed out.

I hope this report shines some light on the LSD experience, as reports submitted before mine helped me to better understand something I had no knowledge of. I believe that knowledge and preparedness are essential when it comes to hallicunagenic experimentation.

I thought I'd like to share this experiance as it was so clear and amazingly real.

A beautiful still fullmoon night, myself and friend Marty planned to take a little of some recently aquired LSD. We had been told it was very clean and fresh.

I road my pushbike to M's house at dusk and watched the huge moon rise over suburban Melbourne. We had decided to take the acid and then rehearse a few songs until it came on. It didn't take long before my hands became disengaged from my mind and magical vistas began to appear behind my eyes. The rehearsal was over.

We retired to the lounge room for a beer and a smoke. I was feeling wonderful as we sat chatting about state of the world. We seemed to be in some mutal blissed 'love's the answer, love's the question' headspace. M talked his brother's suicide, and showed emotions I had never seen in him before. While this conversion was going on I noticed distortions in his face, I had seen these before when we had tripped on previous occasions and I always looked away as I thought it was some sort of sickness. But this time I concentrated on his face as his nose and chin grew into a gargoyle-like mask.

As we continued to talk this mask took on even more hidious looking features (classic gargoyle and ghoul archtypes)until it reach the point where it was nearly impossible to look at. M's face was at a profile to me but these other ghoulish faces continued to look at me from out of the side of his head. Then he turned to face me and his eyes and the eyes of these hideous gargoyles became one. I was staring directly into his eyes and then room exploded into green and all I could see were his eyes in a thick green fog. I remember thinking then that his eyes were the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.

Then the green mist cleared and M had turned into a leprechaun and was lying in a field of mushroons. He was about 3 feet long with a long wispy red beard, large pointy ears, a little green hat, green suit and pointy shoes with buckles. Here I was sitting in the room with a beer talking with a leprechaun as real as the day was long. Then he began changing again first into a camouflaged, pointy eared earth warrior and then a parade of what was literally thousands of faces, pirates with eye patches, old black women and everything else in between. During this whole time we continued rapping.

It was a truely magical trip and we gently came down over a few beers and joints. I felt truly privileged to have seen what I believe was my friends spirit. I had never beleived that I would ever in this life see a leprechaun, now I know one who lives just down the road.

Thanks for opportunity to tell my little story.

Charly

My girlfriend and I elected to have our own little New Years 2K party by tripping our brains out in a nearby hotel. We succeeded, using a total of six hits of acid, splitting them between us. 

I had tripped a few times, but all at lower dosages (one or two hits), so was pretty prepared for an interesting experience. We downed one hit, with 1000mg of Vitamin C (I still don't know if it more greatly potentiates an experience, but it seemed to help.), waited one hour, and then downed hit #2, with another 1000mg of Vit. C. During this time, we had turned off all the lights in the room, lit a number of candles (most in hurricane glass - highly recommended) and relaxed.

About an hour later, we were feeling the first two hits, VERY speedy, but OK.. and elected to imbibe the third hit, too. This particular batch of LSD-25 seemed to hit after about two hours, peak after about 4, and fade around 9 hours.

We were already having very trippy psycholitic [sic] reactions (breathing ceiling, weird stucco, 3-D effects from the wallpaper edging, aural distortions from the Enigma and Deep Forest we were listening to), and proceeded to have delightful but not overly ecstatic sex. :) 

Time passed, first watching VERY awful but amusing porn on the hotel Spanktrovision, then with her painting watercolors and me waxing philosophically. The third hit was coming along well, and, after she showered, I was feeling frisky, so we had sex again.

Oh my god. :) We had complete ego dissolution, and the best sex I've ever had. I came five times, something I hadn't expected was even physiologically possible. She was getting fantastic synesthesia, seeing splashes of color with every touch and caress, while I was in the midst of watching our loveplay sort of in slow motion, floating between being in my body, and loving her, and climaxing, and floating back out of myself while we continued to make love very swiftly and ecstatically.

There was a lot of teeth clenching and a fair amount of paranoia (on my part), but the latter is normal for me with more than one hit. Teeth clenching seemed most treatable using 'Mixed Fruit MENTOS' -- but they taste awful. 'You think you want one, and you put the Mentos in your mouth, but by then, the Mentos has used you for its' purposes.' But they crunch well. I had massive synesthesia on one, with sounds happening, instead of tasting the Mentos 'goodness'. (yecch) 

Star Trek: The Next Generation 'The Best of Both Worlds' was on, and I mused how cheesy the Borg costumes were -- but still kind of spooky. I mused 'That must be when they know to stop spending money on effects. 'Don't spend more, sir -- it's good enough to fool the acidheads.'' 

There were some setting issues, due to a recent death in her family, but I was feeling very empathic, and we talked, and cried, and it was a very wonderful, bonding, and flat out fun experience. Sleep was VERY hard to obtain, even 17 hours after the first hit, but it finally came. 

Now if only LSD weren't so hard to come by here lately :)

  I never used to have dreams until I started using LSD.  It's been about a month since I first tripped and have done it a few more time since.  EVERY single night when I go to bed, I've had a very memorable, vivid dream.  I  love it.  I even look forward to going to bed because I know I'll visit some entirely new world when I'm sleeping.  None of the dreams are nightmares either.

I have done acid before, but never this much. Actually, the last time i dropped i only did 2 hits and this time i dropped 5 hits, which is a huge step up.

0:00 - drop 5 hits of acid

0:20 - get a slight body high and lights seem to get brighter than normal

1:00 - everything has become very distorted, there are patterns all over whatever i look at

1:30 - here comes the peak, having a conversation is simply impossible, the concept of a phone completely escapes me, time has dwindled to almost non-existence, and the patterns are even stronger and i have some long ass trails. i don't even have to unfocus my eyes

2:00 - it feels like i am in a movie, out-of-body type feelings, and the feeling that anything i do right now doesn't matter, i can not hear anything except for what is in the room and what i do hear is accompanied by echos, or when my friends try to talk they sound almost like computers

2:30 - my senses are being completely switched around, like if my hearing is gone i would be able to feel what my girlfriend is saying or see it.  And the times that i can see the patterns and trails are even stronger

6:00 - the effects start to wear off but i don't come all the way down until 10 the next morning, and all day today my brain has felt completely fried. but overall, i had a wonderful time and it didn't feel like a bad trip at any time.  i personally thought it was better than rolling, which most people wouldn't agree with but then again, i am a little weird.

After reading on the internet and talking to people who've done it before, my girlfriend and I decided to trip for the first time.  We picked up 2 hits of blotter for free because I ran a couple errands for the kid I was supposed to buy it from.  So, we went back to her house and ate some McDonald's and ingested the paper.  About 20 minutes in, it began to feel like we got ripped off, so we smoked a bowl and began to watch 'The Green Mile.'  About 1 hour into the experience I began to feel very, very anxious about something, but I couldn't figure out what it was.  Everything seemed weird, out of the ordinary.  So, we continued to watch the movie and I caught my first visual in the part where the black prisoner coughed up the bee/wasp things.  It looked like they came right out of the TV and flew past me.  It was quite cool.  I also noticed that the color on the TV, mainly people's skin, was extremely bright, glowing even.  After that it seemed like I stopped tripping until about three hours later, when a friend came over.  He saw the size of my pupils and decided to play with my head for a little bit.  He kept lighting a lighter by his face, and it was extremely amusing.  Then he tried to make it look like he was going to kick me.  He was across the room and I swear I thought he was going to hit me right in the face.  I freaked out and started jumping around covering myself screaming!  When I realized what I was doing, I found it extremely hilarious and cracked up.  I laughed so hard that tears were streaming down my face.  After I calmed down, I got kinda hungry.  I was leaving at 10:30 and it was 9:00, so I wanted something quick and easy.  I don't remember how it happened, but somehow we ended up making spaghetti.  After I ate, my mom came and got me and I went home and just slept.  I remember I couldn't concentrate on one thought the whole night.  I felt if I did I would go insane.  I also couldn't keep my fingers out of my mouth.  

Overall, I wouldn't say that the experience was a waste, or a disappointment, but it wasn't what I was hoping for.  Still, really cool.  I loved it. I plan to try it again in about 2 weeks with a stronger dose.  I'll do a follow up on it.  Maybe I'll even do a comparison.

Well, this experience wasn't the first time I'd experimented with psychedelic drugs by any means. In fact, the weekend before this particular Saturday, I had eaten a tab on Friday and a tab on Sunday. I had gotten the acid that weekend from someone I ran into completely through random dumb luck, and on the spur of the moment I bought 10 hits. I have very different standards of self-control than most people and that actually made Tom, my sidekick and friend, very nervous about my mental/physical health. He was opposed to doing the LSD and told me that on Friday.

When I woke up on Saturday I was expecting a fairly boring day. Tom had slept on my floor and at 11:30am when I finally woke up and kicked him awake, we set out for coffee. Over coffee and cigarettes we decided that we wouldn't do the acid, we'd save it for later when we'd appreciate it more. He had tripped with me last Friday (not Sunday tho, that was all by myself) and thought it better to wait. Besides, we had plans to go see a few bands in downtown Boston that day at 9pm and we could easily kill 8 hours with grass. 

When we got back to my house, however, we found we had a situation on our hands. I still live at home at the age of 19 (taking computer programming classes - my brain isn't rotted quite yet) and I'm pretty absent-minded, and this time I had forgotten my keys. Worse yet, no one was home and we were locked out. So of course, we ended up eating a tab of acid and heading out into the huge park across the street from my house.

We wandered around the park for a while with nothing exciting to report. We smoked a joint and waited and walked. We left the park and headed for the huge graveyard which is also pretty much right next to my house. At this point, the acid was having subtle effects on me. The grass of the graveyard was greener, the sky was bluer, the sun was brighter. This is something that usually happens to me under psychedelics at first and I was used to it. I was also not too taken aback when we passed three or four signs that said 'WATER' very strangely, or so it seemed. The letters were white, on a green background. The font that was used for the sign seemed to have millions of imperfections that I was only then able to pick up because of the drug. The sign seemed to stand out to me, as if WATER was something I should remember and think about. 

As if reading my mind, Tom suggested we go buy something to drink from the store. 'Why not?' I thought. At this point the LSD wasn't doing very much and I figured that this was a good time to test myself in public. I asked Tom if he was tripping yet, because it had been over an hour now. He wasn't really. Right about then, Tom suggested we eat another tab. I had to agree with him. We decided tripping was worth doing, so it must be done right. We went back to my house (my parents had gotten home), ate the tab, and headed off to the store.

We decided to smoke another bowl to set us off. We headed towards the baseball diamond, past it, and into a part of the park where people tend not to go, through a hole in a fence, and we were on a high cliff overlooking an authentic train yard. We smoked a bowl and walked along the cliff, and nothing was happening. We left the fence and I got my first real hit from the acid. We were standing on a hill next to the fence overlooking the baseball field and suddenly the green grass and the brown dirt of the baseball field all seemed to be bleeding into each other. The baseball diamond had grass seeping onto it and the sand from the baseball diamond was mingling with the outer reaches of the grass. The metal backstop was gleaming and glittering and hard to focus on. 

I looked at Tom. That was a horrible idea. One of the oddest things about my trip was that during the entire time, whenever I looked at my companion, I would see his face in about 10 different perspectives all flashing and changing very rapidly. I had to strain to figure out what kind of looks he was giving me. It was very odd. I'm used to looking at people and seeing strange things when under the effects of drugs, but this time it was just a bit too real. I couldn't see people for what they were during the trip. Children passing me by or playing in the playground all resembled aliens from some Spielberg movie. Most of the adults I dealt with that day looked normal, but they had an aura of evil around them that only I seemed able to grasp.

Had I done too much? How could I really be sure? Four tabs in under two weeks? Was that an excess? Now, it doesn't seem like such a strange thing, but at the time, the thought was running through my head like a marathon runner. It was everywhere in my mind. When I tried to think of something else, it worked its way back into my head, like a virus. 

The visual hallucinations had started early and I felt robbed of the laughing hysteria phase that usually overtook me. In place of that, I found myself on a rambling kick. I'd start talking and keep talking and then I'd look over at Tom and he'd be staring at me. I explained to him that my inner conversings had come out to play. He seemed to accept this answer and I was glad about that. One less thing to worry about, but Tom was worried. He was rightly worried, because less than 10 minutes later we passed a mother and a kid on a bicycle and suddenly I starting jabbering about being a kid and all my childhood memories from this very same park. After we got out of earshot, Tom made fun of me for a while about scaring the lady and the kid. I hope I didn't scare them too much. 

About this time, the trip was coming on full power. I felt a rush all around me. The world outside of my line of perception seemed to me to be very much irrelevant, and the only thing that mattered was right there in that park. Beforehand I was worried that I would start obsessing over my personal girl problems. I soon learned that those thoughts melted away, and I couldn't have been happier.

Time was also very distorted. Neither of us had a watch nor any way to keep track of what time it was. We had to go back to my house at some point to prepare ourselves to get on the train (we decided not to drive; multiple felons maybe, but responsible people). At what must have been 4:00, we had a huge discussion over what time it was. We were sure that it was nearly 7 and we had to go back soon to get ready for the show. We smoked a bowl and headed back to my house. Well, it turned out that it was 4:30 when we got back (meaning we smoked up at 4:20 - very cool, very cool; we can never make 4:20 unless it's accidental for some reason). After we realized it was early still, we headed back, but the entire rest of the day, time kept doing odd things to us. 

We decided to go back to the store, because we had smoked all of our cigarettes (we went on chain-smoking mode once the trip started) and we wanted to buy some candy to eat as an experiment. I found, however, that being in the store was more then I was prepared to deal with, so I told Tom I'd be waiting outside, gave him money to buy me cigarettes, then went outside and smoked the only cigarette I had left from before. Once I was alone and outside, the world changed gears. It went from being extremely small and centered around me to being very large. I suddenly became aware of every single person who walked by me and what they were doing. Then they all seemed to be looking at me. I decided it was all in my head - all paranoid delusions. I tried to find Tom in the store window, and I succeeded. I watched him pay for the gummi worms (our testing material) and cigarettes, and noticed how he avoided looking at and talking to the clerk. I found it very amusing apparently, because I started laughing hysterically. At that point my brain reminded me I was all alone outside and I said, very loudly, 'Oh shit...', turned around, and saw some guy legitimately staring at me.

Bad vibes overcame me, but they were soon gone. Tom got out of the store and tossed me a bag of gummi worms and a pack of cigarettes. Bliss. Usually when tripping I find eating is generally out of the question. When I think I'm hungry, I get a ton of food but then I can't eat it, or something goes horribly wrong in the process of getting food. No matter. Gummi worms aren't exactly food, more like fun, weird, strange globs of chemicals not entirely unlike the ones I had in me causing all these effects in my brain. The gummi worms were great. I puzzled over their movement, their taste and texture, and had a very long conversation about it. 

The store is across the street from the park on the other end of the park from my house, so we went back into the park and sat at the end in an area that was circular with benches around it. In the middle of the circle was a tree with a fence around it. We each sat on our own bench and stared at the tree in the fence. Suddenly, in my brain Tom was gone. He was out of sight and out of mind. I checked my limbs for a status report but I couldn't really control them that well, so I gave up. I started to hear my heart pounding loudly and then the tree started to seemingly dance. It was skinny, small, and without leaves. It was twirling and rippling and the fence surrounding it was bobbing up and down. The rush I spoke of earlier intensified. Suddenly, there were church bells. The church bells played a strange, enchanting sound. I can't be too sure how long I sat there watching the tree and fence, listening to the church bells in my own little world. Suddenly, though, I realized Tom was sitting on the next bench over. I had actually completely forgotten about him, but I didn't want to break up what was happening. In my mind I explained it as a pure trip, that is, what was happening to me right then at that exact moment was everything that acid should have been. Of course, this was probably just the drugs speaking, but it sure felt that way. The combination of sight, sound, and taste sensations had overwhelmed me with goodness and I was lost. I wondered to myself if Tom was experiencing the same things, but he looked bored when I finally looked over at him. I made a really quick attempt at explaining it to him, but it didn't work at all.

Anyway, eventually 8pm did come and we had to leave for the show (after smoking some more pot). At this point I was still tripping, not as hard as earlier, but the acid was taking its toll. All the people on the train seemed to be detached from me and Tom, and they also seemed to be staring at us. More paranoid delusions. I had a quote of HST's running through my head all during the train ride, trying to keep myself grounded:  'ignore this terrible drug.' Unfortunately, it wasn't that easy. Everyone I looked at had big, buggly eyes and was leering at me. I had decided that they all knew there was something wrong with me. I could pass it off as being drunk tho, and that's not that bad for 8pm on a Saturday evening. 

We got to our desired T stop at 8:30 and that left us half an hour to kill. We wandered around with no particular direction, half strung out and half still tripping. Now, Boston is not a town for psychedelic drugs by any means, but I've survived peaking in Boston so there wasn't much in the town that could throw me off, or so I thought, but instead, out of the blue, two people offered to sell Tom and me two different drugs (one was e, and the other was called 'charley,' which I think is heroin but I can't be too sure). That got me extremely paranoid and anxious about going to this club, because i have spent a lot of my life in Boston and I find it incredibly hard to find anything around here. Odd. 

But, by the time doors opened and we got in, the acid was pretty much completely gone and the dope had worn off long ago. I had a slight headache from dehydration but I danced my ass off anyway. All in all, a fun day and a great trip, maybe the most intense I'll ever have. I got home and passed out first thing. Woke up and went to work for some overtime to pay my way through next weekend.

I am an old head. I have not taken large volumes of LSD, as it's potency seems to revolve around your potency. It is the only drug that is impossible to abuse. Respected, it can be dreadfully strong. It operates on your system primarily as a sensory amplifier, when potent, to the point of distortion. 

As a professional musician, I can say that it's Inspirational,but to be respected. When used as a tool to gain advantage over booze and other situations, it is at best extra legs. Over-use leads to depression. The power to trip is in you: LSD is only the catalyst. While you are young, you can dig it the most, it uses up the vitamins and enzymes in your system, which are replaced by time and nutrition. Have respect. Do you see God?.....Of course!!!!!! By opening your eyes wide and gaining empathy with His creation! Do you become God???// No way.  

You must repent. It is not wrong to experience LSD, it is a privledge, and a joy. How can you get tied up in an experience that is only temporary.? By taking what you've learned to the test. That's Life. Love, Stephen

I have used LSD 27 times so far this year, I only started this year.
Here were I live LSD is very expensive and sometimes you don't even get your trips, the dealers steal all our cash, So sometimes I would get a half but not less! Well It seems that every time I trip out something stays with me I don't have hectic flashbacks but strange visions eg: I have a permanet trail shadow following my hands when I move them around and at night all the shadows in my room moves like ghosts! 

Its not really freaky but I think thats what LSD is suppose to do 'FREAK YOU OUT' anyways when I drink coffee the effect is worse and the longer I go without tripping the worse it gets. So when I take a Trip the effects are gone for about a week , but the hands still makes trails! This all started happening after about 6 trips! They were manily SUN FLOWERS, HOFFMAN'S & MARILYN MONROE's!

        Wow, first acid trip in 8 months. This dude I know from on the
Internet sent me two hits of Red Sun acid, and I took them both. It hit me
fast, in about a half hour, and it hit me hard. I played guitar and talked
on the Internet for about 2 hours.

        It was an interesting trip. It hit me a little around midnight of
the 20th. I took a hit of pot right at midnight to celebrate the first
minute of the first day of spring, and that kicked in the acid. Around
1:45 things were real intense so I decided to get off the computer and go
lay down in bed. The near-full moon was very bright and shining in my
window, with clouds swirling unnaturally fast around it. The bars of my
window frame were flickering around, and the still bare tree branches
outside were dancing wit their own life. It was very visual, and too
intense to look at for long, so I pulled down the shade and closed my
eyes, and went to that inner, chaotic, cut and paste universe of vivid
imagery that I hadn't been to in years. Cartoony voices seemed to be
saying nonsense words from every direction as I floated there in
hyperspace, saying things like 'Zlerty-zot meep awwww znew' or 'Sbpack
Sbpack.' After a while, the chaos organized somewhat, becoming a jumbled
collection of imagery and themes that seemed to come from Jewish culture.
Flash to images of a baby in a crip, this feels something like a memory.
This gives way to images of people I know now, only I see them as they
would have been as small children. Eventually things spiral down to more
coherent imagery, and I lay in bed thinking about life until around 4:30
when I managed to fall asleep.

        I haven't tripped like that in years.

 I was 17 at the time and I remember getting back from school and calling up one of my boys and asking what was up for the night.  It was a friday. He told me that he could hook up some acid, so I said let's try it. So me and my twin brother went to his canton 20 minutes later and he already hooked up 10 tabs for 25 bones, so we gave him our share and we all took 3 tabs each. He saved 1 for the next day.

I drank a big cup of orange juice to help kick in the effects (I don't know if that really works) and waited. Twenty-five minutes went by and I didn't feel a thing. I thought we got ripped off and my homie says, 'He said this shit was potent.' And I said, 'Man, we took 3 doses and I ain't feeling shit.' Five minutes went by and I realized how wrong I was. This shit had me on a 14 hour trip. In the peak I saw everything in a glittery glow and everything I looked at began to melt. My bro and T said they felt it too. They said they saw tracers and my brother said that he felt like he was melting. It was insane.

Anyway, I was listening to my walkman and I go outside of my homie's pad. It was already getting dark, but then I started to notice that everything began to move with the rhythm of the music (I was listening to some Jimi Hendrix). It was so intense how the timing was just exact, it would slow down then pick up pace. The sounds I heard in the music resembled life, it was like reality was represented by the music and I could feel myself floating. I let my eyes go out of focus and then I saw hundreds of little pictures of me right in front of my eyes, like I was staring at myself from behind while I was looking into a mirror. I looked to the sky and I saw the stars forming geometric shapes. I have never had an LSD trip like this before, this was something else.

I saw a cat calling for me and I looked into its eyes and realized that I began to communicate with it. I really understood what it wanted. I think it was a stray cat and it seemed to be lonely. I could see what it was thinking, and it undersood how I felt. Let me tell you, I'm not a cat person, but I started to pet it and it felt grateful for my company. All of a sudden it sounded like it was whispering words to me. Though I couldn't understand what it was saying, I felt it was speaking truths. My bro and T were just sittin' there on the couch just tripping, laughing at everything, man. But I saw this and it seemed as though I knew why it was like this and I couldn't explain it. I could still hear the cat then I said, 'Farewell, little guy and good luck.' I went back into the room and tried to tell these guys what was happening, but they were laughing too much, so I couldn't blame them.

I sat on the couch and listened to my walkman. I felt like I was in the music. I couldn't see myself anymore, I could just hear the music all around me. Then I closed my eyes and opened them to what seemed to be a universe and all this time I could hear music playing in the backround. I lost track of time and it seemed like an eternity, but when I closed my eyes and opened them again, I was in my neighborhood walking and it was daytime. This all on the kraziest 14 hour acid trip of my life. I tell you, this really was something else. Almost like a dream in reality.

When i turned nineteen (summer of 98) i was a heavy acid user.  i had just found out that i had impregnated  my ex-girlfriend and was somewhat of an alcoholic loser.  However, we were getting really good lsd mailed from out west, and i was eating a fair bit of it.  over the course of the year i ate it about every weekend, usually 3-8 hits.  i would constantly feel someone hovering over my shoulder and whispering something in my ear.  i couldn't tell who it was but knew it was a girl. this happened approximately 5-7 times over the course of the year.  

the following summer me and my friend got drunk and decided to injest 30-40 drops each.  it was scary but interesting.  the same thing happened but this time i realized that it was my ex-girlfriend because i could see, feel, hear and smell her. i had gone to visit our child that day for only the second time in 3-4 months. within two weeks i cut my hair, got a job, and started working on getting my girlfriend back.  

two long months later we were back together, but the coolest part was about three months after that.  When we had just finished making love on a
january night she whispered the same thing i had heard those many lsd-induced times before.  we have been together ever since.

It was a friday night and after my friend and I had gotten back home, we decided to trip.  Well, actually we had decided to two days ago, but that was just the point-of-no-return per se.  Anyway, I had 3 hits in my posession.  1 white blotter with a star on it, and two sweet tarts that had had liquid lsd dripped onto them.  Around 12 I took the white blotter and my friend took one sweet tart.  We waited, and waited, and waited for what seemed like forever.  

My friend mentioned that he was hungry and so we decided to get some midnight snacks.  We went into my kitchen and made some popcorn and sandwiches.  For some odd reason i started staring at the popcorn and when i realized that i had been staring at the popcorn for some time, i realized that my friend was not in the kitchen anymore.  So, out of fear that my parents or younger sibling would discover him tripping balls, I started whispering out his name, and after what seemed like an eternity of searching i found him standing in front of a mirror in my entry-hall and all he said was look at the mirror.  Now this is probably my only regret of the night, however, I have grown from this mistake and I am sure that it is only specific to me, but I decided to look in the mirror.  It was AMAZING, my face suddenly became nothing and then was immediately an 'aliens' head (those grey ones that are commonly depicted on TV).  This scared the crap out of me.  So my friend and I decided it would be best to go back into my room.  

I felt extrememly uneasy and anxious almost paranoid.  I decided to get on IRC and talk to some 'experts' I knew.  As indicated by a so-called 'expert' i started watching Tom and Jerry.  My friend started laughing his balls off, while I could only think of how bad it must be to be the little mouse helpless to such a predator as a large cat.  However, again this i believe is only specific to me and furthermore sprouted from an incident that occurred only a month before.  Anyway i felt that what i needed to do was just lay down and relax and listen to some music.  So I got in my bed and realized that it would all be over soon and that i should just enjoy it while i could. So I just relaxed and listened to some Bob Marley and closed my eyes and looked at all the patterns and amazing visuals that I was seeing.  There were so many that I cannot remember them all, however, there are two that stuck out in my mind.  One occurred after my friend had insisted on turning out the lights and turning off the TV.  I was staring at my wall and noticed how it looked almost like liquid, so I decided to touch it and when I did, it rippled and some of the 'liquid' came off on my hand and quickly started engulfing my entire hand, I loved this, it was right out of the matrix.  Another wonderful visual that I experienced was when I suddenly felt this urge to stare at my fingers.  My index and middle finger suddenly turned into cartoon baby blue-jay's. 

Contradictions and Additional Notes:  I forgot to mention that around 12:45 after feeling no significant effect, i took the third sweet-tart.  And also, my 'friend' who I was with insisted on turning out the lights and TV, which pissed me off, but because of the fear of inducing a 'bad trip' i didn't argue.

I was 18 the first time I experienced what would forever change my life.  My friend had done acid before, and I was intrigued with how a small piece of paper could cause some of the things she described.  She led me on my first trip...

We were walking from a neighbor's apartment to our apartment, which was only a few yards when the effects started to occur.  It seemed like it took days to walk the short distance.  The hairs on my arms began to stand up...the air felt light...I felt like I was gliding along...noticing things I had never noticed before.  Lights had multiple colors, not just the white color I had only seen before.  The wind made the most incredible, exciting sounds through the trees.  Words are insufficient to describe the experience.  I felt I was in touch with the universe...like I was one with my friend...we could read each other's thoughts.  Life made absolute sense.

I have described it to people by saying that the 'walls in my mind were torn down.'  I have never since seen life the same as before the first experience.  There is more reality now, be it good or bad, REALITY.  It is this continued perception that makes me believe one never comes down after doing acid.

The second time I tripped, it was with my friend, and boyfriend at the time; we'll call him J. It was way more intense than the first time, but I felt worse after I came down. We got the acid from another friend and took it at her house at about 8pm. J and I were with a third friend, W, who wasn't on anything that night. We were driving out to J's house and we picked up some fast food on the way and ate in an empty parking lot near J's house. While they were eating I started feeling the acid. I felt tingly all over, and then it felt like when your foot falls asleep, but all over my body. J and W walked around the parking lot smoking a cigarette and I stayed in the car because I was cold. I was looking at the car seat and it looked like it was breathing, very gently. 

Then we went to J's house, and talked to his parents and grandmother for a while. I was really feeling it by then. I felt detached and kind of unfocused or tranced out. We went outside and we were leaning against the above-ground pool. Water looks really awesome when you're tripping. I was leaning against J and we were entranced by the stars. The clouds appeared to be coming in closer and closer. J was trying to explain it to W and we waved his lit cigarette across the sky. J and I both saw it leave a bright trail and we were like, 'Whoa!!!' W just said, 'Okaaaay...' (He's been with me both times I tripped; he finds it hilarious to watch people on acid.) We went inside and were watching Outbreak  on one of the fifty billion movie channels. The sick people looked really disgusting. 

Then we went outside; it was December so it was pretty cold. J and I smoked a joint and we were just having fun being fucked-up dorks. W was having fun watching us be fucked-up dorks. Me and J spent a lot of time looking at the sky; we both saw a cloud that looked like a man's face moving around. At one point I was holding the joint and the wind blew smoke into my eyes. Everything look beautiful and swirly for a second. It was just a screen of white opalescent smoke. J, who doesn't exactly live in the best part of town (he calls it the ghetto but it's not too bad) was telling us about all the neighbors that went past. Then we saw a dog across the street. J went over and started barking at it. It barked back once, J barked back louder and ran toward it, and the dog hauled ass down the street. It was really funny. We went back inside, and by then I felt like I was just drifting through everything we did. 

All of a sudden, all my thoughts, everything just made perfect sense. Everything seemed so right, and I was thinking that this was how it should always be. J was holding his baby niece for what seemed like a long time, but my sense of time was way distorted, anyway he and the baby just looked so content and peaceful. That added to my thoughts of how right everything was. W and I had to leave soon after that (we're still in high school, we had a lame curfew). On the way home, my sense of time got even more out of whack. The clock would say, like, 11:30 or something, for what felt like ten minutes. Then I'd look back what I thought was 2 minutes later and it'd be 20 minutes later. Before the tripping started, J and I told W to let us listen to 'It's On' by Korn when we started tripping. So me and W listened to it on the way home. It was awesome. If you've never heard it, it had kind of weird, fluctuating noises at the beginning. 

I was at my dad's house for the weekend, and of course I didn't want him to know I was tripping, so I was trying to avoid him as much as possible. I wanted to go to bed because I hadn't peaked yet and I was afraid I'd act too weird in front of him. There was a towel on a rack in the bathroom that look like it was contacting in and out like an accordion. My dad asked where all we'd gone, and for a second I completely blanked out until I remembered we were at J's. I told him i was tired  so I as going to bed, but he was in a talkative mood. I was beginning to have visual hallucinations so I finally locked myself in my room for the night. The walls were moving. My dork little sister had hung pine tree garland things all over in honor of Christmas, and I swore they were breathing. There were also foil garlands that looked like liquid that was dancing. It was cool. 
Then I noticed the ceiling. It's wood so you could see the grain and where the paint is peeling, and the patterns it formed were moving all over, like a flat lava lamp. I watched the ceiling most of the night. At one point the design changed to bugs and scorpions but I didn't freak like I thought I would have. The bed was the softest I've ever been in. I was floating. My deep thoughts returned; over anf over in my head was a mantra of 'Everything is now.' I was thinking that we spend way too much time obsessing over the past and future, and we should just chill and ejoy everything now. I finally got to sleep for an hour at 7am. It was a better trip than my first, because I didn't see things that much the first time. But next time, I'll probably do it during the day. 

This was the day before semester exams and I need sleep! Since then I've kind of kept in mind the 'revelations' I had; I quit worrying so much about what I could have changed of the past and I don't freak about the future, I just kind of go with the flow. Which isn't a bad idea, I found. See, drugs are good for some things!

So there's this thing that came through my town called the Omegafest and my friend buys several bottles of the pure liquid that allegedly starts the national chain of illicit lysergic acid.

This stuff is so strong and pure that I fill a by-then almost empty food-coloring bottle with tap water and swish and gulp... Blugh! I've never really tasted acid to such an immeasurable degree, and I soon discover that despite my self-proclaimed guru status I have never dosed like this before.

So we're (my friend and I) winding back to our origin of consciousness and we're discussing trip stuff. After awhile I realize that my consciousness is completely delocalized and quantum reality is surging through my brain. I have to think really, really hard to figure out what room I am in and by midnight I have forgotten everything that I had done earlier that day.

This is where it gets weird... I come to discover that me and my friend are of the same genetically evolved species, except I'm the active component and he's the passive component. He had mastered the trip from the past up the the present and I knew the trip from the present into the future. Anyways we finally succeed in smoking pot and I am suddenly absorbed in what I swore was post-terrestrial existence.

Everything I saw moved in ray-traced slow motion and all light appeared to be pixellized. This is where the missing moment begins. We are walking in perfect circles in his apartment living room speaking back and forth to each other without thinking about it at all, utilizing the vehicle of our heightened consciousness to communicate. Then, I bump into a chair and it fucks with my orbit. I obliviously pick the chair up and heave it as if it was the oppressive force I've experienced my entire subjective existence... right through a gigantic sliding glass door.

My friend looks at me astonished, but I assuage his anxiety by proclaiming 'Hey man! It doesn't matter anymore! We're creating everything we perceive with our minds and now you and I are going to infuse our thoughts and make the universe contract into the big stop! Finally! We're god now!'

How incredibly naive. We proceeded to break a lot of other things in his home, spit on the walls, pour beer everywhere, unleash gigantic bags of tea into the air, and cover all of the walls with psychotic gibberish in crayon. Actually, I only broke the glass door with the chair and my friend did all of the other stuff while I lay in the bottom of his shower... water blasting, curled up naked in a fetal position sucking my thumb. A baby once again...

My subjective cognitive reference point had completely vanished and I was thrown back into infinity... Simultaneously existing in a 3d shell with my mind expanded into the entirety of the fouth dimension. Mentally dead but physically alive. I was still waiting for us to somehow shed our old skins and enter 'thought-world' but I started coming down instead.

I realized that I was not, in fact, existing in a place made by my thoughts so that I could unify all things into one, but that I had just tripped harder than I've ever tripped on LSD and that now I would have to pay for the shit I broke. Kinda bummed me out that I had tripped once again only to put more polish on the paradigm and not to cross myself over into a greater form, whatever that might have been.

This was one fo my first experiences with the drug and by far one of my fondest, if only for the variation in moods and thoughts and how I was able to cope.

The incident happened in 1993 at a MegaDog gig in London.  Similar to a rave but more trancy tribal music and with better visuals.

We (my friend and his girlfriend) had purchased our tickets the day prior to the gig and had spent the rest of the time what gear to take and use.  George (as he shall be called) had already gone to Amsterdam and obtained a thousand 'groucho marx' (rectangular tabs) and was hiding them from his mum in his computer.

A few hours before entrance we had gone to a couple of pubs and had some alchohol (I've never seen too much of a hazard of mixing small amounts of drink with other drugs) and managed to have ourselves a bit of a smoke.  I had to smoke via a pipe coz I can't stand tobacco so I'm Mr Neat.  George prefers Skunk so Skunk it was.  

By the time we arrived at the que for the gig we were feeling mellow but happily nervous with anticipation.  We didn't even take much heed to the intensity of the cold of the night (November).

After the obligatory hands-up-search-for-anything type affair at the door and then sorting coats and tickets out we all went off to check out the venue.  We'd been there before but its always the thing to do.  The music was already thumping from various rooms and there was the feeling of adrenalin in the air.  The main arena was warming up with the likes of Astralasia with deep base sounds that reverberated around the walls and straight through you.  That was good in itself.

Soon afterwards we met up again and decided that we would take just half of a trip for now.  Because half was the size of a normal one I knew at some point I was going to come up pretty hard.  One by one we filed off to the loos and dropped our gear.  

I ALWAYS have a nauseous feeling when I swallow the tab.  I think its due to the anticipated nausea that some of us get when coming up.  So after swallowing I did the innevitable body shiver with a screwed up face and went to the bar to get some water.

The next forty five minutes or so we spent leaning against the wall nodding our heads to the music and occasionally taking swigs of water.  We all do it!  I think I was the last to come up and when that happens you automatically think you've got a dud.  But low and behold I remember the first twinge of slight sickness.  It made me shift my position and then I felt the warm sensation in my stomach.  this made me breath in deep and I felt my cheeks redden.  Loverly!  The smile stretched across my face and I just let it take control.

It came in waves and eventually remained a constant.  My weight was lifted and I felt light as a feather.  Goose bumps flittered up and down my arms as I felt the steady thump of the base pulsating through my body.  Ten minutes later and I couldn't resist the urge to dance and I was off!  Eventually I was at the front of the crowd near the speakers and the stage where the djs were and loving it.

Every now and then I would come off for a breather.  Sometimes I found George and his girlfriend sitting down with huge grins on their faces.  We would exchange slow nods and smiles (all that's needed) and do our own thing.  I remember that when I danced my arms and hands seemed to move in a slow motion with my eyes and head following their movement.  It seemed much slower than the music was going but I seemed to be hitting the beat every time.

A couple of hours later and I was absolutely caned - I was sweating buckets and could hardly speak.  I would walk through the crowds as if drifing or floating and the people would just melt out of the way.  There were no sudden movements from me - well of course not, I could predict the entire movements of everyone in the building and new exactly when to turn or glide this way and that.  I was dancing a routine through the crowd that had been pre-written for me - it was fantastic.

The first hallucination I had was when I entered one of the chill out bars.  The very first thing I saw was the stone slabs that they used for the floor.  Then I saw the some grungy people with green army coats in the corner and then a spilt drink to my right.  It was dark here and quite crowded.  In that split second my brain had already made up its mind on where it thought it was.  Quickly the bar melted and revealed the dungeon that I was really in.  I moved slowly through looking at the dripping water and the rats that scurried out of my way.  Prisoners of some other era lay dormant in their green macs in the corners.  The stone walls had green alghi and other damp patches everywhere.  I had to shake my head before the bar materiallised.  'For gods sake' I reminded myself, 'its a fucking bar'.  As I ordered another bottle of water the images kept repeating.  I didn't panic though - it was interesting and I remember thinking how it could happen that anyone could possibly get from a bar to a dungeon cell.

Later I bumped into another friend who was smoking some skunk as he always did.  He seemed able to talk fine and was asking me various polite questions.  Unfortunately,  with every word he spoke I was thinking of a thousand answers and when I eventually opened my mouth to speak, a million words tried to form but ended up in alot of giberish and a few audible 'erms' and 'ums'.  This worried me a little as I was becoming increasingly aware that he could tell I was off my rocker.  I had to control the panic welming inside.  Was he looking at me strangely?  Was he giving subtle hand signals to others to suggest I was stupid? Was the group over there giggling at what I was doing, or wearing - or NOT wearing?  I looked down to check if I my trousers had disappeared.  Again, I had to shake my head.  No-one was taking the piss out of me so calm down!

I met with George who asked if I wanted to up to the balcony to calm down.  I nodded and followed like a zombie.  I passed a couple of people collecting for children in need who collered me for money - I think I gave them a fiver - they knew I was totalled and slapped a sticker on my chest.  I remember they made it cover the face of mona lisa I had printed with fractals and a spliff.  They thought it was funny.  I just wanted to get away from their voices that were changing pitch from high to low and back again.

Upstairs everyone was lying or sitting down.  I had to pick my way through all the bodies and sit down.  We sat for a while and I was able to cool down a bit.  Someone tapped me twice on the shoulder.  I looked round but noone was even near me.  I freaked!  I wasn't bolloxed enough that I couldn't mistake that tap.  And I sure as hell knew that no-one was near me.  'What's up?'  George asked.  'blddysbbbllblbl...um'  I replied in good effort and then pointed to my sticker on my chest.  It had gone!  Oh my god, had the mysterious tapper pinched it or had I imagined those people downstairs?  I hadn't imagined the fiver that was for sure.  Panic was on its way back again. 

I got up and decided to go back for a dance - yeh dancing would get my head back to noddy land.  within a few minutes I was leaping around madly fallowing the green and red fractal designs that my hands were making whilst courting with the flashing lights.

Now, George had warned me previously about some type of Ether that companies were putting into their smoke machine during these times.  He'd said it was like Amyl Nitrite in that it brought everyone up in seconds without them knowing and then they'd have a really ace time and tell all their friends about the gig - thus more gigs.  He also said that it had a habit of multiplying the effects of any substances that you were on by about four times.  Looking back I think it was some urban rumours that were going around - but I still think about it.  Anyway, I remember at one point (when Eat Static were playing) at a crux of a tune the smoke machine let out loads and ingulfed everyone.  In the next few seconds I watched as if not part of my body, as EVERYONE became one moving body.  Their eyes all widened and searching forwards.  it was like a huge wave of bodies all under one control.  Then, all of a sudden I felt my left upper leg lock in intense cramp.  I dropped like a sack of spuds and then really panicked.  No-one had even noticed I was writhing in agony!  If anything, they all seemed to just dance on me.  I picked a direction and crawled through the feet of the possessed crowd until I came to a door.  Stumbling through I was in a corridor and managed to slump myself down on a chair.  

Whilst massaging my leg I remember that my leg was starting to fade in green and red fractals and the floor was alive with sparks of these patterns.  All I could think was 'oh for gods sake not now'  I didn't panic then and was more pissed of that I couldn't benefit the picture because of the cramp.  A girl materialised with a glass of water-'...just as you asked-'  I smiled and wondered when I had asked her.

The pain subsided and I calmed down and I sat back and watched the patterns for a while.  Green and red sparkes were shooting across the floor and all over my hands.  The walls were pulsating and shifting colours and the music was altering its pitch chaotically.  Sitting there I could at last appreciate it for what it was and desperately wanted to work out how it happens.  At that point George came through the door with his girlfriend and they didn't look to pleased.  They asked it I'd noticed the change on the dance floor and George kept on saying about the Ether.  We all agreed to go outside into a square that was part of the building's grounds.  Here we were able to cool down.  I didn't bother speaking but just listend to the whispers of other conversations all around me.  The sound was like the noise of the sea genlty rolling on a shingle beach.

Soon we decided to leave.  I had to be led as I could no longer steer myself in the mathematical fashion I had done before.  I remember walking onto the street and seeing the cars.  The tracers that the cars left behind made it seem as if they were moving at high speed.  Watching them it seemed like they were moving at one mile and hour.  The noise was jingle jangle of squeaks and mumbles.  Getting a cab was the funniest part as neither of us was in any decent enough position to speak properly and we had to enter an office to order it.  It seemed like it took twenty minutes to get the words out and then we were in the car-I was sitting in the front.  

In London the all night cabs are driven by dodgy people with their own cars.  It suddenly dawned on me that we could be taken advantage of here.  None of us would be able to put up a struggle.  I didn't even know where the hell I was let alone put my fists up.  My door was opened and a man started shouting.  This was it, I thought.  We're gonna get mugged and I'm supposed to be the tougher one.  I started laughing.  As it turned out the guy thought our driver was taking his fare.  A few seconds later and we were off.  We stopped under a bridge briefly so that I could be sick out of the car.  George was putting it down to the effects of the Ether - again.

When we got back I got the cramps again and George's girlfriend got me some salt/sugared water which worked a treat (strongly suggest it for dehydration) and I lay there quietly tripping and slowly coming down.

With no sleep, I was up and had left by six thirty in the morning.  I had to travel the underground to Victoria and then down to Brighton (about sixty miles) to work.  Needless to say I was completey plastered and still a little bit tripping.  My boss was not amused.

That's it.  It was, looking back on it a great time and well worth it.  For since then I have been able to work out my own personal dosage and have developed a good understanding of hallucinations and what to expect.  If ever I take trips now its usually about a quater of a tab at a time.

One good thing about trips is the ability for hand-eye co-ordination.  I have learnt some of my best tricks whilst tripping.

Thanks for reading this (if you did)

A few weeks ago after a local concert a friend of mine named Chris and I had nothing to do, and it was about 1:30am. I offered him to trip with me and we both dropped a ten strip of pink elephant blotter. We are both experienced acid heads who've done that much before, so we weren't expecting anything out of the ordinary which is why we didn't get a sitter.

At about 2 while I was buying Chris some cigaretts the acid began to work. As I walked into the CVS, the shop lifting detectors started to go off. This got me really paranoid and I thought that someone was going to arrest me so I ran out of the store and threw anything in my pockets that would've set off the alarm, and went back in. This time it was ok and nothing was beeping so I bought the cigarettes, and when I gave her the money her face became colored with what reminded me of indian war paint. I got to thinking that, I was in store for a really intense trip, that I wasn't prepared for.

We got to Chris's house and sat in my friend Shaun's van, I asked Chris how he was doing and he said he wasn't doing that well and he thought it was a little too intense too. After talking to Chris for awhile I looked out the window of the van, and saw a pit of alligators and other lizards where grass normally is. I thought this was amazing and couldn't believe how real they looked, and all of a sudden a man riding a horse was charging down the street. Holy shit I thought, he's coming for me. Then he was gone I look all around and the alligators are still there. This isn't good my visuals usually go away after blinking or looking at something else, but this was different they wouldn't leave, are they real or fake I couldn't decided. My mind would not tell me. 

I tell Chris whats going on he isn't doing well either but by far better than I'm doing. He tells me to go with him to see Shaun. I don't want to leave the gators were still there, he convinces me to go with him somehow. Inside Shaun's house the concrete floor is nothing but crocodile heads, and then blue and orange snakes apear and I can feel them crawling beneath my feet. Finally, Shaun shows up my whole body is shaking and I've chewed a straw into almost nothing. Shaun trys to calm me down but he can't help. So we leave.

Next thing I can remember we're in a soccer field sitting on some bleachers the aligators are still there, but I've found out they don't want me, right now all of the alligators are fighting and fucking each other and are ignoring me for now. As we walk into the field there is a force field constructed by diamond shapes and as I walk through I can feel it. The stars in the sky have turned red and are shooting out white light. I look across the street and see dinosaurs, I ignore them. Holy shit there are 2 cars pulling into the field, are they cops? My friend assures me they are not and I hear a robotic voice yell 'get over here' Chris tells me he didn't hear anything. I begin to power walk back to Shaun's. 

That is all I can remember from that night, but I know I spent a lot more time shaking and being frightened. I think I had such a bad trip because of two things, one no sitter, and two I couldn't decifer what was real or fake. The whole next day I didn't sleep at all and spent most of the day silent.

I went away from my job in Pittsburgh for the weekend of July 4th.  I met up with some travelers at the Pittsburgh Intern'tl Airport and we drove up to Ridgeway Pa in a rental car.  I was there for the weekend, and while camping down in the Bear Creek valley I heard that somebody was throwing a rave up in the main 'Owl's Nest' parking lot.  I chose not to go.  The night of July 4th I was walking with a good friend i hadn't seen in a long time.  He had been a soldier for the US army until he got kicked out for smoking pot.  

Anyway, he convinced me to go up to the rave that night in the parking lot.  He and I walked up to the A-camp that was nearby to get a ride to the main parking lot about 2 miles away.  I bought 2 hits for blotter from an older hipped out brother and gave one to my friend.  We were speculating about the authenticity of the stuff i'd just bought when some dude and his passenger asked us if we wanted a ride. We hopped right in and drove off for the parking lot where the rave was.  

We were crusing along with some strangers who were probably already tripped out, and here there was some other guy walking along the road.  The driver stopped and asked the guy if he wanted a ride.  So this other dude with a bookbag gets in the back seat with us.  He was rather 'studious' looking.  He was wearing glasses and had a button down shirt with a collar.  After we had went along a bit he asked the driver if he wanted any 'dose'.  The driver and his passenger declined.  My friend Hayden and i looked at each other and i then asked if we could have some.

This dude pulls out a chemistry lab storage bottle with a dropper at the top of it.  This bottle was brown glass and probably about 1000mL.  He says 'This is the washout from the basins that they use to make LSD.  Some elders gave it to me and told me to pass it on.'  

My friend and i thinking it was diluted each took about 2 droppers full of the liquid.  I distinctly remember swishing the liquid around in my mouth. 
Ahhhhhh.

So hayden and i were dropped off at the parking lot, and i began to feel the effects of the L starting to kick in.  We found out that we had quite a way to go to get to the party.    Hayden walked off and i sat down beside someone's dark green Vw bus.  I enjoyed laying there and i felt it's personality communing with me.  

I got up and went to walk down the road to the rave.  The effests were coming on strong now.  A group was a little bit ahead of me and someone had some glowsticks on a string spinning them around.  I kept thinking that they had lightsabers.  I caught up to the group, and i could hear a girl breathing across the road from me.  I moved closer to her. I felt that i needed to protect her.  I was her bodyguard.  I had no idea who she was.  I asked her name and she told me it was Amy.  

We walked further down the road.  Where was Hayden?  The moon was full, the silver light casting everything in a spacey glow. What a wonderful time i was going to have!!

I was a little scared form time to time, but the fear faded quickly.  The thing i was most concerned about was becoming confused and disoriented.

The group i was walking with finally got to the rave.  There at the entrance to the litle space off the road was Hayden.  I hugged him and he laughed.  He kept poking me to see if i was really there.  He said something to me about being naked, so i walked over behind the setup.  There was a u-haul and a gasoline generator with a tent canopy set up for the DJ booth.  I walked behind there and took off my clothes.  That's when the thoughts invaded.

Hayden had been in the Army.  He had been in communications. He had somehow taken contol of a government communications satelite. Here he was playing techno music on the world communication network!!!  He was the DJ!!!  I was running around naked yelling at the people over at the DJ booth to leave him alone.  

Then i thought that I was in the making of the next Star Wars... Episode II.  Frank Oz the voice of Yoda had died, and i was the only one who could talk like Yoda. I was running around talking like Yoda.  I thought my friends Laurie and Melissa were there.  I remember talking to a girl who i thought was Laurie.  That's when the corporations too over.

Since hayden had stolen the satelite, the top companies of the world wanted to restore peace.  An asian girl sat near me and mentioned somethign about Ford.  She was the daughter of the top Ford exec!!!  For some reason she got mad and went to walk away.  I tried to get her to stay there.  So i followed her to the entrance.  And there was Hayden!

He talked to me for a little bit and i asked him to help me find my clothes.  after a while he looked down at me and exclaimed 'You don't have any clothes!!!'  'I know!!! Help me find them, they're lost!!!!'

I did find my shoes, and i walked back out to the dirt roadway.  I was looking at the moon, and i kept seeing a laser beam shoot across my vision ala Dark Side of the Moon.  So i walked off in the direstion i thought leaded back to the main parking lot.  I was walking over near the edge of the road, and i entered the woods.  I was feeling kinda funny.  I stumbled into the brush, and i remember crashing over and falling down.  I was dying.

My mind drifted off into a Tolkien book.  I could see the words written in that elegant text.  I was part of the earth and my body melted (rotted?) away and for a thousand years i was a hillside.  Then water and wind pushed away the dirt and i was flat again.  It was like i was reliving that part of the earth's memory.  

I became concious lying on my back staring up at the stars through the canopy of leaves.  I had the feeling i was lying in a net.  Some people were talking to me.  This was a test.  I was being trained for the special underground organization that Hayden belonged to.  I was held in a net and i felt my mind drift away.  I became a two dimensional object.  I was a 'downward spiral'.  I was spinning and spinning and drifting downwards.  Images came to my mind of two seperate entities.  A goat an a dove were pulling in opposite directions.  I had a message sent into my brain.  
'There is no greater wrong than a child torn between the parents of two different religions'

I spiraled off some more and i became the film of oil on a stagnant stream, and i looked up to see a dragonfly land above me.  It's compound eye glittered in the sunlight.  I then became one of the facets of the eye.  The words of Albert Einstein entered my mind.  'I just want to know the thoughts of God. Everything else is just details.'  I saw Einstein as he arrived in heaven. He asked God what the answer to life was, and God said 'YES'.  As i became coherent i thought that God had let me travel back through time and space.  I had been allowed to go back to 1978.  I was allowed to travel to San fransisco, California in that year.

I got up and broke free from my 'net'.  As I walked out of the woods i thought i could surf.  I ran down the road as fast as i could, and i stopped a guy standing beside the road.  'What year is it?'  He looked at me kinda funny and answered '1999, dude'

So i tried to find my clotes again, but no dice.  At least i had my shoes.  Now, if i could only find which way i was supposed to go.  I walked for a bit and ran into a 'DEP' officer.  I walked over to him and asked him how to get to get to the parking lot. He issued me a ticket.  I didn't have any pockets, so i slipped it in the window of a parked car along the road.  I kept walking, and if i saw a car approach, i would hide in the woods.  I stopped by another car along the road, and i asked a guy that was camping there  for a pair of pants i could wear.  He hooked me up with some pajamas pants.

I finally made it to the parking lot after an eternity of walking.  I had lost Hayden, but i knew i'd see him again. I went over to the rental car i had come up in, and layed on the back window.  I looked up at the stars, and i saw the milky way smeared across the darkness. I fell asleep glad to be out of the whole mess.  Someone nearby was playing some Grateful Dead on a car stereo, and i fell asleep to Jerry's guitar.  

I woke up a little later and i was freezing.  I got up and walked around.  Two cars over someone had left their window down.  I looked inside and decided that they wouldn't mind if i slept for a little bit inside.  I opened the door and crashed out again on their back seat.  

When i woke up in the morning, i rolled up the window of the car and walked down to the valley to meet my traveling companions.

What a trip!

I feel a little guilty about submitting this since I haven't been able to read the entire experience archives and have no way of knowing if this is a rather common experience or not.

For me it was a new way to take acid.  

I love acid, but I usually have a problem finding time to have a whole trip Micro dots are like litte aspirin pills of acid and they can, we realized be crushed up and snorted.  This way the trip hits a lot faster and lasts a lot less time.  something to try if you ever get a hold of some dots.
