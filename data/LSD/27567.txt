The difference between the dark and still night outside to the party inside was quite extreme. A constant background murmuring of noise, activity in almost every square inch of my visual axis, and random detached snatches of conversation drifting across my consciousness. The contrast wasnÂ’t helped by a prank it seemed everyone in the party had decided to play on me, which was to shout my name at me as I walked in to the main lounge. The sight of dozens of faces all pissed some tripping looking at you and shouting your name while tripping yourself was not pleasant, but it was a surprise.
