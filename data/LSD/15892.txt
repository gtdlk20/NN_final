After that, I planned on giving myself a few days at least to recover before taking another trip. Unfortunately, 2 nights later I was feeling like a million bucks and my friend (we'll call him M) called and said he was in the mood to trip. I felt like I was so ready for another trip but little did I know. M comes over to my house and it's midnight at this point and I have work at 7 AM. I took it anyway. We both took a tab and a half. M is one of my best friends but he has done a lot of acid, meth, coke, and pretty much everything in his life so he has a lot of psychological problems. After dropping, we bought a sack of marijuana just to lighten up the mood.
