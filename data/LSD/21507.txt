Thinking back, I really cant remember exactly what color that damn lava lamp was that night. I remember hues of green, red, and purple, but Im not positive. Anyway, after enjoying mild visual distortions for about half an hour, such as watching the ceiling fan lower and raise as it spun, walls breathing, etc. etc., J and I decided to go out on the patio for a cig. Now, Im a reasonably stable-minded guy, but he almost convinced me he was my Tyler Durdenmy alter-ego, as it were. Hey, at the time, I wasnt in much of a state to argue, I just denied.  Heres where the trip really set in.
