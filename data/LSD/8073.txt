I found myself incredibly grateful for the many luxurious accommodations Im afforded in my life here with my Mom and Dad. My every need is provided for, and I have done relatively nothing to provide for it. I felt simultaneously very grateful about this, that things were the way they are, but also I felt like it really shouldn't be any other way. On the one hand, it doesn't feel right to say that my Mom and Dad should do everything for me, but on the other hand theyre the ones that called me into this inexplicable and maddening existence, and if they hadn't then I wouldnt be obligated to provide for myself at all. I felt supremely strange and a little unsettled by these thoughts, since I wasnt sure what I was going to do about them now that I had them.
