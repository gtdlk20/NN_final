By the time we made it to the Student Union, I was barely able to communicate. Fences, trees, brick walls, anything with an existing pattern would seize all of my attention to the point where I felt no need to talk, just stare and watch. I was able to tell my friend that if I were to stop and look at any one thing for too long, I would get lost in it, unable to communicate or look away without great effort. If I had been walking alone I surely would have explored this further, but we had a destination and that fact kept me on track, though just barely. Walking behind the Union, we passed a construction yard, another awe-inspiring sight. The shear amount of geometric shapes in the scaffolding, fencing and construction equipment threatened to steal my attention once again. I stopped and stared for a bit, watching the shimmering and waving patterns turn into a kaleidoscope of colors, all twisting in at the same direction and speed. The longer I stared, the more other-worldly the hallucinations became, and I was thoroughly happy. This was exactly what I had hoped for.
