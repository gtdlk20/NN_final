While I knew I was tripping, I had never before hallucinated in this manner. All my hallucinations had been gentle and interesting and had not included people at all. I decided that everyone was playing a trick on me. (Great idea right?) I had an idea that it had something to do with the people that had been playing music in the basement. I waited for a while for them to give it up, said 'you people are crazy' (hehehe) and walked into the kitchen. People continued to talk nonsensically and someone in the kitchen said a rhyme about Jesus Christ (Christian religious figure) to the purpose of him being blessed with the spirit of god, coming down to earth and having nothing to do but 'piddle de ding dong dingus'...
