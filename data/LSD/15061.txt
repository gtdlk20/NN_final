Look up at the ceiling, its insane! my friends always told me. Man, what a sight. Before even thinking about the ceiling, I glanced around the room and stared at the posters. The most intriguing poster was of The Doors Jim Morrisons face. The only difference than a normal picture was that the background colors were incredibly trippy. I stared at his face and I was happy that we were friends. I felt like I could confide in him and talk to him. My friend and I actually did talk to him. We explained how awkward we felt because the people in the other room were acting so shady! After talking to Jim I felt better. After looking at different posters around the room, my other favorite was the Phish poster to my right. It was the band all gathered around in black and white. It seemed as though they were just there practicing in the studio. I told my friend I felt like I was in the studio with them. I told the boys to turn up the mike a bit and my friend and I actually jammed with Phish for a while.
