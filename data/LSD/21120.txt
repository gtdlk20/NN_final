This experience is about the time I took two tabs of LSD. This occured April 7, 2017. I feel like sharing my experience for some reason, it was both positive and negative. This was basically what I thought was the last time I was going to be able to hangout with a close friend before attending court for a drug possession with intent to distribute charge so my chances of being on probation was high but I got lucky. Anyways I needed to explain that because it affected my experience going in with that mindset. I planned the day before to hangout with my friend. I planned to buy and consume two tabs. The day came I rode the city bus to the friends residence. Purchased the two tabs and took them right there in friends room. He ended up being with his companion so friends companion was there. This may sound weird but within maybe 20-25 minutes of taking these tabs I started to feel the effects, I pulled my phone out and noticed how the icon apps on my phone screen seemed to be slowly moving I felt this energy.
