I had put in another recording, which was Psychopod's Dreampod and noticed that the candle fire drew funny shapes to the floor behind it which then started to take more arranging form. I stared there for a while and then again concentrated on listening to the song. The complexity of the sounds and patterns in the song gave me fantastic feeling of euphoria, as I understood that this is what psychedelic trance to me is all about, the soundscapes changing fluently and fast enough with a certain amount of strict control so that everything sounds carefully planned and very mathematically arranged.
