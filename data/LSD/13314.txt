Instantly the trip intensified to an unparalleled degree.  It was a personal insanity.  Things streched and grew.  People from far off places appeared in the brick walls.  The couch threatened me.  I did everything i could to keep from thinking that I took double the acid that I've ever taken, but alas, I was peaking and couldn't help it.  The furniture changed colors and began melting into puddles. The liquified cotton and wool spread around the apartment and it began to flood.  I began to cry to Nathan to get out of the room because the house was sinking.  He never heard me.  I was sure he had died.  The only way I could survive was to climb the staircase.  The staircase was unfriendly and very hard to navigate.  I just crawled, and crawled until I reached the carpet above.  I laid down and looked at the ceiling.  I looked through the railing down to the floor and everything down there was completely normal.  I finally calmed down a bit and remembered that I had eaten acid and this was a result of the drugs I had consumed.
