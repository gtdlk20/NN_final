We went and sat by the pond.  Now is the MOST humorous part of the day.  We sat for a while and suddenly and old man comes walking up.  I assume he's going to tell us we are on private property and we'd better go.  But no he informs Entheogen who's feet are in the water that there are aligators in this pond.  Entheogen believes he's joking.  He says no, there really are aligators in there.  I tell her after he walks away that we should go.  We pick up and leave.  My assumption is still that he was trying to get rid of us, but I think he was trying to be polite about it.  Still, to two people at the end of the peak of their first acid trip this was quite strange and quite funny.
