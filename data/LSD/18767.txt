This time however I tell them I dont want anything from them you have nothing I want and I do not want to go somewhere with any of you. They were agitated and unsure what to do trying to approach me but I say no go away. Finally, I said you are not allowed to control me ever again. Another entity starts towards me NO, I said go away I dont want it. What happens next was something I will never forget.  The feeling was like nothing I had ever felt before it was so overwhelming.
