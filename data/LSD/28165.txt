As the sun began to rise we decided to climb the rocky cliff near the car.  The car!  It must have been 200 yards away  and twice as far below us but we could hear Tranceport as clear as ever.  I remember Bill and Marcus climbed up farther than Jamal and I, and watching thier silouhettes dancing against the brightening sky.  Rock climbing was dificult, and here we were conquoring the cliff, and proving it by DANCING on it!  We felt as if we had just climbed Everest and were on top of the world.  And the view from the top...  We were surrounded by miles of wilderness all around us and we could look down on it all and command it.  As supeior beings we watched the sun slowly rise and light the valleys below, feeling a bit like Zeus must have on top of Mount Olympus.  Unfortunately the drugs in our systems were waning, and Jamal and I started the long descent back to the car.  As we got to the bottom a park ranger's car was pulling up (oh no!  We were still too cracked out to string two words togeter in a fashon as to not scare a person not on this drug).  Talking to the ranger was fun as it turned out.  It felt like my mind was so expanded I could understand anything in an instant, while his was compressed and slow.  He was just checking to see if we were OK as it turned out, and gave off a good vibe.  Nonetheless, it was almost 8 am!! and we took it as a sign it was time to head home.
