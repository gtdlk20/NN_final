At a four-way intersection, the unthinkable happens. A man stops his car next to us and politely asks for directions. We stare blankly at him, our jaws hanging. The mans face is horribly disfigured. A few of us snicker. I try to take control of the situation and blurt out, Uh, Im sorry, Im not from around here. My voice sounds thin, awkward, and childlike. He waves in response, says Thanks anyway, and drives away. Well, most of him drives away. While his car and body speed forward down the road, his head reminds behind, suspended in midair, transparent and still dreadfully disproportionate. I blink, and then the head seems to realize it has been left behind and whizzes to catch up with its body.
