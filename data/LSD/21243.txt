Loud noises are irratating. Textures are different. Strange colours appear on peoples faces. The floor swirls like liquid, just like on Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I'm content to relax for hours. Woodgrains look amazing - they flow like waterfalls. Looking at people skin, my eyesight is enhanced to the degree that I can clearly see every individual hair follicle on people's skin.
