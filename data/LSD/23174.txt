I first moved into my college dorm room not knowing what to expect. I had transferred to a new school, with my girlfriend and another friend. The campus seemed, well dull and dry as could be. So all we had to keep ourselves entertained was the local liquor store that did not id. From the looks of most of the other students I wouldnÂ’t be finding anything to smoke until I returned home. I had no idea that a drug dealer lived only a few rooms down the hall!
