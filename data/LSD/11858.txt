In the woods, Douglas smoked, Arthur was chatting with him, and I sort of went off a little bit (not very far) into the woods to think.  I was really enjoying looking at trees and running my hand along the bark.  Suddenly I had my last great burst of thought.  I had a vivid and exciting vision of the Ancient Mediterranean and hoplites and sun-bleached walls of stone, and for whatever reason I burst out saying that Hannibal (the Carthaginian statesman) did not really lose to the Romans after all, because we still remember him and everything he did to this day.  My point was received with the polite appreciation of true stoners.
