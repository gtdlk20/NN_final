Before Thursday, I had done LSD 4 times. 2 tabs the first two times, and 1 tab the next couple of times. The tabs around my town are very potent, if you get them from the right places so all you really need is one. After those 4 times, our hook for acid didn't want to deal with it anymore so I couldn't get it. Recently, my friend found a hook for it in the college we go to who had the same type of tabs we were getting before. So I decided I wanted to buy about 20 hits and start selling most of them and figured I could take a couple trips out of it too.
