The hot wings finished cooking about 15 minutes later and we ate them.  I kind of needed something to settle my stomach because that first wave of acid influx had ocurred.  I'm not used to such a rapid onset, but I take it in stride.  It was when washing my hands after peeing again that I noticed the amide starting to take effect.  The sink seemed a distance away and my hands did not feel like they were on my body.
