Anyways, I thought that since I didnt have to work till the next day in the late afternoon I would try my acid. I did it alone. I took the acid after me and a few friends had quite a big session of weed smoking. One of my friends there gave me two pieces of advice since he had already tried acid. For one, he said to not look in the mirror because you will think you just look fucked and all cracked out. The second thing he told me was to experience nature. I took his advice to heart, took one of the blotters of acid I had, and proceeded to wait for it to hit me.
