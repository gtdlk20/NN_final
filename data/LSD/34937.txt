The first stage is the giggles. Everything seemed funny, and I notice the slight effect of my friend moving faster. While giggling hysterically I smushed my face in a pillow. When I looked up from the pillow... It happened. Just like that I was tripping balls. The high is hard to explain. But it is very intense. So intense that it may have even been a bigger part of the trip than the hallucinations. The best way to describe it is that I feel this disoriented, depressed, euphoric, overwhelming, dreamlike, meaty, and spiritually mysterious feeling. That doesn't really give it full justice. I can't really describe it.
