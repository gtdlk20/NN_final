For those who know hallucinogens, this was just the chaotic onset.  When I peaked my ability to think came back to me and all I could think was WHAT THE FUCK DID I GET MYSELF INTO?  Why would I pay to feel like this?  The irony of it all is that I had spent the last couple years trying to numb my thoughts.  Trying to render myself unable to think about the problems in my life. Hiding from them.  Now is the part of tripping my friends and I like to call living hardcore but of course this time it was much more intense than ever before.  The physical me sat crouched in between two cars looking as depressed and confused as one could possibly look. Mentally the metaphysical me, the metaphysical human mind, all of life, all possibilities.  I was remembering that I am everything, I am god, I make everything happen, and I am every single person.  time is no more.  My body is no more. What senses one choses to feel no longer limits one. One is no longer on earth. One are no longer ones self.  One is no longer anything.  And then One make the most terrifying realization.  More terrifying than death.  One are completely alone.  Entirely the only thing thats real.  Alone  Hahaha, its maddening.
