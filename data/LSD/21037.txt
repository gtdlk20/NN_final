The tabs disintegrated quite well on my tongue.  Never before had any of the paper LSD I had taken dissolved so perfectly; I could feel the acid going into my body.  Within minutes I could feel the stuff working on me.  I came up quick, and within twenty minutes on the dance floor, I was tripping hard.  Little did I know that my trip would intensify for the next three and a half hours.
