After jamming with Phish, I looked back over at the poster of Jim and I realized he was mad at me. He was REALLY mad at me. He was glaring at me and his nostrils flared. I was scared. I was extremely scared. Even my friend noticed how mad he got! All I could mutter was, Jim, dont give me that look I just wanted him to be happy again. I couldnt bare it anymore, so my friend and I hung out of the window again. I enjoyed it so much. The bursts of air, the clear night sky, it was all so intriguing.
