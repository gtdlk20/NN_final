So she went to bed and I (of course!) stayed up, watching movies, then playing Prince of Persia myself when I had come down enough to control a videogame, then watching another movie--'Kinsey'--as the sun came up. I'm not sure exactly when I stopped tripping; my best estimate is between 10 and 11 am, though for the whole day after that I was still feeling kind of spacy. As for how much of that was drug and how much was lack of sleep, your guess is as good as mine. I did get some very interesting visuals IN my head that night as I was finally drifing off, though, so I think the drug probably had some definite lingering effects.
