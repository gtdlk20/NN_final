Then we went to J's house, and talked to his parents and grandmother for a while. I was really feeling it by then. I felt detached and kind of unfocused or tranced out. We went outside and we were leaning against the above-ground pool. Water looks really awesome when you're tripping. I was leaning against J and we were entranced by the stars. The clouds appeared to be coming in closer and closer. J was trying to explain it to W and we waved his lit cigarette across the sky. J and I both saw it leave a bright trail and we were like, 'Whoa!!!' W just said, 'Okaaaay...' (He's been with me both times I tripped; he finds it hilarious to watch people on acid.) We went inside and were watching Outbreak  on one of the fifty billion movie channels. The sick people looked really disgusting.
