Dave feels that the lsd may be bringing out his grandmothers schizophrenia in him, but in reality, does it really matter? he may go crazy, but isnt there an entire human race to care about? but in that same mindset, isnt there all of life in its entirety to care about? but when we try to to to to to to 11:43 (off on another tangent, trying to elaborate to tad and dave, but they cant comprehend, what does it matter if they cant cpomprehend? there are always those that will, but for everyone that will, thre will be someone who wont. and maybe at one point, those that understand are in the larger percentage, it will always happen that at a later time those that dont will be in the larger percentage. it is all back an forth, wobbling, too and fro, teetering here and tilting there, and ALL FOR WHAT?
