The more time I invest in this, the louder the voice growls, This is worthless, youre wasting your day, this is meaningless, you should stop, this isnt getting you anywhere, give up and move on, this is worth nothing Its getting harder to fight off, harder to ignore. Im trying hard to grip onto framing into my mind, it doesnt matter, I need just to let it flow, what will happen will happen. I have to sit here until its done. I have to keep persevering.
