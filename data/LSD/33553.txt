The acid is getting stronger by the minute and I warmly accept it.  I am really completely fearless right now and willing to do anything.  We stamp our hands at the cedar point gate and walk along the sidewalk near the beach.  Suddenly I decide I want to be different from everyone else and jump the fence separating us from the sand.  I step back and with little warning run, jump, climb the fence, jump, and fall.  And fall.  Turns out there was a very big drop off from the sidewalk to the sand.  I collapse as soon as I hit the ground and roll onto my stomach. Luckily the sand doesn't hurt me and my friends follow.
