A few friends and myself had procured some acid from a friend of a friend. They were delivered to us by the friend with the notion that they were 'double dip' and would therefore cost more (around £4.50 rather than £3), however I was told that they would not be double the strength but still stronger than a single dose. As it turned out I have had 3 1/2 blotters and not tripped out to this degree.
