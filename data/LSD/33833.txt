I then started to look at some of the art my friend had done on this comic book project we were collaborating on and it looked amazing in my heightened state and I started wondering why the fuck we aren't rich bastards yet so I decided to page him to urge him to get to work, but his pager number had changed and I kept getting the wrong number. I called his house and his dad told me he'd moved out (he just got a new apartment) but he didn't have his new phone number yet, he did, however, give me a new pager number....but I wrote it down wrong!!! I just kept getting wrong number tones. It was imperative that I talked to my friend at this point. I took it as a bad omen that I couldn't page him or talk to him.
