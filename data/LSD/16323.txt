I highly recommend a bright, busy, neon-lit convenience store at 1:45 am to anyone who is tripping for not-the-first-time and who is with a responsible babysitter. I had to be careful and not make remarks on what I was seeing for anyone to hear--no one likes it when people on drugs cause scenes in public. On the way in, I told K, 'As your attorney, I advise you not to let me say a fucking word in here.' Then we giggled about that for a while, but I'm pretty sure that's as druggy as either of us acted. I say 'either of us' because, in my experience, people 'babysitting' people on drugs often act far shadier than the person who's ON drugs. Not so in K's case. It was AMAZING inside--the colors were insanely bright, the neon looked beautiful, the floor was crawling and alive. The touch-screen were K ordered her sub was probably the most fascinating thing I've ever encountered on a trip. The screen was moving; the words were wavy, crazy and all-over-the-place. I was seeing different fonts. I was seeing pictures in place of words. I was seeing the LCD screen in 3-D.
