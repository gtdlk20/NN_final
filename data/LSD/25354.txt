After a few hours my buddy got tired of me and kicked me out.  So I called up my dad and he came and picked me up.  The ride home was hell: my father was casually talking to me as I was seeing the street lights growing bigger and bigger.  Everything was kinda yellowish and the light poles were deformed.  I also had the feeling that the car was going very slowly but it as rolling at a normal pace.
