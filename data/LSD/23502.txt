Now, I really dont remember how what happened next initially developed, but I suppose it spawned out of a conversation I wasnt paying attention to. I was extremely concentrated in identifying how I felt, and settling down the weirdness. I think I spent a significant amount of time staring at Frey and Louise, who were also playing a drawing game (they were attempting to construct a character, by each drawing a head, torso, and legs in turn, and then comparing the result). I was really trying to spot the little things that made me think of them as a couple: sneaky kisses, graceful grazes, and just overall looks. I found it fascinating.
