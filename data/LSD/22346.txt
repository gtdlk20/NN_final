We smoked out of my bong and finished about two packs of it when I could tell my boyfriend was feeling something. He had the goofiest smile on his face and looked stoned beyond belief. I started to consider to take my other half so I wouldn't miss out on whatever he was experiencing and waste my tab by only taking half. I put in my other half and accidentally bit down on it, which triggered a terrible taste in my mouth. I tried to drink water partially because of cotton mouth and partially to wash out the taste and like my boyfriend warned, it only intensified the putrid taste. I sat down at my table and began to swivel back and forth in my chair and my boyfriend A and my friend C begin to look somehow 3D as I do this. I tell them and my friend C asks, 'Wait, how many dimensions are we in again?' I begin to laugh and do a cheer my physics teacher taught to remember our four dimensions. I think I'm beginning to come up.
