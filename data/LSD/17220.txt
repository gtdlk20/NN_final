This day was very different though than before.  Previously we had always ended up dosing at night.  We planned it out for this particular weekend to dose as early as possible so we could experience our trip during the day and go for a hike.  I had gotten out of work early and woken my friends so we could meet up.  I called C and E and told them that I was out of work.  E picked me up from my house and we went and picked up C, B, and J.  We picked C up at her house and B and J were at the Wal*mart down the road from us.  When we picked up B and J we dosed ourselves.  E took 3 hits, C took 3, B took 3, and J took 2 strong sugar cubes.  I took 4 of the same kind that everyone else had taken after me and E had a quick rock, paper, scissors match to decide who was to get it.  As we drove away from the Wal*mart we headed back up to CÂ’s house so we could get our things together for the hike.  We arrived at her house in a matter of 10 to 15 minutes.  We proceeded up to her room to grab some batteries for the stereo we wanted to bring along with us.  After we got the batteries we started our walk.
