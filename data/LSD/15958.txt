We eventually got away and back to the house. The atmosphere had been destroyed. It had put a real downer on a fine evening. Upon re-entering the house we all seemed to go into auto-pilot. Without saying a word we all managed to get back to where we were before we left on that little mission. It was fantastic. What made this even better was the fact that in our absence the lava lamp had heated up and was now flowing rather nicely. With all the lights off this made a nice centre piece.
