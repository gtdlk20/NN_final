I logged onto my computer and checked out some stuff online and got uninterested fast.  I noticed C was online and decided to start talking to her a bit.  We talked about our experience and how we were feeling at the moment for a little bit.  But soon I decided to start to watch a movie to help calm my brain and get it off the thoughts of this trip.  I figured if I got some type of outside distraction from my trip it would kind of phase out of my head.  I only watched the movie for an hour before my mother had come home from work.  My parents started getting into a fight that got loud after a while.  This really started to freak me out.  I started thinking that my parents were going to get divorced and they were going to move away and IÂ’d have to leave all my friends behind.  So I decided to head downstairs to get them to shut up.  And they did.  Apparently my presence being there while they were fighting was enough for them to stop and just go to sleep.
