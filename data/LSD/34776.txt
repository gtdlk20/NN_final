It can be negative in a negative environment.LSD is a tool for evolution, and can be used effectively as such. Planning a session, taking the time to do it right is important. We were in a crowded room, we couldnt be loud , we were in an apt.The first time I tripped on this cid it was only the three of us and we were comfortable there. With seven people in a small room , not enough things to occupy us.Ive tripped hard as hell at parties where I almost lost it because of unfamiliar faces and uncomfortable surroundings.Bad tripps are not the effect of the drug, but the effect of the surroundings.
