I went back outside to the couch where there were about 5 people all smoking. I saw them all as giant frogs, disgusting and horrid, who wanted nothing more then to please themselves. I was disgusted by the obvious egotism I could literally see coming off of them. My friend, C, looked at me and said 'Man you don't look so good, do you want to go back to your room?' At this point I could barely answer. My entire mental state was so incredible, but so hard to describe. I saw that at every moment I am the only thing keeping myself from happiness. Every emotion I felt was a direct cause of doing or not doing something, and I could see these paths these decisions would take me on. Every decision I saw as a string of energy coming from my heart and connecting to a point where my next decision would be made. The responsibilty I suddenly felt terrified me greatly and I realized what a child I was.
