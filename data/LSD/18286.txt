The whole night my Russian friend kept getting in arguments with his mother and he would look so angry and start turning red. All of his emotions looked exaggerated and my other friend after the trip told me the next day about how he seemed so just overly angry that night and he said he felt like our Russian friend was going to literally explode or something because he was so mad and annoyed with his mom and turning red and shit. Almost shaking too. Russian friend kept explaining how her moody bipolarism and constant bitching is the reason he tokes so much weed. I really started to understand their situation more clearly through all of this intuitive based tripping and watching. He explained how she was just fucking off the wall and she would cause a scene just randomly in the middle of the night to yell at him about socks or something.
