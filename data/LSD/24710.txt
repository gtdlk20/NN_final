It's now 20+ years later, and my friends and I will all still swear this is a true story.  I told it a while back to a shaman who simply said, 'It was a spirit sent to warn you about fooling around with LSD.'  I also learned, years later, that in those days, one of our group, John, had been taking 4 hits of acid for every single hit the rest of us took.   I think I did 2 hits that day, so John may have done 6-8 hits.  John kept his habits extreme, and a few years later he REALLY totally fucked up his life with cocaine, so maybe he was the intended audience.  I don't have a reason for the story, it just happened.
