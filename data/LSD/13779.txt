Background: when I was 17, I hitched hiked around Australia and stayed at the infamous Hippie House in Darwin (top of Australia) which was the last outpost of the famous Hippie Trail and it became a temporary home to hundreds of freaks and heads from every part of the world.  Prior to this trip, I had only smoked a bit of cannabis. I will use the language of the time, as we spoke it.
