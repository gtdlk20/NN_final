Fire pumps have suddenly appeared and people are yelling at them to stop their seemingly hopeless attempts of stopping the fire. From our raised platform we could se how the spouts from the engines could hardly even reach the base of the statue and it was quite the spectacle to watch the crowd getting wild down below. Eventually the hard work of the fire crew paid off and it was time to bike home to the nutty dome . It seemed like we where biking for a long time through streets thick with brown  RVs covered with lunar dust and ash. Finally we arrive at our tent by the dome and just feel like sitting down for a while.
