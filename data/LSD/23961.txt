This happened in 2015 on a beautiful day in November (it's 2018 now). I live in a place far up north, so there was plenty of snow. Prior to this I had tripped on LSD once, taken MDMA once and I smoked weed regularly. The one LSD trip I had under my belt had been really frightening and I thought I was going to die, so I was nervous as fuck when the day of my second trip finally arrived. The guy I was going to trip with was a friend that I became friends with at the school we were attending, a school where you sleep, eat food and play music all day for a year. We were both 19 at the time. My friend, who we are going to call V, had tripped on acid twice before and had the best time of his life both times.
