Now bare with me this is where things get confusing. When we were playing the game I asked to play and in my dream world I thought I was doing good but my boyfriend kept saying I was gonna die which was confusing.. This was my first glimpse of reality when I was in my dream world. I feel like if someone would had told me to snap out of it right then and there I might have been okay because that was the last moment of the real world that I had before it got all distorted by my dream world. The next glimpse I remember was us walking down the stairs and me falling all the way down. The pain kind of brought me back to what was going on in reality but my mind was still morphing it into some dream of mine.
