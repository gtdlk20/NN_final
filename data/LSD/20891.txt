Going upstairs was like going to another world, and we all agreed on this. Things were so different upstairs because the whole scene had changed. Different people, and different music. It wasnt bad, but it wasnt as good as being downstairs. All four of us sat on a bed huddled toghether and just started to crack up for no reason. The laughing fit seemed to last forever until the girl who lived there gave us a HUGE sticker book with all kinds of sticker like fuzzy ones, glitter, squishy, big, small, and very colorful. The stickers are just what we needed at that point in the trip. They were amazing and the color was just popping out of the pages of the book. Every kind of image was in that book on a sticker. I started to worry about my Gnome,Bill. So Meg and i took the journey down the stairs into the place we started our trip. It seemed like we were only upstairs for like half an hour but it was actually close to an hour and a half. So we were reaching the end of our peak and we all knew it.
