Oh, and the other guy on acid who I'd left in the pub? Apparently, he had a great time in there. He's well known as a complete loony around our town and his odd behaviour didn't raise any eyebrows!!! Not even when he got down on all fours and rubbed his head on the floorboards because he 'wanted to comb his hair'... :/ ;)
