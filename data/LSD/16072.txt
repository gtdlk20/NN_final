My eyes too were connected to memories. Many times I looked in the mirror and when I did I felt the most intense love for a stuffed animal I had not played with for years. At this point I was completely gone, when there was no light I hallucinated that everyone I had seen that day was in my room looking at me and studying me. I was sweating a lot at this point and my gut was making A lot of noise. I felt so sick and just wanted this overly intense trip to be over. At this point I opened my window and puked onto someone elses open window. The room was spinning, and I kept having a vision of my consciencess being a glowing ball of white static light. It made noise that was too intense for my ears and terrified my with its power. another hour of indescribable visions and insights and my trip began to come down.
