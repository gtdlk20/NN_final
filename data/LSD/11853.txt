Eventually, my friend Douglas who had just finished moving back onto campus came over to see how we were doing.  We sat down with him at a picnic table just outside the room to my building.  I remember he told me how large my pupils looked at the time.  It was around dinner time so the three of us headed off to the dining hall which was just across the street from my building.
