When I woke up on Saturday I was expecting a fairly boring day. Tom had slept on my floor and at 11:30am when I finally woke up and kicked him awake, we set out for coffee. Over coffee and cigarettes we decided that we wouldn't do the acid, we'd save it for later when we'd appreciate it more. He had tripped with me last Friday (not Sunday tho, that was all by myself) and thought it better to wait. Besides, we had plans to go see a few bands in downtown Boston that day at 9pm and we could easily kill 8 hours with grass.
