I first took the hit in front of the mirror. I went out of the bathroom and held it under my tongue for about 30 minutes then swallowed. I started looking up at the ceiling and saw bugs gathering around the ceiling fan. The patterns on the ceiling looked really intricate like a top-notch old western painting. I knew it was just the Christmas lights reflecting off of the tree. I took LSD for my first and last time that day. It was Christmas break and everybody else took more hits than me so it was like they were in a different world. I wanted to be alone so I went out to my car and when everybody else got in I thought they were trying to set me up. I knew that they were my friends but I just wanted to trip by myself, as I though that was the best way to trip so that I didn't have any distractions.
