T+30mins: already starting to trip quite nicely. Decide to say goodbye to the security job (I only had to work as long as I wanted to) and wander the party lookin for fun. My 2 buddies (also tripping on some of the same paper I had before and Lego's liquid) and I move around from place to place, plotting between us who we want to run up to and strobe our microlights at and dance for. Give several lightshows, head to VIP room for some refreshments.
