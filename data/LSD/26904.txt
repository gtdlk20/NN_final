When we arrived, I was greeted by friends and we decided to wait until the next evening to take the acid.  By the next night we were ready.  We had two sugar cubes and two gel tabs. (One of the gel tabs, however, was cut abnormally large.) My friend was an acid virgin and decided to take only one of the sugar cubes - this left one sugar cube and the two gel tabs for me.  I had taken acid several times before and wasn't going to complain.  I was reading Tom Wolfe's 'The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test' at the time, so I figured it would be historically clever to dissolve the sugar cubes in cherry Kool-Aid.  I remember searching the foreign kitchen for 'the appropriate glasses' from which to drink the electric Kool-Aid.  As I opened the cupboard doors, an image struck me like an ethereal sign from the drug god: two sparkling martini glasses!
