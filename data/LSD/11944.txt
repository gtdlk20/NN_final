This is when my trip took a bad turn, around 12:30.  My dad was still awake, watching the olympics (in Sydney, where it was just morning).  I realized that I wouldn't be able to talk to him or explain why I was awake in my state, so I turned off the blacklight (the only light) and the stereo.  I became very tense and remained so until around 4:00 when I fell asleep.  I couldn't keep from clenching my fists and grinding my teeth, often biting my cheeks as hard as I could to prevent the feeling of teeth scraping against teeth.  I wandered the hallway after my Dad went to bed.  Everything was still melting, only now the colors weren't emphasized as they had been; hard lines solidified and the colors around them turned dull.  I attempted to listen to music to mellow me out, but everything I tried to listen to sounded harsh and grating, from reggae to Jimi Hendrix's blues to hardcore to comedy.  By 2:00 or so I just wanted it to be over.  I kept checking the time, as if searching for some anchor to reality.  I found myself become more and more paranoid that I had somehow permanently damaged myself, and often repeated my name, birth date, etc., to myself to prove to myself that my mind hadn't been destroyed.  Finally, I fell asleep around 4:00.
