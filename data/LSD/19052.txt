S and I continue to try and get A to come with us so we can get out of the woods but he is still too far gone to comprehend what we are trying to do. We decide to leave him where he is because we are really close to the exit. S and I leave the woods and are sitting at a gazebo in a park that is right outside the exit so we can wait for A and relax a little bit. After about 10 minutes we see someone run out of the woods (not the trail exit mind you) and fall down a hill. They stand up and go S! M! Is that you guys? A had finally sobered up a little bit (or so we had thought) and found his way out of the woods. He runs up to us and sits in the gazebo. A little ways away there are two people sitting on a swing set swinging. A looks at his phone, then looks at us and says does this even make noise? S and I look at him with confusion and then A throws his phone which lands near the people swinging. S says dude go get your phone, you're going to regret it later if you don't. A walks up to get his phone then looks at the people on the swing set and says Hey, did you guys say something? They had not and it was then that S and I realized that A was still pretty far gone. I go A come back they aren't talking to you. The people swinging must of thought that we were all insane.
