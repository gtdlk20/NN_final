Over the course of 2 months I ingested various amounts of LSD. Let me also add that my supplier was the chemist so there was no decrease in quality of product. The first dose I took was one hit. The trip was common and comfortable and lasted nearly eight hours. For the next three days I loaded my body with vitamin suppliments and ate very well to prepare myself for the next series of doses. My next dose consisted of one hit plus one hit+1hr. I noticed an increase in overall intoxication and visual patterns. The duration was around eight to nine hours. Again for the next three days I re-nourished myself and to save repetition of facts just know that after each dose for three days I reloaded my body with vitamins and minerals. My next dose was two hits at the same time. I noticed instantly that my trip came on a lot harder, was more intense and lasted a lot longer, almost 12 hours at this point. My next dose was two hits at the same time followed by one more one hour after noticable effects were reached. I noticed each time that the initial dose seemed to determine the intensity from the get-go and the secondary dose seemed to help continue the intensity. For two weeks I did no drugs and ate very well. I decided that this break would help in any tolerance and would also be benificial to my body considering what I had in store for my next round. I needed to do a larger dose to determine how much was being wasted since lets face it three hits isn't exactly a waste.
