Suddenly it's lunch (11:30am). And I just want to microwave my mathbook to eat and some doofus can't understand that simple fact and is opening the book and explaining to me that the book is inedible. The words and pictures are slowly meandering about the page so I walk off still transfixed by the mathbook.
