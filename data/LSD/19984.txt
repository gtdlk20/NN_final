My friend Kevin and I were getting ready to go to a Cavs basketball game with my dad, and he had a couple hits in his pocket, and suggested I try one. This was in the days before pyramids and geltabs, microdots and every other kind of acid technology would later come up with. Those forms were supposed to be 'cleaner' but never seemed to pack the punch that I got from paper. Good ol' fashioned white blotters. Best 5 bucks you'd ever spend. And to think, all these kids are going crazy today over X, spending as much as $30 a hit to get one tenth the buzz.
