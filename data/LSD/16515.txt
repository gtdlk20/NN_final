It passed over head with the sound of a thousand locomotives, and disappeared into the distance... At that moment, I knew that I had witnessed the end of the world.  I turned an ashen white, at that moment, a car pulled up, it was my brother and his girlfriend.  My Ma had sent them to come get me.  I left the party that night, a changed person.  I started going to church, something that since I've stopped as the church centered a lot around giving to get, and I didn't feel that was right, so now I just pray, and look to God to find the answers.
