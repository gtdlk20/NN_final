T+9 hours: We were still seeing visuals but my dad came and picked us up and brought my girlfriend home. When I came home I ate food (which was kinda icky) and talked to my girlfriend on the phone till 3 am - visuals were still here, I have some trippy shit in my room, lava lamps, electricity balls, etc. And they were making butterflys all over my ceiling.
