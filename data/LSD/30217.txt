Just recently I had an experience that I will never forget in my entire life. A couple friends and I decided to take LSD on new years night, my friends will be labeled as friend A,B,C. We had all been very excited through out the day to take our sugar cubes with two hits of liquid LSD in them. We had been jamming all day at friend B's house and we were going to spend the night at A's house.
