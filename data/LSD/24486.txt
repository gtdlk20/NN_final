This trip happened at a huge music festival. This was my first time that I tripped really hard and it was overall a very positive experience. My and one of my friends took 2.5 hits at about 1 PM. We sat around and talked for about a half hour, and when we both started to feel some initial effects come on we started walking to the festival area. We decided to split up from the rest of our friends that were with us so we could be free to go off and adventure without being tied down to a big group.
