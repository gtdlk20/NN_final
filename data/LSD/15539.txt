At about 2pm two friends came round to see me, this turned out to be very fortunate as one of them had used LSD before and had experienced all this. She was able to reassure me that it would wear off eventually and just to relax. While her boyfriend kept me entertained (and conscious) with stupid comments, as he likes to do. The three of us sat in my room watching TV and IÂ’d have snippets of conversation with them in my more sober moments. This was great as I had people to re assure me and some company, I began to feel better again. Despite this I was still tripping incredibly and my room was still bending and bowing uncontrollably, which I still found it fairly disconcerting as my mum was going to be home within the hour.
