An hour after that, 3 hours ish into the trip by 9:30  10 am, I was tripping really really hard.  I was unable to distinguish between reality and what was going on inside my mind.  By the time I thought to say something, my mind was already slipping into something else.  There was no difference between me closing and opening my eyes, because either way I still had a clear as a picture image of what I had just seen in my mind.  The entire world became a tracer, so every time I saw something I would see that image move along my entire scope of vision.  I didnt eat anything, and barely drank any water the entire time.  I also lost all sense of hearing, vision, etc. I felt that everything was captured in a picture and then when I saw something else, that scene would slowly drift into the next.  When I looked up at the sky, the sky had just become another part of this scene driftng.
