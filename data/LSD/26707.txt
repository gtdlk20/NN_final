We got to his house and he came out with a few blotter tabs.  Keep in mind I was still hammered at this point.  He then proceeded to give the hits out to each of us.  'Here's your hit, here's yours...'  I took mine and could taste the bitterness of the LSD on my paper.  This was usual but I had never tasted it this strong.  I asked him if he knew if it was dropped or dipped or what.  He said it was soaked in LSD and pretty fresh from the chemist.  I got excited and then realized it was 2:30 am.  I was like man I'm tired because I was still very drunk.  So I got dropped off at my house and fell asleep.
