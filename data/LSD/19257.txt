I returned to my room where C and A were. I was beginning to come down and my boyfriend A informed me he had mostly come down to. I could focus on something and the visuals would return if I gave it a minute, but the physical feelings were completely gone. All I was left with was happiness. I think the trip had mostly resided by midnight. I was in a genuinely good mood, probably from laughing and smiling so much. My friend C was on a whole different high and was irritating me immensely and sleeping in my room that night. I didn't want my boyfriend to leave, but he did and I forced myself to sleep. The next day I felt exhausted in my body and my jaw ached from grinding my teeth.
