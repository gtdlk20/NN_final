The process of rolling up a nice spliff had started again but it was not easy as concentration levels were very low. I remember how we would have conversations about rolling up then someone would eventually decide to take it upon themselves to complete this task. However, it would not take long for them to get side tracked and we'd end up talking about it again. This went on for some time, I was sure we were stuck in some kind of a loop.
