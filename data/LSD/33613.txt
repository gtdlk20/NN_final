We exit the ride and begin wandering around the park again.  At this point Spencer has called me multiple times but I stopped using my phone because I thought I would break it so it stays in my pocket.  The first thing I remember coming to as we left the corkscrew was a railroad with the gates down.  On both sides of the railroad tracks are huge packs of people, each wanting to go in the other direction.  As soon as the gates go up everyone pushes forward, me and C follow not wanting to stand out.  Everyone looks very sorry and hurried as we push through the bodies.  I see a woman pushing a stroller through the massive pack of people who looks very scared.  I feel sorry for her and want to stop pushing and just let everyone pass through me, but I know I will cause a scene if I do anything and just continue shoving.  This also pushed my trip in the wrong direction, making me feel like a terrible person, and making me hate Cedar Point even more.
