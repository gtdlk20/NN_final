But those times are not what this report is meant for. In between when I first tried acid and now I have had several psychedelic experiences and I would safely say that I have grown accustomed to them. Last time I tried it, was by far my favourite. I loved it so much that I wanted to have it written down while it's still fresh in my head and then go through it as many time as I liked.
