As all this was going on it came to be about 4:30 in the morning, and having finished off a pack of cigarettes in an effort to satisfy an oral fixation and alleviate my unconscious tendency to clench my jaw, I decided to go for a walk to find another pack. I reached the nearest gas station at about 5, but they weren't open yet, so decided to try the nearby Safeway. They didn't open until 6 am, so I wandered around the complex, appreciating the fading visuals and being moved by the sight of the rising sun and the sounds of The Books.
