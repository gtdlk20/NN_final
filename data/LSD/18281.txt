I dont remember when exactly this was but at some point were at the dining room smoking weed and my other tripping friend is super interested in the weed and by how dank it was. I dont even remember whos weed it was. My attitude and the way I looked at weed was definitely different at the time, it was really weird looking at weed but it wasnt like I was really digging it necessarily. I was just uninterested in weed at the time whereas my other friend couldnt get enough of it. I remember me and my tripping friend kept having to piss and kept having to go to the bathroom the whole night. I remember going the first or second time and afterwards I looked in the mirror. My tweaker friend told me in the future after this experience that looking at yourself in the mirror while on acid is the fucking trip of your life.
