We were walking along with a set of bamboo Unklungs, which is an Indonesian instrument.  It consists of a hanger, with eight separate and removable instruments, each a different note on the scale.  Each of the eight handheld pieces is basically a frame with two bamboo cylinders that vibrate and make a noise when shaken.  There is a Primus song that uses these instruments (I think - it sure as hell sounds like it, but I've never checked the liner notes to know for sure) and it's track 8 on Pork Soda, if you want to know what they sound like, regardless of whether that's what they use or not.  We found a vendor with several glass pieces, and we worked out a trade for a foot-and-a-half bong.  The bong was the nicest piece the vendor had, and it would have sold for more than a hundred dollars at a head shop.  At the barter faire, it would have cost $50 to $70. The bong was predominantly blue, marbled through with green and orange and white.  It's absolutely beautiful, and thicker than any other bong I've seen.  It's still intact after being battered countless times, a year later.
