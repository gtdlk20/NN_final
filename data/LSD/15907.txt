After that, I went to my car and started driving back home. It was getting to intense though. I thought all these people were honking at me and I felt like everyone was against me. All the cars seemed evil and I was getting overwhelmed. I wasn't straight to drive so I pulled over on a street to just chill for a while. I was by myself and very afraid. Everything around me was staring at me and torturing me. The trees all looked disappointed at me and like they were going to kill me. I'd been seeing crazy visions all night of evil thoughts every time I'd get lost in another pattern of thoughts. I didn't feel right and called my friend 'M' and told him that I really need a friend to help me through what I'm going through. I was stranded on acid and needed someone. Thankfully, he came and picked me up and took me to Denny's. This is when the peak ended. I started coming down but still felt like I was in acid land, and was loving it. Hallucinating like crazy, and everything felt so much more real. I could see what I was tasting and smell what I was seeing.
