We immediately went back to my girlfriends place, making sure that the new friend did not fall or pass out. As we were walking me and the experienced guy started talking about some super weird shit, and now there is s video of me walking down the street sayin 'wub wub, wub wub wub' as a sentence and then getting a response of wubs from my friend back. At one point I said 'one wub unto the many' and we thought it was the deepest shit ever. Anyway eventually we got back to the room and chilled there. My new friend curled up in a ball in a chair and started talking about how much he misses his girlfriend, so we gave him a stuffed animal and named it his girlfriends name, which calmed him down a bit.
