We crossed it up and went inside where many of my housemates were sober and watching a movie. I went upstairs to fill up my water bottle, and then went into my room to collect myself and rest for the journey ahead. I sat down in my chair, put on some Sound Tribe Sector 9, and closed my eyes. Soon afterwards I felt another presence enter the room, and I watched our energies intertwine. I opened my eyes and said 'Wow'... T was sitting right in front of me. I hadn't heard him come in but somehow I could feel his energy there. I told him what happened and he seemed to understand. Soon enough everyone had come up to my room, and we were chilling up there listening to music for a while until we remembered that we had intended to go down to the boat house. I grabbed a Butterfinger, opened it, and stared at the shimmery butter-brittle after breaking off a piece for T. It took me about 10 minutes to take the first bite, meanwhile we had all forgotten our intentions to go down to the boathouse again. There was so much involved in the experience of taking a bite of a Butterfinger that it was pretty intense, and not something to be taken lightly.
