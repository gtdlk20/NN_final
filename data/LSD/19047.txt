We arrive at a small cliff (cliff really isn't the right word because it was only like 20-25 feet tall but it was a steep drop off) and we decide to sit next to it and chill for a little. At this time I'm starting to come up super fast. I keep getting this feeling that I was supposed to be doing something but I couldn't remember what it was. I look over at S and he is so relaxed and taking in all the sights nature had to offer which helped me ground myself and calm down a little. Then I would look at my friend A who was beginning to lose his goddamned mind. He stood up and went, how am I even alive right now??? for some reason I found this hilarious and responded I'm not sure but you've been doing it for 19 years so you're doing something right. A got up and started pacing around and said he was full of energy and just wanted to run. S and I told him that it probably was not a good idea and to try and relax a little.
