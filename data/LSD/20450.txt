I hitched a ride with two people I did not know, and I spent the ride mostly watching the interior lights of the car. When we arrived, I had not realized how many people who I had never seen before would be there. They all seemed friendly enough and after sitting at the kitchen table for a while I went into the basement to have a look at the musical equipment that was down there. A complicated system with a large stereo being monitored, sampled and equalized by a computer. I sat for quite a while in a chair tuned into the music. It was almost hypnotic, I can not describe it and I wonder if I would recognize it if I ever heard it again. I can not remember a single thought from this period that was not related to what was going on around me. I kept reaching for my pack of cigarettes but didn't manage to make it all the way to smoking one for quite a while. I was sitting there simply blown away. After a while people started to go upstairs and I chose to go with rather than sitting in the dark basement in a house owned by people I didn't know.
