All of the trip sitters had long since fallen asleep. For at least an hour, I kept moving. First, I tore down all of the shiny things we had set up, because I didn't ever want to see them again. I turned off the music we had been playing all night, cleaned the shower, and turned all of the lights off. There was a dim natural light throughout the entire house, so turning the lights off made things a lot more serene in the house.
