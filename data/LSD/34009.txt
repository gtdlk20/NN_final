9am, I'm home.  Wonder if I can sleep.  Amazingly enough, by 10am, I do.  I can't sleep on most any other psychedelic material I've imagined.  I wake up about 3pm, and seem not to want to sleep more, but I think I'm down now.  Some visual focus issues persist, and continue an hour later as I am now writing this, perhaps my eyes are still a bit dilated.
