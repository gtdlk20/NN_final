Also in the dining hall I experience some not-insignificant paranoia.  There was a person sitting at a table on the other side of the room and a few rows back from where I was, who I thought was watching me.  I was afraid that he was going to beat me up.  There was no reason at all for thinking this, except that he was a little intimidating physically, but I kept thinking that we were making eye-contact and that he was staring at me angrily.  Nothing ever came of this and we left the dining hall after I gave up on finishing my food.
