I honestly cant remember everyone else leaving but at some point I realised I (whatever I was) was alone. Apparently when the others left I told them I would stay for a while but I have no recollection of that which scares me a bit. I dont think they realised how distorted my reality was at this point.

I was not thinking in a normal conscious sense, I was far beyond any cognition of the normal world which included my mind. Looping concepts ran through my head, not in chronological time but rather in the form of pure thought. Ideas and loops like:
