I took 2 tabs, and we started walking to our tripping destination.  We really chose an awesome place to trip, a location that was secluded and had lots of space / nature / foliage to sit around and talk, and this location also had a beautiful view as well.  I noticed that I was starting to lose motor function and couldnÂ’t really walk up the hill very well, a 10 ft. incline seemed to me to be almost 50 ft. This is when I realized that I was starting to trip, and that this trip would definitely be a lot more intense than the first time I had taken it.
