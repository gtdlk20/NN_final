Finally after awhile we got bored and decided to go outside. I was still having a little bit of visual but not much. We decided to throw rocks at this sign about 50 feet away and we all tried a few times, they hit it but I didnt. We went back into Barry's house and Barry fixed Romain Noodles for us. It had been a long time since I ate them. It felt weird eating them, they felt so slimy. After we ate we went into Barry's room, we rolled a joint to smoke in the morning. About this time it was morning, it was about 7 so we all decided to get some rest. We all 3 slept for about 3 or 4 hours, when we woke up we just sat there and talked about how we felt about the trip for awhile. I didnt have any visuals or anything and the head trip was still there alittle bit so I felt really good. When Barry was giving me a ride home we smoked that joint and the body buzz of the acid hit me all over again. When I got home my mom just thought I was fucked up on dope, she had no idea that it was acid, and that is my most memorable experience on lsd.
