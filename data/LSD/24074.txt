T + 0: Having obtained some 'pink pyramids' which turned out to be good blotters, I ingest my first along with my girlfriend and roommate. This is my girlfriend's (called A for the sake of this story) first trip. My roommate (call him N) has tripped twice before, both with me after hearing about some of my experiences with psychedelics. So, I end up being the 'wise old man' when it comes to drug/psychology questions. This role is partially flattering and partially uncomfortable.
