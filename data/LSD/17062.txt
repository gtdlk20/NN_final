It wasnt until about 20 minutes in did I notice some changes. My face turned flushed and red, I started feeling really hot. Soon after, the first initial impact hit me like a ton of bricks. Immediately I started to become a bit hysterical. This wasnt I expected at all,'' was probably what I was thinking. My extremities began to turn numb and tingly, like I had just slept on them for a few hours after a nap. I tore off my shirt and guzzled down all the water I could. It took a little bit longer for him to get there, but E started sharing similar experiences. Every wave of tingling energy made me feel like I was right on the edge of losing consciousness. In fact, it was the same feeling I felt right before passing out and having a seizure in the ER---only extended indefinitely. I tried turning on a more calming song, but its normally gorgeous and soothing harmonies turned sour and awful. I was emotionally distressed by this and started to grow more hysterical.
