The peak began to fade into the plateau, wherein I returned to physicality. It became apparent upon returning to my body that I was rythmically twisting and convulsing in what I can only describe as a 3D manifestation of higher spatial dimensional manipulation. My contortions felt like I was being moved in ways that were physically impossible, but that the movements themselves were only a shadow of that dimension. I also did not feel like I was in control of my movements; I was being puppeteered by some external force. Eventually, I regained control of my body, and returned to the normal habits of an lsd trip. I put on a funkadelic album and zoned out to the sounds, while also deeply shaken by the totality of my experience. The remaining hours of the trip passed as they usually do, and I went to work at 10 pm without issue.
