As Ive mentioned, Im very sensitive about my hair. Not only was I rocking my wavy locks, but I noticed the raindrops were soaking me - and I didnt care. Their delicate texture reminded me of the threads of light, and as my phone screen got wet too, I saw the drops becoming rainbow- colored on the screen, a totally regular, everyday thing. Yet, to me, it became something more. A flashback to my unforgettable experience: it made me want to cry; it reminded me of happiness, and belonging within the universe as a part of the human population.
