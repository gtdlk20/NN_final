I went to sleep about 8 hours after I had dosed due to sheer exhaustion. Waking up later that night though I felt the most intense feeling of peace and contentment. Everything was going to work out, it felt as if I had been through physical therapy and could finally walk again. The next day the after-effects were still with me, my touch especially felt very soft and insulated in a pleasent way. While this was a very intense and memorable experience I do not suggest 4 hits of liquid unless you have tried it first.
