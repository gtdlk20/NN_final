then i took these gloves i have for raving that have glowing LED lights for fingertips and i went into my bathroom with a discman playing 'trance stimuli' and i just left my body.  i went through the entire album dancing in my bathroom thinking these explosive thoughts and discovering new life in an album i heard so many times.  and my gloves...my gloves blew my mind.  when the last track finished i was dripping with sweat down my entire body, but i wasn't tired.
