At this point in the trip I experienced a level of awkwardness difficult to even describe. I couldnÂ’t keep eye contact with anyone because I felt they were reading my thoughts. When I glanced up at my friends buddy he appeared to have four eyes and an elongating stretching chin. A little freaked out but nothing to worry about, just a side effect of the drug. However, throughout the entire trip I was laughing and giggling on and off.
