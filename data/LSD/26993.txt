We retired to the lounge room for a beer and a smoke. I was feeling wonderful as we sat chatting about state of the world. We seemed to be in some mutal blissed 'love's the answer, love's the question' headspace. M talked his brother's suicide, and showed emotions I had never seen in him before. While this conversion was going on I noticed distortions in his face, I had seen these before when we had tripped on previous occasions and I always looked away as I thought it was some sort of sickness. But this time I concentrated on his face as his nose and chin grew into a gargoyle-like mask.
