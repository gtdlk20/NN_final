Another visual was when we were inside.  I sat at the top of the stair looking down at the brown carpet.  The whole carpet looked like a pool of quicksand.  It looked like they, my friends, were sinking into the carpet.  And in the kitchen it looked like the floor was a grate with some goo spilling up through the cracks.  Every slight crack in the wall would look like a huge hole and would pulsate bigger than smaller.  I could also see sound in a way.  The walls would move to the beat of the music, like huge drums.
