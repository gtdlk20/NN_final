I gather all my strength and run out to the main room where my friend and trip sitter were. They were playing 'I had a friend who hung himself' by Primus, and I start yelling 'no one is going to hang themselves in my house! turn that stuff off!!! My sitter immediately turned off the music and started calming me. 'Don't freak out, its only acid, you might think your not here now, but I see you so you must be. Sit down and drink a tea. There's a good bloke.' He then puts on some Hendrix and gets me an ice tea. That brought me so far back to me, it was amazing. I sat on my comfy sofa and I look outside (on a bright summer day) and it was snowing and blizzarding. Yep I think, this is going to be just fine. '
