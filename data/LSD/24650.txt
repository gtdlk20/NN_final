You know that feeling in the back of your mind when you know somethings going wrong? It begins here. I hear the sirens constantly and I think, the party's getting busted! I run to the door and look outside and the cops are there..but they're not coming in, they're sitting in their cars talking to each other laughing. I don't get this. I go back in and realize that I am tripping really hard. I start looking for my friend and when I find him I tell him of my condition. 'It's ok, just remember that you took acid and everything will be ok'. I try to party more but the sirens keep bothering me to a point of heated panic. Im running aorund the party, person to person, (by this point I'm pretty sure all of the poeple attending were tripping somewhat, including some dj's) trying to convince people that we should all go somewhere else besides the party. After about 20 minutes of this, I have a crowd of about 20 people following me out the door, and Legos stops me. Asks me where I'm going, hands me some candy. Before I think about it I eat it.
