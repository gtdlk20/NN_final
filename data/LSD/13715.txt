There is a certain place where ones mind is free to float in an infinite sea of forever. Ones mind is as much a reality as the physical world that we cling to. The mind and the physical are not two separate entities on different planes of existence. There is an infinite fractal architecture linking the mind and the body woven into itself forever. The entity we know as consciousness is a combination of our minds taking stock of the real world and the real world creating tangible realisations of what the mind would perceive to be true. The idea of forever lends itself to an infinite void of conceptualisation that can only be countered by stopping to realise the moment that is now.
