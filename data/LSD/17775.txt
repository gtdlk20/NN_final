We sat at one fire circle in front of a booth where energy drinks were sold.  There was a giant tye-dyed mushroom tapestry stretched out above the shop, which is why we chose it out of all the other fire circles.  We sat down, marveling at the complexity of the hay bales, when the people already sitting there asked the circle if anyone had a pipe.  We happily procured a lovely glass piece, and to our amazement it was loaded with an amount of weed that it was never designed to hold.  The pipe was passed around a few times, and then reloaded to the same bountiful level.  The circle had broken up a bit, and after two hits, our happy pipe-loaders decided to go strolling, leaving us with this heaping bowl.  We smoked it, and then new people came to sit.  Seeing us with a smoking pipe, they offered to load some.  The fire was warm, and we were giggly and happy to the point of being stupefied.  There was no way to express the all-encompassing sense of happiness, giddiness, joy of life and sight and sound and creation.  These people with their generous weed-sharing ways were just small examples of the glory and bounty of this barter faire.  We were all one, all happy and all sharing in the beauty and warmth of the communal fire.
