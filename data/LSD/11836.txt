As we walked out to the farm I began to feel hot and I was being extremely talkative.  Both of these Arthur attributed to my excitement/apprehension, and he was almost certainly right.  When we got to the woods, there was a fallen branch that we had to duck beneath to start on the trail.  As I went under it, I touched it with my hand, and for a fleeting second I felt this weird connection with ancient humans.  I thought about how people for millions of years had walked through the woods, maybe even these same woods, and had maybe even put their hand on this same tree, in this same place.  This was my first indication that something unusual was beginning.  It had been probably 35 minutes.
