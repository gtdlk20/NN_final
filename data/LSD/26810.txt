I actually tried LSD several times before the EVENT I am about to descibe (which was on 3-28-89 at the Omni in Atlanta- just looked up the exact date AND setlist on the internet, pretty cool) and even though a few friends and I had experienced some pretty wild things during our frequent acid trips during my 'crazy' college days of 1984-88 this one sticks out in my mind as the 'Big One.' Because Jerry Garcia died in 1995 making it impossible to attend a Dead show as so many did I have fond memeories of the few shows I did make it to, but as far as this acid trips go, this one was diferent because I had never experienced the truly powerful energy being spread around by the thousands of people (all ages although mostly young adults) who were either tripping along with me or were at least very receptive to feelings I was having on acid that I would normally hide
