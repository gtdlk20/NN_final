7:15 AM. This amounted to my fourth one. It didn't even take five minutes for me to feel the familiar rushing sensation. I was locked in my dreamland again. There was a girl who I have never seen before just laying out on the couch, I didn't even know when she had gotten there, or at least I couldn't remember, I guess she woke up because of my constant shuffling about the house. 'I need to go home,' she told me, 'Where's Joey?' Joey? I knew who she was talking about, but I had no idea that he was here. 'I don't know, I'm still tripping. Just look around the house, I'm sure he's around here somewhere.' Her make-up was poorly done, and although she had a nice body, she wasn't much to look at. 'Alright,' she told me, 'But look with me, I don't know whoever lives here and I just don't wanna be walkin' around in someone's house and...' Her words started to run together, and her mouth was producing sentences at a million miles per hour. I couldn't concentrate, I was completely zoned out on her poorly drawn make-up, melting face, and fast-talking mouth that didn't make any noise other than complete and total nonsense.
