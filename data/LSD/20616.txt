Well we got to the party and all my friends were there, I walked in and looked at one of my buddys sitting on a chair with ty-dyed flowers sprouting out of the walls and chair he was sitting on, then I looked at him and his face morphed onto an evil looking frog. By now things were getting insane. I tried to calm myself and sit down for awhile, thats when I looked into the kitchen and saw a very cool tile pattern layed into the floor. Now this was a real pattern, it was all kinds of squares, rectangles, triangles, octagons, of all different color. I was looking at this when I noticed my heartbeat, then I saw that with every beat, a wave went out from my body and hit this pattern and blew all the little tiles up into the air, flipping all over the place, then falling back into position, this went along the intire length of the pattern, in one wave after another. That was the last good feeling I felt for almost 4 months.
