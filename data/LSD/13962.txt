The night I took the hit, I met up with my friend and her boyfriend and after listening to the band, decided to go back to his apartment. I definitely did not want to be driving while tripping. After arriving to his house I realized it was the 25th anniversary of the Grateful Dead blotter. That relaxed me and made me giddy inside. I took one hit. One hit. Doubting hardly any strange feelings would arouse. I was wrong.
