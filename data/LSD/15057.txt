After discovering the Widespread Panic cd, my friend and I raced back inside, put the disc into the cd player and danced for what seemed a million years. Bare footed, long skirt, my beautiful Grateful Dead necklace tied tightly, I danced until I thought my lungs would burst. It was the most beautiful thing in the world. I loved my life. I danced until I thought my lungs would burst. It was the most beautiful thing in the world. I loved my life. And if I could just dance here, and not do anything for the rest of time, I would be fine.  Eventually we got tired, however, and decided to sit in front of the fan and cool off. Watching my skirt blow in front of the fan, I felt like I was at the beach. I imagined myself, drink in one hand, the other hand tracing lines in the sand. This feeling was overwhelming.
