Summer mentioned the blotter not dissolving yet after about 30 minutes of having taken it (she ate afterwords) and Louise recommended switching location to the rooftop of the mouth - this is possibly something to keep in mind for the next trip, as it immediately dissolved afterwards. I had accidentally swallowed my blotter earlier, which was probably one the reasons, along with the larger dose, why my trip was somewhat delayed when compared to theirs. Dianna was a true trooper, who kept the blotter underneath her tongue until it dissolved - and it took a long time: about an hour, but she began coming up immediately after it was absorbed.
