I just read some bad trip stories, and all I can say is holy shit...I think I definitely would have died. The first time I tripped, on two yellow geltabs, I thought I was going to go insane. But as one unfortunate person put it, 'There will always be someone who has done more than you. ' Indeed, my friend said that he tripped so hard once he had to go up to trees and touch them to see if they were real. That made me feel better.
