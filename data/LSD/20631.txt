Finally we decided to leave the room. It was still dark outside. I took an infinitely long piss and began to notice that the wood floor seemed to be emanating energy. Paintings would move, and plants would go through the seasons. It turned out our uncle and grandparents were already awake. They began to ask us about college admissions being the concerned adults they were. We somehow managed to ramble through the conversation supporting each other when we got stuck on a train of thought. Eventually we decided to go on a walk. We were starting to come down at that point. The moon was incredible, and we couldnt' understand where we were walking, but everything was still amazing. Eventually we returned and took showers. My cousin claimed that his shower was absolutely incredible. I did not have a particularly amazing shower, I had already come down from the trip and was just heavily stoned. I felt disconnected from my body. Everything was distant. I felt like I had lost my soul. Like I had no reason for existing. I pressed on though. At the time I couldnt' piece together what had happened during the trip. As teh day went on I began to go insane from insomnia. I was dead tired and my brain was fried, but I couldnt' go to sleep. I was ready to commit suicide and asked some family for something to help em sleep. They gave me some motion sickness medicine and eventually I crashed. I woke up normal.
