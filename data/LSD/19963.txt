I never experienced any visitations this night.  No real intense revelation to change my perception.  No enhanced powers of creativity or ideas.  It was simply souping around and I was an observer....in the middle of it all naturally.  Things were strange and everything was a picture.  A picture that was transformed in every single way you could imagine.  When I started to come down, I looked at a clock and realized this had gone on for 22 hours and I had not eaten.  So in an intense after trip 'shower period' where everything is lovely and everything is one mystifying.  I had breakfast, which turned out to be a mix of vegetables in my Mom's home made soup.
