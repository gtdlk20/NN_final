Our friend Aj had called earlier and wanted to know if we wanted to watch Fear and Loathing in las Vegas.  We thought it was a good idea, so at this point we decided to meet her on campus and walk to town to another friend's house to watch the movie.  We met up with Aj who was with another friend of ours. They were both sober, but had tripped before so they knew kind of what was going on for us.  They said they had to stop at a few places first before going to watch the movie.  I didn't really feel comfortable going to any parties, and said I wanted to stay outside and we'd wait for them.
