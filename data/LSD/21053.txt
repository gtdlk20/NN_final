Minutes later, I stood up to walk upstairs on the balcony to smoke some grass, but on the way, I got into a conversation with my friend.  He started talking about parents.  He told me that there were sophomore girls in the group whose parents will be coming to pick them up.  Everything was very fast and crazy, and intense open and closed eye visuals overwhelmed me.  Although I wouldnÂ’t realize it for another ten minutes or so, I was already in a delusional and subconscious state. I had a vision of a man running and weaving in and out of people at a Rave I went to in LA.
