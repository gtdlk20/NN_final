I could hear the electricity buzzing around me. I could see the fluorescent lights flickering. Nowhere was there any relief to be found, no green plants or artwork to soften the consumerism. Desperately I tried not to let my glance fall on any of the products all around me. I didnt want to give them my attention. Stuff I dont want, stuff I dont need. My eyes found something that wasnt a box with a sticker: A sign on the wall said Area monitored by closed circuit television.
