Our departure was delayed for a while because I was beginning to feel really rooted to the bar and afraid of what we might encounter if we left. I cant remember if I reasoned myself out of this or was talked out of it, but eventually we set off on foot. Although the dark made me a little apprehensive at first but once we were outside the cool air and lights on the wet concrete overwhelmed me with euphoria. Walking felt absolutely effortless, as if I was being carried around by a conveyor belt and colours, rather than being cartoonishly exaggerated as portrayed in the media, instead just seemed much more intense. It felt as if I was seeing colour with clarity for the first time, shapes and patterns (existing ones, not just my hallucinations) also seemed to have real significance. My most powerful ecstasy experience doesnt even come close to the absolute peace and euphoria I had wandering those wet streets but although not as intense ecstasy is at least stable. LSDs volatility ensured the bliss way to be short lived.
