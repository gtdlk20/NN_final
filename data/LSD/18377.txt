In the next two hours I am tripping and she is out of this world. She started feeling queasy and she asks me how soon can we leave the place for Montreal. She started to feel that we will never make it into the city. I had the bad idea of walking towards the bus depot but we were tripped out so much that cars in the highway were scaring her even though we were on the side of the road. We make a pitstop near a gas station there we call a taxi. While waiting for the taxi, I speak about another quirk of me tripping. This I call the Second Stage where I start seeing these silver membrane(?)-like intelligent entities appearing in the periphery of my vision while I have my eyes open. I call them intelligent because I see them to be playing with my attention. Taxi arrives and in the next 10minutes we are in the bus depot. She felt safe and in the half an hour we were off to the city.
