After these lines, which my mind seemed to vomit onto the paper, I began to laugh out loud.  Tears came to my eyes and I was completely overcome with joy and again I reminded myself that I had an entire day to trip and have fun; after my next class at 2 p.m. of course.  Time flies between classes and the poem; I do not particularly remember, but I estimate that I ingested about 5-7 bong hits during this time.
