Several minutes went by without either team even getting a shot off. Turning the ball over, players falling down and tripping over each other, throwing the ball out of bounds. This was pure torture. I wanted to laugh so bad tears were coming down my face but seeing as there was nothing that a normal person would consider funny about the situation I had to hold back. My dad kept asking me if I was all right. I could only hunch over and pretend to have a stomachache. This was simply too much. It was time for Kevin and I to get out of there before my dad started to think something was up.
