I have taken LSD for around 10 years, smoked Cannabis for 14 years and have tried most other soft drugs. I was at my friends house, we talked about various drugs and the effects, smoked a bit of grass and watched a few videos. Just before I left to go home he said he had some old LSD tabs (about 12 months he said) he brought out the packet, it contained 10 tabs with piece signs draw in red. Goody Goody I thought, ill go home ring a couple of mates get a few vid's in and we'll have a bash. 12 month acid probably won't work anyway I thought.
