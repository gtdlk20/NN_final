I somehow end up sitting on top of him. I do something that makes him say, Ow! and I come back to my body, just a little bit. I fall to the side and Ryan holds me. He is talking about God and love and warmth and light. I listen and try to talk. I feel like some of the wildness has left me, but Im still not sure what this body is or who Emily is. We talk about the spirit and the soul and I try to describe the feeling of being outside of the physical world, but then I get thirsty or cold or have to pee. I keep saying, But I have this body, I have to keep coming back to this body. I am full of disdain for it, the thing that is keeping me from the void from before, where I felt like I belonged.
