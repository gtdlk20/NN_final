I asked why no one else was doing it and they explained that you develop tolerance and they didn't want to have to do twice as much to get the same effect.  I had no idea the night before that they were all tripping.  At first I had the feeling that nothing was going to happen.  They just told me to hold on and it would work.  About a half hour after taking the acid, things started to happen.  The first effect I noticed was that a blue chair in the room seemed much more blue.  It was strange but not alarming.  Then I laughed my ass off as I watched my friend B roll a joint.  It was so funny that he had these finely tuned 'joint rolling skills.'   Then we set off on what would be the strangest journey of my life.
