T+4 hours: I am crazy. I am so far gone that I actually gave up, when my girlfriend was wondering the apartment, I decided to sit in this little tiny back room next to the refridgerator and wait it out. My girlfriend, being the persistant little girl she is came in and sat with me and basically talked me through it somehow. The irony is that I'm about 1000x more experianced than her but she managed to talk me into being happy.
