As the LSD came on strong, I was staring out my window.  I saw beautiful trees, greenery, and thriving life (including groups of students merrily walking), but this beauty was CUT and MARRED by the numerous roads and cars streaking like dirty death bullets through my campus.  This led to the realization that I was in the city, deeply desiring a natural habitat but unable to access it.
