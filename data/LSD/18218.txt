I did this and waited until Saturday (New Year's Eve) afternoon, after my couch had been delivered.  All morning was spent going back and forth with myself over taking something that I had no experience with, and from a seller on the internet (good reviews notwithstanding) that I had not seen.  I didn't know if I would freak out or if something bad might happen.  I had read enough trip reports on a reputable harm reduction website to know that bad things can happen with unknown substances. I had read enough trip reports on a reputable harm reduction website to know that bad things can happen with unknown substances.  To my credit I felt like an experienced psychonaut, so I felt like if anyone could handle it I could.  Luckily I told myself it was a small amount, and that only LSD is active at such small quantities, and I wondered why I didn't get the blotter.  Actually I had thought that it was sour patch kids blotter.
