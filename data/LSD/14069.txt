T=2:55: the intensified patterns in the concrete ceiling began to swirl and blend smoothly.  The support marks seemed to dance like rainbow-hued cartoon bones.  The saturation of the colors of the wood grain patterns of the door began to pulse.  Fascinating.  I activated the chemical hot pack and watched the trails of crystals grow.  The warmth was nice.  I felt rather cold for some reason.  I had read that temperature regulation could vary on LSD though-- so perhaps that was prudent.  The visual trails became more intense.  I saw jagged edges suspended in the air when I moved the hot pack.  The trails seemed to be more pronounced with sharper-edged objects.  I didn't see them around my hands for instance.  I put the hot pack under my shirt because I was cold, but then had a sudden desire to take my shirt off and pull on a comforter instead so I did.
