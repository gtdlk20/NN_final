I am writing this in july of 2009, two years and two months after the first time I had tripped on any kind of psychoactive. It was the last day of my freshman year of college and I could not wait to be finished. I had five hits of acid, and two of my best friends since middleschool had decided to go camping at a lake about 75 minutes from where we live. A place we had been to a million times before.
