We sat in a small shed, lets call our other friend D, had in his backyard. We used to sit out there so his parents wouldn't bother us. It had three chairs around a small table covered in grafiti with a bucket of water on it which we used to smoke marijuana from using a cut coca cola bottle. G pulled out his weed and started to smoke some while I stared at the table, I was mesmarised by it, I could see faces which seemed to be only inches from my face smiling at me then withdrawing back to the table only to come back at me. I looked up at G at this point, roughly 11pm, and told him I was fucked up and tripping too hard. He offered me some weed and I said noway, in fact I decided to give my remaining skunkweed to D because I said I would never smoke it again (this turned out to be an acid induced lie). My visuals were overwelming, I found it hard to look at people because of the shit that I was seeing. And I had this overwelming thought that the shed I was sitting in was a small shed in the middle of a vast shanty town on which leaving the shed would mean that I was lost in a labyrinth of slums.
