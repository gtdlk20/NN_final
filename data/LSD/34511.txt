The only visuals I got during the party was when I was looking at the screen and it had strips of red and blue and green triangles Wich made this trippy cornucopia and kept changing between the two I saw the triangles overlapping the red stripes and when it switched back to the triangles they were in hd and the colour was very vivid. When we left the party we went to smoke some joints at this place that was sheltered from the wind and cold, this happened during November in southern Europe so it was cold but not so cold. After daylight breaks we leave to go to the gas station that was about 2 or 3kms away.
