C was making a lot of noise in the room and we were all telling him to be quiet. We all thought he was tripping to hard to control himself. But that was the weird part because we were also tripping so hard but could handle it completely. C started making absolutely no sense at all with random remarks of insanity. C started throwing everything he could get his hands on, even his own stuff that he just started demolishing. Everything thing he said wasn't making any sense. We were all tripping out of our minds also, but just wanted C to chill out before he woke A's dad and that was something that we just didn't want to deal with. We couldn't even smoke our bud because it we had to literally babysit C. Because he was FAR from himself.
