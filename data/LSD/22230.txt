My trip began early that day. It was about 11:00 a.m. when I took the first hit. Although this could have been mind over manner, I believe I felt the effects of LSD the second it dissolved in my mouth (I also felt this way almost immediately after taking shrooms). Of course, the effects weren't very strong but I noticed a slight change in consciousness. Colors began to get a lot brighter and I noticed something was different. However, I wasn't exactly sure what it was. After about an hour, I was disappointed that I didn't experience any kind of hallucination. At least it wasn't what I expected. At this point, my mind was altered a great deal and the colors were very enhanced. They were absolutely beautiful.
