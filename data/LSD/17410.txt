As I mentioned above this was my first experience with LSD , I decided to take 2 hits instead of 1 because I have read that 1 hit of acid isnt nearly as potent as 1 hit of acid taken during the late 60s and 70s, I wanted to get the classic experience so to say.  All in all I was extremely excited going into the trip, not 1 ounce of nerves.
