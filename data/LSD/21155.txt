I returned to the tree of before, only to find that there were people sitting around it, talking.  I wondered what thsee folks were doing sitting by a tree in the dark, but I didn't question it; I just moved on.  The next tree I stopped at, there were people sitting around, too.  Gave up on that one.  Finally, I found an unpopulated tree, and prepared myself for action--only then did I spot the sitters under it.
