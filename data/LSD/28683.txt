As soon as I walked through the door I was approached by a rather shadey looking character.  He asked if I was interested in some doses and told me to follow him in the bathroom.  I was a little skeptical but proceeded anyway.  He said it was $10 a hit but told me he could give me 2 for $15.  I was planning on just one but felt obliged to buy both because of the offer.  I took the first hit and went out to the floor to meet up with my friends.  The show began about a half hour later and I decided to take the second hit because nothing was coming on.  Another half hour went by and it seemed that I felt something but I wasn't sure if it was the beginning or just anxiety.
