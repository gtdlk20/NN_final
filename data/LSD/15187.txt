During the entire experience I thought that everyone of my peers, people around my age, were also coming to some state of spiritual awakening. I at many times hallucinated  as I looked at websites like reddit and such, that other people were on my wavelength, including the friends I thought to be picking me up. I also assumed that the world just managed to change drastically, to the point to where we were already on the verge of utopia. As my mom feared that I was getting ready to leave the house, on my own, in the middle of the night, she decided to cleverly convince me she would take me to see my friends. Instead, she brought me to the hospital, quite possibly saving my life.
