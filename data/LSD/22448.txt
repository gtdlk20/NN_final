By 6pm, we had moved to our other friends house and were just sitting and lounging around, when I walked into the room I swear that I was sunburnt, but when I went back outside to ask my friends, they said that nothing about my skin tone appeared out of the ordinary.  I realize now after shrooming, that I have a tendency to notice the red tones in my skin a lot more than usual.  I reapplied sunscreen and went back into the living room.
