My trip by the way had only icreased for three hours! I was still not even peaking! This experience taught me that acid is unpredicatable in the amount of time trips peak, last, etc. This one was intensified because of the atmosphere. When we were away from the concert experience, my peak finally leveled out and except for a weird feeling in my throat and some weird visuals, I managed to slowly come down and enjoy the experience, knowing it would only be a 'normal'  trip for the next three or four hours.
