I took about a half hour to set up my room for myself, keeping all lights off except for my blue and green lava lamp. My glow in the dark stars now seemed a part of the wall, though very distinct from the faces that were crowding the ceiling. I went on tumblr and saw faces in every single image while listening to my library on shuffle and feeling one with technology. I realized how innately nimble my fingers were at navigating my device. I rewatched 'Going Normal' and was only partially distracted by the faces that filled different parts of my computer screen. Even when I closed my eyes to try to go to sleep I could see different colored parts of the faces creating kaleidoscopic patterns. I eventually drifted off to seep listening to sounds of the rain, trying to induce a lucid dream.
