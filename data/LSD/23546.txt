My sea of feelings was briefly softened by Dianna, whom I realized I was lying on top of, only when she put her head up again, and attempted to explain, Oh I was on such a good trip Len... I was on a spaceship... but then I became the ship... and I was flying, oh it was beautiful! and I could see it. And it was. Picturesque. But I couldnt talk about that now, no matter how much I wanted to be visually engaged, I just needed to share emotions.
