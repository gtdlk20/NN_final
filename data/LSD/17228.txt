I felt very inhuman to the rest of the world.  I felt though as if everyone else around me was playing the same game with me.  Each time I would get a wave of energy it felt SO good.  It became the point of the whole trip as soon as I figured it out.  It was sort of like my being was just reoccurring some type of active stimuli.  I canÂ’t really explain it because each time a wave hit me I would forget nearly everything.  But as time went on things became more and more in depth.  The best way I can lay out my mind at that time is like having options really.  In the beginning of the trip I only had 2 or 3 options.  But as time went by I had 20 to 30 options.  These options though were not really options they are just an example of how much detail I had in my life.  Everything was extremely simple in the beginning then slowly became more complex.  From the start I only knew that I was human and I was alive.  Soon a began to know that these other beings around me were human and that they were my friends.  I started to remember I had cigarettes, a phone, a wallet, and other possessions.  After a few hours of doing this I started to come out of it all.  It was probably 4 or 5 hours after we got to the house that I felt like I was back at least somewhat into reality.
