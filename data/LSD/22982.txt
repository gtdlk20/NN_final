4:00- I decided to go into my room. I made it upstairs and went into my room. My bed, which is blue with patterns, looked like the ocean. Waves were moving through it like the shore at the beach. I continued to see crazy patterns coming out of the walls, sometimes even flying past my head. I just put on some Beatles, laid back, and watched the CEVs flowing around in my head for the next few hours.
