I went into my room and kicked my shoes off, took my pants off, laid in my bed and threw the blankets over. My mother was staying with me and I honestly forgot she was and I realized I'm on acid and I came inside without texting her I was coming back or anything and I was like fuck I'm tripping to hard to explain myself I started to panic because of this thought and realized how my clothes looked when I got into my room it looked odd my pants and shoes on the floor just messy it looked like so I got up and tried to clean but for some reason I put my clothes in weird spots around my room and when I realized that I panicked some more. Trying to clean on acid is hard haha. I laid back down and my trip felt stronger. I felt this overwhelming panic that my mom was gonna come into my room and I'd have to explain myself. I felt insane. I kept hearing inside my head these loud and different frequencies of vibrations. I thought I was having a bad trip. I tried to take deep breaths and that helped in a way. I tried to look for my phone in the dark and couldn't this made me feel uneasy. I finally found it and looked at my bed and noticed how tangled I was in my blankets. By this time I felt the panic come back because of the thought that my mother would walk into my room and see me losing my mind. I took more deep breaths and calmed down. Just got on my phone and began messaging my friend about the difficulty I was having and then finally the panic feeling went away and I got up to tell my mom I was back and she didn't care. This made me feel better I went back into my room got on my phone and listened to music for the next hours until the acid finally wore off. This was my trip on 2 tabs.
