As I arrived home I had some trouble unlocking my door and the grain of my wood door was, once again, dancing. I got inside and proceeded to my games room to play video games. The games were no more intense or difficult than had I been playing them normally. I beat one of the games and, dissapointingly, I decided to go to sleep.
