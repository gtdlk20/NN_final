Eventually one of us or both of us prompt the idea to go to our Russian friend's house I went to earlier down near the 7/11. Or maybe the guy called us I don't remember but we both knew that's where we wanted to be because his house may be kind of shitty and weirdly foreign but his mom didn't care if we smoked weed or took psychedelics so we were down. I assume 10 to 20 minutes later is when we arrived there by walking and when we go inside his place or I guess just that part of town in general the whole vibe of the trip becomes much more upbeat and 'real'. We arrive to his place and sit down in his dining room with the kitchen and living room right there and IÂ’m telling him about how I'm on acid and he's like 'haha I know. I saw you take that shit' He then turns the lights on and they both see that my pupils are fucked and my Russian friend's just like 'Holy sh...You look like you're on a good one bro..'
