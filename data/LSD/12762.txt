This is when it started to go bad.  I realized later that what set me off was trying to act in a normal way, because I couldn't figure out what normal was, and that got me freaked out.  The party was full of drunk people, some talking to me.  I tried to smile and laugh at the appropriate times, but I had to think really hard to decide when to nod or smile, etc.  There was some sort of a bong going around, and I took a hit off of it.  My lungs had never felt so strange, the flavor was not at all like what I imagined it would be and it was cold.  Startled, I began to cough, and I suddenly couldn't remember what was normal in any sense of the word. I didn't remember how to breathe normally, and continued to cough every few seconds.  My throat and lungs burned and every sensation was like I was feeling it for the first time.  My tongue in my mouth, the way it felt to swallow...it was all new to me, and I still couldn't remember how to breathe.  Delyriem asked if I needed water, and left to get me a glass.  The moment he left I got sucked into my head.  I was alone in a crowded room.  My thoughts were uncontrollable, I had no clue what was going on. I was alone in a crowded room.  My thoughts were uncontrollable, I had no clue what was going on.  My body felt strange, I was staring into space. I didn't have any visuals at this point so I didn't really remember that I was tripping, I just knew that I felt very strange.
