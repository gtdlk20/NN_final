Myself and a small group of friends had gathered at someone's house to try out some acid. We had each separately tried it but in very low doses. The evening started with a few joints to pass the time, we wanted to wait until there was no chance of bumping into any of his family members as they were still at the house. It was about 10pm when we decided to drop our first tabs. I had originally decided to go very slowly. On my first acid experience I had been tripping for 7 hours on just one tab and a bottle of cough medicine. It was an hour later when I thought that maybe one tab wouldn't be enough so I chewed down another. Over the following hour I started to feel a mild sense of euphoria and a desperate desire to eat my last tabs. By midnight I had munched down 4 tabs of half decent acid, as had one of my friends. Another (the guy whose house we were at) had taken 7 as he was a big guy and liked to get as high as possible whenever he chose to take any drugs. The other two people there took somewhere between 1 and 2 each.
