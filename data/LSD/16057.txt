I flash out of the Light, and see the universe folding over itself, contorting itself, bending, the power of the energy doing this was Omnipotent. 'I' was less that a particle of dust in a camels nose. I hold on to the only thread of words I could force myself to remember: 'You took acid, don't be scared, when its time, you will be back' I am transported to a new planet. This planet feels much more strange, more alien. And sure enough, these guys were shape-shifting. It's really hard for me to remember/express even 1% of the situation... They look more aggressive, and they stare at me and change shapes in front of my eyes. Not human shape, but fluid, liquid, sinuous electric shapes. They definitely give me the sense that I don't belong there. I will myself away from there, and proceed to fly around the planet, just looking down from away. I hoped the Winds would come take me away from this place... But I didn't wish where to else to take me...
