This was my second time trying acid and I must say it was not too much different than the first.  The first time i tried acid i bought what was supposed to be 'real strong acid' and it was 2 hits dropped on a sugar cube. Since it was my first time, i decided to have a sober sitter stay the night at my house.  I dropped the acid and i had high expectations of the trip.  About 30 minutes after dropping, I look in the mirror to see my pupils are as big as pennies, so I was like 'wow, im gonna trip balls'.  This however was not the case.  After about 2 hours, nothing seemed to happen at all, and i was slightly confused becuase my friend bought some from the same guy with me and he said that he tripped like crazy.  After 4 hours, i began to feel tired and i gave up and I knew that all i had bought was just something that made my pupils big.  I was dissapointed.
