On the way into town we stopped by at a Tescos, I cant remember exactly why, presumably for food. The shop was crawling with police (looking back I may have just hallucinated some of them, Im sure there were definitely three but at the time everyone inside looked in uniform). Every authority figures eyes bored into me, every corner I turned revealed yet more cops. I darent risk leaving the shop in case they corned me alone so I followed my sitter around the shop. He was talking quite a lot and concentrating on his voice as we wandered about the shops confusing layout helped me focus my attention. We were finished and back on the street within minutes but the experience was nevertheless taxing, my euphoria was totally vanished and the streets assumed a new hostility. After talking to my friends for a while and watching the reflections of the streetlights in puddles I began to feel more comfortable again, looking ahead I realised we were close to the city centre.
