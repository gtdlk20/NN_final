We made it out of there without actually causing any kind of disturbance at all; at most we were being loud and giggly, but I held it together and didn't let the ~really~ hysterical laugher set in till we were back in the car. Then we went for something of a country drive, stopping briefly back at the apartment to pick up one of the friends we had left there during the sandwich run, because he wanted to be on this drive. Hey, who can blame him? So I was driven around for about an hour on a beautiful summer night--we drove down by the creek and smelled the summer air.
