T+3 hours: The acid was getting too me, I kept thinking that this wouldn't end and I'd be in a world that wasn't real forever, nothing was real anymore, the fan was alive, the walls were alive, the blankets were alive, the floor was alive. Patterns melted into each other, and then formed new ones, from those patterns came new ones. The tracers were unbelievable, I'd be able to swing my hands around and I could move the color/pattern scheme of one object right onto another object. If the wall was striped I could bring the stripes onto the floor. As I walked into each room I began turning every light on in the apartment to make everything glow it's own individual color. And it did, as I walked into the kitchen everything was green, we decided we were hungry but couldn't cook anything so I took out clementimes. The problem was they were green, so we thought they were bad. We forgot that when oranges are green it just means there not totally ripe. Somehow we thought that it was like bread, that turns green (mold) when it's bad, so it took us a while to figure that out.
