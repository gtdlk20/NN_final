I went into his kitchen and looked at the pattern on the floor. It is a kind of random speckling of broken colored fragments on a white tile. As I watched the fragments they seemed to flow together and expand out, kind of like a river. Some of them seemed to pop out of the floor and they all kind of came together in the center and this beautiful blue aura of light was shaded on and around  them. This was around the height of my trip. I went into N's room, of course decorated with glow in the dark stars, black lights, and posters. He had some stars arranged on his ceiling that spelled out the word 'PIMP'. As I watched the stars they all were spinning fast and counterclockwise. The posters of girls looked like they were moving, coming out at me, taunting me even.
