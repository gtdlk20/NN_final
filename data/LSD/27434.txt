We took a walk and the trees looked like plastic; my hand was melting into the colors. As I was walking I felt like I was getting shorter, then things would jolt and Id be walking again. Then I started to taste the colors. It didnt taste like chocolate or cheese, but it was a 5th taste. Like the four are Salt, Sour, Bitter, and Sweet; well Color was a fifth taste, really creamy and smooth. I mostly tasted Red, Green, and Purple. They were trying to mix together but couldnt and constantly swirled. This taste persisted through the night. I was watching an episode of Taxi and it didnt make any sense. I didnt know what was going on. More mental hallucinations were seeing time. A wave with crests and troughs, and the part that was tripping was smeared everywhere. All three of us also had the urge for something. I want something, said #3. We all agreed but didnt know what we wanted.
