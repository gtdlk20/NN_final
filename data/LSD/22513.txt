We sat down and started drinking and smoking. They were also tripping hard. One of the people in the apartment passed a spliff my way and said 'look, you're shaking'. I remember looking down at my hands and not being able to tell if I was shaking. I looked at my hands, fully aware of the fact that I have poor vision, and all I saw was a blur. I couldn't tell whether I was shaking or not and whether or not it was just my crappy eyesight. I tried really hard but I couldn't tell. I then became absolutely convinced that he was screwing with me and trying to send me on a bad trip. Sure enough, I started thinking I have to get out of here. I have to leave. I don't know where I want to go, but I have to leave now. I tried telling my buddy that we have to leave. He was like, why do you want to leave? I was like, we have to leave now. I need to get out of this apartment. I don't know if I was telling him we have to leave in front of other people but I eventually convinced him to leave.
