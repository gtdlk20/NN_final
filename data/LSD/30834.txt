We went back to Square Hall, at Diannas, to eat, and immediately after I was done, I felt my muscles tensing up. I had a specific tense spot between my shoulder blades, which had me lifting and narrowing them. I immediately announced to Summer I was tensing up, and she nodded saying she also started to feel physically different (she mentioned something about not being able to feel her left arm and leg tension). I dont remember Dianna being particularly affected by that point, but she decided to sit on the floor, and began painting.
