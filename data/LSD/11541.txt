As W escorted me around, it occurred to me that this is what it would be like to be old and in a nursing home.  I flashed on a friend of mine who had recently died of cancer and I thought this is probably what he felt like in the last days of being in the hospital.  Oddly, this was not a depressing thought, but a neutral, affect-free observation of what the future might hold.
