It has been a long walk ever since the power tower and we are just now passing the Corkscrew.  Exhausted and confused I tell S and C that we have to ride the corkscrew right now while the line is short.  The wait is perfectly fine with me still, just me hanging out with my friends, talking about stuff.  The ride is pretty fun, but nothing mind blowing.  The acid still isn't causing any obvious visuals, or audio distortions.  The acid is making me think different and enhancing my mood, but anything else was still very subtle.
