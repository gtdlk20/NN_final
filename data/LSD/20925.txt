yes, this is where it got bad. Benny began flipping out, demanding that we tell him in detail what had happened during the night. I was completely cool by contrast, saying everything was fine. I didn't trust Kim. I was convinced she had taken some acid. I was fucked up but had convinced myself i was rationale. I told kim to take benny out of the room to talk. Meanwhile, Victor had curled up at my feet (i was sitting) and was stroking himself through his pants, chanting 'oh' in rhythmic patterns. i couldn't help but laugh. it was repulsive yet so brutally stupid that i had to laugh. Then the worst thing happened. Victor raised his head and plunged his hand into his mouth up to his wrist. i pulled it out quickly, but to this day i still don't know if that really happened. he says he was trying to kill himself because he thought he was insane.
