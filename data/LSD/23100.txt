I don't remember what the insightful visions were... I however now realize that they were part of my 'Atomic Existence' theory which states that all life lives through their atoms which are recycled into the universe no matter what after death and are turned into new things. We were watching a film about people stranded out at sea (Oprah from the 80's (my teacher noted her girth)). I somehow related to it in my altered state of mind. I felt that I too was lost at sea on a raft, by myself in a vast sea in day to day life.
