5:00 arrive at my friend's safely. We began to play games and he decided Cuphead would be perfect for me and boy was he right. The cartoon game was full of colors and tracers. he took a glance at my eyes and there was no color. I looked in the mirror and seen myself but it looked like my whole face was covered in eyes, weird. We wanted to smoke but I left the weed in my car so I went to get it. It must've took me 20 mins to find it even though I knew where it was. My mind was everywhere. It was dark outside and the rugs to my car seemed like arms reaching for me. This was scary but then I finally found it and went in to smoke. We smoked some bong packs and it was blast off time again. I stayed at his place watching Rick and Morty and playing Cuphead it was fun but it was midnight now so I had to leave. I was coming down slowly now but the dark seemed to have light. The rain was still colorful even in the dark. I make it home and decide to watch some music videos.i began to feel tired around 3 a.m. and I had to work at 7 a.m. so I decided to lay down. I close my eyes and wow I see so many things. The closed eyes visuals lead me to a dream like state and I finally fall asleep.
