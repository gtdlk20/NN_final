In the months following the experience described in the other submission, I felt a presence, a sort of new found wisdom, clarity, and happiness toward life... However, gradually, my ego began to become dangerously intertwined with the experience; it slowly crept in and began a kind of claiming of responsibility for this new gift, twisting it in a way that was not honest. I don't recall if, in the back of my mind, I was aware of this or not at the time, but if so, that crafty ego was successful at pushing it far enough back so as to be ignored.
