First, we stood in front of some 300-400 year old Italian drawings done in an intricate crosshatching pattern. They came alive on paper and suddenly shapes hidden within the crosshatching were apparent. The arms of the figures moved as did the heads. It was bizarre and striking. The intensity and passion of the drawings were much more easily felt. I suddenly realized that the intricate style of crosshatching displayed was, sadly, a lost art.
