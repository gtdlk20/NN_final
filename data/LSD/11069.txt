We finally got there and I had no idea that the sunken gardens could be so alive and chaotic. Light was strobing over the grass and structures like some kind of trippy spotlight. Every sound was amplified to such an extreme that I thought cars driving down a road far off through the woods were right next to me. I lay down on the grass and closed my eyes only to melt into the earth below me and witness the most complex, detailed, crisp, and colorful CEV's I've ever seen. I can't really describe it, but if you've seen some really trippy and complex art before, it might be something like that. Except imagine it being alive, and having deep meaning.
