I entertained myself by staring at multi-dimensional fractals by placing my eyes about a centimeter away from the floor.  My body was exhausted, especially towards the end of the night.  A couple times, I ventured upstairs looking for alcohol.  I felt that alcohol would have been a perfect antidote to calm my nerves and let me sleep.  I was hungry for sleep.  I desired it more than anything.
