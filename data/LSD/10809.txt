For the next thirteen hours, I was enthralled by the beauty of life as I had not been in over a decade.  Color seemed to thrive in this new, alien world! The entirety of the rainbow glared at me from every corner.  I saw colors I couldn't name, colors that I've never seen replicated.  It was as if I had never seen color.  I  looked out the window towards the bay, and grasped the size of the universe in a new way.  A vast map formed inside my head, earth, and the planets, and the sun and stars and space beyond.  It grew ever larger, and an arrow appeared over the grain of sand the earth had become, an arrow with the words 'You are Here' hovering almost comically above.  I snapped back to reality, or what my reality had become, and took a few moments to clear my head.  While I was recovering from the sheer size of the void, a white swing caught my eye.   A red cardinal had perched on the right hand arm-rest and the colors were so sharp and clean that they almost hurt to look at. I thought it seemed very realistic, then laughed to myself.  After all, it was real life!   My mental processes seemed remarkably clear, and I began to 'toy' with ideas in my head.  I was fascinated by my new found ability to take a blueprint, and picture it as an actual object.  I am not nor will I ever be a mechanically-    inclined person, but today it seemed not to matter.  I built entire houses out of thought,  being able to cross-section and dissect them with ease.   Even such complex instruments as jet engines could be effortlessly mentally re-constructed.  After playing in the sandbox that my brain had become for some time, I opened the back door and headed out onto the patio.
