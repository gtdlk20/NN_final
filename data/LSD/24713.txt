This didnt kick in immediatly so we wwent for another drop which we bought for Â£5. The trip began slowly, and we had a bit of fun. There were typical wall pulses and things, and we had a dance to the awesome psy trance that they were playing. At about 10 o'clock the organisers of the rave brought us a suger cube laced with the stuff, which i was reluctant to take at first, cos i didnt wanna push it. but once my friends had taken it, i felt i wanted to be on the same level as they were.
