30 minutes went by and I felt nothing yet.  Our party ventured inside and the cool air revived our bodies.  We walked all the way to the end of the tunnel.  Water dripped everywhere, bouncing off rocks above and splattering our faces.  I looked at my watch and it had been 45 minutes.  I remembered again taking acid and a strange feeling overcame me.  'How could I forget about eating acid?' I thought to myself.  I urged my friend to follow me back outside because the trip began to rise.  I reached the mouth of the tunnel and I was astonished at what I felt and saw at that moment.
