One of the big takeaways from the dining hall was that food was very bland.  I was reasonably hungry, but every bite that I took of my pizza was just really bad.  Again, the word I want to use here is 'disappointing' or 'upsetting'.  I think the big thing I need to communicate here is that substantially the reason why it was a bad experience was because I felt let down, like it failed my expectations.  I had had pizza before and loved it Â– I love pizza!  This time the pizza was bland and chewing was a huge chore.  It upset me that the pizza was not tasting and feeling good like I had always known it to do.
