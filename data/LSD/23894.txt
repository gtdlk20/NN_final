After that the strangers there became nothing more than symbols of my emotions. I became fixated on the fire, then stuck my face very close to the burning wood. My emotions then proceeded to pull me away, I then began to try to get past them using every movement I could think. I would get past one then another would stop me. I cant remember how long I tried for, but I eventually ended up in this circular parking lot with many people.
