The nighttime part of the trip was the hardest. The shadows on my windows transformed into monsters. (I had been waiting for a visual all day, and this was what I got!) Some of them looked like skeletons. I thought I was going to die. I kept thinking that maybe I should leave a note for my mom and apoligize to her. I wanted to tell her that I loved her. I was really starting to panic. This was very scary and at one point I wanted to start crying. I did eventually calm myself down, but this took about an hour. Eventually, I did fall asleep. It was about 3 a.m. but it finally happened.
