Let me tell you something really fast, in my town, 5000 people 60 miles away from any other 'populated' town, you get a pretty good idea of anything that comes around, what I mean by that is the speed, coke, weed, and acid are almost always the same quality as the last time give or take a little bit. The acid that came to town went like this: 1 hit= body high, 2 hits= mild trip, 3 hits= heavy trip and  4 hits= not fun anymore. This is how it had been for years, this is the way it is now. But on that fateful day, the exception that proved the rule came into play.
