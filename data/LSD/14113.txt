T=19:30: my roommate came out and we talked about society and the economy and experience for 3 hours.  I was astonished at how much was arbitrary, how much was a mere mathematical or biological/evolutionary or social consequence of something else arbitrary that had occurred before it.  This permeated discussions of economics, politics, business, finance, career development, recent scientific discoveries e.g. about exoplanets, social dynamics and sociology, etc.  I felt able to reexamine the world from a broader and less parochial perspective.  I kept watching and wondering if I would relapse or start seeing visual trails again, like I had read that people sometimes could.  I felt a bit unsteady.  For some reason I was better at making eye contact than I usually am; I decided that there was no reason why I shouldn't, and that old habits and anxieties need not dictate the future.  I admit I was a bit worried about suddenly relapsing into incurable insanity like some government propaganda psychedelic horror story, but nothing whatsoever happened and I was fine.  By the end of the discussion I felt great that I had engaged with someone intellectually so broadly.  Over the past couple of months we had only rarely spoken at length with one another, and usually about narrower subjects.
