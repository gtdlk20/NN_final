The hour FINALLY ended and we got up out of our chairs and somebody flicked on the lights. JESUS CHRIST I'M TRIPPING! Everything looks NUTS! I stand up and try to keep my cool. I picked up my backpack and walked to the back of the room to chill near the door until class ended. The teacher was saying something but I was definitely ignoring it. Apparently she had said that she had candy for all of her students because it was Halloween (I found out only moments later). I picked out some Smarties from a bag of candy she had for us. I ate them all quickly and began to exit the room. I saw one of my friends dressed up as Waldo (you know? From the Where's Waldo books?) and I began to laugh out loud. It was even funnier to me because he knew I was tripping. I walked out the door and went quickly down the stairs like a robot to Wilderness Survival class (where I had my insightful visions).
