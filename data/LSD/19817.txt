Being veterans day I watched a war movie with my roommate which was mentally very intense in terms of how vivid and lifelike it was, but I experienced no feeling of terror.  I found it difficult to sleep at about one a.m. as I was still experiencing visuals.  I layed there in my bed for another hour or so tossing and turning before I fell asleep.  Unfortunately I had to work bright and early the next morning, and with my alarm at five a.m. sharp I awoke to find I was still experiencing full visuals.  My only point of reference is that I was still tripping harder than I had on any other trip.  At work I experienced feelings of disorientation, and confusion along with difficulty concentrating. Visuals had subsided by nine a.m. and my body still felt lifted until aproximately noon.  I was told the type of acid I had was called silver surfer, but I cant verify this.  I appologize for any unuseful information included. If possible I would be interested in finding out approximately how much I had.
