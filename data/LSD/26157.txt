I was stoked to do acid for the first time and I was hyped for spring break, I chose my room as the place to trip. I took one tablet of 200 μg LSD the day I got out of school for spring break. I let the paper sit on my tongue for about 30 minutes and then I chewed it up and swallowed it. It was around 8:30 pm and I kept looking in the mirror to see if my eyes were dilated, they werent. I kept waiting as I layed in my bed. I cant remember whether I was meditating as I waiting for it to kick in or what.
