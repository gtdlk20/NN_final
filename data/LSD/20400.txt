T+?: (what I think is happening): snap out of blackout, standing in parking lot of venue, next to a police car, with the rear door open, and man who looks like a police officer standing next to me. My vision is only about 50% right now because when I try to focus on his face it melts and slides off his chin. I hear him say 'get in the car'. I say 'am I under arrest'. I hear 'yes, get in'. WE HAVE JUST LOST CABIN PRESSURE. Here begins a nightmare of old bad dreams and embarrasing moments when I felt most vulnerable, all of these come floating back to me at once at blinding speed, each with sharp clarity. I'm riding in the back of a police car, talking to my mom on a cell phone the officer gave me. For some reason, I feel it necessary to repeat over and over again my vital information (name, birthdate, address, phone number, etc.) Into the cell  phone. ..black out.. Wake up, I'm at home on my couch, my friends are passed out on my floor and bed, and I feel like total dogshit.
