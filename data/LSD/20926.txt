Victor had a true bad trip. We had to call his brother, who arrived and brought us all down to his house five minutes away. We watched 'the big lebowski' and gradually Victor came back to us. He grabbed my leg and said 'douglas is that you? are you really there, right now?' i assured him that i was and he laughed out of sheer relief. we stayed  for a little longer and then made our way back to Victor's house to collapse from fatigue. At 12.30pm saturday i awoke and went home still in a daze. I went back to sleep.
