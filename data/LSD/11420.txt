Yeah, the cab is here.  We walked towards the van, waving it down.  When it stops, we realize it wasn't a cab, it was a mom with a carload of kids inside.  Boy, she must have thought we were loopy.  I am discouraged once again.  The next car that came was in fact the cab.  We got in and looked at the strange looking man about to take our lives into his hands.  He never said a word to us.  It was like he sensed our energy or something.  Going up and down hills felt like a roller coaster ride, hearing all of the creaks and cracks inside the car, with the radio on so low, but yet it was like we were at a concert.  Stop lights stayed red for an eternity, watching 500,000 cars in cross traffic going by.  It was hard to make out where we were even though I've lived here for 12 years.
