Anyway, we left our cars, and climbed a rock formation which has a car underpass under it, and overlooks the river. The lights reflected off the water twinkling with the currents, providing some real good eye candy. Anyway, we sat up there and smoked a bowl or two, and were watching the night sky, wondering where our buddies were, (and I was paranoid about getting mugged, even though we had gone there a lot before) when we noticed what the clouds were doing. Even though it was dark out, we could see the clouds and they were forming right before our eyes. I have seen this once before straight, but it was nothing like this...on acid, they kept forming cartoony shapes, like the Escher dragons biti ng each other's tails, etc., etc. Extremely intense.
