Overall, acid and mushrooms simply do not compare. They are two very different drugs. With mush, everything agrees. With acid, it seems everything is up in the air. With mushrooms you can just chill and it can be fun. With acid, you need to be moving, seeing new things, thinking new thoughts, for it to really work out well.
