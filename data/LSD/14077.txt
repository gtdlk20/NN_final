T=3:20: I began seeing psychedelic patterns when I closed my eyes.  Round paisley 4-way-symmetric patterns, fern-like patterns, 2-tone paper-cut-artwork patterns.  They seemed to have a recursive or fractal structure.  They zoomed inward and always resembled themselves.  Every 30 seconds or so they would 'reset'.  I opened my eyes and checked the time on my phone.  The visual trails were incredibly intense.  The home screen looked like something from a futuristic movie or video game, with trails sliding off the graphics like white angular fading vapors or sparks.  Beautiful.  I momentarily thought of messaging a few of my friends who had had extensive experience with psychedelics in the past but thought better of it.  I don't drunk-text so I certainly shouldn't trip-text.  I wasn't sure if I even remembered my password anyway.
