All of a sudden, all my thoughts, everything just made perfect sense. Everything seemed so right, and I was thinking that this was how it should always be. J was holding his baby niece for what seemed like a long time, but my sense of time was way distorted, anyway he and the baby just looked so content and peaceful. That added to my thoughts of how right everything was. W and I had to leave soon after that (we're still in high school, we had a lame curfew). On the way home, my sense of time got even more out of whack. The clock would say, like, 11:30 or something, for what felt like ten minutes. Then I'd look back what I thought was 2 minutes later and it'd be 20 minutes later. Before the tripping started, J and I told W to let us listen to 'It's On' by Korn when we started tripping. So me and W listened to it on the way home. It was awesome. If you've never heard it, it had kind of weird, fluctuating noises at the beginning.
