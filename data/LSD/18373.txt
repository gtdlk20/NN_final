The day of the trip begins with missing the first bus to our destination. We took the second bus and head off. When we reach there at around 2 pm we decide to drop 100 µg of tab each. In less than an hour she begins to feel the effects but I am not tripping. She says the clouds were frame-dragging and I wasnt able to notice it. I wait the next 15 minutes and during that she goes to a nearby public toilet when I decide to take a second tab of another 100 µg tab. We started walking after that and she is unaware that I have now a total of 200 µg in my system. In the next half an hour/ or forty minute that follows I start tripping.
