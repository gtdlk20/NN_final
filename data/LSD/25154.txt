It was a friday night and me and my friend, lets call him G, had decided to go and buy some acid from a guy we had met a couple of times at local death metal concerts we used to frequent. This guy used to scare the shit out of me, he had a massive inverted cross tattooed on his back along with other scary tats and scars from self mutilation all over his arms. We paid him only half the price we had paid for acid we had purchased previously from other people and I was a little sceptical. The acid he gave us was a blank blotter which he reffered to as a 'White Tile'. I thought sure mate you probibly cut it from note paper about ten minutes ago, but I wasn't going to argue with him.
