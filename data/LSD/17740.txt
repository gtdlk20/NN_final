When we got back to my mates house he still had one huge eye and all the photos of him as a child in the house had one eye. It wasnt like I focused on them and they morphed. It was instant. I could not get my head round this at all. He decided it was time for sleep and went to bed. I went for a shit and realised I was still a pathetic human, I looked in the mirror and my skin began to melt, all over, I looked at my hands and they did the same.  I tried to get to sleep and did manage eventually although I do not know how. As I was distracted completely by this shape on the wall like triangles but longer and more curved, three of them with thousands of eyes coming out of it. There was nothing on the wall but everytime I looked at it there was this thing doing shit. It started to freak me out. I smacked my head against the wall and as I looked accross it there was a street with lamps that were lit up stretching out into infinity with no horizon in sight. I put my head under the cover and lights flashed up every where it was like a miny city underneath the cover. I looked out this door that was left open and it was very tempting to go outside. My major regret of the night was not going outside because who knows what would have been waiting for me out there. But then again that could have been my downfall aswell. It will just be one of lifes misteries you know. Like why does order come from chaos.
