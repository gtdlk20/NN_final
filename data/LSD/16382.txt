This time I wanted to experience it all by myself with no friends around so that I could concentrate on the experience by 100% and have nothing to do with others disturbing my trip. I had got myself a good-sized piece of blotter acid a couple of weeks before I thought I was going to trip. I took the weekend free of work so I had the time to come down properly and clear my head off the possible weird thoughts and paranoia there would come and had bought myself some potato chips and candies to eat during the night if I felt hungry and an energy drink to drink if I started to feel too tired.
