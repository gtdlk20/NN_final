11pm: I was in front of my computer, I began to see all the colours of the rainbow then time had no meaning. I became aware that I was 23 years earlier in side my mother's womb and in 70 years at the most I would be dead and buried. What is the significance of 70 years when 70 years from now, there will be only the past and no future. I felt that there was nothing after life, we are only mammals ant that thought was horrible. I always thought that there was life after death and that's what is beautiful. But now I realized the opposite. There is nothing, we are only a bunch of chemicals and we will get dissolved into nature. Just as there was no I before 23 years ago, there will be no I after I die.
