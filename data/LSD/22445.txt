Apparently I kept on playing the same song over and over again, and this song also became one of my pillars, my friend whom I was tripping with was also another pillar, and my other friend whom had taken the same amount as me was another pillar.  I believe I had 4 pillars total, which was totally necessary because if I didnt have these people I would have lost my mind.  I had no concept of size, walking was impossible, I moved maybe 3  4 feet during that entire 8 hours that we were located at the tripping spot, but to me it felt like miles.  One of my friends was sitting at the same spot for an entire 8 hours, and I should have joined him, because he had the most incredible view of the city beneath us, the sky, and the landscape.
