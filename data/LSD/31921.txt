At about 5 Oclock AM, the effects were still very stong,  but something began to become strange.  I was the only one awake at this point, and I was now just sitting and staring into space and thinking.  And thses thoughts kept coming into my head. As I looked around the room, I see all these people, just passed out from a night of doing drugs and partying, and I looked at myself, and I felt this overwhelming sadness, I felt like nothing more that a junkie, a knew that thats all I was, all I am.
