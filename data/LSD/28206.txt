We started by watching the Beatles classic 'Yellow Submarine'. Amazing, we had fun just lying on the floor and watching all the crazy things in that movie. But since I was on the floor all it took was a slight uncomfortable moment to make me want to constantly move around. Eventually we became restless and went on a nature walk. We walked to a small area near by, void of people. Stood around a sewer grate, watching it, some of us first trippers were paranoid about what people would think if they saw us.
