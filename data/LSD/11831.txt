When I took this drug, I took it because I wanted to change my life.  When I was a child I was badly abused by my best friend.  When I came to college, I was in many ways a person deeply handicapped.  I was painfully shy and struggled to talk to strangers.  I was extremely apathetic and I rarely did my homework.  I had no experience with intimacy.  These were all of the things I believed about myself at that time.
