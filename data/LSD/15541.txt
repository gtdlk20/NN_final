My mum did come home within that hour and came straight to see me and who I had over, I just said I was very hungover and she went away and didnt bother us anymore. I was lucky she didnt ask too many questions as I would be unable to provide much of a coherent answer. Another hour went by and the three of us just continued to chill out as we had been doing afternoon. Then almost as quickly as I had realised that I was tripping, I felt extremely spacy but sober and like my brain had just run a marathon. Suddenly I was capable of conversing without my consciousness deserting me. I could walk straight and the room stopped rotating. The drug was far from gone but it never returned as it did earlier that day. Surfaces still swam when stared at and the Asian script was still in full view but the high was just fun now, not too intense.
