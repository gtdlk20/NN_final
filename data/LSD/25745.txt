We went back to the park a few times, nothing too weird happened, colors changing and shit being weird, the usual. Then it was 10:30 pm, when we had to go home. We had already agreed not to drive, and we left the car back at my place and took the bus to my girls in the morning, but now we had To go back. The bus we took earlier was not running any more. It was 40 degrees Fahrenheit outside. It was raining. I was on acid. So we start our journey to the train, cold and wet at balls. We get to the train station and my experienced friend says 'gotta take a piss Brb' so he jumps the train tracks to god knows where to go piss. He gets back like 30 seconds before the train gets there, that made me nervous. We take the train to a transit center, then wait for THIRTY MINUTES at MIDNIGHT, TWENTY FEET FROM COPS, while its raining and cold. Some homeless people try to finagle us out of our money, but they give up eventually. That was the longest thirty minutes of my life. Eventually we get on the correct bus and get back to my house, where it took me like an hour to fall asleep.
