So we are walking around when we get to a clearing in the middle of the forest and there are really tall wooden poles sticking out of the ground with cables anchoring them to the ground. On the end, the cables have little plastic sheaths. Everyone took turns grabbing them and throwing them as far as the could up the cable to see who could get theirs the farthest. Once we got bored from this we kept walking until we found two wooden poles with wooden slats between them suspended by rope. Not unlike a ladder. The first rung was about 8 or 9 feet off the ground and I wanted to try to climb it. I jumped on the first rung and was hanging when my friend pushes me causing me to fall on the ground. In the process I kneed myself in the nose (this is important later). My nose starts to bleed and hurts pretty bad, but I didn't want it to ruin my trip so I didn't dwell on it.
