I was completely fine until six oÂ’clock, when I started to feel it coming on. I felt dizzy, disoriented, and confused. Colors were wrong, somehow. Another hour passed and I was very, very deep into my trip. Objects were so disoriented and light was everywhere. Everything seemed to be covered with a beautiful flowery, paisley print. When the car was stopped, I became panicked because I felt s though it was floating away, like a boat. I urged the driver to put the emergency brake on, or we would float down the street and into traffic. I put my seat belt on and held on to the sides of the car. After this fear passed, it was time to go back to my house. My friends and I sat in my room for a while. I was rather dazed and I could feel I was on the brink of a bad trip. Objects in my room were so strange and unfamiliar.
