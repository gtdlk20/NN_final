Now I'm an hour in, and I head outside for a cigarette. I'm starting to come to terms with how the chemical feels. I lay on the ground with music on and watch the stars slightly fall before me. I head inside and just chill while they watch videos and smoke dabs. Though I know trip sitters should be sober, I made this exception, seeing as I too had taken just 2 small dabs. The feeling now was almost strictly bodily, like I was completely sunk into my comfy chair. I make small talk with my close friend's brother. I have one more smoke and head into my friends basement at 3am.
