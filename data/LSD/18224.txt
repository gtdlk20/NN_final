I was so happy at this point, because I love tripping and this was an excellent start.  It was all interesting, and while it became intense, was never scary.  I thought, I wonder what music sounds like now?  I couldnt for the life of me find the CD I had created on my computer and I had left the physical CD in my dads car, but it was no matter because I just played it on my computers library- Hurts Rapture.  And it did have me enraptured- music sounded so good, like way different and being experienced on more levels, it felt like.  Like it was a direct link to my soul.  Or maybe one of those movies like Constantine where time stops and the protagonist is in hell, but this was heaven.
