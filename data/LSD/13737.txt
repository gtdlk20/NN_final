This is where it really gets intense (in a good way).  Sophia, the friend that opened the door, runs a hair salon out of her basement.  There are lots of mirrors and haircutting apparutus filling this space...what a treat!!  I immediately became fascinated with the old-time 1950s hairdryers she had positioned above each chair (you know the kind...looks like a helmet), I sat in a chair and pulled on of these things down over my head and staring looking up into it, each hole in this thing was flowing with color, nothing tangible, just color, lots and lots of colors.  Hues of blue and red, purple and orange that I had never seen before.  Intense visuals!  I tried to explain to Sophia, she just looked at me, laughed and told me to enjoy all the sights, she would stay close. I continued to explore the combs, brushes, powders and sprays (smells good).  Too much fun...
