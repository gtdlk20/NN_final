I definitely think that that freakout was one of the best things that could have happened. Back when Summer confessed to me that she didnt want to trip on Saturday, she was particularly shaken, which brought me to have negative feelings regarding the Seth situation. Releasing all of my stress and anger put me in one of the best mental places for the trip, and I felt powerful and reinvigorated. I ran some errands throughout the day, and met Summer around 7 PM. We went to our respective homes, so that she could pick up the Tic Tac box, and change into more comfortable clothes. On our way back to Diannas, we saw Frey and Louise, and they told us they were going to swing by later, which I was happy and excited about.
