Now, as I was right around the end of my peak, I realized that this theory had to be right.  Exlpain it as god or call it the universe, do whatever you like.  Terms don't matter, we're all talking about the same thing.  I'm not saying everyone's right.  More like everyone's about the same amount wrong, so there is no reason to worry.  We will catch tinny little glimpses of whatever we are 'really' dealing with and that's all we need, even the biggest glimpse we'll get is ultimately tiny and that's okay.  Some of us will seek and others will be happy with what they have.  That's fine.  People, including me, will continue to argue and fight about what they believe to be true.  It's okay.  It's fine.  It's all alright.  This was of course, a very comforting revelation.  It's okay.  And I realized that this was the moment I'd searched for all my life.
