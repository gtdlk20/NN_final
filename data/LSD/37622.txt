We smoked, and came back to my friends house. I was tripping nicely. We put on floyd. This would be one of my most insane experiances ever. After a while I was really getting into the floyd and they re-went out to smoke again. I opted to stay and listen to floyd in the warmth...... by myself. Big mistake/but crazy journey. After a while i was completely swallowed by the floyd and I was bugging, I never felt so aware or able to control reality. The walls were moving, the music was part of me and went exactly with it.
