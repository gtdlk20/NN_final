Near the end of the day (sometime around midnight) E wanted to go.  She had to drop me back off at my house considering she was the only way I would get back home.  I went back home reluctantly because at that point and time I still wanted to be with my friends and try and figure it all out.  Although I didnÂ’t express my reluctance I still was.  When I got home I greeted my parents real quick and headed up stairs with my dog.  When I got upstairs I started petting my dog and received only love back.  It was a good feeling to have something there that would just give you love back I started petting my dog and received only love back.  It was a good feeling to have something there that would just give you love back as long and I just petted it.
