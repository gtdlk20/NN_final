and that's the point, really.  to change your life and the way you see reality.  to expand.  not just for one insane evening, but for the rest of your life.  so i would recommend giving it a shot.  try a couple of subtle trips.  meditate, if you're so inclined.  slowly it will seep into your daily life and you'll be capable of that kind of thought all the time.  good luck.
