Timing: I originally didn't write a timeline, because I didn't focus on it during the trip and it wasn't of great importance to me. However, as I'm turning this into a report, I will try to estimate because it might be important for some readers. but note that ALL TIME ESTIMATES ARE VERY ROUGH AND MIGHT BE COMPLETELY OFF!
