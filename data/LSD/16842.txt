We had dropped the acid at about 8:00 pm, they were on the large sweet-tart rolls that have the dimple in them.  Each one had two doses on them, and always anxious to start the fun, we were getting disappointed after about an hour with no effect.  So after about an hour had passed, we took another.  In retrospect, I think this may have been a big mistake, because as the night progressed, I can only say I was taken to a place that living humans shouldn't visit.
