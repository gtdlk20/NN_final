Throughout the night I was smoking tobacco in my joints, using more and more as I started to run out of weed. LSD always gives me the ability to separate feelings and experiences. For example, if I am listening to music I would hear each instrument separately at the same time. So when I was smoking tobacco I would feel the relaxation that it brings me but also I would feel the tar entering my body and clogging up my throat and lungs, I would remember that I hate the taste of tobacco bringing me to the conclusion that it is not worth smoking it.
