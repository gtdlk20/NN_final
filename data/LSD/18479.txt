We had ample provisions, munchies, oj, alcohol, a little pot, blacklight, various colored lightbulbs, and good music.  We were all comfortable with each other and the surroundings were pretty cool.  Me and S had a two bedroom apartment in a complex perfect for tripping.  Basically it's renovated gov. housing painted in purples, oranges, reds, yellows, and other bright colors in odd patterns with colored flood lights everywhere...cool.
