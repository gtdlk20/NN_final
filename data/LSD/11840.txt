This was an extraordinary experience, really beyond my ability to rationalize or make sense of, and I immediately told Arthur I thought we should just go back to my dorm and relax for a while.  When we got back to my dorm, the first thing I noticed was how heavily distorted my vision was.  My hallway looked like a funhouse, as if it were twisted into a spiral.  As best I could, I navigated us to my room and maneuvered inside.
