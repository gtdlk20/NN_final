On a Friday it came to my attention that a few friends (a female we will call C, a male named A, and another male named J) had found a hook-up for liquid acid. 'Holy shit!!!' I thought. I'd run into acid only once before this in my drug taking history and it was crappy (and very expensive, $10 a hit) blotter. This shit turned out to be $5 a hit and apparently very potent. All my friends went and dosed at about 12:30 pm, I did not as I had no money at the time. After they came back, 2 hours or so later, they said it was soooo intense and they needed to be alone. So I decided to go get money and dose myself. Everyone who had tripped had done 2 hits maximum, stupidly I thought I'd do 4.
