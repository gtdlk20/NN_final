3:45: Before going home I sit on a rock and meditate on things, in general.  Then I go home.  No one is there so I'm cool.  I watch Dark City and it blows my mind.  I relate it to everyday life.  I get lost in it and when it is over I feel sad.  Now the hallucinations are everywhere and I feel like I'm in a kaleidescope.  I turn on VH1 and watch the 100 greatest Rock and Roll Artists.  I have a paranoid thought that maybe all old 70's bands did acid and got to the same level of tripping as I am in right now.  I start to appreciate all the artists I see and other things about them.
