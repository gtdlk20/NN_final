'Lets go to the pond.' I suggested.  A quick walk through the woods would get us to our destination, a shining mirage of paradise in the moonlit night.  I visualized the pond. I saw the bright moon shining on the water, its sandy, beach-like shore (only on one side of the lake), and benches on the sand to relax on.  I smiled. 'Let's go.' We skipped over to D's care and extracted a few bowls of cannabis from his bag and headed blindly into the woods. We made our way through the woods, and upon doing this I noticed patterns on everything, and forming out of everything.  The leaves on the ground formed patterns, and the clouds in the sky formed patterns.  It was amazing.  I was busy staring at the pattern, and we got there quicker than I expected.
