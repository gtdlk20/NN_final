When it kicked in we decided to roll up a blunt on his back patio. The broken up bud was moving all over the plate so it was hard to 'catch it' to begin rolling. Finally after like 30 minutes I finished it and after a few puffs I passed it to N and looked over at his yard. It was autumn so his trees were without leaves and very tall and with skinny branches...and the second I look over at them the acid just hits me and the tree is like waving out of control, its branches swirling and what not. That was the start of the real experience which was around 8:30 and I took the 2 other hits and realized how serious but incredible the drug can be. The weed kind of helped to make it kick in.
