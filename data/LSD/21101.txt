I was 16 at the time of this experience. I had my friend Pete over to my house for a night of tripping on acid. In the morning we picked up 2 microdots, which we were told contained 500ug of LSD. This number didn't mean much to us, and we had had previous experiences with a weaker strength of microdot orally. Tonight, we decided that we would like to heighten the trip by insufflating the microdots.
