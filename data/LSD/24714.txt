It was strange at first becaus eit was my mates first experience with psychedelics, or any other drugs for that matter, and i felt i had the responcibility to look after her. So i sat with her in our dorm for alot of the time, talking and walking around, it was perfect, she was fine and we both said alot of things that we needed to say, i was happy here. This was what i wanted from my trip, to really sort out my head cos i was in a bad way with alcoholism, and acid alwys gives you the thinking you need to tackle your problems in the non-psychedelic realm. And it helped her i think too. We bonded that night, we went around the castle grounds and got frightened, inspired, wiser and became better friends for going through this together.
