7:30 PM - At last, we pack up and head back to Steves house. On the way out of the woods, we pass a small group of kids about our age. Only a few minutes ago, I had jokingly asked my friends, Whats the proper etiquette if you pass another hiker and youre on acid? I greet the kids, but my words feel empty and awkward. None of us speaks for a minute after passing the other group, then, when we are out of earshot, all of us burst out laughing. I hope I dont have to encounter any more strangers.
