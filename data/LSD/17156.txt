I turned and faced the direction of the water (which is about two to three hundred yards away from camp) and noticed how dark it really was. I took one long drag off my cigarette and received my first lsd induced visual; as I moved the cig away from my face I could distinctly the glow of the cherry and my hand move in slow motion. Almost like a brush stroke out of a painting, or as if someone had filmed this action and removed many of the frames to slow it down. This did not startle me, but produced an intense feeling of excitement. I took one last look at camp and had an urge to tell everyone what I just saw, but knew that I could not do it justice. Instead, I struck out for the water.
