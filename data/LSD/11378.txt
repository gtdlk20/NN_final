Just another night of college. I was sitting upstairs in my room at my house reading some books for my Humanities class. I got the urge to just go ahead and take the acid that I had been saving for Thursday -- which was 6 sugar cubes, and probably about 2 hits of liquid that were the remains of the vial from my dealer.
