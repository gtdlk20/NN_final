I eventually made it to sleep, and when I woke the next day I was the happiest and most mentally serene Id been in my life.  Anything that would have normally been troubling my mind, preventing me from being happy and free right at the moment, was gone!  This state of mental tranquility and happiness lasted for a few days, and slowly faded as new issues settled back into my subconscious.  My true self was somewhat tempered as time passed, but Ive made a conscious effort to not let it become completely buried.  A few months later this experience spawned an interest in Buddhism, which Ive taken to practicing, as a way of training my mind.  I firmly believe that through meditation the mental tranquility that I attained during this experience can be cultivated and continued, without the aid of any drug.  LSD just showed me that it was possible and that the key to happiness in this world lies in our minds.
