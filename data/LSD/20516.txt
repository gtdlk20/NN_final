While we were sitting there in what was pretty much just nature and darkness expect for a few houses we started playing Led Zeppelin and weird trippy Jefferson Airplane songs like Chusingura. At one point I think we may have played Across the Universe again I dont know but I remember closing my eyes and feeling and seeing these lovely orbicular colorful vibrating orbs come towards my being and vibrating around my body and doing SOMETHING to me mentally. I dont know what it was it kinda felt like a cleansing and it felt very comfortable and soothing and made me happy and I started to laugh and told my friend because we both closed our eyes at the same time I forgot to say and I was like whoa I feel like that did something to me (closing my eyes) and I thought he would understand but he was like What? What do you mean that did something to you? he sounded kind of worried like it was something bad and I cant remember if I explained it to him or just said nevermind haha but ya I close my eyes again and start seeing angular spikes. I read on Wikipedia one time that a lot of people see 'angular spikes on mescaline so this kind of reminded me of that whole deal. It was also reminiscent of a certain scene in the movie Suspiria.
