I didn't know much about acid or what to expect. That was probably for the best. Kevin just said it would make me laugh and I would see some cool stuff. Sounded good to me. What could possibly go wrong? He said it would take about 30 minutes to an hour to kick in. It was about a 40 minute ride to the arena, so I figured we'd arrive, find our seats with my dad and then Kevin and I could wander around the arena just as it was kicking in. No big deal, right? I had no idea what was in store.
