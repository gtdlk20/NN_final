The buddy who smoke a bowl with me is playing guitar hero so I sit and watch him for a while. Due to the weird and almost traumatic experiece I am not really paying attention to the screen but from what I remember the colors were amaand moving very rapidly and stretching out into space. It's nearing the end of the party where everyone is passed out and A is still awake along with 2 others. Ally and I decide to walk over the conversation. I am still only saying to my self 'what the fuck' or 'what is going on' and everyone decides to ignore me. Ally is almost at the end of her trip and I'm just finished with my peak, but was just in awe of what just happened I can't stop thinking about if everything is fucked or I am. I start thinking that I'm insane, but I keep it to myself because I don't want others to think that I think that I might be insane.
