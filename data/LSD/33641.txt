Me, S, and C have now all made our way back to the beach where we this time walk to a very secluded area to smoke another blunt.  After the 3d ride we got lockers and put our hoodies away.  At this point my jean pockets are extremely full and I am feeling very overwhelmed wanting to get my hoody back as soon as possible.  After smoking the blunt that C rolled earlier in the car I am unsatisfied and want a nice blunt to smoke.  C finds a new map lying in the sand and hands it to me in attempt to redeem himself for earlier.  I use the map as a tray and roll a blunt.  I then fold up the remaining pot inside the map, not realizing that I could have used it to find my way to rides. 	We smoke the second blunt and this time feel much more paranoid.  Many people are staring at us and this time I don't feel happy.  The sky is starting to get darker and a mood of sadness sets into the park.
