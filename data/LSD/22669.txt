At another stage I found myself in the past surrounded by a bunch of those ancient greek philosophers and watching the world being formed out of atoms. Then I found myself in what I can only discribe as a victorian classroom sitting at an old desk and looking at a blackboard that had some kind of formula written on it and I had an overwhelming feeling of the world being made out of wood and everything being all creaky. And in what seemed to be a dungeon where a guy was strapped into a chair and two guys in white coats were saying that he was mad and the guy was thinking to himself if they were experiencing what I am experiencing they wouldnt be thinking I am mad. There was something about being in outer space as well where I was watching what seemed to be a galaxy of stars swirling about and in the motions of the stars I could see things that happened on earth like a man and a woman making love.
