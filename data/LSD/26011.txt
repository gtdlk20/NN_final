Some time past partying and killing time we came to another stage sitting on the grass, at this point I fairly sore and was laying up and down looking at the clouds and feeling the grass, the clouds were making  triangle patterns into each other. Also there was another moment where I sat up having a cigarette with my eyes closed hallucinating the warmth of the sun made me feel like a golden orb of some sort. The moment past we danced some more seen more people walked around did plenty of things. My trip started to settle a bit and when we were standing at the back of the stage I could see the clouds all flare up like in a time lapse in a big circle all around the stage. It was magical. Over time my trip settled and I could have conversations more and just function normally.
