We walked back up the hill towards the house and sat down somewhere in between our journey. As we sat around staring at the visuals, my friends seemed to be pulling me down from the depth of my trip talking about T.V. shows and video games, the type of things that become so insignificant under the influence of psychedelics in my opinion. LSD to me offers an experience to accept and allows me to 'just be', Just a window to spontaneity.  We got back to the house, collected some warm clothes, and got ready to go for another walk up a steep hill and this is where they began falling into the mental loops that LSD inspires, which had also been amplified by the weed.
