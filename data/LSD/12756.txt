We went back to Delyriem's room, and laid in his loft bed, just laughing about everything.  We must have sat there laughing for about an hour, I honestly have no clue what we were talking about, but everything was hilarious.  I remember saying things about having two voices, laughing voice and normal voice, because our voices sounded very strange when we were laughing constantly.  I was getting some visuals but not as intense as I'd had on mushrooms. We watched the ceiling, the walls, and some optical illusions on his computer.  His roommate was in the room, and he knew we were tripping, but then our friend ML came in, who didn't know either of us had done drugs. We tried to act as normal as we could but I could not stop laughing.  ML was talking a lot about strange things that Delyriem and I found hilarious, and I had been staring at an optical illusion for a while so her body was swimming around and her face was twisting and melting and I had to pretend that everything was normal. She kept walking in and out of the room and every time she left we would crack up again, for no reason at all.  Then she'd come in and we'd try to act normal.  I was still having a lot of fun.
