The ceiling fan had one red L.E.D. light attached to each of the blades.  However, when the strobe light have seemed to stop the fan, the blades stood motionless and wavingly pointed to the floor and drifted back up again.  To each still and bending fan blade three red planetlike orbs with clouds spewing off of them rotated and circled each fan blade.  By this time I felt I chould maybe close my eyes....this is getting to be a bit more than I had anticipated.
