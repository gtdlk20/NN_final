I closed my eyes and eye could visualise my thought patterns flowing freely from thought to thought, I could see if anything bad happened it would make a blockage in my flow of thought and it would keep building up and building up and cause me to get bogged down on that individual bad thought, I just had to learn to 'let it all go' so to speak. I felt as if I had a major break-through and I was just about to tell everybody about it but had to restrain myself 'what the hell would everyone think if I blurted out all the shit thats been going through my head for the last god-knows-how-long, ill be a goddamn laughing stock, well maybe..eh? Who are these people? I cant remember any of petes flatmates names..' looked over at dave at man, he was having a real bad one, shit, he looked so down I couldn't believe it..hmm he would be the one that I would save, by passing on my new found knowledge of LSD I would turn his bad trip to a good one just like I did, time to talk... 'Err we are going out for a bit, umm come on...jack and d..dd..ave'
