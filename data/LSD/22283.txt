Turning my back for a moment to the sea, I headed into the shade of the trees, into the heart of our camp.  All the bags and other paraphernalia we had deposited there instantly transformed into glowing jewels of ruby red, emerald green, blue sapphire and colours that were radiating their sweet luscious fruity taste with such intensity that I was stunned into an inanely smiling silence.  Incidentally as I stood up to walk, I  could feel my body plunging down into the ground and back up again, like I was suspended on a huge bungee-jump cord.
