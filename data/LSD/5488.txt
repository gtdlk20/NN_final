I awoke the next morning with a sense of exultation, I felt like I'd lived eons and seen things that no one else would ever see.  The relief of stress was enormous, and for a few months the minor problems we all have every day failed to dampen my new found spirits.  It has affected me in more ways that I can put into words, but overall I'm a much more tolerant person, and I like to think of myself as being more understanding.  I feel as if the mystery has returned to my life, and with it my will to continue moving forward.  After all, there's no telling what might be around the next bend, and whether or not it'll be able to top that day as the most thrilling and awe-inspiring of my life.
