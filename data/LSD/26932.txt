At around 6:30, I started getting the familiar queasiness in my stomach, but decided not to tell my friends yet. I went into the bathroom and looked at my pupils, and they were really big by this time. We wandered around a while, and they had a cigarette, before we decided to walk to our high school football game. We paid, went in, and sat down with some of my other friends. I immediately noticed the full moon, and the clouds that sometimes covered it.
