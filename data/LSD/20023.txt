I was diging into the ground with my bare hands, the smell of the moist black dirt was beautiful. Someone picked me up, and put me on thier shoulder. I couldn't speak so I just kicked, I feel bad now cause I did hit someone. They dropped me and I belived for some reason that I was 'doomed', I reached in my pocket without thought. I pulled out my keys and slid them across my throat. Luckily they didn't even scratch.
