This substance is made for people who can easily watch life go by without worrying or putting in maximum conscious effort. I see now why meditation is an important skill to have. Overall this was a pleasant and somewhat enlightening experience. Though the comedown the day after is difficult to overcome. Still slight feelings of disconnection and numbness but definitely a more open mind and a better acceptance of my outer and inner universe; especially now after puffing some grass.
