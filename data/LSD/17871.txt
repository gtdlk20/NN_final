Also a reminder, this entire time the visuals were literally everywhere still, they went on for hours and hours. At times youd feel the need to close your eyes to give them a rest as its exhausting, your eyes feel tired from all the stimulus, but there is no rest. Even with your eyes closed you see colors, and shapes, and fractal patterns dancing in the darkness of your eyelids. So out of breath from seeing things, is how we put it. You feel exhausted mentally, physically, and emotionally from such an experience.
