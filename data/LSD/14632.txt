My breathing feels almost circular - as if I am not quite getting enough breath but never quite breathless enough to justify stopping. Sometimes I can be harsh on myself, often not harsh enough. This is a time that calls for the latter, and I dont give myself an inch. I know Im not setting any records with my time, but Im going to cross that damn line as fast as I possibly can. I was obese only two years ago and couldnt run sustained for more than 2 minutes - this is fucking huge for me and Im not going to allow the other me - the lazy, underachieving, Netflix binge-watching me to dictate shit now.
