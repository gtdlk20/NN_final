It's been about eight years since I last took any form of hallucinogen , at this time I cannot say whether I ever will again.  I tend to have the opinion that whatever path you take in life, one way or another we all reach the same conclusion and our experience then takes us across the divide to places where we won't tell the living our tales.  Anyway, I digress.
