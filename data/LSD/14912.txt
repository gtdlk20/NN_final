5 hours in: Peaking very hard still, I was exhausted from playing the piano, so I sat down on the couch in Drew's room and began smoking a cigarette. I closed my eyes. I saw nothing but darkness and yet there was some sort of pattern to the blackness, as if there were spider's threads running horizontally and vertically everywhere, but it was barely noticeable. I was floating in this gentle 'fabric' and I was in DEEP space. I mean I was doing some kind of HEAVY astral travelling. I was FAR, FAR away, from planet Earth, and I could feel God speaking to me. I was FAR, FAR away, from planet Earth, and I could feel God speaking to me. I didn't hear words, but rather felt them, and God told me that everything was LOVE. There was nothing else, just love and perfection. I felt loved by God and the universe, and He revealed all the secrets of the universe to me. All I had to do was float there and become wise and all knowing. All conflict that had ever existed in me or outside of me just melted away, and I was a super-being of pure consciousness, and my body disintegrated into the ether.
