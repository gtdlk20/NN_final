In London the all night cabs are driven by dodgy people with their own cars.  It suddenly dawned on me that we could be taken advantage of here.  None of us would be able to put up a struggle.  I didn't even know where the hell I was let alone put my fists up.  My door was opened and a man started shouting.  This was it, I thought.  We're gonna get mugged and I'm supposed to be the tougher one.  I started laughing.  As it turned out the guy thought our driver was taking his fare.  A few seconds later and we were off.  We stopped under a bridge briefly so that I could be sick out of the car.  George was putting it down to the effects of the Ether - again.
