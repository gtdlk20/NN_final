After over 30 hours tripping I had finally passed out. I woke up once and was still a bit confused. I wasn't tripping when I woke up again but the paranoid thoughts are very consuming. The second time I woke up it was with the sunrise and I knew the trip had worn away. I turned on Pink Floyd's 'Time' and cried with urgency and gratefulness.
