Now, I wasn't really seing crazy things as much, but I was so scared and nervous and paranoid they would figure out what was wrong. My friend kept trying to calm me down but I just started crying and couldn't stop. Then the nurse and the dean came back and they were like, what's the matter, are you okay? Why are you shaking so much? I said I just didn't feel well and that after my asthma attacks I start to shake because I get myself so worked up and scared, and that I would be fine and I wanted to go back to class. They said no and took me downstairs. They said my friend had to go to class, though. I really didn't want her to leave and started crying again. They took me to the office and made me call my mom.
