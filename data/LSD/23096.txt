I Looked in front of me. A large kid in a dark blue shirt. I mused that it looked bluer than all of the oceans in the world... I realized I was tripping, and giggled to myself about it. I looked up to the TV monitor. I don't know if you've watched the Dracula movie with Keanu Reeves, but its really sick and downright disgusting, especially on acid. Therefore, I was sort of uncomfortable. I kept looking at the backs of friend's shirts, watching the designs dance and move on their backs.
