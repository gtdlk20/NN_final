1745 - It begins I am the master of time I could see 24 seconds into the past and the future. I eat a steak that still tasted like steak had a wierd fuzzy texture. I was in a red and blue glitch world with the ability to control time. After I was done with my steak I was waving my fork around and there was a trail coming off of it and I named it bob the trail snake and with him I started wandering around my house. I drank 1/2 a coke and I threw that up but not my steak. The coke tasted like fucking dirt.
