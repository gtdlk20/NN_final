T: 16:00 I woke up as the sun was rising.  I got dressed and walked down to this AMAZING little beach where families were out with their kids and guys were fishing.  I felt rested, but very inward like I was still not ready to interact with other humans verbally, but being nearby was pleasantly reassuring.   I felt battered, but alert. After a while, W came by on his hoverboard thing.  We went back to his place and had a really nice breakfast, while he filled me in on what happened that I couldnt remember.
