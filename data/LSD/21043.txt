The first thing that I did subconsciously occurred in the limousine on the way to the afterparty.  The Limo was driving around a roundabout, the centripetal force holding me pressed against my seat.  There were lights flashing on the ground in the Limo, and very loud music was playing.  Everything was crazy, and the intensity of the dancing at Prom was fresh in my mind.  Lots of flashing colors and intense rushes of emotion were flowing through my sight and awareness.  Wooooooooooo!  It wasnt until after everyone in the Limo was looking at me did I realize what I had done.  I had just screamed at the top of my lungs Wooooooooooooo with my right hand/fist clenched, and raised high in the air.  I had no control over screaming; like I said, it wasnt until after I screamed and everyone was laughing at me that I realized I screamed in the first place.
