I do not regret taking LSD, but I always wonder if I would be a happier person without it.  I stopped talking to those friends and my cousin, as I realized how toxic they were using drugs for recreation so frequently while never achieving the dreams they always talk about.  Can't win all the time, I suppose.  Thank you for reading this, as this experience meant alot to me. I hope it can help others as well.
