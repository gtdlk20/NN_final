It was unbelievable. My body and mind are usually exhausted at the end of an intense trip, but for once I felt as though the acid had given me life and energy. Its been a few days since the trip and I still feel incredible! Its been very easy for me to integrate the experience into my life, which is surprising given how profound it was. It intrigued to me to think how impactful a positive psychedelic experience like mine could be on so many of the people I know that havent tried these drugs yet, but I can see why theyre so timid about it. For me, tripping feels like the most adult thing one can possibly do. Its heavy metal, its alien, and if one does it right, its the ultimate ecstasy.
