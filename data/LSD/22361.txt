At my friends house I had a sudden urge to go home and tell my mother I was trippin real hard on acid. I wanted to be home because it was the only safe place I knew. So I asked my friend to take me home. He replied that he would as soon as he finished bagging up the ounces. I really had to go home the urge was ridiculous. I said to him that I would call a cab so it would take me. He told me to wait five and he would take me straight home. I didnt agree with that I started grabbing the phone and trying to dial a cab. My friend grabbed the phone off me and hung it up. This happened about four times before I could not take it anymore. I stood up and started climbing out his window. When I was half way out my friend grabbed me and said ' man, wait two seconds and ill take you! ' I replied half-sticking out of his window ' You know when you have to go, well I gotta go '
