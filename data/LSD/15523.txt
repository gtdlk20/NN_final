Anyway after taking the dose and eating breakfast I headed up stairs, I started watching TV to fill in time as I knew I would have to wait a while for it to set in. After about 30mins I began to feel a slight change in thinking patterns but just assumed it to be my imagination at this stage. About 5 or 10mins after that, I began to notice little things changing, if I really started at my curtains I they would ripple slightly but nothing special at all. Throughout this time my stomach seemed very gassy and often made gurgling sounds so I could tell that it was being absorbed. Realising that it was just beginning to come on I turned off the lights, lay on my bed and put on interesting melodic music.
