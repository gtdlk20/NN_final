At about 6pm I was turning myself over again, but this time when I did it the pain in my back just about tripled.  Now, there was a small part of me that was really intrigued by all this, especially when I found I could feel the shooting pain all the way down my right leg (read: I could _feel_ my right leg).  But by now both M and I were really worried, and we tried to call all our friends that knew anything about muscules and massage but no one was home.  We contemplated taking me to the hospital but we didn't know how, since every movement made me cry out in pain.  So M got a cold pack out of the freezer and put it on one particularly nasty, spasming muscle.
