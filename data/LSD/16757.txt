Needless to say, this event took our trip and spun it 180 degrees.  We discussed how strange it was that we took this drug on impluse (which was unusual for us), and after wondering why, we went outside and this whole thing began to transpire.  We talked about how even though M was really high, he could not _not_ do anything, because when we got into our accident, people called 911 for us, people put out the fire we started, people dragged us up out of the ditch and saved us.  We ruminated that this night might be part of some cyclical karma and in another, parallel world, we had saved our own asses.
