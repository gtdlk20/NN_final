It was a spur of the moment decision to take acid, which I realize now is not something that you should do with psychedelics.  There was an enormous jazz festival at my school and my fiance Delyriem and I thought it would be incredible to watch a jazz concert while tripping.  I had listened to jazz on mushrooms before and found it to be hilarious, and so I imagined that it would be a similar experience on acid.  What I didn't take into account was the insane amount of stress in my life at the time, and although I know it's a bad idea to take psychedelics when stressed, I didn't really think about it.  I had tripped on mushrooms a few times, and had attempted to take acid twice but both times it turned out to be DOB and I didn't trip hard at all because the dose had been too small. We decided to split 3 doses in case it was DOB again, so at least we'd trip a little if it wasn't real acid.
