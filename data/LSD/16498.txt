Although I'm not convinced they were true flashbacks, I consistently, for weeks afterward, could sware occasionally that I was seeing something in my peripheral vision and turned to find nothing there.  This became more common after the subsequent experiences I had with a dissociative called DXM, though they subsided after I stoped using anything for a while.  But those are stories I'll come back to tell later.
