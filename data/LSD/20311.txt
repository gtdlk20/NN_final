A few months later me, my roommate and my friend Lee decided to take 8 hits of LSD.  We'd all done it before, but never more that 3-4 hits, this was something new to all of us.  We all woke up early that day, Lee and I both took 8, and Eric decided his mood was off so took 2.  We all made our way to brunch, talked to people and headed back to our rooms.  I was having a cigarette so I was finishing it outside when the initial body rush hit.  I went upstairs and saw Lee and Eric experiencing more or less the same thing.  We decided to go for a walk, so we all bundled up.  It was a warm winter day, but a winter day none the less.  While walking we all realized that we had become walking machines, our bodies whole existence became walking, and with my body, my mind became a walking machine as well.  I scanned for all possible paths, chose the one that would be the path of least resistance, and contracted the appropriate leg muscles to make that happen.  Suddenly my walking machines processor was shattered by a sight so unexpected that I shrieked (at least I think I did).  A llama farm.  Three llamas standing tall, one staring at each of us.  They where mirrors of us.  And if they where mirrors of us, we where mirrors of them, so we must be llamas.  With that dilemma solved we proceeded down the road.
