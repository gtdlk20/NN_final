'9'  It was a question, not a statement.  He then did the absolute stupidest thing that one can ever do to another while on a strong acid trip.  He said, 'Uh-oh.'  The beautiful reds and yellows of the room turned into a violent violet and deep blue with hues of shadows looming over me.  I was getting the fear.  I managed to ask him what Uh-oh meant in my newly found tongue.  His voice turned to static.  All I heard was garbled, muffled foreign language.  I again concentrated on the statement as much as I could.  It was like listening to Chinese on a cell phone, but I made him write it down.  All the page said was two things really big.  'Double dipped' and '18 hits'.  The 1 from the 18 slithered off the page.
