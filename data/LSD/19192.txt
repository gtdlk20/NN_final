I looked about the tent and it became a different place then a tent in Manchester, TN on the Bonnaroo campgrounds. It became an open field of tall grass swaying back and forth with many hills and a light blue sky. Slowly it became the tent again, everything was out of place and nothing felt quite right. I couldnt do anything but close my eyes and try to ignore it, when I closed my eyes though all I could see was a small cube of multicolored lights that said something in the middle, as I kept my eyes closed longer it got larger and larger. As it became larger it was very clear what it said: YOU ARE ON LSD in bold letters. Every time the colors changed I could feel each individual color pour into me but not my body into me, as in my soul. After what felt like years it went away, all I could see was black. I began to transcend  my body, I felt my body dissipating from me. I was my soul out of my body, racing through space, stars shooting past me, free beyond any way of describing it. I then transcended time and space, I reached total inner peace and connection with myself. At this point I believe that I was at a ++++ on the Shulgin Rating Scale. I dont remember anything that happened past this point, I passed out.
