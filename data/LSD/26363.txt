Sunrise came, and it was an incredible experience.  I put on one of my more serene CDs (This Mortal Coil's album titled 'Blood.'  I recommend it.) and stretched out to watch the forest dance lightly to the music and the sunrise.  I then went down by the river's edge and sculpted it in my mind.  I have never in my life seen such incredible beauty.  Sadly, since my emotions had been tied up elsewhere in my mind, and so I found myself indifferent to it.  Never before have I experienced such beauty, and been so unmoved by it.
