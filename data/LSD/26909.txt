we decided to go to the community pool, but we never made it. everyfew steps or so, we would get distracted by something. then i noticed her face. it looked so strange. her eyes were morphing and her face just looked so weird. we were out side for an hour, wandering around. then we went inside and watched the Matrix. it was amazing. I was convinced the guy who wrote the script was tripping. It made perfect sense. After the movie was over, I was convinced i was in the matrix, I ran around screaming, 'there is no spoon!' i really was convinced. suddenly, i was ravenously hungry. i grabbed a sprite and ran into my friends room. 'orange.....AMBIVALENCE!' i said, and we all giggled. i didnt end up opening the can of sprite for about an hour.
