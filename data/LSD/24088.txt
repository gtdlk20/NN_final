T + 10hr.: We decide to go on another walk to smoke a joint on a bridge near our apartment. The walk is much colder than the last as the night has become quite chilly. We come to the bridge, only to find a new fence around it. This especially upsets N, who gets very scared and wants to leave. We do end up going to a park nearby to smoke.
