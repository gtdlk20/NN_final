When I got home from school, I dropped two more tabs at the same time, grabbed my iPod, and drove to Blue Sky trail, which is a nice nature spot in my area. I chilled there for a while listening to music just waiting to start feeling the acid. After a couple hours, I start listening to the Beatles out in the open forest just in heaven. I had never actually felt that good in my life before. It was everything I could possibly dream of.
