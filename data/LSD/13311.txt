At some point, Nathan had left the outer realm to go and play the guitar inside.  I went in after who knows how long to see what goodies I could find inside.  I wanted to talk with Nate about the beauty and awe that we had eaten.  I saw his door was shut.  I heard a noise from that direction and saw it open.  He ran naked through the den into his roommates sister's bedroom, into the closet and shut the door.  The only thing he had was an acoustic guitar.  I laughed at the thought and retired to the Salvador Dali book.  How vibrant!
