As we walked to the park, my consciousness 'split'; more strongly than ever before.  The 'more real' and 'aware' part was not confined to my body- it spread out, and in dimensions i wasn't aware of. Every detail of every thing held infinity, and vice versa.  There was at once a unity to all, and a dichotomy of spirit and substance, almost as 2 sides of a coin.  The less aware essence of me was talking with P.'s less aware side about people we know, and the way to get there.  P. was becoming fearful, and I was ecstatic - we both felt 'something big' on its way in the near future.
