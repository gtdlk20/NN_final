A bit later, I run into a girl I know, and my normal shyness being absent I tell her I think she's really cute.  She's with some other guy tonight, but I get her phone number, anyhow.  I find some other people I know in order to make sure I can get a ride home later.  I spend the next few hours, walking, contemplating, talking to various friends and strangers at the party, staying very clear and comfortable throughout.
