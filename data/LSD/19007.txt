I had finally got S into the ladies room after a minute or so of convincing. Even when she was inside, she kept yelling things at me through the door. The store employees probably thought we were drunk from how we were acting and shouting, so the next part was no surprise. I was getting lost in a particular geometric pattern on a coke bottle when the cashier came around the corner to tell us that we had to leave or they were going to call the police. We promptly left. As I walked out the door, I said, Sorry for inconveniencing you, have a good night.  S just screamed at the top of her lungs.
