Soon we came to a fire pit between the train tracks and the lake. W stepped out into the water, holding his hands up in the air in the direction that the wind was coming from. I watched his spirit extend out from behind his body. By this point I was finally ready to smoke a bowl, now almost 6 hours after having dosed. But we realized that we didn't have a bowl to smoke out of, so we decided to head back to my room. On the way back there were lots of kids sitting out on the boat house deck. W and T are sailors, so they yelled 'Get the fuck off the boathouse!' and 'Security!', and threw a few pebbles towards the kids. Basically being dicks, but we all cracked up uncontrolably after that.
