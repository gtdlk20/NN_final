Before leaving we went into the back garden to pay the dog a visit. Thankfully he was a placid dog, content to just stand there silently whilst we gathered around him. I couldn't understand how obsessed the others were by him. They seemed to be worshipping the dog. I wondered if they had gone mad but when I saw the dog's eyes I realised what had happened. It did have some kind of power over them, I knew this because his eyes' were both glowing bright green and I became convinced that he was trying to place thoughts in my mind by looking at me. This was not frightening, it just made me feel a little bit uneasy.
