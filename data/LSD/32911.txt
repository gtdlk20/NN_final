Then we heard the cops siren! Everyone went crazy. We all started running nonsense and they shouted from the outside: Stop right there! Man, that was the rush of my life! So I froze right there at the corridor, totally frozen, and waited. One of my friends went up the stairs and saw through the balcony a police car and two cops arresting a shirtless man on the street. On our street. He came back and told everybody it was going to be okay, that they werent raiding the house and we wouldnt go to jail or get killed.
