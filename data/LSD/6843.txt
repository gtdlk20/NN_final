Im talking about human mythology and how the world is made up of two planes, the visible and the invisible. And for thousands of years, people have been talking about the invisible world through myths and spirituality and religion. I tell him I understand that were eternal beings and we will die but our souls will live on, somehow. In another life, in another dimension, Im not sure.
