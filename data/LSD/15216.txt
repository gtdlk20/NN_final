Hello Friends.  After four years, and many other voyages into psychedelic wonder, I'm going to tell those to whom it may concern about my first experience with LSD. Here goes.  It was a dark and snowy night in my humble abode by the river.  After repeatedly mentioning my interest in LSD over a year or so, my druggist (I'll call him Sunny) came over with the goods.  Ten colorful hits of blotter in the cutest little 1/2' single hit ziplocks and some Blueberry Afghani Hash Plant. I tried to stay calm, but deep down I knew I hadn't the faintest Idea what to expect.  It was 9:30 PM by the time we ate our paper.  I started off with one hit and Sunny (I believe) had two.  No turning back... this excited me. You see, if anything fascinates me in this world, it's the unknown, and personal revelations that challenge what's socially accepted and/or lawful (as well as physically/mentally/spiritually possible).  I played the waiting game for 45 minutes before deciding maybe it was weak material, and I took another hit on Sunny's suggestion.  Not long after (10-15 min), I started feeling the 'rising vibes'.  Chills, shivers, and an unexplainable inner expansion.  Fiddling around with my iPhone, the icons began to bounce around and dance lightly as I stared in amazement.  Knowing that the effects I was feeling were only the onset of the first hit caused an excitement that still gives me chills.  What was I in for when the second dose took effect?  What would happen during the PEAK?  This was around the time my two roommates and another friend left the house, uncomfortable with the thought of spending hours on end with a couple of dosed dudes.  I don't blame them.  They don't experiment with substances that may affect the boundaries of what goes through their minds.  Their loss, though upon reflection, we may have been better off with a sober sitter or two.
