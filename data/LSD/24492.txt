We walked over to another concert nearby and arrived right on time. The band started to play, and after a minute I realized they werenÂ’t playing any real songs and were just improvising. They were really gelling and were playing some very spacy, atonal music. I was hearing how they kept subtly surprising each other and exploring different tonal areas seemlessly. If I focused my attention, I could hear great intricacy in the way they played every note. We left after about 30 minutes to go catch another show. We sat down towards the back and had a conversation with this really bubbly, free-spirited girl who I think was also tripping on something. Her voice was very calming and I enjoyed the conversation, though speech was still difficult. After she left, I laid down in the grass and stared up at the sky. I was getting very intense visuals looking at the clouds and they appeared to swirl around and I could see waves go across the sky along with the music. I told my friend to do the same and offered him my sunglasses. We laughed about the common experience and how it made absolutely no sense to our logical brains but nonetheless it was very real in our minds. This was a strange duality to me of being completely out of my mind, but yet still present, collected, and completely able to communicate!
