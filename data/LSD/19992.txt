As we got to the top of the escalator, I noticed a balding fat man wearing a trench coat. This character was suspicious to say the least. He headed straight for us. He inched our way until he was standing about a couple feet away from me against the wall. He slowly turned his head and said 'pssssssst' Now this time I thought surely someone has found us out for real. This guy knows what we're up to and he wants to either expose us or join in the fun. Now I'm not sure if this guy was just slow but what he said next left me momentarily speechless. In an eerie whisper he leaned over and said 'where'd you guys get the icecream cones?' Not sure what the big secret was, or why he felt that he needed to whisper, but once again we broke into hysterical laughter.
