The whole trip was a incredible rollercoaster ride, and I have decided that because of the pain, I will never take LSD again.  But I do not regret this trip.  The spiritual awakening between M and I was well worth it.  Plus, I got to scratch another drug off my 'first time in the new body' list.  I am anxious to try salvia, DMT and I may be getting fungus soon.  Wish me luck.
