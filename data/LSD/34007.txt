7:30 or so we stop for breakfast, and meet some others of my friends.  I give them my brief bioassay report, that I think the dots are probably a low dose of LSD and not LSA as some others had suggested they might be, as I've tried LSA before and it was more sedating and less clear.  I guess this might be 50ug or less of acid per dot, though.
