Suddenly, a wave of detaching psychosis pulsed through me. I feel more stimulated and energized than before I entered here, my balance seemed to slightly waver back and forth. Thoughts of confusion and spiraling questioning flooded my mind - feeling like I was almost equally overwhelmed by confusion and questioning. This didn't feel dysphoric/fearful, but seemed very intense and disortienting. Recollecting now, it's hard to describe my exact thought train(s) - I found myself glaring down at the green marbled tile outside of the sink's rim as I wash my hands. The marbled patters seemed to be flowing and moving back and forth fairly rapidly, the light also seemed to yield streaks of color. Questions like 'Why am I in here? Who? What? Or Where?' Came to me seemingly all at once. Then I felt confused and almost paralyzed by my unusually abysmal mind set, seeming manageable - yet heavily disorienting and confusing. I felt partially but not fully detached from myself while comprehending that I was bending over running water over my soapy hands. Awe struck, fairly confused on my thought train, seems hard to focus on one of the many simple questions racing in my head. This feels not dysphoric/uncomfortable, but highly intense.
