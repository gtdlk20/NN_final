I opened the fridge door and got a glass from the cupboard.  I then started to pour the orange juice and the whole world then became orange, pure ORANGE.  This was the hallucination becoming solid, no trails of lights on the edges of objects, but a complete change of my visual field to the colour ORANGE.  The whole world became one single shade of orange, no differences in shades, just all the same shade of orange.
