The next forty five minutes or so we spent leaning against the wall nodding our heads to the music and occasionally taking swigs of water.  We all do it!  I think I was the last to come up and when that happens you automatically think you've got a dud.  But low and behold I remember the first twinge of slight sickness.  It made me shift my position and then I felt the warm sensation in my stomach.  this made me breath in deep and I felt my cheeks redden.  Loverly!  The smile stretched across my face and I just let it take control.
