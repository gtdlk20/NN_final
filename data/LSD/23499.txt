When Dianna, Summer, Louise, and I went back to the apartment, the weirdness continued. Sitting back down was difficult; I felt so hyperactive, but I let my movements guide me on the canvas, continuing my shading. Immediately, when I looked over at her, I noticed Dianna wasnt as keen on keeping herself as grounded, and she began to giggle all over the place again. I cant really remember how much time had passed while we were like that, but before I knew it, I noticed Dianna asking Louise to paint her feet.
