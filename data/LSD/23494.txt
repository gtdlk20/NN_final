About an hour after we dropped, I began to feel different. The muscle tension increased, and as I was prompted to look at my hand, I realized it felt disconnected from my body. It wasnt like a phantom limb, where I didnt feel it - it just felt foreign and far. As soon as I looked up at my surroundings, I realized everything felt slightly foreign and far. The circumstances were weird, and I asked myself what was so peculiar about the reality I was in. This feels weird, I said. Louise looked up at me with a concerned look, and asked, Bad weird?. I considered, and had a hard time deciding: my feelings, thoughts, and emotions, were getting hazier and confused, Not really... not bad and not good, just weird. This sense of weirdness persisted throughout the whole trip and well-into the next day.

I later realized it was this weirdness that caused me to dissociate from my immediate reality, and re-evaluate the world around me.
