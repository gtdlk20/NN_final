I stood on the edge of my world and looked off. Every choice I had that night corresponds to a way of thought, and I believe that I chose the only one that would let me see correctly. One thing I know, if I had chosen differently, I would never have known that I had chosen incorrectly. Whichever way you go, you 'know' it's the right way.
