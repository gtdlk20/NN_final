I took the first 10 hits individually one every 5 minutes for 50 minutes instead of all at once. I started into my trip by the time I got to my 6th hit. It was kind of slow and gradual with little spikes of reality leaving flashbacks. Then it hit me about an hour and a half into the trip. A hardcore peak that lasted for almost 45 minutes. During this time I only saw the colors purple, red, blue, and white. I lost all sense of time (thank GOD for stopwatches) and I could not determine what was real and what was fake. My coordination and balance were no more. I began to wonder if I really should take the remaining 15 hits. When I began to come down and I could hear without the echo again I closed my eyes and stuck the remaining 15 hits in my mouth and swollowed. What happened next was nothing like I expected (of course I was expecting death). I continued to get further from my peak and the intensity continued to drop. But what didn't stop were my visuals. I continued to have outrageous visuals without the peak for what must have been 16 more hours. I was just calm, but tripping.
