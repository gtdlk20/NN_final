Very little of me was there any more.  I dont really remember anything very specific from this time.  My mind was in pieces.  Language was unavailable.  To the extent that there was any self there, I knew I was the source of an unimaginable volume of radiating love and gratitude for Rs presence.   I knew I was safe, and I was ready for what might come.
