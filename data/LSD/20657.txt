By now it was about 2am. I got home and decided to sit and watch a little tv. I was all alone because my mother was out and felt shit scared something was going to happen to me. Everything was still spinning and there was a small green dragon next to the tv which wouldn't let me past to get to my room, so I thought I would wait on the couch until either it went away or the acid wore off. This is the time when my mother came walking through the door (I hadn't heard her car pull into the driveway), she asked me how I was and how my night was which I remember replying by saying with my eyes extremely wide open 'fine, just fine....I'm off to bed now, goodbye'. I remember her looking at me with this weird look, you know the 'what the hell is this guy on' look. Lucky for me she didn't follow to investigate. I pretty much spent the rest of the night lying in bed unable to sleep staring at a poster of a band called Obituary. The band members faces would come out of the poster to me and stare at me, which scared me alot, so I closed my eyes and could see a myriad of shapes and colours swirling into uniform patterns shapeshifting into different shapes marching accross my mind and could here a bubbling sound which I was convinced was my brain desolving in my skull......pretty cool huh?
