1995 was the year of acid for me, a doorway into places i am certain i dreamt about in my childhood, crystal dimensions, where i could taste colors and touch sounds and smells  with my hands from the very first trip on, i felt great amounts inhibitions and unresolved issues from my shitty  past leaving me,literally'enlightening' me. i was like a snake shedding skin and slithering into a newer safer place. i stopped being afraid of who i had become. in August i had my most important trip yet. a few weeks after my 18th birthday, my then-boyfriend, D, another friend, G, and Buddha Ben (D's brother) decided we would 'visit other galaxies'. it was Buddha Ben's first trip, so we were excited about the initiation, as we always had an amazing time on acid, even all by ourselves.
