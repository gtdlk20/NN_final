My visuals were simply amazing. Nothing has come even close to them. I was flipping through my Dali book, when suddenly, Dali's artwork seemed to take over my visuals. I ran to the bathroom, and in the mirror, my reflection was still my face, but it was my face painted just like Dali's own self-portrait in the book. Incredible. The whole world seemed to enter Dali's surrealistic fantasy. I was lost within the visuals and seemed to be consumed by them. I began conjuring up different images, and they seemed to flow from my mind in intricate, detailed patterns.
