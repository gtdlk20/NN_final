C is fine now but is grounded for a very long time and I think its going to be a very long time before I try hallucinogens again. That night was so fucked up. I had tripped harder than I ever had before with visuals and realizations beyond my understanding but I think its time to stick to the ganja and having and old fashion good time. After this is was all and done with, now we need a new fucking bassist for our band.
