I went back into my room and found myself very displeased with its appearance. I got the urge to begin to clean it. I picked up some papers and headed for my garage. Without turning on the light first, I stepped out into it and felt something on the bottom of my foot squirm around. I screamed bloody murder though I didn't really feel any terror or fear, it was mostly just an automatic response. My boyfriend turned on the light and I swore I saw a cockroach crawl away from under my foot. I began to laugh and yell and demand if what I saw was really a cockroach or if I had just imagined that. My friend C and my boyfriend insisted it wasn't, but they later informed me it was, they didn't want to give me a bad trip though. I don't think this would have bothered me anyway however, I felt so content and detached, it didn't phase me in the slightest.
