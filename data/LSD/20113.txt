T + 3hr: We spend some time at the base of a large waterfall. This is part of a state park, which is closed since it is after dark. At one point we hear voices and see figures across the water on the other side, coming down a trail. Assuming them to be park rangers we try to blend into the darkness. Eventually, the figures get into a car and leave. We leave soon thereafter and walk back to the apartment.
