About 2 hours into the trip I saw what I can only describe as dna sigils interweaving themselves along my arms and hands.  They flowed along perfectly with the contours of my normal physical body.  I also saw slightly different sigils on the face of my girl friend.  These visuals were constant for about 4 more hours.
