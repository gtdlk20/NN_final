We both thought that was pretty funny, and then started thinking about it and realized it was pretty much an accurate statement. The restless, almost nervous energy was building and sitting at my computer became too intense. Now, I've experienced this restless LSD-energy plenty of times before and I know there are basically two options: First, there is the option to allow yourself to bounce off the walls and get wrapped up in a whirlwind trip. Some people routinely choose this option, but I personally find much greater value in the alternative. The second option is to channel all this energy, learn to control it, and to direct it throughout your body. I find that I can direct the majority of this energy into the palms of my hands, and by sitting cross-legged I can enter a state of deep relaxation.
