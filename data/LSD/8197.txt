The experience of getting into my room was traumatic enough -- I felt like a failure for being confused -- and then I was immediately confronted by my reflection in the mirror near the entry way. The visuals this mirror reflected were similar to those in the 7/11 bathroom mirror but this time I saw even more faces in everything except for my own face, which seemed to completely lack depth, especially as all my features twisted around inside themselves. I called my boyfriend and he seemed to just trip me out even more, his voice echoing in my ear and strangely distant and spooky, though it still felt beautiful to talk to him. I began to cry because I realized how much I deeply missed him. At this point I was curled up on my bed, feeling like I was stuck in a psychological hole. Everything around me was shifting but I finally got up the nerve to go on my computer and video chat with my boyfriend. I tried to explain how I was feeling but could only tell him fundamentally the opposite of what I meant to say. Talking to him was tripping me out so hard and, to make things temporarily worse, he kept sending me pictures of me that I had taken on his computer, and they were really tripping out my brain.
