Back on the street I had staggered a few more paces then fallen.  I was now a seven year old child lying on the pavement, my best friend's parents stood over me feeling concerned 'What happened', 'He's hit his head', 'Call an ambulance'. A disk shaped hole appeared above me with someones arm reaching down to me to try and pull me up into safety, I tried to reach the grasping hand but couldnÂ’t. Then the hole disappeared.
