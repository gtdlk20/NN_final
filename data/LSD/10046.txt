I started to come down from the acid after about 6 hours after dropping.  When the man came back down to check on me, I decided to ask him the key question, 'who are you?'  I was beginning to think he wasn't my 'adversary' but rather a friend from my 'former life'.  He told me his name and instantly I knew all that had happened.  I 'remembered' that I had taken acid, after four hours of raving and wandering around!
