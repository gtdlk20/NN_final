By about 11:00pm, me and my friend 'Jack' decided to take a walk up to the goat farm up the road. We always went up there drunk looking to kill a goat. I took my second hit when we got up there. I got up to a goat and just started to pet it as I looked at 'Jack' and said 'Do I punch it?' We both decided it didn't seem right to do so. About that time we heard a loud crash that started echoing in my head and ran.
