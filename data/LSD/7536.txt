We both sat down.  I opened up my laptop and Arthur suggested I should play some music.  Immediately, I was deeply disillusioned and even perhaps unsettled by the sound of music.  It sounded depressingly flat, dull, and lifeless Â– far worse than I typically felt listening to music on weed, worse even than I felt listening to music sober.  I wasn't into the music at all, and I found it hard to even concentrate on.  After only a few songs, I stopped playing it.
