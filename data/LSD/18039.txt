After I finally quit looking at my hand I lyed down in the grass and looked up at the sky, it was still blue but the clouds were moving in very fast motion and they were changing colors in the process. It was kinda like what the sky looked like in the Doors when Jim Morrison is following the indian to the cavern. When I sat back up I noticed that my pants were breathing, when they exhaled my blue jeans turned into blue potleafs in this non stop pattern. After spending about 2 hours in the cave we all came out, I came out a different person then what I was when I went in.
