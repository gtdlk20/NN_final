I'd never had any experiences with psychedelics that widened my perception before the night in question. Unlike Huxley with mescaline, it took some doing before my doors of perception would be opened, and it wasn't cacti that did it for me, it was the synthesis of cereal grain mold we call d-Lysergic Acid Diethylmide, or LSD (an abbreviation of the german spelling). I'd been taking Acid awhile by then, and knew it was capable of weird stuff, but I was young then and had no real compass. It was just another drug, and it stayed that way until Christmas of 2014 when I took more than I ever had. I guess I was a bit down, with it being the holidays and there I was alone eating Acid with the phone off.
