After an hour he said it's starting to affect him, I felt nothing, but he said it'll take longer for me cuz it's the first time. Time passed by, it was hard for me to feel it working, cuz I didnt know just what am I suppose to feel. Slowly but surely I began feeling happy, I was laughing for no reason, it was hard to remain calm. I felt energized, had the urge to go somewhere, do something. Music sounded so alive and great.The playlist was on random, some songs were amazing, I heard them like it was for the 1st time, different sounds, different beats, other songs which I usually like-sounded awful. The sound was affected by the mood. also the taste, we drank some cranberry juice and I was amazed at how perfect it is. Felt every drop runing down my throat. Then we went outside to get some fresh air, and it was the best air I ever tasted. So fresh and sweet.Came back inside. (still laughing non-stop)I looked at the clock, it was 23:20 but it seemed like so many hours have passed. Time just didnt move. my bf wanted to smoke, but said it'll make him feel sick, so I suggested he'd just hold the ciggi in his mouth. He did. But for some reason there was smoke coming out of his mouth (even though the cigarette wasnt lit).
