My thoughts mostly focused toward acid, although I had heard some interesting stories of mescaline, a substance I still hope to explore.  I discussed it with the friend I knew to be most interested in the subject, who I shall refer to as 'Entheogen'.  She and I agreed that since we were both so interested in LSD we might as well just try it and get it over with.  Actually, we were MUCH more excited than I make it sound.  In the subsequent weeks we used her contacts to get ahold of a few hits, and then finding a time to actually do it.  During this time, I almost chickened out, but thanks to Entheogen I followed through on what would be one of the most amazing experiences of my entire life.
