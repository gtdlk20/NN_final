I was giddy with excitement on Sunday morning when I drove to her house to pick her up. Although we were both slightly nervous, we both had a great mindset because it was a beautiful day, and we had no obligations to take care of. Once we were at my house we prepared our backpacks with water, iced tea, sunglasses, an extra pair of clothes just in case anything happens, a bowl of mixed fruit, and headphones. Our plan was to bike over to a nearby nature trail and have a picnic by the lake. We went into my room, hesitantly placed the blotter tab on our tongues, waited for it to dissolve, and swallowed at precisely 1:40 P.M. We hugged each other in anticipation of the great adventure we were about to experience, and sat on the couch to watch TV while it kicked in. After about ten boring minutes we decide to just leave on our bike ride.
