02:45am - Sat down for a while.  As usual, my friends who were rolling were bitching about the music or something and blaming it for 'killing their roll.'  Perhaps the fact that ecstasy only peaks at around 3 hours or their negative attitude is what actually killed their roll, I'd say.  My arm was pulsating and there were little black worms crawling all over it into my skin.  This made me happy, because I'd been wanting to get a larger dose of acid at some point.
