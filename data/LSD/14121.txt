I did not expect to have full-blown loss of self and ego death and a thousand alien reincarnations and significant insights about perceived reality and historical changes in the structure of society and the resolution of longstanding psychological issues and an improved social attitude from my first trip.  I was expecting to maybe see the walls appear to breathe like I had heard that they would, and maybe feel a bit more peaceful.  Oddly, they never did, but I was ultimately very much at peace with the experience, and with experience more generally.
