Beyond this I have no more time stamps and for the next couple of hours time itself becomes a slippery concept and description becomes more difficult. I write My being is seeking integration into the family soul collective, and I may be realizing its existence for the first time. I have before experienced what I consider to be my familys subconscious valley on a fairly large 4-aco-dmt dose, and it seems that now Im being confronted with the possibility of revisiting this place.
