I chose the new Tool album Lateralus as the soundtrack to my journey, and this suited the trip fine.  The album flew by, its almost a full 80 minutes long, but for some reason it went by very quickly.  So instead of time slowing like it should it went much faster at least for that 80 minutes.  But during that time I saw some of the most beautiful CEV's that I could ever have imagined.  The only one I remember vividly was what appeared to be some sort of a fish creature, that had no real head, and its whole body swayed through the liquid colors.  Around this time I began to think about my life.  I came to many conclusions about what I should do and where I should direct my life.  I also figured out what I percieved God really is, but I won't go into that.  I don't want to rant on about things that I think are nearly impossible to explain.  If anyone knows the album I was listening too, the last track 'Faaip De Oiad' is a creepy phone message from a man talking about aliens with loud jarring music.  When this came on I felt an incredible fear rush throughout my body, but it went away as soon as the song ended.
