At some point we put on the AENIMA album by TOOL and cranked it, probally around 12am.  Fan-fucking-tastic!  The cd is kept on loop for the rest of the trip which adds alot to the weirdness.  I groove to one song it ends, next thing I know I'm grooving to it again but I'm in a different part of the apartment doing something different.  Crazy deja-vu feelings and mind loops.
