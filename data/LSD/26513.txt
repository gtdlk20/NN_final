We stayed up the whole night and my friend, who's a dumbass had to work the next day.  We convinced him that he had to ride 10 miles to work on a bike because there was no way he could get a ride.  Actually, his mom could have given him a ride, but we convinced him otherwise.  He ended up riding all the way to work on a shitty bike with flat tires at 4:00 in the morning.  It was the funniest shit ever.  I remember everything about the night, but most of it just can't be explained with words, at least unless a person has tried it and knows what I'm talking about.
