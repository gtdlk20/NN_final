The uneasiness of realizing how intense acid really is is a feeling you dont soon forget. Its like climbing to the top of the biggest slide at the playground, and then looking down nervously to see how high the slide actually is. I walked to the bathroom to try and cope with what was happening to my body and mind. I had to get over this feeling so I could get to work. I sat down on the sink to try and catch my breath when I started to hallucinate. The tiles on the bathroom floor danced in a very peculiar way. They moved right on beat with the thoughts racing a mile a minute in my head. Seeing this ballroom of waltzing tiles calmed me down enough to go back into the kitchen and try to get back to work.
