I was offered a beer, it was ice cold and complemented the 'trip taste' I had in my mouth perfectly. I was offered a beer, it was ice cold and complemented the 'trip taste' I had in my mouth perfectly.  The group that was already at the house before we arrived started to watch Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' on video.  I settled in to watch with the others and was instantly transfixed by the music (they were piping it through speakers) and the images on the screen.  As the movie continued to play I found that I was feeling the music, physically feeling it.  This was overwhelming!!  I tried to explain to the others I had dropped with, but they were off on their own tangent.
