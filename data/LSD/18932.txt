Paranoia about being discovered on drugs soon began to set in, so I bundled my tripping friends out of my house and asked my sober friend to stay the night in case I went mental (I thought I would never come back down).  He agreed, but said that he'd need to write a note for his parents, so we walked back to his house so he could leave a note.  At this stage, it was about about 2 am.  I waited outside his house while he wrote the note and it was then that the strangest thing happened me.  I had gotten a few visual effects, such as objects (cars, for example) 'shunting' quickly one way and then straight back, but nothing too impressive.  But I was leaning on a low wall when I heard a man and a woman behind me.  They were talking about me...  The gist of their conversation was how 'awful' it was that I was on drugs and what would his parents think, and so on.  But it didn't just fade away - the conversation continued for minutes!  I know this, because my friend took about five minutes to come back out.  I could hear every word said and two distinct voices saying them.  I was utterly convinced that there were two people behind me engaged in conversation about my trip!  Eventually, I plucked up the courage to look behind me and face them, and when I did, the only thing there were the leaves of a palm tree (or something like it) rustling in the breeze.
