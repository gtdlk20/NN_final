This time was fairly typical.  The week ahead I had made plans to trip with my friend Casey, one of the two people I usually trip with.  We had tripped together the month prior and it was a lovely experience, especially the comedown which we had spent drinking coffee in a 24hr coffee shop and reading a local tabloid.  It was a nice sunny day and I was expecting another nice, pleasant trip.  We live in a suburb, but generally ride the bus into the city to trip, to enjoy the city atmosphere for a bit before retreating into a pleasant and relatively safe park near downtown, before riding the bus back into our suburb.  It can be a bit formulaic, but it's pleasant and generally how we do it.
