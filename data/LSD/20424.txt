Four or five of us were skipping school and hanging out at a favorite local tripping spot, a small woodsey area at the base of a hill on a local semi-private golf course.  It was a weekday morning on a warm spring day and the course wasn't open.  We were all peaking pretty good, joking and strumming guitars, just goofing around.  But we were kinda quiet, too; we were not suppose to be on the golf course and we didn't want to be confronted and shooed away by the groundskeeper.  Suddenly we noticed a young man, maybe late-20s, about 75 yards away, walking past us from our right to left.  He was white, sandy hair, casual dressed with a light jacket and was toting a green fabric daypack.  We really quieted down, but he didn't glance over, he just kept marching along right down a fareway.  When he got directly in front of us he suddenly made a 90 degree turn and without missing a step he started walking directly toward us.
