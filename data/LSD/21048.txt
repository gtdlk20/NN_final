We left the store and headed to Mike's house. I followed him, Crystal Method pounding inside my car. I was a little uncoordinated when it came to getting on the expressway, and I kind of almost got in an accident, but I managed to get on the ramp OK. The ramp lifted me high up, or so it seemed, and I could see the city lights ahead like millions of little stars. There was construction on the expressway, so there were miles of flashing barricades set up. I wasn't having visuals yet, but it seemed like there were a hundred cars behind me, and what with the soundtrack, I felt like I was doing warp speed in a spaceship.
