As a footnote, I have done acid about 15 times in my life, in varying doses (once was tricked into eating a cube with 8 hits of strong liquid on it).  I have experienced a mild recurrence of HPPD-like hallucinations at times (they are usually VERY faint), and also have had some rather strong flashbacks.  It has been 2 years since I took my last LSD, and about 9 weeks ago I had a flashback so strong it almost felt as if I had done another hit.  I actually look forward to the flashbacks at times- they are much more smooth than actually doing acid, and last only a couple of hours.  The only bad side effect I have experienced is that during one trip, my skin broke out in a visible rash.
