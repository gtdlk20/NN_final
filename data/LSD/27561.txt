I headed of down the road peering into the distance. I could see the first 20 or so yards reasonably clearly however after that it was a bit of a haze. As I focused it seemed as if the road repeated those first 20 yards endlessly into the distance. I had been walking now for what seemed like a long time and still couldnt see the end. Suddenly I was standing at the end of the road. It opened in to a concrete clearing on which 5 roads sprang from similar in design to a cannabis leaf. I had walked down what I though  was the diagonal road second from the right, When I emerged however I was on the horizontal far right road. This confusion shocked me deeply. I just couldnt get my head round the juxtaposition of which road I thought I should have merged from and where I was standing. After what felt like an eternity I managed to map the area in my mind and convince myself that I hadnt flipped realities or teleported or whatever I thought was going down.
