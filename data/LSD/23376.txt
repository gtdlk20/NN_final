When we got back into town we went back to R´s house, dropped the last two hits and sat on his porch for a while. We were still feeling a slight tingle from the first hit, but we were both hungry for a slightly more profound experience. Suddenly R points out that we had nothing to smoke later on, so we headed over to a contact of his, to buy some hash. When we got there we told him (R´s contact) that we had dropped acid, just to clarify, in case the second hit should be stronger than the first, and we would start to act weird.
