12:13 PM (T 2:13) I find that Im able to make more conscious decisions as to how I react to stressful work scenarios. In moments where I would usually get worked up, Im noticing a more moderated, slightly detached approach to finding solutions. Upon reflection, my detachment seemed to be of my critical thinking part of my consciousness from my more limbic, emotional side. This recognition of the influence my visceral urges have on my thoughts and actions empowers me to maintain an elevated, more consistent level of overall mindfulness.
