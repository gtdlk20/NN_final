Anyway, keep your phone off when you do acid. This worked out for me, but I could easily see it having gone bad and the experience between the initial phone call and arriving at the girlfriend's place would probably qualify as a 'bad trip,' though there was some cynically pleasant conversation with Casey.  Anyway, the experience of just 'sobering up' seemed worth reporting.
