This trip changed my life. I gambled and won big time, but I also got a preview of how bad it hurts to lose, and even though I say I won, theres still a price to pay. I cannot share the true nature of what I saw; there are literally no words for it. Ive never seen it captured in paintings or photos. Ive heard it in some songs, but still... Its not the same. Dont underestimate these drugs.
