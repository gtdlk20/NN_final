As it played I closed my eyes and felt as though I was floating through the sky, looking down through the clouds and seeing the entire city's lights from a bird's eye view. Then I soared higher until I broke through the atmosphere and was flying through space. I saw the world in all its purple beauty spiraling through the cosmos. I opened my eyes; I was back in the room looking at the stars. I concentrated on the ceiling, and one by one the stars started to peel off like stickers, then they hovered right underneath the ceiling and started waving like a flag, all in synchronization. Stars then started sprouting out like flowers in a fast stop motion film. I saw a shadow move across the room and a wavy figure standing in the doorway.
