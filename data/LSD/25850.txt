The experience was similar to a 4-hit trip, except the visual hallucinations were more vivid, perhaps more synthetic(?)  Far more interesting for me was the audio.  I had not noticed it until a good 5 hours or so into the trip.  I heard a faint creaking in my mind, sort of like rapid pulses of sound like a modem noise over the telephone.  I found that as I concentrated on this noise, playing it up in my mind, it grew louder.  I could hear distortions of this sort of 'data stream' noise analogous to the settings in an audio program such as Pro Tools or Sound Forge (modulation, frequency, wow-flutter).  Very bizarre and very cool.
