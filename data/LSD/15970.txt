Again, for the third time, the now familiar cellular-explosion was imminent. I get pulled more and more, till again, the beautiful Light, or God as I came to understand (but this is a whole new story). More beautiful ecstasy... For me its easy to be this calm on these VR environments. People only have bad trips went they fight the acid, or don't accept what they see. Your on a train. It won't stop until it reaches the station, so relax and enjoy the ride.
