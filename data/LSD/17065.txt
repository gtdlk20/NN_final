Everything that made up my field of view became a wash of bright colors and indistinguishable textures. However, the more I looked at a specific object, the clearer it became. As these visuals settled in to both my mind and Es, we began to desperately hold onto reality. The two of us walked throughout the house, reciting facts about our lives that we both knew absolutely to be true. I ended up completely glued to the watch. The blue watch face on the screen bulged and shifted and made it difficult to read time. It was around 8:30 pm or so when I realized I was counting and announcing every minute to E that went by. At this point I was panicking because I knew I was experiencing a bad trip. I told E that we needed someone else to tripsit us. He agreed, and I messaged my other best friend (lets call him B) with plenty of difficulty. The keys seemed to be in a different position on my phones screen every time I looked at it, and my messages were short and nondescript. Luckily, B made it about 20 minutes later.
