Later one friend left to catch the bus home so my one friend and me left wandered aimlessly around the dark streets of our small town. We walked up some round grassy hills and then lied down on the top. This was one of the coolest parts of my trip. I was literally leaving my body and flying into the complex cosmos of stars. We lay there for an immeasurable amount of time.
