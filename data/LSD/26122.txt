Me and a friend had taken many hits of LSD before this intense experience. I was very educated on the drug and had a sincere passion for its effects. We got our hands on some LSD-25 blotter papers made in Switzerland. I took 3 and a half and he took two. We layed down on the end of my dock around 6 oclock looking up at the sky waiting for the LSD to kick in and the sun to start setting. About 1 hour and a half after taking it the most ridiculous things started appearing in the clouds, we saw many faces glaring at us. The clouds moved to form a huge spiral in the sky covering the entire sky. My mind and spirit left my body. I felt like I had no control over myself or anything else around me I went wherever the doses took me. Many other things happened during my trip that by the way lasted 16 hours. LSD is fun.
