	On the walk down the dirt path to one of our favorite smoking spots Im struck dead in awe staring at the moon. Watching it as it slowly descends toward the mountains only to watch ascend once more. I pointed out the moon to my friends, and there we all are, stopped dead in our tracks staring. The moon had finally reached all the way to the mountains creating an epic lunar show, where the moonlight would reflect off the mountains in a series of bright patterns. We continued to stare in disbelief of this cosmic event until the moon had completely disappeared behind the mountains.
