Once the puke loop stopped and I returned to bed, ego death began. I phased in and out of experiencing having a body. For much of the time, there was no other quality to my existence other than what seemed like a pinpoint of energy located somewhere inside the space of my head. I could no longer see this world, nor hear it. Instead, the sensory input came from somewhere else. The pattern, the typical visuality of the lsd experience, came to life and took over all data being sent inward. The shapes moved and spun and interacted in a spatial dimension I could not comprehend. Combined with these shapes were sounds. The sounds came from nowhere in my home. I had no music playing, no sources of white noise. They were part of the visuals. There were strange clicks, hums, vibrations, and other sounds that I cannot describe as I have not heard them before or since. They made sense with the movement of the geometry. In that moment, the only part of me left intact became aware that this was the machine aspect of our universe, the behind the scenes interactions beyond the macro from which all complexity is created. It was all so amazingly digital. In this time, I managed to change my viewpoint to what seemed like looking down at my corporeal body, and it too was only the grey rainbow vibratory geometry like everything else.
