My first LSD trip was actually kind of an accident.  The guy I usually buy shit from had been talking about some shit he had, hash and opium, but by the time I got around to hooking up with him he was out of hash and the opium was 'bottom of the barrel,' if you will.  I ended up buying four hits of acid, each dropped on some sort of gummy candy.
