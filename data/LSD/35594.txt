While I was in my car I stayed up the whole night from 11pm to 12am and went to work while I was coming down. I made pizza and that was the easiest job to trip while I am working. During that time in my car I lost half of my ego. I thought that I turned into somebody else and I had to tell all of my friends that I wasn't really human. I believe that is the true feeling of dying. I turned into something else other than an earthly body. My soul carries on. People may think that the reasoning behind LSD is to seduce people. But the true good trips are those that make one loose their ego and bring one back down to reality. Reality is just an finite spec in time.
