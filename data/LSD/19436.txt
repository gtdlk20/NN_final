6:00 PM - Soon after we begin hiking down the main trail, I realize I am not enjoying the trek. I feel like I am in a storybook but I have no control over the ending of the tale. The trees and on either side of me quiver and emit emerald vapors, crowding my vision. The Flaming Lips song It Overtakes Me comes to mind. I hum it for a while and it boosts my morale, but claustrophobia sets in when I notice how narrow the path is. Furthermore, I realize that every step I take I will have to retrace on the way back, since there is not enough daylight left to make the full loop around the lake.
