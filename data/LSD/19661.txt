Eventually this came to my attention, as the familiar smell of cannabis filled the hallway. Being that this was a freshman/transfer student dorm building I figured hey they are probably looking to make a few friends who also smoke. So I gave his door a knock, and nothing. Somewhat depressed I headed back to my room mentioning what I had smelled to my girlfriend. Fortunately the next day I saw him in the hallway, so I decided to start a conversation with him. Eventually finding out he sold weed, acid, shrooms and other various drugs. At first I just stuck to good old weed. After about a month of knowing him, and becoming fairly good friends with him, he offered me acid for $10 a hit. So we (my girlfriend, friend and I) decided to try it.
