Now I am feeling good about my decision and set about doing things that I knew might be a problem later, like uploading my pictures or deciding on what to have for dinner.  Half an hour passes, then 45 minutes, I am looking at the clock but remembering reports about people thinking their acid wasn't working and taking way more than they should have.  I decide to go for a walk.  This is the end of December in Wisconsin, but I don't mind the cold and it is actually beautiful and refreshing.  I was hoping I would start tripping outside too.
