I was staying in a friend's cabin in the Californian redwoods and she was away at the time - perfect.  The acid was really smooth, I was sitting out in the sun looking at the trees and could see them breathing.  The trunks were pulsating in and out.  I could also clearly see the trunks radiating a bright green aura.
