As it turns out, I am not the only one with qualms about this hike. Everyone seems to be expressing their dislike for heading deeper into the woods, and were all tripping so hard were having great difficulty communicating simple sentences to one another. With great difficulty, I suggest we agree on a time to turn back, and we settle on 7:00 PM.
