I was laying on the couch and watching TV and getting quite high. I hung on as long as I could stand to watch (waiting for the Madonna video), but the faces on TV kept flashing to weird and sinister forms the faces on TV kept flashing to weird and sinister forms. Of course I kept telling myself that it was all my projection, just the inner part of my mind manifesting, and, yes, it was unpleasant. I did some stretches and deep breathing to try to relax. I prayed to the drug and my mind to please let this be a learning experience. And please let me not hurt anyone.
