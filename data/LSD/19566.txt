It bothered me though; it was distracting and consuming my time. It made me aggravated and highly strung. I spent so much time on it, looking at myself, trying to readjust, readjust, readjust, getting no where differently. I still do it, every time I catch glimpse in passing, I get an uncontrollable urge to linger and look. I do and minutes upon minutes are spent dawdling in the mirror. Such wasted time! Its like entering a daydream state, its difficult to break out of it, to startle myself awake, become self aware that I have been looking at myself. Its vanity, inappropriate unhealthy vanity.
