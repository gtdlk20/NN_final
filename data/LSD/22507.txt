Kyle started messing around with the special features on the Monty Python DVD and found some trailers for some really tripped-out movies: Stanley Kubricks Dr. Strangelove Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, some fucked-up movie called The City of Lost Children (The best visual effects of 1995, 1996, and possibly 1982) and another one called Baron Munchausen.  This last one was for some reason incredibly hilarious to all three of us, and we laughed our asses off for a good 40 minutes straight.  Later, Justin went into my room to listen to music and try to enjoy the remainder of his trip and get some sleep, Kyle had passed out again, and I put on some music and tried to get some sleep.  In the total darkness, it was easy for my eyes to convert the blackness to blueness, and I spent the rest of the night (T +4:30  T +8:00) in a sort of trance, wandering into far-off corners of my mind, all the while being embraced and enfolded by the blue.  I guess I nodded off to sleep at some point, because the next thing I knew, it was morning and I had to get up and get ready for another day of work.  We all sat around on the floor of the bonus room and ate Cocoa Krispies, shared stories about the night, and had a good laugh over Baron Munchausen.  All in all, it was a wonderful night full of new discoveries, and Ive been looking forward to my next trip into the blue.
