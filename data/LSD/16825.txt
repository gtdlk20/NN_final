This kind of quiet mumbling continued for another two or three minutes, until we both sat down on the floor and faced each other solemnly.  We were both so incredibly dumbstruck at the feelings that were pervading our minds that we could do nothing but stare at each other with a stupid kind of disbelief.  I stretched my arms out and stated that my mind felt as big as the room.  I had the very tangible and frightening feeling of melting into the floor and up the wall, and I when I licked my lips, it felt like I was licking someone else's.  All of a sudden I got up and started to walk around the house, which was a chore. The walls were groaning and breathing with life, and it was difficult to recognize my family members or even myself in the pictures hanging on the wall. We wandered around my home of 19 years as if it were an alien landscape.  I sat down in a chair and attempted to turn the computer monitor on, which I could not.  The button was jumping from side to side so quickly that my finger couldn't find it fast enough. I looked at my arm, and it looked extremely distorted.
