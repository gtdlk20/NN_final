The pages were making a noise on the ground, muffled and strange.  I picked it up and there was the leather jacket/hat thing again.  This time it was different though.  The blackness that I mentioned earlier wasn't anywhere around me.  It had concentrated between the collar of the jacket and the brim of the hat on the paper.  This blackness was emotionless.  It was deeper than space and time.  It was a black that only hell could spawn.  Yet I was strangely drawn to it.  I heard the voice again.  It erupted from the depth with a shy and booming voice.
