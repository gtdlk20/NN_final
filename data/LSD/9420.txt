A girl approached me, demanding I play in the amphitheatre, and I reasoned with her that I wasnt skilled enough and my fingers were too cold. After some small chat she wandered away only to circle around me and the rest of the amphitheatres inhabitants (one vagabond homeless man and one older woman waiting for someone) for what seemed like some time. I was pleasant with her the whole time, again testing the spirit of the season, but my pleasant polite indifference fueled her and led her to engage in conversation multiple times. But I could not be trifled with; I was on a mission; I had ideas.
