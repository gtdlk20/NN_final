It was towards the end of my freshmen year of high school. (It had been a year of many changes for me.) I had gone to an all boys private school in 7th and 8th grade where I was miserable. They were rich,shallow and boring. I was middle class,laid back and energetic. When I finally returned to Hanover County public schools from my two year exile, I was enthralled. I made up for everything I had missed. I partied, I got drunk, smoked weed, hung out with girls every chance I got and felt good. My many experiences of being intensely stoned stimulated my already curious, creative and active imagination. I found the 'distortions' of senses thrilling. But I wanted a more intense experience.
