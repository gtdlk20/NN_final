Then out of the blue John asked me if I wanted to take it now. I couldn't believe he suggested it, especially after all the fights we had had about me doing it at all. I dropped one of the three papers under my tongue at 3:00 PM (Presidents Day) and we watched Big Top Pee Wee. An hour passed and I was feeling in a particularly good mood, but I wasn't seeing anything, and it seemed like nothing was happening. I told John I was feeling pretty disappointed, and that perhaps my brother was lying about the strength of the drug. After an hour and a half John amazingly suggested 'Still nothing? OK Take another and I'll take the last one.' The movie was hilarious and bizarre, and occasionally scary. At the end I remember laughing and laughing at the image of an elephant in overalls. John said 'Now that's just WRONG!'
