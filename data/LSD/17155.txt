10-20 minutes after deuce's observation I tried unsuccessfully to get deuce and rosy to go down to the water's edge with me. Finally realizing that no one else wanted to go I grabbed a bag of chips, a boombox, a flashlight and a gallon of water; not that I needed all this but I didn't want to get to the water's edge and think of something I might want and end up making several trips... 'better to be prepared' I muttered to myself.
