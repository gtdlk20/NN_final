Everything I saw moved in ray-traced slow motion and all light appeared to be pixellized. This is where the missing moment begins. We are walking in perfect circles in his apartment living room speaking back and forth to each other without thinking about it at all, utilizing the vehicle of our heightened consciousness to communicate. Then, I bump into a chair and it fucks with my orbit. I obliviously pick the chair up and heave it as if it was the oppressive force I've experienced my entire subjective existence... right through a gigantic sliding glass door.
