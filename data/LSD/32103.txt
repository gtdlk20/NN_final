As always, my LSD sojourns into visionary experiences receiving so much praise by others evaded me.  In the past, absurdity itself dogged my mind/body interpretation of all sorts of experiments that gave others what was expected, from Budweiser to Slivovitz, from Leper Weed to Ecstasy.  Even so,  I was surprised by the unexpected skull crushing sensations on my first LSD trial and the writhing during later trials into floor positions with muscles graced with astonishing energy.   Soon, I learned from Dr. Grof himself, that the alarming skull pressures ascending from the roof of my mouth, moving into the maxilla, climbing across my nasal bone and shearing my forehead in opposite directions was a birth memory of one born by Twilight Sleep, an obstetric procedure abandoned thirty years after I was born.  My initial resistance to this interpretation finally gave way to the unmistakable correlation between the LSD memory and what the fetus would feel as the doctors first two fingers drag the baby out of the birth canal by the roof of its mouth, producing obvious distortions of the skull in the expected sequence.  This was a real memory, it was resurrected by a very small dose (25ug) of LSD and it happened only once, disappearing totally after several days of exact encores in the form of flashbacks.
