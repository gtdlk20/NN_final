I considered myself a fairly seasoned psychonaut at the time, and I recognized the initial onset of the condition roughly fifteen minutes later.  Colors became sharper, and sounds took on a strange ethereal quality.  I walked into the den, encouraged.  It was a large room, with a hardwood floor and a fireplace.  I felt certain that this was the right room in which to begin my journey, and so I reclined on the couch and fell into a relaxed, mellow state.  That was when I began to hear singing.  It started as a sweet humming sound, like a barbershop quartet tuning up, only at very low volume.  The sound began to rise, and the tone began to change.   The windows were slightly open, and a cool breeze began blowing the curtains from the window,   It seemed to me at the time that there was a whole invisible choir in the room, and each change of the light wrought its own change upon the tune.  It grew and grew, and soon instruments were thrown into this beautiful choral mix.  I began to search in vain for the source of the sound, but as I moved the music grew around me.  Soon I recognized that the sound was coming from me, and from all the life around me.  The music was the embodiment of life, and spirit, and joy.  Everything I saw added to this beautiful melody.  I went into another room, a hallway this time, and a few soaring violin notes accompanied me.  The mellow feeling gave way to a kind of curious energy, as if I was using awe itself as fuel.
