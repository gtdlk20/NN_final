After dancing  once again, my friend and I decided to head back to the window. As we climbed out, we began laughing uncontrollably. I donÂ’t know to this day if it was because of how wonderful it felt to be on the outside world, or if it was because at 3 in the morning, we were climbing out a window staring up at the rooftops of houses. A light suddenly came on, we threw ourselves back on the bed. Who in the world was that? Had someone seen us? What would they have thought? This only made us laugh harder. How random. I love random events and awkward moments define my life, but this was a whole new chapter in the book. After about ten minutes and no one had pounded down the door, we relaxed and laid on the bed.
