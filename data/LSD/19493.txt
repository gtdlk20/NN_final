But anyway, back at the rave, my friend Pat (He was on BZP himself) decided he wasnt leaving the car, so we left him there. I persuaded my other friend (Alan) to join me on the dance-floor, and after much persuasion, he joined me. At this stage, I was having very vivd hallucinations, and hysterical laughter followed every stupid story I told.
