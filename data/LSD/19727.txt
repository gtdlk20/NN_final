Well I made a big mistake the other day that, luckily for me it turned out astonishingly well. I just acquired 6 hits of quite good acid that I was going to split and share with my girlfriend on a nice day. I woke up on Thursday morning and realised my mom - who was the one who could always tell I was on drugs - was in NJ and my dad was at work. We drop at 1:00 pm.
