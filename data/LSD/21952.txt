We start walking to nowhere in particular when A says I just want to shout and then proceeds to shout the word SHOUT! over and over. S and I find this hilarious but try to get him to stop because we did not want people to come see us in this state. At this point we are pretty deep in the woods and we decide that we are all done coming up so why not smoke some weed. Now I don't know if any of you guys have smoked weed while on acid but it goes from mild visual distortions and bright colors to full on things start to melt. Everything I looked at seemed to have an aura coming off of it, almost like a flame. It was hard to focus on anything in particular because everything became wavy. After a few minutes A loses his mind. He stands up takes off his shirt and starts screaming Thank you! S and I were like for what? Then A starts shouting Shout! again and runs away.
