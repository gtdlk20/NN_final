Soon the sun started setting and we had been out in the field for at least 2 or 3 hours.  So we decided it was best that we started heading back to Cs house for the rest of the trip.  And besides the dark it was getting really cold.  We all managed our way back to Cs house with little difficulty other than the face that I kept on noticing or rather not noticing certain fences.  When we arrived inside Cs house her parents at the time had company and we all had to greet them which was extremely hard to do because I kept losing my concentration.
