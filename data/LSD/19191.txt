Everything is going well and I feel the acid and I see the bands I intended on, so I pop the second. I feel the second everything is a little bit nuts but definitely something I have under control. I go see the last band I wanted to see of the night and me and my friends head back to our campsite. Im having a really good time when I get there so I decide to smoke a joint of this killer weed I had picked up specifically for Bonnaroo. I start to feel odd, unexplainably odd, I get into my tent take off my shoes and lay down onto my back looking up at the ceiling of the tent. I start to see some pretty intense waves on the walls, it starts to storm outside and the whole tent is shaking. Lighting was crashing all around me my heart was pounding and I felt as though I couldnt breathe. I feel myself being pulled away from everything around me very quickly. I tried to tell my friends I was having a bad trip, but they didnt know what to do because they didnt have any experience with psychedelics like I have. All I could do is lay there and take it in, suddenly I couldnt tell if my eyes were opened or closed. My first thoughts is that I was dead balancing between heaven and hell in some kind of purgatory type realm, I figured I ODd. I talked myself down by saying repeatedly to myself you cant OD on lsd. It became like a song in my head, a beat. After what felt like years I realized I wasnt dead and where I was. For a short amount of time I was under control.
