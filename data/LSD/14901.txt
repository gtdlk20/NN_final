I then stood up off the couch to see if I could walk, and that's when I felt the most terrible pain in my stomach. It hurt SO BADLY, that I couldn't even stand up straight. So I stood hunched over, my body basically forming a 90 degree angle, and I held my stomach in my hands and held on for dear life. I wondered how it was that I could be feeling a large butcher's knife stabbing at me, when there was nothing there! Oh the pain! Would it ever cease? All I wanted to do was stand up like a normal person! So, I kept fighting to right myself up, thinking that if I just kept stretching slowly, I could stand all the way up again. Whatever the case may have been, I would soon discover that this was VERY GOOD acid.
