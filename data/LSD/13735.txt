We actually make a group decision (a miracle!) to cut through the park ad head to another friend's house where a small gathering of other friends was taking place.  The walk through the park was of an indeterminate time frame (remember...it is vast!) when we finally reached the house.  I'm rocking at this point, still climbing.  I go to knock on the basement door and watch my hand get engulfed by the wood fibers of the door, but it's soft!!??!!  I turn to my fellows and mention that 'I hope they can hear me knocking in there because this door is so damn soft it's eating my hand.'  As soon as I turn around, a friend of mine opens the door and extends us an offer to come in.  She was smiling at us...she knew, right away, of what was afoot.
