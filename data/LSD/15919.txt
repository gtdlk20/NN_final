At one point I saw a train go by the window and my girlfriend saw a little girl standing in the middle of the room pointing towards a chandelier. There was a chandalier in the room but not where she saw it. At this point the music started getting overwhelming, my music selection was shitty as I kind of just figured pink floyd would be amazing, but in fact it was so bizarre it was actually scaring me, so we vigorously searched through my friends selection and found Good Charlotte. Yes - good Charlotte, we put it in and it was so corny that it made me happy! So were tripping out on the floor in her living room as my girlfriend is peeling/feeding me oranges and listening to Good Charlotte.
