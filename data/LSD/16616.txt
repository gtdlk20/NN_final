So I decided to start off with five hits at once then five more hits three hours after effects began. About 30 minutes after I took the first five hits I went into what I would call an instant peak. I was tripping very hard for only about an hour and a half when all of the intensity dropped. So I decided to take the other five hits and no increase occured. I thought for sure I would have crossed some kind of deminsions at this level but it didn't happen. I decided to wait a week and try again with a much larger dose. 10 Hits followed by 15 hits for a total of 25 hits. Now I wanted to time this so that I would get the maximum benefit of the LSD without wasting any. Basically I wanted to trip harder than I had ever before and get the maximum effect from each of these 25 hits. I had started to see a pattern developing also.
