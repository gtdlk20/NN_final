It was warm most of the night, mostly hot, thick like sweat in the air. There was a rock in the ground shaped like a heart. I had seen it before I thought, I had been in this moment before, but it was the optical illusion of the circular spinning motion of the drug, of all the  times my perception has been altered and shifted away and into else. An else mangled with nostalgia and déjà vu, the keys into understanding the current of life itself. A place I manage to explore each time these doors are opened, and information overflows, streaming through me like static electricity. She pointed the rock out and said This is how I feel about you M.J. I heart you. I wasnt sure what she exactly meant. I wondered and doubted whether or not she meant it the way I suddenly felt it reflecting toward her. I heart you too Lacy. Metaphorically and literally. I lingered around her as much as I could that night. I wish she had been with me, but I also understood that it was probably better that she eventually fade into the other bedlam of festive activities magnetically pulling people in, in relation to location and susceptibility. Im not sure if she had the greatest Halloween. She seemed greatly disappointed in something, reflecting that into herself.
