Dark.  A more pervading nothing than anyone can imagine.  It was terrifying.  It was ultimate void.  I got dizzy.  The fear started knawing at me.  The pages of the magazine got hot to the touch and I threw it on the desk.  I got so scared that I tried to throw up, but I could not.  I paced, and all the while praying for whatever else was left to hurry and end.  In my clumsy disorientation I hit the table and the magazine fell.  With luck, I hit the table hard enough and the monitor flicked back on from the mouse movement, I think.
