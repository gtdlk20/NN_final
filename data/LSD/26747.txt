Final thoughts-  Unfortunately, I feel I missed some of the insight that I found on earlier trips.  Maybe this was because I arranged such a comfortable time for us all.  My most profound trip was on a camping trip about 5 years ago.  Still, it was a very enjoyable time and I hope it's not my last LSD experience.
