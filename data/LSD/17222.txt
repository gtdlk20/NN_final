My mind set at this point and time was that I was really happy.  In fact I was overflowing with happiness at the time, I even mentioned to everyone that I was extremely happy.  As time went by I started noticing the trees off in the distance starting to split into different trees and wave back and forth as if it were breathing.  At some point and time Cs stereo had died due to lack of battery power.  My friend J though had a mandolin with him though (its a kind of folk instrument).  He at first began strumming it in the most awful way.  It made this horrible screeching noise that caused me to see the trees in the distance grow eyes and glare at him.  We all told him not to do that.  So he started playing something on it for real for a few minutes until he decided that he just couldnt concentrate enough to play.  We all agreed it was for the better because of the fact that it would create some horrible noises if he were to mess up.
