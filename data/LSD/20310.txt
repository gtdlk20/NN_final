I used to be a heroin 'junkie', an 'addict'.  That was how I defined myself.  I was the classic, tortured artist junkie.  I didn't know any other way drugs would be used other than to just feel good and to create an image for oneself.  I later quit and swore off all drugs all together.  That was the next way I defined myself, a preacher of the gospel of dangerous drugs.  After some time, talking with my roommate and friend Eric, and some thought I realized it was not drugs that abused me, it was I that had abused them.  I was the one that needed to change. I began experimenting once again, this time I listened to my experiences, in an attempt to not only have a good time, but to better myself.
