Arthur and I decided we should watch some TV.  At this point I was beginning to feel a definite claustrophobia.  My dorm is not very large, and my roommate and I were not much enamored of interior decorating, so the walls were essentially just blank plaster with conspicuous pipes poking out of the ceiling in some places.  It felt industrial in a terrible way.  All I wanted now was to relax and laugh a little, so we turned on cartoon network.
