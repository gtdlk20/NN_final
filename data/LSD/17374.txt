I have always had a hard time sleeping after an LSD trip, and this was no exception.  My mind started up with the circle of thoughts, over and over, and when I tried to go to sleep it felt like once I slipped over taht thin line between sleep and wake some vital function would stop, like my heart or breathing.  I began to wonder if the LSD was having some sort of reaction with my other medications (Neurontin for nerve pain and an antibiotic).  I would slip in and out of this paranoia, in which I though if I fell asleep I would die.  I kept waking M up and asking him to tell me I was OK, but he kept falling back to sleep.  I finally decided that since I was thinking I would die if I fell asleep, I just wouldn't
