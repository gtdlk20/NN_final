Somehow we end up in G's room trying to get comfortable. Lucky for us we had a strobe light available with color filters. I plug it in and set it on an open drawer with the green filter. Everything now starts to come in patterns. As G lied on his bed exploring the wonderful world of LSD, C and I tried to settle into these little gamers chairs but were relentless and eventually C pulled aside his chair and we both laid on the carpet.
