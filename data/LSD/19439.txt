The yelling escalates and so does my headache. There is still a great deal of disagreement about what to do. Should we leave the woods or continue hiking? All I know is that the chaos and confusion are mounting, and the trees are making me feel claustrophobic. Our group cant make it fifty feet without stopping, splitting up, and going bonkers. At one point, Liam leaps off the path and perches himself on a rock. Another time, wanders off to find a tree he can climb. Further along, Jamie runs ahead on the trail and I fear she is lost. Steve is relatively silent the whole time, but I can tell hes tripping just as hard as I am. The shouting continues and my head throbs. I sense that Im teetering on the edge of a bad trip, and I pray I dont start to panic. I am about to consider ditching everyone and getting the hell out of the woods, when somehow we come to a unanimous decision. We will turn around and head back. Hallelujah.
