On a more personal level, I suddenly started to stare at the two middle-aged men sitting in front of me: one of them looked Hispanic and pensive, while the other was a sleepy Asian. Such different people, probably with different lives, and different destinations. Yet for a few moments, they sat next to each other - closer than they must have goTen to the ones they actually longed for. We were all heading somewhere - to progress, to paTerns, to dreams. Their destination was just the same as mine, fulfillment.
