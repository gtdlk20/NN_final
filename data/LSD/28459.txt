I lost the complete 'core self' that we all have.  I term this 'core consciousness' - the part of you which is the experience of being 'you'.  Your 'I' if you like.  That went from me and all I was thinking about was 'This is insanity there is no 'I' I am just an amalgamation of sensory inputs, I do not exist.  I also thought that even though I was 19 I was wearing my mind out completely i.e. I thought I had the mind of a 100 year old person and so I was running out of my finite numebr of thoughts.
