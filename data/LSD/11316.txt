I am 16 and for a while now I have been terribly interested in psychodelic drugs. My first trip was nothing like I had expected. I can still remember looking across the dead parking lot on that cold Febuary nite, to see four trees bent in half at the trunk and expelling shadows that flashed beautiful psychddelic colours and spun around on an invisable axis. Ever since I witnessed the impossible, I have became aware of something intruiging: when I look in front of me, I once saw the empty space as nothing. Now I see something. Or at least I can feel it on some level. There is an energy flow that binds everything and makes everything function in the most ancient and perfect way.
