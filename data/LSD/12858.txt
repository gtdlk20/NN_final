When we passed by one of the houses I perceived something that looked like a gigantic bacterium wrapping itself around a street lamp. It was like an anaconda, but segmented, see-through, and had this energy vibrating off of it. It glowed on the edges. I wasn't sure what the hell it was and I tried asking A but he was in his own little world and just told me to stay off of that neighbor's property and to stop pointing. I asked him later what it was and he said it was probably a security system. I asked What kind of security system looks like that? I've never seen that in my life. He said Probably because you were high. Yet for some reason he was unable to describe what it looked like to me when I was sober. I have theories about that for another time.
