I went back and laid on the couch and reached out and felt like I made a spiritual connection with me uncle who I was very close to growing up. He was like my role model and I respect him. He is a very wise spiritual man. I felt overwhelmed with good vibes again and once again felt like I was purging out the negativity in my body. I called him and when he heard me rambling about how I dropped 7 doses and was tapped the fuck in and didnt remember what I was supposed to be doing here and I am totally lost and on and on and on he laughed. He said Matthew you need to go outside. Its a beautiful day and the earthly spirits will love you right now. Get up go outside and lay down in the grass and let yourself be engulfed with the positive spirits who will help you figure out what you are trying to do here. I replied saying I cannot go outside. He shot back Its not that you cannot go outside its that you are setting boundaries for yourself as you always do. Let go of your boundaries and travel outside. I looked out the window and it all looked so big out there (mind you I havent been out of my house at all in literally 3 or 4 months.. except for a few times with my daughters mother. I ditched most of my friends due to my anxiety that I have a hard time controlling) I just couldnt do it. My uncle continued to laugh and told me that everything would be alright and to keep purging out the negativity and thats the reason I had come to purge the negativity, the boundaries, the fear of responsibilities and maturity, and thinking to much of what other people think of me. It still didnt seem to clear to me at this point. What he said made since but he cut me short because he was at work leaving me confused and sort of upset with him.
