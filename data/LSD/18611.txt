It was my first time taking LSD and I was slightly nervous I must admit.  I have tried many other drugs before, but for some reason LSD was always one that I was unsure about.  I decided to go ahead with it and with my best friend (who is a frequent user of the drug) I decided to trip. We stayed at her house in her room where we listened to rock n' roll albums and created art projects. At 8:00 pm we took the first half of a tab, (I only wanted to take a small amount for fear that I might not enjoy it) and for the first hour or so I did not feel anything.  Then all of a sudden with out even realizing it I started laughing.  There was nothing that was outright funny, yet I could not stop myself from uncontrollably laughing.  My legs felt sort of jello-like and warm and tingly.  I could feel my blood circulate through my body; I was warm, happy and very pleasant.  Then all of a sudden my friend has some candles that were lit and she blew them out.  I did not know why, but I quickly stopped laughing and started crying.  I had tears running down my cheeks and was silently sobbing.  For some reason I was very upset the candles had been blown out.  I just had so much emotion inside of me that I had to release it in one form or another.  In this case I went from laughing to crying- yet I wasnt that sad.  I soon stopped crying and began to draw.  One thing I found frustrating was that it was very hard to concentrate while drawing.  I could not focus on my work and I also could not get what I was creating to come out the exact way I had wanted it to.
