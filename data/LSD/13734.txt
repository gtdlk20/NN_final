It took us a long time to reach the tree that was relatively close. The forest was just too alive to ignore. Plants were living right in front of me, and it was the most amazing thing. Green forest dwelling plants were sprouting and growing all around me as the trees swayed in the humid mid-day air. When we got to the tree, I noticed right-away that it was crawling with all kinds of strange creatures (indescribable beyond their roach sized, black bodies). We were wandering under the canopy for awhile, lost in the great nothing, never wanting to return to what I knew before. This feeling was common between the three of us and then my friend muttered,'we aren't lost, man...we have just been found...'
