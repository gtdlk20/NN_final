Set: This was about my 6th time taking acid. I'm starting to feel more comfortable with the drug each time, although there's always a lot of fear and madness during the strong trips, I see it as part of the experience, and I think I'm handling it well enough. I didn't sleep enough before tripping, and dropped at around 4:30AM, with an empty stomach and a bit tired to begin with. It's also worth noting that I've been reading Tim Leary's 'The Psychedelic Experience' and believe there's a lot of truth in it.
