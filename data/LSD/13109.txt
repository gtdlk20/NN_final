I tried to record a new message. I wanted to say that I was starting to become afraid, that I was having a bad time, that I was unhappy. I couldnt speak. I said it wont let me say bad things about it. D asked what it was. In my head I answered my trip, but I couldnt say it aloud. I dropped my phone onto the red leather chair, it sunk deeply into it, impossibly deeply, and became immersed in the leather, which more resembled a very thick paint. I guess Ill leave that there, I thought to myself, somewhat amused.
