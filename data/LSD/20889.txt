Knowing Bill would be there gave me a really good vibe for the nite. We dropped in the car on the way to the party at about 9pm. The blotters were named MAGIC, which i liked because i wanted it to be a magical evening. It kicked it quick for us, we all took 2 and 1/2 hits at the same time. Meg gave everyone vitamin C drops to help out our colors and visuals. I never really thought it did much but this nite it all seemed to flow so well. We get to the party, and there are so many people there, at this time the acid is starting to take effect and when we walk in we stayed in our little trip group and found a spot in the house where we could have our 'comfort zone'. We all decided to just sit for a bit and take in our surroundings before anything else. We were on the floor in a 4 person circle when i opened my bag and took out Bill. Everyone else at the party was drunk and smoking pot, we were the only ones on LSD. When i took Bill out and placed him in the center of our circle we all smiled and giggled because Bill started to smile with us, and gave us strength that the nite would go smoothly. This little 10inch ceramic Gnome became the center of our 'comfort zone' and many of the drunks were already making fun of us, but we all looked at eachother and nobody cared because Bill was giving us courage and strength. He knew us and they did not.
