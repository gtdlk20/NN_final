I decided to go to a rave this last weekend in New Haven, CT, in probably the largest venue I had seen a techno party anywhere, at the New Haven Colliseum.  I had been in the techno scene a few years back but kinda got jaded from the commercialism and the lack of PLUR and bad vibes that had begun to develop in the US techno scene these last few years.  however, I had never done acid at a techno party and had decided that I would give it a try, as I had grown into different interest, particularly tribal and goa trance.
