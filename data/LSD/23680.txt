My stimulation prompted me to experiment with closing my eyes again, and my lord, am I glad I did it - it was insane. At first, I got the same hazy, dark fractals from before, but they seemed much more detailed. Still hazy, but detailed. They didnt stick around for too long, as the mandala I saw broke apart, and turned into a tunnel I was catapulted into. Thats when I got why they call this tripping. I thought I was in the front row of a roller coaster, which would take me to different sights, and stop at certain locations for a few seconds more.
