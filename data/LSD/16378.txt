I immediately recognized the voice of my girlfriend sobbing.  Her cat was dying.  Now, she's not really cool with me using drugs, and so I tend to keep it on the down low.  We sort of have a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy.  Now, keep in mind I was out of my skull on acid.  It was awful. I blurted out that my friend Casey was on acid and I was babysitting him, so I couldn't come see the cat one last time and be with her, though I normally would.  The conversation was sorta fucked up and I might have been incoherent, but she was crying and my cell gets bad reception, so she didn't catch on I was flying too... though at the time I was worried she had some inkling.
