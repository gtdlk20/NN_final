I tapped his name but nothing happened. The letters were just pushed out of the way. No! I thought, why wont you let me? I fiddled with the other functions of my phone, which was now trapezoidal in shape and a foot long. The screen was all gray and would not display color. I returned to snapchat. It was frozen. My trip wont let me talk to AJ. But maybe I had? My eyes bored into the text that read 19m ago. Hadnt minutes passed? What was happening?
