I remember walking into the kitchen and catching something this beautiful girl from my school said.  She said, Ill never look at him the same.  At that moment, she turned her head and smiled at me, indicating that she was talking about me. She had been discussing my incredible will; it was as if she wanted me. I felt amazing.
