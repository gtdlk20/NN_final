On many occasions I have used LSD to enhance the visual aspect of the event but always staying to a moderate dose to avoid any possible complications (police, other substances). However, I recently decided that I was going to do a little self-experimenation with some of the strongest paper acid I have ever taken. The purpose of this experiment was to find out if it is possible to waste my supply of LSD by taking too much. For instance, When I smoke Marijuana in a blunt or if I roll up a really fat hog-leg, I use more Marijuana but obtain the same high as if I had only smoked a bowl (minus the nicotine effect in a blunt).
