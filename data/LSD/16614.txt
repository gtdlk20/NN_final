I got to my girlfriend's house. I'd probably been tripping about 2.5 hours at this point, and was high. Peaking even.  I was feeling sad about the cat, worried about pulling off what I had to pull off. I'd never needed to pass for sober for a prolonged period of time before, and was gonna be with my girlfriend, her teenage brother, and her god fearing mom.  I had visuals, racing thoughts, a 'body high' feeling, etc.  So, the door opened, everyone was there, this cat was dying and stuff, they were supposed to spend some time with the cat, then take him in to be put down (vet's advice).
