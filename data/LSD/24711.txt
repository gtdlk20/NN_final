This wasnt a flaw tho. This njust enhanced the experience for me, it was incredible. WE got there early and had a few drinks, and i brought some salvia and pipe which made a few friends to start with! a couple of my mates took mdma fairly early so me and a few other mates went hunting for acid. Of course i now knpow what people mean when they say that You dont find LSD, LSD finds you. This all seemed alot like someone who had spent too much time on LSD, but it makes sense now.
