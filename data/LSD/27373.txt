Whilst massaging my leg I remember that my leg was starting to fade in green and red fractals and the floor was alive with sparks of these patterns.  All I could think was 'oh for gods sake not now'  I didn't panic then and was more pissed of that I couldn't benefit the picture because of the cramp.  A girl materialised with a glass of water-'...just as you asked-'  I smiled and wondered when I had asked her.
