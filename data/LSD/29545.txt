I would like to note that though I had caught a buzz at the bar I was totally sober by the time I dosed. I went into this with physical and mental acceptance and eagerness. I was very confident and in positive state of mind. I did not go into this expecting spiritual revelation and I think because of this, recieved none. I looked at it more like a science experiment. And one I will try again. I was never really scared, though sometimes I would spook myself with my reflection and wander off to do something else before coming back to play in the mirror. I never once during my trip regretting taking acid and look forward to doing it again soon. I've also found that while writing this account I have been able to better understand some of the things I was feeling/thinking at the time of my trip. Also, I THOROUGHLY researched the physical and mental effects of LSD. I read trip reports, both good and bad. I read about how people coped with a bad trip and how they, with positive thinking, were still able to turn their trip into a positive experience. Simply put I was well prepared.  With that in mind, I hope this account has been useful to anyone considering tripping for the first time. The next time I trip I will be with friends and hopefully do it during the day. Yup, can't wait!
