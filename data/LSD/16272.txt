I don't know how long I spent just observing the little one, since I was almost completely enraptured by this living being. Some hallucinations occured the same time, like feathers everywhere, with a caressing feeling and a bit of euphoria. They were caressing me and the rabbit, like we were best of friends. Suddenly I just snapped out of it and gave him something to eat and went back to my room. I started to feel tired again and went to bed, and put on Shpongle - Nothing Lasts.
