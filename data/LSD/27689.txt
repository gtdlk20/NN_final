that explanation doesn't really do justice to the experience, but it's always good to share good trips in some way. has anyone else done something similar with good results? again, I wouldn't recommend doing something like this, but it just so happened that I did it. wasn't planned at all, it just came together to create one of the best trips I've ever had.
