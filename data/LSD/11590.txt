I dont really know what happened next. I think I passed out and had a kind of fever dream of a tall red figure asking me if I was ready to die. Some of my friends think this was Satan, but I dont think so; the figure didnt come across as menacing. When I chose to return to Earth, I almost immediately woke up. I checked the time again. 12:00 AM.
