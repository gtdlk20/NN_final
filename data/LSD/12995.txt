AJ, I forgot to use your name in all the other recordings, causethe underlying feeling is Im not telepathic, and thats really frustrating. Like I feel like I should just be able to instantly impart emotion and sensation into somebody else, and that was what I wanted to do. Why I started making these recordings and then I started getting giggly cause its supposed to be serious. I just wanted you to know that I was having what I perceived to be a profound experience, and I was thinking about you, and like that experiencing it without you is kind of a deficit in my experience. But thats ok. It was just like the realization that you couldnt just feel what I felt, filled me with a real sadness. im just experiencing emotions like purely. [laughs] Its definitely extremely pleasant. Im actually just trying to stay really calm right now so that I can talk. Probably a lot of what Im saying sounds completely insane. I just realized that. I dont really know when Im speaking out loud versus when Im just thinking. This like line between consciousness.that part all makes sense. Its all very blurred. Like I get why thats always brought up. Its just like you feel like you should be able to know and feel everything at the same time, and you kind of do, and its really awesome. Hey this recording went like a full fucking ten times longer than all the other ones. Good job, go me, Im gonna stop it now.
