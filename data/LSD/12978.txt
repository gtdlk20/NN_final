I lay down on my bed for a rest.  At that point, my phone rang.  The call-display said it was my dad.  I didn't answer and he left me a voicemail message, which I listened to.  At that point I started to get very emotional.  I love my dad but in my life I have let him down.  My dad is a far better person than me - he loves me and wants me to succeed but I know I am a disappointment to him.  I have become extremely isolated and distant from him even though I do love him in my heart.  The thought of me not being able to talk to him because I was strung up on drugs made this fact really hit home.  At this point I imagined how my dad feels - totally out of control, not understanding what happened to his son, not understanding why his years of efforts have slowly gone awry.  I cried uncontrollably, which I haven't done in years.  Tears seemed to explode out of my eyes for several minutes. I imagined how my Dad must feel to 'lose control' and see his son growing so for apart from him, and my brain actually lost control, spiraling in random directions and confusion as I imagined his confusion.  I kept apologizing: 'I try my best Dad!  I really do!'  but the tears kept coming.
