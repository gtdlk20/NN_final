But I think all the krap about emergency room bad trips is exaggerated, dark-age hyperbole. And last time I dropped I looked out my 4 story window, not jumped. LSD's LD50 is evidence that it is no harmful to the body than water is. It is beneficial to the mind and soul when used properly. It simply changes your perspective, shifts your dimensions a bit. Like Alice down the rabbit hole, its a strange, but fun and stimulating adventure.
