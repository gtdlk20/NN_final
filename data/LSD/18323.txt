Looking back on it now I definitely dont have a problem with moderate and responsible use of things like cocaine or alcohol (especially when its pure) but at this moment while tripping when I was thinking about how disgusting and bad these things are it was just because I was in a really virtuous and spiritual headspace with no ego whatsoever. And its mostly ego that allows people to do these toxic dangerous hard drugs like nobodys business. Its also mostly their egos that allow them to do it and have a good time while doing it even though theyre essentially poisoning themselves. I felt like my tripping friend was having deep and similar thoughts, maybe even the same thoughts since he had that same coke too and around the same time I did just a few months before this trip. I dont know it just kept feeling like we were sharing the same headspace. This headspace was very crazy.
