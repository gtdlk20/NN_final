One of my friends parents were going away for the night so him and his sister threw a party.  Myself and a few other friends took the acid in a nearby house and then headed over to the party straight away. Now Ive had acid that has taken 3 hours to come up, but normally it takes an hour or two. However this time it felt as if we were coming up on the walk round, which was only 10 minutes at the most.
