Throughout my trip, a key piece of artwork popped up often. An extremely psychedelic piece of artwork, a side-piece to my room, cycled through millions of colors. Seeing black and white was simply a matter of perception. This art felt as if it was a living piece of emotion, a snapshot of the artist's feeling and life at the time of the creation. It was up to me to interpret this in a personal way, and I feel it followed the general trip mentality of big-shark little-shark.
