Damn, this is weird.  Everything I look at is funny, the ashes of pot look like fleas running away, and it is so freaking dark. I took a walk by myself outside; the grass was cool-wet and I felt like a ball of energy, the size of my fist, where my heart would be with two wires attached to my eyes; Hovering. Like Emerson on once wrote, I become a transparent eyeball. This was at 12:00 am and I still had six hours left.
