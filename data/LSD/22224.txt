After setting up my campsite at Bonna 09, I was lying on the grass trying to stay out of the sun when a guy in his mid 20s walked up to me and asked me if I wanted some molly. I said no politely and he proceeded on his way, before he was out of view though I yelled across for him to come back. I asked him if he knew where I could get some acid. He told me to follow him, I did. We walked two tents over from mine to a group of tents under a large green tarp, that I later named tent city. The guy said wait here and walked into the darkness that lurked in tent city, about a minute later he returned with another mid 20s guy.
