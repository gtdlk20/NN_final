That night LSD really handed my mind to me on platter and let me see inside. It was an amazing experience to have total ego-death and to question ideas like self I and real with total conviction. But it is also an experience that gave me a huge appreciation and respect for the drug. High dose LSD is not for everyone but in the right conditions with right mind set it can be amazing. I wouldnt say this experience was good or bad I was in a world in which those concepts where non existentit was simply an experience and a reminder of how fragile reality actually is.
