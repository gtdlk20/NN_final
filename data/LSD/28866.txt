I snapped from my trance once the blue disappeared from the screen and decided to go downstairs and put on some music and wash the dishes.  I went downstairs, where I found Justin on the back porch in the light rain staring up at the stars.  At this point (T +2:45) I was starting to peak, and the outside wasnt the place to be for me  mainly because the raindrops landing on the hood of the gas grill turned into serpent-like eyes, and then they looked like serpent scales and the grill turned into a huge dragon.  I went inside and put some Phish and Grateful Dead in the CD player on random and began the dishes.  When the dishes were over, I had just reached my plateau for the night (T + 3:15), and Justin and I went back upstairs to sit in the bonus room (big living room area over the garage with the computer and entertainment system, etc.) and burn some incense and listen to some music and trip our minds off.
