There was a void of pure light with a very simple temple far in the distance, pyramidal but flat topped with no outer inscriptions beyond a rune above the door. I think this was the name of God. I can't remember what we said, but we spoke for a time, and when the time came to return to my body, it felt ravaged. Particularly by drink.
