I entered without incident, and spent the next hour and a half just talking with J and B and watching J play computer games.  They both left around 12, and feeling full of energy, I decided I would stay up and listen to music.  I listened to two albums straight through, Lateralus by Tool, and Hail to the Thief by Radiohead.  Both albums sounded amazing - sound was literally orgasmic, and my closed eye visuals were synced with the music. sound was literally orgasmic, and my closed eye visuals were synced with the music.  I listened to some Acid Mothers Temple as well, before deciding it was finally time to get some sleep, because I had work at 10:30 the next morning.  Finding sleep was difficult, but I finally managed to drift off around 4 am.  I woke up the next morning feeling completely refreshed, with no 'burn out' feeling or any residual effects.
