Perhaps in a lapse of judgement, I waited for the wind to pause, sparked my lighter and took a long toke on my pipe, followed by another to finish off the bowl. A few moments later I got up from my chair, laid down in the grass and looked up at the sky. I could feel every single blade of grass massaging against my skin. In a single moment I became aware of everything that had led me to this moment. My senses and my consciousness seemed vitally linked. I felt alive and vibrantly awake with everything I had. I was completely unaware of my body yet I was overwhelmed with a euphoric cocktail of sensory and emotion, it brought tears to my eyes. I was crying harder than I ever had before. I was crying harder than I did during the saddest moments of my life, and it was because I was so happy. , because for that moment I think I felt what I could only describe as absolute love and understanding.
