At some point when I return back to the dining room table I start looking around the table and this one piece of paper caught my eye. I guess this was a lettera private letter but how was I supposed to know? It was in plain view along with everything else and not even hidden so why would it be private? I wasnt even thinking about what it was or might be. The only reason my eyes were drawn to it was because the table was a mess with papers and books but it was the only thing on the table that had cursive writing on it so visually it really stuck out. At least with the LSD mindset.
