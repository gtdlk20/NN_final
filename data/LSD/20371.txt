She seemed very short at one point too when she walked around and made movements and she seemed like a witch/gnome hybrid or mix or something odd like that. Like some kind of mythical or folklorish character or archetype that hadnÂ’t been named yet. She almost seemed to look kind of ogreish in some ways and the way her mouth looked started to change. I remember her hair looked extremely trippy and vivid and seemed really vibrant and glossy and at some points even started changing lengths and texture. It also became clear to me that I was on real shit because I began to view her visually from a nonhuman alien perspective and my whole attitude about what I was seeing was drastically changed and broadened.
