I went to my mailbox after getting off of work Wednesday, I work the night shift, and found a small package that I thought looked like it might be it.  Breathless with anticipation I took my mail up to my apartment.  I put everything else away then set about opening my mysterious package.  This had been a great night already because I girl I liked texted me at work all night.
