Setting: An outdoor rave (in Israel, where I'm from) with a couple of good friends I usually drop with. A lot of strangers, a lot of mess, a lot of noise. But we have some experience with these events and we put up a good tent, places to sit, cold drinks, etc. We dropped right before sunrise and after a couple of hours it got pretty hot.
