I had wanted to try LSD forever, as long as I could remember, but it was so elusive.  Finally with my new job and my life in order I sought to find it again.  This time I came armed with a bit of knowledge that to my surprise, most people (even drug users) are not privy to- Silk Road.  I narrowed down my purchase, from LSD to shrooms, back to LSD, etc.  Made a list of potential products and vendors and the price in bitcoins, which I converted into dollars.
