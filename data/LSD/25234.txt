Pre-Babble: This was to be one of many experiences with LSD, the first being 6 months beforehand, at the age of 15. This particular story I choose to dwell upon as I felt it left numerous festering loose-ends in the intricate channelling of my brain. Since being noted 14 Ive been smoking the greenery consistently and have downed various substances (Ketamine, Noss, Meth): I know the density of emotion/vacancy that drugs tend to evoke and am therefore less susceptible to fabricated paranoia etc  which relates to the below tale as it was composed mostly of fear and negativity.
