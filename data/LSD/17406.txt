I guess I will give a little background on my drug use. I consider myself fairly experienced with mind-altering substances. I am a daily pot smoker for a little over a year now and I have done mushrooms about 7 times previous to this experience, so I felt I had a good understand of what was about to take place, even though this was my first time taking LSD.
