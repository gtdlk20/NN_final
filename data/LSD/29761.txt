My next class is with one of my good friends; he had no idea I was on acid, but I showed him the poem I had written earlier; he couldnt read my handwriting.  Class started and, maybe because I was in the front row this time, I started to feel like I was going to be called on and put on the spot in front of everybody.  I couldnt shake the feeling, especially since I had not read the required material for the day.  This developed into a sort of paranoia, which I believe I was only able to pull myself out of because I am very experienced with psychedelics.  At times I felt like running out of the classroom; I was truly scared.  Anyway, I was better able to comprehend what was going on during the duration of class, but I could not write the notes as well in my notebook; I would later use them to study and I found them to be comparatively, to the other class days, sub-par.  Class ends at 3:15 p.m. and not a moment too soon for I was tired and just wanted to chill for the remainder of my trip.  Which I did, and ended up having a tremendous afternoon and evening.
