trip #1:  I just recently, about two months ago, went on my first acid trip....I had smoked pot occasionally, but that's about it until that first time.  My fiance and I recieve two hits from a friend, two tiny little purple squares that completely changed my life.  We each took them at about 1 in the morning.  At 3ish we began our long, glorious journey with constant, hilarious giggling...then about 4 the visuals started.....  I was afraid at first, but I immediately calmed myself not wanting to start the trip off bad.  After a few minutes we went outside onto the deck, and were feeling extremely randy so we attempted sex, which was hilarious, because about halfway through, I looked up at the sycamore tree growing in our back yard and it started to 'grow'...I immediately lost all interest in the task at hand...and actually sat there so long, that brent said that when we snapped out of it my skin was cold..... so that was the main theme of our trip...that big, beautiful, growing tree, that would start to be 'pulled' into the sky by the 'wind', while growing in spiraling vines, each leaf shimmying independantly.
