My mind was quiet. I wasnt worried about anything and I was starting to get the idea that this is what it was all about; being present in the moment. I was starting to get the idea that this is what it was all about; being present in the moment. I wanted to test this idea by creating what I considered to be the perfect moment for myself, and basking in it. So I made some chai, loaded some very potent cannabis into my pipe, turned my music up and stepped outside. I sat down in my favorite chair on my patio and paused for a moment to take it all in. The piercing sun was presenting the most beautiful blue sky I had ever seen, with strips of clouds that looked like they had been painted on by a French impressionist. It was 60°F outside, the 20mph winds were crashing into me with every gust, seemingly in synchronicity with my music. Without a doubt, I was sure I had created the perfect moment, and I was immersed in it.
