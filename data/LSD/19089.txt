10:30 ~ My friend seems sleepy laying in his bean bag infront of the TV, his brother mostly on his phone - we chat every few minutes. I feel very stimulated and awake from the acid, watching the show and enjoying the visuals on the screen and the walls and ceiling. The visuals have begun to heavily gain in intensity. My mind set feels overall good, but strange in the sense that I'm recollecting on a conversation with my girlfriend about pregnancy. This gives my mindset an eerie and rather haunting emotional vibration. We we're worried about it for her from a sexual encounter, and are getting a test in two days. My thoughts on it seem positive yet negative at the same time, some mild fear and loathing accompanied by re - assured positivity and resolve.
