My friends used to do acid quite frequently at my house but I was unsure about it and the way it made them act very differently, it was kind of scary because of its unfamiliarity. My best friend N used to do it often and we had a lot in common in the way we think about things, so one Friday night I decided to take it with him at his house and see what all the fuss was about.
