On a deeper level, we learned how to let go.  Our memories aren't the only part of us that come and go naturally and spontaneously. Actually, I believe every aspect of our lives occurs somehow spontaneously and beyond 'our' control.  Basically, when we become self-conscious and grasp at ourselves and try to somehow control our natural processes, we go against the course of nature. We seem to do it because we want to make our minds more trustworthy.
