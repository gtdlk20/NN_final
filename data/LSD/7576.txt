This experience had a long-term impact on me, specifically with respect to my use of marijuana.  Speaking only of this substance in itself, I found it to be a very clean and cerebral trip.  There were some visuals early on but they were not the prominent part of the experience.  The effects of this drug, for me, basically manifested as flashes of thought or 'insight' that came into my head without effort.
