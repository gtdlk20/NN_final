It was 31st night 2005 on a beautiful beach in goa at a trance party , 11:25pm,  when I did my first drop of LSD n nothin happend for about 30 mins so I said might as well do another trip... This time it was a blotter a red heart... 15 mins into it and I was on another plane, cos both trips hit me and came on at the same time....both intensely potent I'd realised...
