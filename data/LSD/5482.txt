I ventured outside again and felt my breath leave my throat.  I was enraptured.  The sky that had been so perfectly, absolutely blue only a few hours ago was now a violet so gorgeous and benign that the strength left my knees and I sat loudly on the ground with a loud 'oomph!' sound.  This violet color was reflected on the surface of the water as an intense, fiery orange.  The sun itself had turned a red so deep it seemed a burning ball of blood in the sky.   All around, waves of colored smoke-light (it had the characteristics of both) began to caper and dance.  They distinctly seemed to be sentient, and benevolent.  I reached my hand into one of them and at that point I had an epiphany.  I realized that nothing is unimportant, and everything matters.  For some people this might seem obvious, but the idea struck me at the time as being crucial, and central to my own personal beliefs.  The sun finished its performance, and the stars made their way onto the stage.  The sky became a vast, black painted sheet of canvas, and the stars gleamed like cold jewels in the night sky.  They rippled and undulated, as if they were pleased with their own beauty.
