Mike convinced me to go for a walk in the neighborhood. It was nighttime, but I have never seen so many colors in the dark before. Everything had its own distinct pattern: the sidewalk was done up in wavy stripes, the sky had some other psychedelic 60's looking pattern, etc. Dozens of metallic colors were all over the place. Everything had zillions of trails outlining it; my own body had so many trails dancing around it that I felt like I was wearing a thick astronaut suit. Thus, I was walking with my legs apart and arms out.
