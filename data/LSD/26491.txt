At once, it began to rain. Just a slight shower, but what an incredible experience! I was on my back, staring straight up into the sky, with the rain falling around me! I saw tracers on each raindrop, creating a kind of random 'tunnel' around me, stretching off into the clouds. I opened my mouth to taste the rain. It jostled and sparked in my mouth, all at once sweet, salty, bitter and sour. I was overcome by the sensory information being transmitted to my brain by my tastebuds. The rain stopped as quickly as it had begun, and we all decided to roll over and look at the world.
