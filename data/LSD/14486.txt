By the time I took control of what was going on customers and more employees had started to arrive. The first order of the morning came up, and I took some pizzas off the dough rack to sauce and cheese. The color and texture of the sauce was very strange. As I looked down the line of toppings, they all seemed to turn animated, like a poor cartoon drawing. I started to laugh to myself at the sight of it all, and the more I laughed the funnier everything became. As the smell of fresh baked pizzas filled the kitchen I realized why I was feeling so uneasy; I hadnt eaten all day. So I threw some breadsticks in the oven to have something to snack on. Just then one of my good friends who also works at Chuck E. Cheeses came in, coincidentally she is also the girl I have been secretly in love with for about a year. We always flirt at work so I ran up to her and threw my arms around her. It felt like my arms had stretched out to wrap around her tiny body two or three times and I squeezed her tight. As I let go of her she looked at me and smiled the prettiest smile I had ever seen. She seemed to have a sort of extra glow about her today, I couldnt put my finger on it. Whatever it was, I really liked it. The weariness of the acid had almost immediately vanished and I was comfortable again.
