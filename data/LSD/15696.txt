As with looking at ourselves and each other, when I looked at my girlfriend her head would grow and shrink, and her eyes (which she has nice big eyes as is) would grow huge, as well as her feet, but the rest of her body shrunk. It was if we were in Sonic the Hedgehog or Mario - actually she looked like a hedgehog, or tails from Sonic. At one point I saw my girlfriend was doin something weird with her arm, she was like trying to grab something in the sleeve of her sweatshirt with her hand. I asked her what she was doing and she said that her hand was lonely and wanted to meet another body part. At one point we were standing in the kitchen and I was saying how I was hungry and could go for a snickers bar. All of a sudden she's like yeah!... Jesse.... and that was it. I knew the rest of what she was going to say as one time Jesse gave us a snickers bar when we came home rolling and needed food bad, I knew the rest of what she was going to say because her memory actually transfered to me visually, I saw it happen in front of my eyes at that moment.
