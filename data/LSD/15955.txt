The five of us had gathered in the living room, the door was shut and we had circled a coffee table/stool and began talking again whilst rolling up a few spliffs. This was a difficult task as concentrating on anything for more than a moment or two was almost impossible. We would occasionally break into fits of laughter and we each had huge grins on our faces for the duration of the evening. It was not long before we got a call from a few friends who wanted to pay us a visit. I remembered that a few hours earlier they had called to say that they were on their way. At the time it sounded like a good idea but I was no longer sure. It was late and I was perfectly happy with the people that already surrounded me. The pair had arrived and were waiting for us nearby. We had no choice now but to meet them and hope for a quick resolution (i.e. that they would decide to go home, allowing us to do the same).
