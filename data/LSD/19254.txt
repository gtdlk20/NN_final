I've also heard that you shouldn't look at yourself in the mirror while you trip. I did this anyway, out of curiosity, expecting to see someone who wasn't me. It was me, with pupils as big as saucers, but it was me. I looked up close however, and saw every pore on my face it seemed like. It also looked like I had broken out with a million tiny red pimples. I quickly removed myself from the mirror upon this inspection.
