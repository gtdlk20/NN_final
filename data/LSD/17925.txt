By this time I was really getting overwhelmed by the visuals and had to turn off the TV and reduce the stimulation. Madonna's video came on and I couldn't understand it, but it had some powerful images and I liked the music. I was giving myself worrying thoughts. How would I know if I did something to hurt myself? What would prevent me from drinking poison or stabbing myself or mistaking a housemate for an evil being and killing them, etc., etc., etc., ad nauseum into the most extruciating loops of yes/no, 'who said that, 'who said that?'.'
