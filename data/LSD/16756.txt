By this time it is about 2 or 3hours into the trip.  The steep climb of the high is evening out to its plateau.  We hear a single car approaching on the nearby road, and it is pretty much the only sound that is around us right then, and we both tune our ears to it, listening to the nighttime driver getting closer to the round-about that is right up the street from our apartment complex. As we listen, we hear the tires suddenly start to squeal, and then screech, and then SLAM!, and with hair raising clarity we can hear the EEEEEEEE of the car horn stuck on. We look at eachother with the classic, 'Oh, SHIT!' faces. M pauses, then says, 'I have to call 911.'  M runs into the house, gets the cordless phone and brings it outside.  He holds the phone in his hand and stares at it, and I know exactly what he is thinking: Shit, am I coherent enough to do this? I'm so fucking high, but I have to call.  So he calls.  After M reports what we heard, the dispatcher takes his name and adress, and we hope that the cops don't come and try to talk to us.  M hangs up the phone.  The car horn is still stuck, but it shuts off after a few more minutes. I try not to imagine the reasons why it got stuck, or how it turned off.  Soon we hear the approaching sirens, and tow truck.
