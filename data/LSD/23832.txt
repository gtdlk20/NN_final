We began to walk around the concourse. As we walked we both saw a strange boy, probably a few years older than us. Not sure if he was tripping too or if he had before and could tell we were under the influence and wanted to mess with our heads, but he stared directly at us with his beady little eyes and stuck his tongue out. Now what we saw was one of those big lizard kinds with the forked tongue. That was the first part of this experience that really freaked me out. I can only assume that he actually existed since we both saw him. A bit stunned, we continued on our way.
