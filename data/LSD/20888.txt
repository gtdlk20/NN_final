I have taken LSD many times. There are only a precious few trips that really stick out in my mind as an EXPIERIENCE, this is a letter about one of them. I was with my best friend/trip buddy Meg, and we decided to go to a party and take some acid. My other friend Nikki and her date (a guy i never met before) decided to come to the party with us, and trip also. This was fine because i love Nikki and this guy she was with was cool and had a positive attitude. On the flipside, the party we were going to was going to be intense. A lot of my ex-girlfriends were going to be there along with people i didnt like and a lot of strangers. The party was at a 2 floor apt. in a bad city. During recent acid trips my best friend Meg and I had we became bonded with this ceramic garden Gnome that i had in my room. For reasons i cant explain he was our tripping buddy and we named him BILL THE TRIP GNOME. He has a wise smile on his bearded face and seems to have brought us peace and comfort during our recent acid trips. We knew it was gonna be a crazy nite, so we all decided to bring Bill the Gnome to the party with us. I put him in my backpack along with other things to prepare me for the nite. I alwasy have certain things with me if im doing acid away from home, the things i brought that nite besides Bill the Gnome were, some beer because i like to drink a little when i trip. I also brought a change of clothes in case i did something stupid and got dirty or sweaty. I also had my glow toys which included a squishy glow ball(red) and green glow sticks. I also have asprin just in case of a headache. So I was prepared physically and mentally for a good trip...
