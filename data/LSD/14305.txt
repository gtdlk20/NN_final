This is where I lose consciousness, and drift into sleep. I'm guessing the trip lasted 8-10 hours, and when I woke up, I was not at baseline, but felt an energy that shielded me from negative thought.  Sunny and I watched a live concert DVD of Led Zeppelin, and discussed drug use by bands of their hayday.  The legend of Jimi Hendrix onstage with a handfull of acid tabs under his sweaty headband.  The retreats made by Led Zeppelin to create the inspired music which I believe is empowering to the inquiring listener.  We sat and smoked the rest of the cannabis, and if there was a state of being that could be sustained indefinitely, I would choose this.  Calm, Peaceful, Bliss.
