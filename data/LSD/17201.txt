The next day I woke up with a brutal headache and everything was too bright for me, so I had to wear sunglasses the entire day. It was pretty ruthless doing 320ug for my first time, however, I did not experience any bad trip (which I have later from taking lower dosages of different acid) nor did I feel nauseated or like throwing up or experiencing diarrhea (which generally happens as I come down from hallucinogens). My body recovered extremely well other than the pounding headache which I got rid of with some painkillers or paracetamol. I can't remember all of the trip vividly, but it was the most intense experience I've ever had with drugs, moreso than cocaine, speed, mushrooms, hashish, etc.
