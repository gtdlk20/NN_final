That was the state we were in when we finally said 'Forget it!' and relaxed. We figured, 'you just forget it, but don't TRY to forget it'. We didn't even discuss it or think about it much.  We didn't have to TRY to relax, we just let go. It was perhaps the greatest, most peaceful moment of my life.
