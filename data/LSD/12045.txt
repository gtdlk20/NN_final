There were 18 hits in total for a group of four acid veterans who were very sketchy about this whole bubblegum business; it was the first we'd ever heard of such a thing. It was me who had found this dude giving us the stuff, and we were already beginning to think we were getting ripped off. Acid is very hard to come by in the great state of Texas, so we knew there would be hell to pay if this son of a bitch runs off with our cash. I gave the man $160 and he drove away in on his moped. 'What kind of drug dealer drives a fucking moped!?' my friend Cody asked, 'I had better fucking trip or I'm gonna find that guy and kick his ass!' Our patience wore thin as the guy was 4 hours late, but there it was, 16 hits plus 2. Now something you must understand, acid is not a fairly common drug around these parts. Hell, I felt proud of myself that I had even found any, but when you do find some it's usually weak and you have to take so much of it that you get pissed for spending all that money.
