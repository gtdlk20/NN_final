I got back to my dorm at 4:30a.m. and had so many horrible emotions now flowing through me, but everyone was asleep and there was nobody to talk to. The acid made it impossible to sleep, and no matter what I did, the emotions only got stronger. I tried not to think about it, but that only made it worse, so did cigarettes. I felt trapped. I couldn't sleep, there was nobody around, who knew how many wonderful sensual things Megan was now experiencing without me. There was nothing I could do. I stayed up until 11:00a.m when I had class, because I was unable to sleep. Those 6 and a half hours were the worst of my entire life.
