What blew my mind as well was the fact that I took presumably 300 millionths of a gram and it had my consciousness crackling like a transformer- I could imagine the trace amount of LSD being like a key to my mind.  It was such a good feeling, like it was supposed to be there, taking every brain activity to another level.  Before the trip I asked my friend what it was like and she said that it was kind of speedy, like it could get going and my mind would not be able to slow down, but I found that I liked this as well.  I was full of energy while I was on it, and when I would get the idea to go do something and do it was like yay!  Like look out the balcony door- wow it looked crazy outside.  Like some kind of movie in sepia or something.  I wanted to go out for a walk but that seemed an almost impossible task considering I could hardly make dinner.  Plus it was about 30 degrees out.  I am an adventurous person by nature so I almost did it, but I didnt want to go to too much effort and freeze myself and I was having such an experience inside.
