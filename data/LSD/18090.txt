As I sat by the computer trying to figure something to do I watched the girl on the summer playlist video thumbnail. Suddenly everything went dark, the pleasant picture of a young woman turned into a witch and a dark fog shrouded my periphery. I was a bit startled by this and tried to reach for the mouse to change the music. My hand looked sick, morphing into a green/purple disgusting extremity. I realised what was going on, stood up and walked into another room. It helped immediately (thanks internet!).
