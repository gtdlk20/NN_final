I ventured back inside and turned the t.v on, browsing at large.  It started to become complicated as the buttons began to change, sometimes as part of a pattern, sometimes at random.  A short time later, they began to drift from the face of the remote itself!  Laughing like a loon, I tossed the oddity of a remote back onto the table, where the clean grain of the cherry wood swam over it and devoured it.  I smirked at this odd sight, completely at ease, and refocused my attention on the movie.   It was an old favorite of mine, but I found vision being routinely drawn away to a large, white wall on my right.  I eventually gave up watching the t.v to focus my full attention on the wall.  Complicated fractal and runic patterns would arise spontaneously on its surface, only to be seconds later subducted into the ether.  Chaos would destroy order, which would instantly arise in another form.  I saw planets rise and fall, stars form, reason melt and the very fabric of the universe be torn open, to spontaneously be pulled back into the plasma of the wall, and then spit back out in another form.  At times I could only interpret the colors as noise, the sounds as color.  I could visibly see the music from the clock radio on the counter traveling from point to destination, but I could not for the life of me make out the digital readout of the clock.  I became very preoccupied with time, and dimension.  Such intangible concepts to me were like solid objects, visible things that could be touched and seen.
