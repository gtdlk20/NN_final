What I did get from it is that God is in all things, no matter how miniscule, no matter how insignificant.  I couldn't tell you how long I was there, a second, a minute, an eternity, but as quickly as it had started, it ended.  The presence then told me that I'd been shown the most important thing the world has ever known, and that I was to remember and tell as many people that I could.  The feeling that I had seen this once before was strong in me, I later likened it to what people are shown, before they are born into this world.  I remember nodding my head, and then I was told that I was going to be put back into my body, and was reminded once again to remember and pass on what I had learned.  And then 'BAM' there I was, standing outside the house on the front stoop.
