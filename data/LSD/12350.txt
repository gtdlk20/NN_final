It turned out that the bathroom was about sixty seconds away so it wasnt as much of a mission as what was about to come. I waited outside the bathroom as she walked in and not even fifteen seconds later she came out with a frown on her face. that was quick, I joked. She said there was a spider in the stall and she cant do it. I started laughing while thinking to myself is she serious? So I took a look inside and at first sight it seemed fine, but hanging right above the stall was the biggest spider I had ever seen! The entire place was covered in insects! I went outside in embarrassment and told her to try the last stall, which was the least insect-ridden. After waiting for her to come out I decided that I also needed to pee. Cant I just go in the womens bathroom where I know its safe?
