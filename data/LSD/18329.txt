A lot of newbies to acid often seem to say their first times Will life always be like this? while in the experience because when youre tripping you never think anythings gonna be normal ever again and you dont understand how it ever could be. Your consciousness is too wide open to even conceive of that. Some people get this feeling from strong weed highs too but in a more subliminal conventional way. Like just an idea in the back of their paranoid thoughts. Like they get so stoned and high that they cant understand how they or their head could ever return to normal sobriety or at least they think that returning to normal could be a long struggle and might not happen fully 100%. Of course though it always does happen fully and I do always come back fine no matter how fucked up, tripped out or high I got.
