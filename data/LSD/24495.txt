I was so glad when the concert was over, even though it was a band I normally like. My friends couldnt stop talking about how amazing the show was, and I was having a hard time explaining exactly why I didnt enjoy it. I was able to put it behind me, though, and I enjoyed the rest of the day. It started to get dark and there were now brilliantly colored lights all over the place to check out.
