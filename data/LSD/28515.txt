Me and my friends picked up a ten strip from a total sketch job, and with the thick tabs and nice logos we figured it would be good stuff, not realizing how right we were about that. On Friday night I had drank pretty heavily despite knowing I was going to trip the next day, and got only 7 hours of sleep. Waking up tasting booze in my mouth, I knew I did not have time to nurse a hangover and had to eat the LaLa as soon as possible because I tend to have 20 hour acid experiences.
