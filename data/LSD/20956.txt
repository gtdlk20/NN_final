When we got out of the house I had no idea where I was in relationship to anything, I knew the road but where the fuck did it lead??!! Which way is north?? Godammit... I went blank and we walked towards jacks house we went in silence before I remembered what the hell I had came out here for, right time to let dave know the truth..
