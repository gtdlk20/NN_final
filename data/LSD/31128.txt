The girls agreed with me, and quickly jumped on the bandwagon, Whats my color, Len? asked Dianna. I looked at her, her big, welcoming smile and tall, yet delicate, frame. Youre like, a light... light blue. She nodded slowly, probably trying to envision herself as a light blue, Yeah!, she acknowledged my judgment. I can see that too, Summer added. Dianna suddenly looked at me and emphatically remarked, Youre definitely red. Like an intense, blood-red. I smiled, Crimson I translated. I stroked my leK wrist, where my King Crimson-themed Larks Tongues on Aspic taToo lied. Man do I love that band.
