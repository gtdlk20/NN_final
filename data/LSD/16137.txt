We made our way to the front door where we quickly realized that the door had been locked, and he was without his key. Now, this situation was sticky because his mother was sleeping and we wanted not to wake her and have her find us tripping out of our minds. We couldn't report to my house because my mother was already up, and I did not want to face her either, so we decided to sit at a diner and enjoy the trip. We made the drive to a local diner and as we arrived I had noticed that Matt had began to act strangely and had been talking about recent rough times he had been going through and was very upset about the situation he had been in, but I convinced him that everything would be fine and we made our way into the diner.
