The day started off in Brooklyn, we were having fun, alot of people I knew. Abuot 15 in all. At least half of them were tripping, probably more. We walked around and smoked and the street started getting really cartoony.  Then the other group of people went off to smoked their blunt and we went to smoke ours. Even though were all friends they just wandered off.
