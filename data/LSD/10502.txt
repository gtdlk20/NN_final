I was older.  Not much, but enough to notice.  I contemplated myself and my existence.  Then I remembered the voice in the void.  Age isn't real.  Time is an idea.  I looked at the pimples and my 5 o'clock shadow.  It wasn't hair on my face.  It was black ants and they were moving rapidly up and down my cheeks.  They were biting me and turning into wrinkles and made me look really old.  I felt as though I were 100.  I was weak and tired so I sat down on the toilet.  I was exhausted.  Finally I stood up and I had returned to normal.
