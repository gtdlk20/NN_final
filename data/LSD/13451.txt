Also at this point I was scared because I felt like I was gonna be punished for breaking the illusion and felt like I was gonna be transported into another body, another life, another illusion I wouldnt be aware of. Apparently I kept saying what? No way! I think that was me reacting to these delusions telling me  that I was god, and what didnt help was Ned twitching his foot because it made me feel like I was going even crazier, like I felt like Ned twitching his foot was the illusion of reality glitching out due to me being aware it was all an illusion. I continued to go through this thought loop that I was god, and I was just so tired of it. I continued to go through this thought loop that I was god, and I was just so tired of it. By the time Arnold had convinced me to finally take a benzo, my other friend Andre arrived, and that helped calm me down too. By that point I was calmed down by the benzo but still convinced that I was god and I created everything and I was just talking about how impressed I was at how I got everything down to the particle. Apparently I went on a lot about fractals, Niel Degrasse Tyson and quantum particles. My friend Andre, just going along with it at that point joked around saying Im glad you got it down to the particle, and some would say youre a rocket scientist. And that really made it feel like they were also aware that reality was just my own concoction. So despite the benzos calming me down, I still had this Im god headspace about me for another hour. After a while I go upstairs and take another benzo and call my mom, because during that experience I was worried Id never see my family again.
