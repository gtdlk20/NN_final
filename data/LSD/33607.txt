In what felt like hours of waiting (actually 20 minutes), Me and C finally made it to the front of the line.  A woman turned to me and asked if I wanted to go before her daughters so she could go at the same time as them.  This made me extremely happy and very thankful for the woman's kindness.  Minutes were taking eternities to pass and even knowing that we will get to ride a minute or two sooner than we would have originally was plenty to make me overwhelmingly happy.  After thanking the woman me and C stepped up to the gate where we waiting to be seated.  I noticed how the 3 men running the ride all had microphones and were talking to each other trying to crack jokes.  I noted how bizzare the human race is that we actually need to hire people to keep patrons entertained because the park is too boring otherwise.  This was a turning point in the trip and I started thinking about the people that own Cedar Point and how they are treating human beings like they don't have emotions or thoughts.
