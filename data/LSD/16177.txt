This is when the classic hallucinations started kicking into high gear: fractals, breathing walls, melting ceilings, giant hands and feet, morping, new, bright colors.  A lot of what happened is a blur because none of it makes sense now.  Everyone, including me, was having a hilarious, social time.  I stayed up late with a lot of people, but being so high and full of munchies, they became annoyingly lazy and incoherent.  I was offered salvia and weed but refused both.  This was one uncomfortable part of my trip: the ampetamine-like rush was starting to get to me, I hyperventilated a little bit and felt like my lungs were the size of ping pong balls.  It was important for me, however, to experience both the highs and the lows, the fears and the ecstacy.
