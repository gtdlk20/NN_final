We were within sight of my friendÂ’s dorm by now, and as I walked down a path (that I thought seemed similar to walking down evolution, though now that I think about it, there was nothing special about this path at all) she exclaimed that I had never heard her play piano. After excitedly agreeing to listen to her play, we took a short walk to the nearby performing arts center. As I walked in the front door, it looked as if the walls were designed with skull motifs above the doors. I stood and stared at them, fairly sure they didn't exist at all, but unable to ask my friend if they were real. When we walked into the lobby of the center, I nearly lost myself again in a fit of laughter. The place, by any standard, is impressive.
