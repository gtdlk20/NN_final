We made our way back to campus, marvelling at the power nature was displaying. When we arrived, I was hitting one of a series of peaks, feeling like an insect crawling upstairs to my room. Being unable to find my own room, I followed the other guys to one of their rooms. I collapsed on a bed, stuck in the corner, and found myself lost in the molecular structure of the ceiling. It is obscenely difficult to explain to someone who has never eaten a high dose of LSD what this was like, but I tried nonetheless when my friends were asking. This seemed to go on for hours, but in reality probably lasted thirty minutes.
