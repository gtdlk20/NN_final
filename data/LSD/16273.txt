Time started to slow down into really small fractions and I felt my body relax from bit by bit and the music started to feel more and more intense from my headphones when suddenly I was in a total visual world caused by it, went through different places of fractal shapes and every sound and detail in the song gave me visual stimulation so that it was like a guided dream. And what a beautiful dream it was. Suddenly my consciousness woke up and I opened my eyes and my room was still there and there were no hallucinations except that everything was bending and stretching from direction to another.
