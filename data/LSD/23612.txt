Summer, who wrote a play called Insomnia: The Musical, was clearly in for aimless walking at night on acid, and Dianna agreed on the premise that we were going out to pick up food for her. Since I hadnt had anything since the sushi, and had to keep my motor running for the trip, I agreed. We quickly went back to Diannas to pick up our clothes - we all gave up on bras... or other soaked underwear by that point - and put them on. I wasnt the least bit impaired, nor did I have trouble putting my clothes on, but I was still so far. I was still in an impossibly weird, nonsensical, and removed abysmal world of non-realities.
