The moon, meanwhile, crawled across the sky, and it sometimes appeared as if someone had taken a huge eraser and smeared the moon's color across the black sky. By 8:30 or so, my friends knew I was tripping, because I said something about the huge dragon around the moon. We started discussing the Pillsbury Doughboy and how it would be funny if, instead of saying 'Whoo-hoo!' when you poked his stomach, he said 'Fuck you!' This conversation lasted until halftime, when the two friends I arrived with left (one has a curfew with his probation, and the other wanted to go home). I found a glowrod lying on the ground. I played with this and talked to some other people, and occasionally watched the game. The moon continued to creep and bleed across the sky, and shine its bright yellow light through the clouds.
