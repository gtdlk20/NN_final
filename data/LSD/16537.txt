Shortly after meeting up with our friend at a pre-concert tailgate party at around 6 PM, we acquired our first and most important item...the acid. Something described to us as 'Pink Elephant' by the local dealers. It came on blotter paper and sealed in a ziploc bag. We were promptly instructed to keep it out of the light. Whether this was for protection of the acid, as they asserted, or protection of themselves, we didn't argue. I stuffed the acid into my back pocket and proceeded to buy a beer from one of the vendors. After perusing the event for about thirty minutes, we decided to leave and make the journey back to Boulder (my home town). Along the way, we called a few friends who had also planned to trip that night, with mushrooms being their substance of choice, to get the blacklights and glowsticks. With that taken care of, it was just a quick drive to Blockbuster and we were prepared.
