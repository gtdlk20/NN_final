Anyways so at this point were walking through the woods and its about 11:00am. I remember these times very clearly because they seemed like the most important things in the world at the time. We began walking and L told me what to expect because he had done it once before and I settled in to wait. We walked past all manner of shit along the bike trails: old bikes, a rusted car, a washing machine all kinds of shit that just shouldnt have been there. Slightly disappointing but hey you cant let stuff get you down.
