That very same friend and I tripped on New Year's Eve, 1999. My friend, Neo, loves to trip, the harder the better. I, on the other hand, am definitely a roller. I would have loved to roll that night, but let me tell you that when you're dead ass broke and you're craving a roll real bad, a mind bending $5 trip hits the spot real good. We dropped around 11:00pm and smoked up a little with my sister and my other friend Goku. It seemed like a long time had gone by, and I had actually forgotten that we had dropped already when I started feeling that weird wirey acid feeling. The main thing was Goku's watch. Every time he moved it, the street light would glint off of it, except instead of it being a white glint, it was bright red. Neo and Goku were talking, and Goku flicked away his cigarette, which left a long orange trail behind it. Neo then asked if I was feeling it, which got an emphatic yes.
