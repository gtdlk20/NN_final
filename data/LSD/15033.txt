Regarding lust, which was large factor in the ending of my most recent relationship, I realized that there is nothing wrong with sex, as one is only sharing oneself with another person in a way that borders on boundary dissolving, but that due to the intimacy of the act, it's unwise to be frivolous with it, and ultimately was glad that, though the opportunity had been available, I hadn't made love to anyone since my ex. I thought about my unfortunate preoccupation with pornography and, while I understand this preoccupation and can define its origins, it is no longer of any use to me, and ultimately is only detrimental to the possibility of having another romantic relationship.
