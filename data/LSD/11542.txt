W kept trying to engage me in conversation, but I couldnt make words work.  Another flash: like how it must feel to have a stroke.  I was feeling tremendously grateful for Ws diligent caretaking and at the same time guilty for making him have to do what felt like to me such a lot of work.  I kept trying to ask how I could pay him back or what I could do to pay it forward.  He was SO gracious and kept saying he was enjoying himself and felt privileged to be with me during my journey.
