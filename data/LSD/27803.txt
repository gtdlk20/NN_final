More places in the brain -- behind is fear, below is despair. I was overcome with fear when I 'went' to that spot, for a moment I was crouched in the corner in terror. But realizing that it was a place that I had gone, just like the love/joy place, made me realize that getting out of fear is simple -- just move up!
