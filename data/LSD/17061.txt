Before me lay the 350 microgram aqua-green square of infinite wonder. I was spooked, but hyped nonetheless. I kept telling E that this was almost 5 times the dose that I had originally taken a few months earlier. He suggested I cut the tab in half since I had my doubts, but I pushed through anyways. At 5:00, we had both placed the tabs on our tongues and I defected to the other room to meditate and clear my head while the acid slowly seeped into me. As soon as I felt the tab completely dissolve, I went back into the main living room and tried my best to set the mood and relax with E. Part of this was turning on Drive Home, by Steven Wilson on the Youtube TV---a really beautiful and emotional song that is close to my heart. We discussed that we ought to have our own tether that would anchor us to reality if things were to go completely sideways.
