Everything was completely black around me.  I was absolutely disincorporated.  I directly felt what was going on in my body, but I was diffusely separated from what was happening.  I remembered my intention and decided not to try to resist the spasmodic electrical discharges, but to trust my inner healer.  I was certain that this was what was supposed to happen and was happening for a good reason.
