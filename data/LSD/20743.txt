About 8pm, my cousin and two friends and I each took 2 geltabs of acid.  I remember saying, 'wow these things look so little, are you sure they are going to work?'.  One of my friends that had taken acid before just laughed at me.  A half hour went by, and I was a bit annoyed because I felt the same.  I wanted to take another one, but my friend assured me that it wouldn't be long before it kicked in.  20 minutes later, I was starting to feel a little strange.  I suggested we all go outside and sit on the porch to get some air.  An hour later, we were two miles from my house running through the woods.  Now I'm pretty much a lazy person, it's an effort just to walk outside to my mail box :-).  But I felt so great, like I could walk anywhere!  We killed another hour walking back, it was a lot of laughing and good feelings all around.
