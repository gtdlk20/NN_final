I tried to read the philosophy book I'd brought with me. But it seemed that instead of being able to read it in a linear fashion, I would get stuck on each sentence or idea. As I read any particular such sentence, it seemed in that moment the most profound thing I'd ever read, but I'd be unable to connect it with anything else  even the very next sentence. After some time, I gave up on trying to read anything coherent.
