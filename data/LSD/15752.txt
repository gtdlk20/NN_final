We were at the end of watching some stoner film when I began to notice that something was different. Something felt out of place or strange but I didn't know what. Then, as I stared at the computer screen that had been playing the film, I noticed that everything had started to melt. At first I thought it was a screen saver so I asked the others what they saw, it seemed that they're tabs hadn't taken affect yet. I then looked back at the screen and noticed that all the walls were pulsating colour that seemed to trickle down the walls. I felt very comfortable with this, it made me feel warm, which was good because it was freezing outside as it was about a week or two before Christmas.
