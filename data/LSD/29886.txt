I think it's around 2:00 A.M. and people start passing out from the booze so it's less people to fuck with me which is good. I decide I just need to go in my little corner and just think. Acid is the most amazing drug to think on because when you start thinking about things, you can solve any problem. I get into this argument with myself about the beginning of time and the meaning of life and everything about the universe. When Ally comes out of where ever she was and wants to know what's wrong. I tell her that  there are just too many things going through my mind right now that I can't even begin to tell her the most subtle detail of what I am contemplating right now. She kinda wigs out and then suffices with a smoke outside.
