I woke up at 7am and lay there on the floor. We left his house at about 8.30am and headed into the city to go our separate ways. I spent the rest of the day filling unadjusted and very out of place. Something was wrong and would continue to feel like this for about a day. After an hour or two at home feeling depressed I decided to take a nap. I woke up at 7pm just to eat some curry. I went back to sleep till the afternoon the following day. When talking to my friend who had to work that day he told me that he was still tripping whilst at work. Thankfully his boss was sympathetic to this.
