Somewhere around this point in time, I started to have an uncontrollable flood of introspective thoughts, from what must have been my subconscious.  We made it back to my house, and I was beginning to feel quite anxious, edgy and generally negative.  My friend and I smoked a few cones, and although I was momentarily amused by the whole action of smoking and the novelty of the bong, the weed didnt seem to have any effect on the experience at all.  The introspective cascade that was beginning centered around issues that plagued my life (and probably most peoples lives), but which I would normally refuse to acknowledge at a conscious level.  They were surfacing at a rapid rate and I was being forced to accept them, and deal with them.
