I took some with another girl. She ended up scratching her skin to bloody pieces thinking things were crawling all over her. I totally felt like I perceived another reality. I couldn't move my body as it was just a bunch of molecules moving around. I couldn't see our three dimensional world at all. The air around me was alive and moving, and I saw many dwarf-like beings moving around intently doing things, but unaware that I could see them. My body was melted into the atmosphere so I couldn't move. To this day I'm convinced that the drug somehow opened my awareness to another dimension that we normally can't sense. Ever since that trip I feel like perhaps there is other life out there, but with our human perceptions, we can't begin to understand them.
