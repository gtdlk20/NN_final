I went to go see a concert at the Gorge Ampitheater and took some acid that just fell into my hands as I ran into a friend I hadn't seen in years.  It was during the day and I was tripping....I walked to a cliff and sat down on the top of it.....the wind suddenly gusted and I felt it enter my body....all of the sudden I felt the prescence of a friend of mine and then realized that he was there....it wasn't just a thought, but it was a shamanistic sort of connection.
