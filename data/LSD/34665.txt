I felt a peace like no other wash over me softly, and as it did the top of my head opened like a lotus. I felt a peace like no other wash over me softly, and as it did the top of my head opened like a lotus. This was a very odd feeling looking back, but at the moment it felt perfectly natural. My spirit or energy or consciousness or whatever float  upwards out of my body into space. I felt at total peace gazing out at the stars and all of creation.
