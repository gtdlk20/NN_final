I went back into one of the other rooms to relax, chill and begin to draw again. I did this for a while. The next thing I know, after drawing some great stuff, was that when the other 2 talked to me there voices sounded metallic and echoed. I was really wasted, they asked me if I was ok, and I reassured them that I was. I was loving every second of this. Then the other two went back into the other room where the music setup was. I stayed alone in the other room drawing for about 30 mins drawing. Then bob came in to get me and took me back into the other room for a smoke.
