So, I didn't have an epiphanies, nothing really deep realized about myself, it was just a fun time. My girlfriend didn't have the best Time, but she was nervous because we were at her house, she she's willing to try again. My new friend doesn't want to do it ever again, he just wants to stick with weed. My girlfriend realized she's too uptight about stuff and my friend realized he's An anxious piece of shit, and I just had fun. Hopefully that's not a bad thing for dropping 500 ug after never drinking smoking or doing any drug ever before.
