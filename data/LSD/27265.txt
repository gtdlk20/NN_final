My friend mentioned that he was hungry and so we decided to get some midnight snacks.  We went into my kitchen and made some popcorn and sandwiches.  For some odd reason i started staring at the popcorn and when i realized that i had been staring at the popcorn for some time, i realized that my friend was not in the kitchen anymore.  So, out of fear that my parents or younger sibling would discover him tripping balls, I started whispering out his name, and after what seemed like an eternity of searching i found him standing in front of a mirror in my entry-hall and all he said was look at the mirror.  Now this is probably my only regret of the night, however, I have grown from this mistake and I am sure that it is only specific to me, but I decided to look in the mirror.  It was AMAZING, my face suddenly became nothing and then was immediately an 'aliens' head (those grey ones that are commonly depicted on TV).  This scared the crap out of me.  So my friend and I decided it would be best to go back into my room.
