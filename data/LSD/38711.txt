Anyway, he convinced me to go up to the rave that night in the parking lot.  He and I walked up to the A-camp that was nearby to get a ride to the main parking lot about 2 miles away.  I bought 2 hits for blotter from an older hipped out brother and gave one to my friend.  We were speculating about the authenticity of the stuff i'd just bought when some dude and his passenger asked us if we wanted a ride. We hopped right in and drove off for the parking lot where the rave was.
