Suddenly it seemed that the outside world was on my side, and I was safe and in control.  I felt completely at peace.  It was a warm day, but even if it had been freezing I doubt if I would have felt it.  Eventually I decided to return to the house before I forgot how to move.  It sounds silly to me looking back now, but at the time it seemed to be very possible.  Given the sensory over stimulation of the situation, I'm not entirely surprised.
