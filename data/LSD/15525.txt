After another 10mins I began to find myself staring at my curtains and could now see clearly that they were moving. They were moving as a whole thing, almost as if they were attached to a board and this board was being rocked forwards and backwards. I then began to notice my sheets and if I let my vision run they began to resemble some sort of skin. When I saw this I new that the LSD was starting to take more of an effect, so got up and sat at my computer and became fascinated with my desktop background. It is a 3D computer generated picture that starts out bright in the middle then darkens off on the outsides and allover it there is sort of like a network of wormlike structures with brighter parts to them. Normally it is an interesting looking picture but now the wormlike structures were beginning to squirm about the screen, particularly at the brighter spots.
