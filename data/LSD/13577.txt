When he came back to reality he seemed overwhelmed by the intensity of the experience he just had, and was amazed how strong the experience was and how much difference that extra 1/4 tab of LSD made. To be honest I didn't expect to trip as hard as I did either! But LSD doesn't seem to demolish my ego so much as let me pick it apart and toss out the parts I don't like, at least at the doses I've taken. Mushrooms, on the other hand, have a tendency to tear my ego to shreds. I find this is only useful once every long while, so I much prefer to work with LSD.
