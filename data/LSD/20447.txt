I remember looking at my iPhone playing the song and it had artwork for the song that wasnt the Let it Be album but instead a colorful portrait of all four Beatles separately and I cant explain it it just looked very trippy and high def and 4 dimensional and the iridescent colors on the edges of everything seemed to overlap while the images themselves popped out more. The picture looked so intriguing and kind of luring and emotional. It was like this sparkly underwater look almost, cant explain it. Everything was very VERY clear but kind of liquidy and it looked emotionally evocative and kind of sad. Really emotional actually and I could see it on the Beatles' faces lol. Especially on Ringo. His nose looked funny and he looked so emotional and random and justthere and George Harrison had what at the time looked like these crazy sacred patterns on his neck that are actually there on the picture. He also had an eye ball on his palm and I got hit with these intense imaginative spiritual feelings and attitudes towards it like my eyes and senses were drawn to specifically that and was just like damn..stop trying to trip me out mind.'
