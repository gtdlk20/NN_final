I am not the kind of person who typically agrees to this kind of stuff. I am not entirely comfortable with getting down and dirty, but I thought to myself, Im on acid, might as well! and as soon as I had mentally accepted the fact I was going to get painted all over, I felt extremely ecstatic. I wouldnt say my emotional responses were slowed down or delayed, but rather amplified: I processed everything with intensity, and was determined to survey my stance on every event that took place. Obviously, because of the confusion and haze of weirdness, I didnt reach very promising conclusions. It was very basic business - either something made me very happy, or very confused.
