My heart rate has come down to a significant stable level, as I have accepted my trip and now I'm slightly more or less enjoying it. Patterns are all over the place and I can vividly see textures surrounding me. Lights are spinning just like fans and giving off pulses. I can see waves of lights in every direction I look. Keep in mind I am in a totally black room but it feels like all of my walls are LED panels and my room is rapidly changing colors. Every time I verbally speak, I do not hear the words until my sentence is finished, as if someone was repeating what I was saying after I was done. I can't understand anything. I no longer know where I exist, what I am, or who I am. I'm very educated in the field of science and astronomy so the intelligence is projecting spacial images and stars and such everywhere. I feel like I'm floating throughout the realm of space and time.
