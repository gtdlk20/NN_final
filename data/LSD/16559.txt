We were two acid-tripping imbeciles stumbling around a driving range at 10:30 PM, in cloaks, no less. I felt awkward but somehow open. The next two hours were spent quite constructively, with discussion involving everything from political policies to the stupidity of the act we were indulging in. What followed has stayed with me for quite awhile. Lex turned to me briefly, a look of ardent enthusiasm on his face and exclaimed, 'Dude, you know what's an awesome word? GLOOP!!! It's like glop and soup combined! Doesn't that sound awesome?!?'
