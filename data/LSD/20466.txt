When I got back home, I went to sleep shortly after writing a report of this and posting it to another website. Four hours later, a friend who lived in the area dropped by and walked into my bedroom. I looked up and he said something I didn't catch. He seemed to move a little too quickly into the room. I jerked up and awake and drop kicked the young man out of my house. :) I followed him outside and told him that it was NOT a good time and not to call me, I would call him later.
