One of us should have a phone. I think Ill just go get mine from upstairs. Its also a good idea to let Louise, Frey, or Mark know that were going out she said. Her argument seemed reasonable, but I was able to tackle it, for the sake of our destination, Frey and Louise are probably asleep, and Mark totally crashed on that bed, though. Do you think we really need to wake them up? Were just going to go to Grand Central, grab a bite, and come back. I made it sound so easy, and it was... for people not on psychedelic drugs.
