 OK now its time to play I thought what can I do in this place. Feeling this energy about myself I thought how strong I might be and what I can do. I stood up and sort of prepared myself to muscle flex I guess is best way to describe it. Exert my energy of self-outwards. I built up and released. A huge energy shockwave pulsed out of me and the room bulged out around me as I flexed and then came back in as I relaxed. Holly shit I couldnt believe that just happened. It was like realizing I have super powers. Still in awe of what I had just done so excited. I started to realized how much power I might have. I barely exerted myself. This place felt like I had found the real me and my reality is a show shutting all this off. I thought wow is this what we truly are. I felt excited and really happy still grasping with what was happening and accepting it  yet not afraid in any way.
