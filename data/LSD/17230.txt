Sometime later in the night though B and J had to leave.  They promised to hangout with some other friends and they had to leave.  This though has to be one of the weirdest things about acid.  Saying goodbye.  For whatever reason while we were saying goodbye we always had one last thing to say.  It made it difficult to go our separate ways.  At some point and time though we all managed to say our final goodbyes and they left.  At this time I was no longer tripping and I was only hallucinating still.  My strange trip was over and I was with C and E.  I was still trying to figure out the trip though in my head.  It had to be one of the most complex and hardest things that IÂ’ve ever thought about in my life.
