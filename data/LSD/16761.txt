About halfway into my movie I began to experience back pain, and I thought, 'Oh great, here we go,'.  I tried not to think about too much because I knew that would make the pain worse.  This was pretty much the only thing I was worried about with LSD and my new body, and it was showing up.  On MDMA and 2-CB the only physical effects I got were increased spasms and stiffness in my legs.  I got those on LSD too, in addition to back pain.
