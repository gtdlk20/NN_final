by about 1:00 in the morning, as willy nelson and the dead bowed to the giant cheering sea of color, people, and the sweet musk of hashish that filled the air, i breathed out a sigh and my chest seemed to collapse back in forever, as if the whole experience was one breath of holy understanding. i guess the theme that seemed to umbrella the entirity of the trip was that understanding in itself has lead directly to the thing being understood, and if there is any other inhibitive emotion, then there is something left to be grasped. i thought this right at the end of the concert when walked away aching with pleasure as id been standing for about 13 hours strait and my face hurt from smiling for so long!
