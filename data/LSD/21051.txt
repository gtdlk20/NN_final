There was an awful point in time where I thought I was going to go crazy. Mike came over to me and asked if I was going to be OK. I remember looking kind of over his shoulder, and through my peripheral vision a second, translucent face came out of his face, so it looked like he had two heads. I shoved my face into a mercifully dark pillow and moaned. I wasn't exactly sure. The only thing that kept me from falling apart was Mike telling me that he'd tripped so hard before, he had to touch the trees to make sure they were real. So if he had survived, then perhaps I would as well.
