Exactly a week later, on a Saturday, my friend and I parked at a local elementary school. Yea thats right a fucking elementary school. It was actually a pretty sweet spot because the woods behind the school were frequented by bikers and hikers out getting their kicks on the paths that lacerated the woods. We figured we pop the acid and spend 6 hours or so wandering in these woods looking for glorious things. It was actually a fairly good plan. We just didnt realize how much walking this would actually entail.
