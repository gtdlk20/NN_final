I of course shared these first two Epihpanies with Entheogen.  I kept #3 to myself... and I'm not entirely sure it should be called an Epiphany, but I guess it depends on your point of view.  At some point in the early stages, I looked at Entheogen and just wanted her sexually.  There are many personal reasons that this is complicated, but I won't go into them.  Suffice it to say that it was not an option, nor did I entirely want it to be.
