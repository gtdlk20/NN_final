As we thought, upstairs was just makeup... and I had already too much of that, so we went straight down. Going down wasnt as magical as going up, since I actually had to use my legs. It was heavy-handed and slow. As I tiptoed my black heeled mini-boots on the pavement, I felt like I was a mammoth approaching. Yet, wed just crossed another bridge on our quest... it was taking us somewhere else, which made me thrilled and excited.
