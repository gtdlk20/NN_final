I can't tell you what time this is all happening in because I didn't look at a clock the rest of that night. I decided I needed to get out of that house for a little while to cool my thoughts. So we head out to one of my friends cars to go smoke a bowl. My buddy and I both smoked down one bowl and that calmed me down. We went back to the party it went back to just how it was before. Everything in there was fucked and I was the only sane person in the room. When really it was the other way around. I talked with C to get things straight and he assured me that he wasn't fucking with me. Which he really was the only one who wasn't fucking with me that night. Then I realized I was having this complex over this little detail about C from the trip. This happens sometimes but never happened to me before so I wasn't ready for it.
