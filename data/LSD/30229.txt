While the ambulance had arrived A's brother and the paramedics were carrying C out to the ambulance, C began to vomit not a lot mostly dry heaving and urinate himself. After he was restrained in the ambulance we had to talk to the police while still tripping very hard. We had told them that after dinner C went to bathroom for a good ten minutes and came back out, and hour latter we couldn't control him so we decide to contact some one and here we are now.
