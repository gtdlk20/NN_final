After coming back to reality and climbing safely back onto the bed, my friend and I began to dance again, swaying to the music. At one point, I touched the boom box ( I still call it that, forgive me.) and I knew right then and there I was at a Panic concert, front row, basking in the gloriousness of JB, Jimmy, Schools, Jojo, Todd, and Sunny. I was the luckiest girl in the world. Who would have known in just an hour, I would be sitting at yet another Panic show this year. I literally felt the musicÂ’s vibration. I jolted at this orgasmic feeling.
