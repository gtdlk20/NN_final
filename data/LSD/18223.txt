Sitting at my computer on facebook and the internet looking up things relevant to these matters, I began to feel strange.  Like my vision was getting weird.  Lights were going off in my field of view behind my vision like a firework show or strobe light.  An explosion of color and light.  It would get really light, then really dark, then the trip really started to kick in.  The visual perspective on things changed, they began to take on different shapes and especially when I would look around they would shape-shift.
