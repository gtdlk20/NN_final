The visuals I perceive at the lake are probably the strongest of the whole trip. The surface of a large tree in front of me ripples as if tiny raindrops are disturbing its liquid bark, and the shapes of its trunk spiral and squirm as if they are alive. I feel as though I am seeing sound. Across the lake, the trees blend into one another, there are trunks where the canopy ought to be, and vice versa. I look to the opposite shore of the lake and expect to see a moose at any moment. Everything here is bathed in a golden, peaceful light.
