I arrived at camp to find that rosy had taken the lantern and was wandering around the woods, while deuce was idly sitting staring at the burning wood. My heavy breathing combined with the look on my face must have alarmed him, because he asked if I was ok. I proceeded to try and explain what I had experienced, but was unable to. I ended up begging deuce to come down to the lake and check it out, but the stubborn bastard refused to do it. While I was trying to convinced deuce to go, rosy meandered back up to camp; I immediately laid into him 'Dude you fucking have to come down to the lake!' Rosy too refused my request. I would not relent, it was now a battle of wills. How long could deuce and rosy withstand my beligerent requests to go to the lake? I knew what had happend out there and neither one of them had experienced anything like that in the woods or at camp. After 10-15 minutes of nagging I finally got rosy to go to the lake with me.
