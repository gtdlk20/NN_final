I got out and began walking home without another word. I had never been to this house before. I had no real idea of where I was. As I walked I thought of the two possible explanations I had thought of before the people came out of the house. One being that I was tripping and that people had played a cruel trick on me, the other that this going on inside my head. That I would live forever in this strange world where everyone talked garbage and went no where. My hell for a mistake. I had yelled loudly in the driveway when this thought occured to me.
