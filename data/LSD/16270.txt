Some hours passed and I started to feel a bit tired and went downstairs and took the energy drink from the fridge (a bottle of half litres) and drank it almost instantly. I felt my heart beat a lot faster and started to feel mentally very aware of everything. The effects of the energy drink were very clear and I felt very good afterwards. The time was about 03:30 and I definitely felt the effects of LSD since everything I looked at gave me information about itself.
