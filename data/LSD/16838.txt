Myself and a group of friends had gathered at a buddy's house, his folks were at their summer home and we used to have get togethers there to party, have bonfires, and listen to music... it was always a good time.  But this one night has stuck with me, I remember it as if it had happened yesterday, the vivid image burned into my memory.
