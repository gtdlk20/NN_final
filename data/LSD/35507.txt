My senses were mixing with everything around me. I tasted lights. I felt as if everything around me was a flowing texture of sensory data and emotion. I felt heavenly. Everything felt right. I felt like I was doing the right things with my life, and that I was treating people the way they should be treated. I could not understand at the time how someone might have a bad trip on this stuff.
