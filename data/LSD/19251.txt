In fact, the only emotional response I think I really felt was giddiness. Besides this, I felt like I wasn't functioning at an emotional level. My friend C tried to talk to me about people or things but I just didn't care about any of it. I was focused on what I was seeing mostly and how my fingertips were swelling with the same energy that was surging off of the walls and ceilings. I didn't feel like myself at all, I had no normal emotions I usually felt. I didn't care about myself or anything else.
