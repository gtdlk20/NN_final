I first felt the effects about 50 minutes to an hour after I'd ingested the drug. I noticed in the opening scene, where Count Dracula denounces Christianity (I thought he was a bad ass for it ;)) that they took a sample from that movie Dracula (The one with Keanu Reeves (lololol)) to put into the song Torn by Into Eternity. This made me feel happy. My trip began.
