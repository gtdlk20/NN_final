I remember playing the guitar, and everything I played sounded awesome even though I was playing awful sounding chords with tons of distortion and delay.  While I was playing, I noticed that I was twitching my eye.  It wasn't just a normal twitch - my whole face was scrunching with every note I played, and my eyes were going wild.  The uncontrollable eye twitch continued throughout the night.  I started to listen to music, and when I finally came to later that night I realized that I had gone through about 20 CDs.  I must have not listened to all of them because I was only listening to music for about an hour total.
