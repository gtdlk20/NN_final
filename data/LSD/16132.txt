After about 40 minutes I began to feel the start of what would be the most intense tripping experience of my life. The first hour was quite pleasant. I felt a nice glow start to take over my body and made me smile very largely. We listened to some trancey music, and some TOOL. We both agreed that we had heard and felt parts of the music that we had never heard in the countless hours of sober listening before. I began to notice my speedometer to start the breathing effect and other various objects in the car. We engaged in very deep conversation of how much we appreciated the acid, and how it made us think of the world in many different ways.
