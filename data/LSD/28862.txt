Kyle showed up around 9 p.m., we all had a few of my house drink, and Justin and I dissolved our sugar cubes in our mouths (T +0:00).  We all piled into Kyle's car and drove down to the waterfront and the beach to await the coming trip.  We sat on the dock for a while and talked, and after about 40 minutes I began to feel tingling in my extremities and in my chest.  I glanced over to Justin, who had a big smile on his face, and I knew he was beginning to feel it, too.  I looked down and noticed that the grain in the wood of the dock had re-arranged itself into some sort of tribal-looking patterns (T +0:45).  We decided to drive back to my place so we could enjoy the trip more (our laughter and comments were beginning to draw some looks), so we got back into Kyle's car and drove back.  When we got back, we decided to bring the pitcher of OJ/hard alcohol upstairs and watch a movie on the entertainment system.  I popped in Beavis and Butthead Do America and we all sat back to enjoy.
