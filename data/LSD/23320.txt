T+3 hours: We don't know where to go so we hide in my basement, I still feel overheated and terrified as shit. We venture back up to my room and all of a sudden I throw up in my hands. It was actually a very spiritual purge it was like throwing up my soul and then having it enter back into me again. Within about 20 minutes after I threw up things got even worse, I was not only filthy and dirty from vomit, but my dad was home and my girlfriend is freaking out too and since we were in my house she couldn't make any real decisions. We tried calling like 10 people in my phone because I really wanted to leave my house to get away from my dad, brother, and the this cop that was supposed to be here. Finally I got a hold of the girl who sold me the acid, a friend from a few towns over, I told her the story as best I could and she said she'd be right over with her girlfriend. After the phone call I actually begin to cool down and also calm down. The visuals are intense and I still am semi-incoherent but I am calm and have calmed my girlfriend down a bit, even though I give her TONS of credit for trying to calm me down the majority of the time.
