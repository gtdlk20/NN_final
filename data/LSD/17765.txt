Chair and I were at a barter faire in Eastern Washington, and we were enjoying the festive air of the place.  There were many people with booths full of goods to trade or sell set up along many straw-covered pathways.  People came from miles around to attend this fair gathering, and there was a lot to do.  So we set about obtaining some LSD.  It's not always easy to walk through a crowd of people not knowing if they're government agents or not, but we wandered through the late sun and located a man with an interesting shirt who offered liquid doses for $2 apiece.  We agreed, and decided that 5 drops would be a reasonable number for us each.  We knelt before him as though he were Queen Elizabeth and we were being knighted.  The drops that came from the little Sweet Breath bottle had a slight minty taste, but I'm sure our breath was sweeter for it.  We thanked and paid him.
