Time melted away and for what seemed to be an eternity, we sat in that room, the rest of the city fast asleep as we soared to unimaginable heights. By the time the sun was rising, around probably 6:00 AM, Mikey had gone home. With one of our sacred acid bonds severed for good, me and Carter fell awkwardly back to Earth as we smoked one last joint and talked about the trip. At the time, I was so blown away that I didnt really say much. I sort of expected the credits for my life to roll and someone to shout, Thats a wrap!  Instead, Carter left me with this: Now you know what its like to be as high as humanly possible. He said it so causally that it gave me the chills.
