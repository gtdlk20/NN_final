I don't really know what happened to me that night.  It wasn't like any other trip that I've ever had before, and I had always had a good experience... I still couldn't tell if what happened that night was a good experience or not, but good or ill, it did change me.  It was also the last time, that I took a hallucinogenic drug.  I realized that there are some things, that us living humans are just not meant to experience.
