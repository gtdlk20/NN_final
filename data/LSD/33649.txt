Anyways now I was back, and I started describing my past life to C.  I have a very strange past life as I used to live in a different state and moved when I was 10.  I was always open minded, but I had a complete different personality for half of my life.  Anyways I could tell I was freaking C out by telling him this while he was on acid so I just stopped and waited in silence.  After being seated on the ride C tells me to put my feet against the steel in front of us.  The man running the ride comes over and tells us to keep our feet off of it.  I am instantly angered.  Does he think I'm going to break the steel box?  Does Cedar Point treat all of their customers like that?  Before I can  protest the ride begins and our box starts its ascent.  Not at all wanting to ride the ride I once again think of my 8 year old self.  As the box begins moving forward I feel exactly as I did 9 years ago and It feels like my body is being ripped apart as we drop from the giant metal tower.  After the ride my heart is pounding and  I feel very excited once again.
