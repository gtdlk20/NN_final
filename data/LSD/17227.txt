I do clearly remember though that as I was tripping I would get these waves of energy a type of surge of body energy.  Each time this happened I would completely blank out.  I would forget who I was, what I was, who was with me, where I was, and what I was doing.  Each time this wave of energy hit me I only had a few seconds to recollect myself and try and remember everything.  But as soon as I would collect any information I would get another wave of energy.  I remember though that it was a sort of game in my mind.  Where I would do something or say something that would cause these waves of energy to travel through me.  It was really interesting and different.  Before this night I had never experienced anything like it.
