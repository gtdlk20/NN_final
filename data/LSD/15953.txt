Still in the playground, some of my companions had decided to eat some tangerines that they had brought with them. There was a massive fruit bowl in the living room of the house that had been emptied very quickly. The bananas went first, the texture and consistency of these once chewed was disgust so I binned it. They, however, loved the sensation of eating whilst tripping. They had carried as many tangerines and oranges as they could out to the playground and spent a few minutes savagely tearing the skin off. This was quite a manic scene that had made me think they had all become far too intrigued by this action, that they would be there for some time. Thankfully they stopped and we played on the adventure playground.
