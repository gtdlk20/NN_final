Almost a decade ago,  I remember getting on the demon drop.  The demon drop is a ride where you are sat in a large steel box.  The steel box is raised a hundred feet or so into the air and then you do a bar guided free fall.  As the box reached the peak and started moving forward to begin the plunge I immediately freaked out and started screaming.  'Wait stop the ride I don't want to do this!' Instantly the ride dropped and I felt like my body was being split in two.  I came back a few years after that incident and rode the ride just to prove that I was a big boy.
