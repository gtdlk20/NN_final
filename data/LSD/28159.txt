Several miles down the road we found the spot:  to this day I think of this little area as my spiritual home.  When I die I am sure this is where my spirit will go immediately.  It's simply a small parking lot on the top of a small mountain pass with overlooks on either side.  On the left there is the remainder of a mountain, on the right a small rocky hill that the road winds around.  One can see the lights of Estes Park (50 or so miles away) and possibly further from the overlook, thousands of feet higher than the valleys below.  We were two hours into our trip now, and everything was beautiful, too much so for words to begin to describe.  Huge green pine trees were all around us, concealing us from the world and the world from us.  I had purchased Paul Oakenfold's 'Tranceport' that day and had not listened to it yet.  We put that CD in the stereo and listened as the bass rumbled through the forest, through the valleys so far below and up past the high mountaintops.  I credit that music for creating the feelings felt that night.  We stayed in that spot and danced the night away.  The trees seemed to dance to it also.  At one point the four of us took a walk down the road to look down into the world.  Bill and I were leading with Marcus and Jamal trailing and having a wierd debate about TV commercials or something.  There was a tree laying on its side that apperently gave Bill weird vibe, so he approached it and asked no one in particular 'Are these trees?  I don't think so...'.  On closer inspection they were indeed trees.  All of us had the same perception problems and had a blast sorting things out, but not before engaging in an argument with the downed log.
