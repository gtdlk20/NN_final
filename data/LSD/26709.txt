After tripping for many hours it became 4pm and I seemed to have come down.  It was time for me to go to work.  I smoked a joint with my bud on the way and of course, the trip came back somewhat or was prolonged.  I walked into work with this wild awareness about me.  I did really well on the phones but my cubicle was pretty wild.  The walls were definitely breathing for the most part.  Anyways, all in all, a great trip, just very strange and tired at work.  Acid can be great fun and even better if you take it at a better time than I did haha.  Trip safely and as always love and peace!!!
