It was incredible because me and my friend were also just sitting there looking up at the trees surrounding us right above our heads and how all their branches and leaves overlapped each other and how everything looked soooo vast and complex. If I look at that same area sober or I guess just not on LSD it just looks like some leaves and some branches and thats it and it looks like a pretty relatively small area with not much scenic value to it at all its just so trivial. However when on this trip this small area above us like I said just looked so vast and so big and complex. There was just so much to look at and it was infinitely visually complicated and intriguing.
