Kim was laying on the floor, and as i stared at her (she was very attractive, young with incredible breasts) she morphed into a little girl sitting in her room, who shifted into a black girl with an afro listening to a record player. The entire room around her shifted right along with her through different time periods. She had an incredibly tight shirt on and it had a picture of a ninja turtle on it. Victor and i laughed for at least twenty minutes, because the turle seemed to bulge and dance on her shirt. 'God i love being a turtle!' we screamed:) I stood in a corner of the room, and found that by pressing down with my foot i could bend the room. I made dust levitate with my hands and spun it around in mid-air. I lay down on the floor, and i found myself instead lying on a creek bed, looking up through the water at the sky. There were clouds and blue sky and a bright sun, no ceiling at all. I could see reeds jutting out from the river bank. Fish swam by. Kim threw her leg over the edge of a chair to my right, and the chair morphed into a long wooden dock, with kim dangling her legs down into the water. I felt so cool and relaxed. i felt at peace there underwater. i could breathe normally and watch everything without the least bit of fear. i began to play with kim's feet, rubbing and massaging them. I began to see planets orbiting around her toes, tiny meteors and stars and her feet became the universe and i got closer and closer and closer.
