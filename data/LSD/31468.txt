After a while of playing with the light I thought of something to do which was start a bonfire outside in M's backyard, M was like hell yea lets do it but I dont have any wood. So we ended up using this wooden dresser that no one used and me and him had to carry it down the stairs outside and got the other girl that was trippin with me (I'll just call her shelly), we got outside and we were still mesmerized with the beauty of everything and we left mark to set up the bonfire while me and her stood and stared at the grass for about an hour and a half...the grass was like a whole new spiraling world of mysterious beauty it was wonderful...
