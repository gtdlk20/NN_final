At about 4 hours after ingestion, I felt utterly alive, with streams of vibrations flowing through my body, I could not really locate where my body was. There was a definite body-mind split which made me exist thoroughly in thought. And I felt like a kid about 4 years old, with a big honest smile on his face, longing for a playground, a place to play his life away. And playing gave life meaning, the joy of spilling energy for a cause that found purpose in itself, not needing any justification other than the sheer desire to play. I understood how important it was to be in peace with ones self in order to have a better life quality. The song they sing to us when were kids: Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merely, merely, merely, merely, life is but a dream., proved to take in tremendous amounts of wisdom.
