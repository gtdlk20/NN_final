We took the hits, my one friend and I took three and the other took two, at about 6:30 and proceeded to my house to see if my parents were hiding any shit we could smoke. The theft was a success, hadn't been caught yet, and then went back to the starting place. Just chill'n on the couch when My #1 friend (the 3 hit friend; I will refer to him as #1 and the 2 hit friend to #2) said 'Dude, I think I'm feeling it.' and rambled about these glowing strings he had in his room. We all knew that hell was about to break loose any time now. We walked outside when #1 went off the wall. #2 and I kept telling him to calm down as people were walking their dogs and kids. It was about 7:30 now when #2 lost it. I was begging them to cool it and that they were insane, no pun intended. At the end of the street I was in uncontrollable laughter.
