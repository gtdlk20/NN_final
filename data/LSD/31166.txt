Dianna, Summer, and I eventually found a deli that was open, and seemingly low-key. I picked up a box of hummus and pita chips, Dianna a croissant and a burrito, and Summer didnt get anything, since she claimed to have been eating cookies all night long. I knew that wasnt true, but I respected her decisions and well-being, so I let her be in harmony with herself. Really, the food and eating it turned out to be the most uneventful part of our commute back through the subway. I noticed that Dianna was studying the jelly texture of her brioche incredibly amusing way: she would squeeze it up in a nut-like shape, and then turn around to me while giggle-whispering, Doesnt it remind you of a vagina? (which yes, it totally did, by the way).
