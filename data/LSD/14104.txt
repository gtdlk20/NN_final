It was difficult to actually get my hands on the drug. My brother who uses drugs very liberally was no help at all, but was anxious to get his hands on whatever I was able to get. He offered to try it out first to determine how much I should take, and whether it was safe or not. My friend pulled through for me beyond my expectations and finally I had it in my hands.
