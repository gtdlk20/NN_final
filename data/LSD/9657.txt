Like with all acid trips, after the ego loss it all comes flooding back and I felt a part of the future, the past and the present, I looked into the past and made insights into the future. Just started enjoying being again, enjoying the taste of food and having a lust to learn again. The day continued and lots more happened that day, but they more revolved around life choices and making my friends, family and loved ones feel loved. I took a Valium for sleep just when I realized it was the last day to enroll for Uni. So I enrolled for Uni to start studying Neuroscience and then found out that it was my cousin's birthday. So it was a rather dramatic day following the trip, but that's another story of intense life integration.
