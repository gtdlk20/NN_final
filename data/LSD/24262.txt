I suffer from cluster headaches. It had started about 3 weeks prior to the trip. My friend had brought over some acid so I figures why not. Note that I didnt even know this was even possibly a cure for the headaches. Therefore there could be no placebo effect. Anyway, I started the trip and noticed the usual effects. I noticed that about 1/4 of the way along, my headaches which were quite severe that day, had completely gone away. I was astonished to feel better. Never would I think that this is a cure for anything, but it helped tremendously. The good thing is that since that day, I havent gotten any sort of cluster headaches since. Thanx cid!
