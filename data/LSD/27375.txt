Soon we decided to leave.  I had to be led as I could no longer steer myself in the mathematical fashion I had done before.  I remember walking onto the street and seeing the cars.  The tracers that the cars left behind made it seem as if they were moving at high speed.  Watching them it seemed like they were moving at one mile and hour.  The noise was jingle jangle of squeaks and mumbles.  Getting a cab was the funniest part as neither of us was in any decent enough position to speak properly and we had to enter an office to order it.  It seemed like it took twenty minutes to get the words out and then we were in the car-I was sitting in the front.
