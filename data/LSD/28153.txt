Summer break was ending and my friends (Bill, Marcus and Jamal) were just getting back into Colorado from other states.  We had all simultaniously gotten into this drug thing but we had never tripped together.  There was nothing to do on campus this Friday night, but I had 8 hits of acid on me.  I ran into my friends outside our dorm and told them my plan.  To make a night of it we drove Bill's Cougar up towards Rocky Mountain National park at about midnight.  About half an hour after dosing we stopped in a small mountain town along the way to walk around and look at things, including a large dinosaur (triceratops) skeleton in a shop window that we could not stop laughing at.  After meeting this creature and realizing we weren't sober any longer we decided to head on up into the mountains.
