H drives a 2-door sardine can and it is very funny to watch A inside of it because he has to stick his head out the window or put his head out the sunroof, but for some reason, I'm the one who's driving. Because H almost ran down two pedestrians while driving on MDMA at 4 am. A is too preoccupied and I don't think that J or G are in any condition to operate a vehicle. As H is getting into the back seat in a car that defines compact, I stop to watch the scene going on in the backseat. A silent girl who has just lost her fetus is sitting next to one very small window and in the middle is her bf who has finally given into crying and is clutching her like he is the oyster and she is the pearl. I imagine God to be a pearl hunter trying to take him away from her.
