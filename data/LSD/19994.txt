All in all it was fairly pleasant for a first trip. Probably best that I didn't know too much about the drug going in. Otherwise I might have been a bit paranoid. My second trip did not go nearly as well. Not knowing much about acid I of course didn't know about acid hang over either, and I was able to parlay it into a sick day from school the following morning. I slept like a baby.
