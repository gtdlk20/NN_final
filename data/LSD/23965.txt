We arrive at the gas station. I remember it was a funny feeling coming inside. It sort of made the trip more intense. We stood inside for a while, not knowing what to do exactly. We started laughing again, and I began to wonder how fucked up we looked. I suddenly remembered why we were here, so I went up to the desk and said give me a pack of cigarettes. For some reason this was hilarious to me, and I really tried hard not to laugh my ass off. I got the cigarettes and payed, and we walked outside. I felt a little embarassed.
