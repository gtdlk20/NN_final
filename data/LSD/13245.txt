The walk back was rather uneventful until I got to a cement design near my dorm. Supposedly, a fire burned down one of the buildings long ago, and now the area was cursed. If I step on the center of the design I won't graduate on time, or so the story goes. I decided that if there WAS any bad energy here, I would be able to sense it on acid. I stood, looking into the crisp night fairly confident nothing was going to happen. But then I started getting unexplainably uncomfortable...almost scared. I was so surprised that I was actually feeling something that the fear turned to curiosity. Then I saw it. A strange bipedal  shape blacker than the night, blacker than anything I have ever seen, moved with super-human speed from the fringe of my vision towards where I was looking. I saw it move from the edge of a nearby building, behind a tree and disappear. I couldn't believe it! Did I just see some manifestation of a ghost? I saw it again, this time on the other side of me. At this point I decided that whether it was a malevolent force or not, it deserved respect, so I left it alone and continued to my dorm.
