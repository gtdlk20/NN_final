Trees and grass were moving in a way I had never seen before, above the surface of the ocean.  Branches and leaves seemed to burn with motion, each becoming a hazy, insubstantial blur as they moved.  'Like kelp, but not' I said out loud.  It occurred to me that I was talking to myself, and had been for quite some time, and a fresh gale of laughter overtook me.  Each old and familiar sight was altered, changed somehow as to make it appear completely new and wonderful.  I looked up at the sky, curious, and was greeted by the sight of a vast cerulean ocean.  It was a very clear day, and both the moon and the sun were visible, and they both screamed and competed for my attention.  A jet soared overhead, and it left a great plume of rainbow exhaust all the way across the sky.  As I watched, the jet passed cleanly through the moon and out the other side, creating momentary chaos.  The sky changed entirely, becoming first darker and then lighter.  Colors sprang from nowhere, and disappeared just as quickly.  I knew how easy it would be to forget everything and watch the sky patiently until the end of time, but I had other things planned for the day.  I looked at an oak, and saw that each leaf was in fact a diffuse, green light.  The green gave way to blue, which in turn gave way to yellow.  These changes continued at a fairly predictable rate, and I realized that I had control over them!
