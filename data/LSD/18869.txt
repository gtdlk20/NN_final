My friend J looked at me in concern and asked if I was all right. That emotional tug of war came out in my voice. I replied with a two-faced yes then began to sit. I was trembling. The racing train of thoughts in my head and my racing heart seemed to compete against each other to the finish line of my composure limit. I started to think I was having a bad trip. I started viewing LSD as a superior being that I have disobeyed and was waiting to punish me with a horrible trip waiting in its wings. Dysphoria hit me like a bomb. I couldnt take it anymore. I was unconsciously talking to myself. My friend G told me to calm down. I replied with a How could I when death is just around the corner I wanted to yell, but I somehow controlled myself not to.
