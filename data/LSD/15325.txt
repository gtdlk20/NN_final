I wound up trading half the remaining tabs for food and wine, although  most people would share freely without the barter. I gave fair warning not to take more than half a tab, and not to think that it wasnÂ’t coming on and take more. Others might not have gotten or heeded that warning, hence the announcements and need for some talking down.
