I had been color blind since a traumatic event as a young child.  I have some ideas on why, and know the how, but being color blind is embarrassing to say the least. Let me just say, the 'need' for color got put unto the back burner for the sake of preservation. At many points in my life, if the crayon didn't have the label on it, I could not tell you what color is was, other than light or dark.  Grey, brown, green and dull red's all looked exactly alike to me.  Beyond that I can tell a difference between the primary colors, especially if I knew that's all that was there, but it was more by elimination than recognition.
