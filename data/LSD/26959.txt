As I said before, both of my previous trips had been pleasant, mild and solitary.  This was truly about to be a great experience--the shared one.  I was also excited for C., as it was his first time.  As the drug took hold of all of us, I could feel the energy level of the whole group rising and flowing in an indescribably free and encompassing manner.  The physical sensations I had were somewhat more intense than before:  I would even compare them in a small way to the effects of Ecstasy, which I have done once.  Anyway, we all talked and laughed and I could honestly feel everyone else's thoughts and energy.  It was absolutely beautiful, as if we were all walking through some bizarre Narnia together.
