By about 1AM I felt like food was a thing that could be reintroduced into my reality.  The flavor of pesto on a cracker was sharp, explosive, and rapturous to my entire body.  I practiced locating all the things I had brought with me (phone, iPod, tablet, wallet, glasses, etc.) and was very relieved to discover I was beginning to be able to function again.  I texted some friends to practice word-using, and opined that I had just been through something immense and that I would need some assistance fitting the pieces back together again.
