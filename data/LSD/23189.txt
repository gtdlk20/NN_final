In any event we arrived at the 7eleven and purchased random snacks, although the acid didnt give me the munchies at all. We decided to smoke when we arrived back at the dorm so we grabbed some cigars and snacks for the expected munchies. We began to watch The Butterfly Effect, and I almost shit myself. I love the movie straight or even while smoking weed, but definitely not on acid. Everyone unanimously wanted to stop watching it, so we turned on some techno and Winamp visualizations. I normally dont listen to much techno, unless high, but its excellent while on acid.
