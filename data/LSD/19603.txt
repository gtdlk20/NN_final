It is startling to me to realize that this has been my perfect happy day. Not everyday can be as so, I wouldnt be happy if everyday was like this, but Im writing the whole day, everything being poured out and formed up into young amateur shapes. This is finally the place where I have been searching for, the place where I can write perpetually, until my head aches and my eyes burn, from morning until the late evening sun gives way into the dark. I am here typing away, forgetting everything else. Its difficult to fight it back, to fight off the nagging call from all the things I need to do. This time wasnt planned, wasnt expected, how am I going to make up for it later? But I hear a whisper inside me, just go, it doesnt matter. Persevere. Your still there, Im keeping you there until the end.
