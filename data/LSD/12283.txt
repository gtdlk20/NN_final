The music I listened to while I was tripping was also giving me anxiety when I thought about it, for no good reason. My head feels like it's heavy and kinda numb, almost as if not from LSD but from the weed I smoked, it's just not clearing up and lingering for way longer than I want it to...  I have doubts about re-trying these experiments now, this might very well be the last time I touch these things for a while.  A few more hours pass and it all starts to finally clear up, very slowly.  I'm starting to get a minor headache and it feels as though I'm going to finally start recovering.  I've never been so happy because of a headache! I can feel my head again.  I quickly swallow an Advil cap, anticipating some relief by the time I'll lay down to go to sleep... I was able to go to sleep around 1am, after some 30 hours of being awake.
