After the acid trip you almost want to thank your sanity and thank being sober and appreciate the fact that your mind always and actively has a pretty solid grip on your perception of reality and the way we creatively see things in our everyday lives. I learn my mind is more strong and powerful than you think and is actually pretty resilient at the end of the day its just that the LSD has temporarily taken the place of my normal serotonin based perception of reality for the next 10 or 12 hours or so. LSD is what helps make my reality and perception instead of serotonin. Because theres no such thing as reality just the reality my mind creates for me, this is one of the functions of serotonin and LSD definitely shows this as well. There is no such thing as the right perception or the right way to look at something. There might be the way I usually look at something but thats just statistically normal not right or proper.
