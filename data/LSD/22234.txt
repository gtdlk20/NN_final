We go our separate ways, I return to my campsite ecstatic to drop for the first time in over 3 months. Upon inspection of the tabs I realize its 3 tabs cut into 2 making them both rectangular shapes rather than squares with a small perforation going through one side. I decided that night will be the night I take it, with no hesitation I pop the first in my mouth. I wait a little while for the second because I donÂ’t know the strength of the blotter and I wanted to get a feel for the strength without it hitting me like a train.
