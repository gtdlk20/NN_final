I dissolved a sugarcube with LSD in water with the intention of experimenting with very low doses during my regular work day. No clue about dose, strength, age, or provenance of the LSD - my former roommate had found some cubes in the back of our freezer when we moved out of our apartment and gave me some. I kept the water in a clear glass which I covered with plastic wrap and kept out of direct sunlight during the 8 days or so it lasted. I took sips from the glass on 4 or maybe 5 days, some of the days consecutively, some with several days in between. Who knows how much LSD it was, but Im wildly guessing that it was between 10 and 30 mics on any given day. I tried to make sure to keep the liquid under my tongue for at least 30 seconds before swallowing it.
