Oh Id been in this state before this day a couple times before, and I blocked it completely out of my mind.  This time I was going to accept it though.  I knew what I had to do something.  Anything at all.  It was like I had just been born again and everything was entirely new to me as I slowly rebuilt reality as I knew it. The next 12 or so hours I did everything I used to do as a kid and spent the entire time outside rediscovering all the joy from doing things I thought I was no longer interested in.  And over the next month I slowly grounded myself to where I felt like Id fully adjusted to my new mindset.  And here I am.  Though I cant say entirely how, I have been living life as a completely different person.  Previously afraid of being alone and separated lonely and depressed.  Now accepting the fact that if I love others and everything else, Im loving myself.  Be kind to ones self and feel the goodness in everything.  Happiness is subjective and its difficult to remember that.  I did go back to drugs but only for three days, and immediately felt them pull me back to my depressed state of mind.  Its been about three months since I last abused drugs, and four since this experience,  and Im more together and happier than Ive been in for as long as I can remember.
