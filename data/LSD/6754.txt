I realized somewhere in my random mental wanderings out on that deck that half the reason I was freaking out was that I was alone.  So, once again operating in survival mode, I called my friend A, and explained that I had take 2 hits of LSD, but that the effect I'd gotten was far more potent than I'd expected, and that I was in need of some companionship.
