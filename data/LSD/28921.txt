We all start to want to move to a new spot out side of the tunnels. So we get out of the tunnel and onto the gulf course at about 2 in the morning and walk to my friend D's house to kick it on his porch. On the way out of the tunnel I felt like I was sewer people or something the world outside just looked new and glorious. We walk off and I notice the ground that I was walking on was like cement on a gulf course not so much as hard but as sturdy. We got to his house and sit at the table he had set up in the front.
