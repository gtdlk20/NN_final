Reaching the payphone was suprisingly easy however it was already taken. This small setback seemed like a huge blow to my ambitions of making a phone call. Not wanting to hang around outside the shops, due to intense feelings of self-consciousness bordering on paranoia, I decided to go into a shop to waste a few moments of time. Stumbling into a off-licence I was hit by the bright fluorescent lights. I walked in squinting to see the local nutter in there being served. The man had hassled myself and a friend previously, after another acid night, on the walk home. He didnÂ’t seem violent at all but was random, insistent and intrusive (at least last time he was).  Putting my head down pretended to be intensely interested in some crisps. The nutter left and I managed to stagger out of the shop with a drink.
