The trip really did change the way that I actually thought for a a few weeks.  It is hard to explain, but the way I thought was actually transformed.  The biggest effect was that nothing petty even fazed me.  I never felt like arguing about anything with anyone for any reason, that all felt below me.  But I noticed that that effect wore off over time, and I feel like my old self.  I don't know if thats good or bad though.
