At this time I began to get a very large surge of fear and I wanted to go home, so I told everyone that I had to go home. They were both pissed off, they just couldn't understand what I was feeling. I dropped Jim off at one of his friends house. It was just Wally and myself now. Not quite knowing what to do I drove back to the grocery store parking lot. I was scared to go home because I was a total mess and I thought my mom would have a huge fit.
