Anyway, we had got hold of our trips and decided to go to our mates house (pete) to ingest them. Jack told us that it wouldn't be wise to drop so early in the evening (it was 4.00pm) cos we would be flying when the rest of civilisation was still active. I thought 'fuck that, I wanna trip!' and dave agreed so we ended up taking them about 5.00pm. Now I thought that if the first trip was anything to go by I would be able to handle everyday situations quite easily (I had made arrangements to see my girlfriend that evening) so I thought we would drop, go round my girlfriends house, come up and be back at petes house before it started peaking and get out of hand. Pete and his flatmates, who I wasn't too familiar with, started their evening of getting heavily stoned so I thought it would be rude to leave so early after getting there so I stayed for a few spliffs. 5.20pm (20 minutes after dropping) I felt strangely inhibited but I couldnt tell if I was just stoned or if I was coming up.
