Shortly thereafter, I decided to go into the Jacuzzi, but I had no bathing suit.  I took my linen pants off and went into the spa in my boxers.  Two of my friends joined me in the Jacuzzi.  I remember chugging beer very fast.  When I got out of the spa, I was wet, and needed a towel.  Get me a towel, I need a towel, someone get me a fucking towel!  All subconscious.
