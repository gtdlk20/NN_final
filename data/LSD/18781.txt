I spent the next hour waiting anxiously for the effects to become apparent. I began to notice a mild body high and euphoria, but saw no immediate changes in perception or thought. I stepped outside my room and began wandering throughout the house, studying the environment. I noticed the shadow of a light fixture which appeared to be swaying back and forth against the wall, even though the lamp itself was completely still. This was about an hour into the trip and aside from some mild euphoria and hallucinations of shadows swaying and expanding, I otherwise seemed to be thinking clearly and felt somewhat normal. I was observing this environment that I interact with on a daily basis, from the perspective of being on a tour with my mind and the many tricks its capable of as the guide.
