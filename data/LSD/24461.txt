We arrived at the Land of Moses around 2 a.m. It turned out to be a graveyard in the middle of Nowhere Indiana. By now I was tripping very intensely. There was a strange woman guiding us the whole way. Her name was Carrie. We walked throughout the graveyard and made it to a giant statue of a man holding a sword. Carrie spoke of the Statue never facing the same direction. We watched as the lights around it flickered violently. Some sort of electrical Fury. I could feel an intense energy that defied any other trip I'd ever had. Soon Carrie's stories had my girlfriend so scared that she was in tears. The look in Carrie's eyes was so mesmerizing. She looked like she was on LSD as well, but I knew that she was not. She spoke of possessions and figures in the graveyard. Several of the people with us saw something walking in the distance and became frightened. The energy was so strong.
