I just let one hundred and five micrograms of LSD dissolve in my mouth and swallowed the paper. Like unlocking a door and throwing away the key. I let this sink in for a moment, knowing that I was about to be completely at the liberty of my own subconscious or Psychedelic Ego for the next 8-10+ hours. As the late Terence McKenna never tired of pointing out, this guarantee of profound effect, for better or worse, is what separates psychedelics from every other method of spiritual inquiry.
