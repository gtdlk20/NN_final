	The night continues on at the same park, and in a wide field we all notice a giant pole sticking up from the ground. We all look in wonder, until one of us starts running over to it, with the rest following close behind. Turns out it was a telephone pole (Go figure!). I was barefoot during this whole ordeal (Hippy nature I suppose) as well as most of all last summer. I felt this soothing, soft, almost perfect scratch against my feet. I would pick up handfuls of this sand I was standing on, and just let it slowly drain from my hands. During this repetitive action the thought kept running through my head of there being as many planets in this existence as there are grains of sand on this Earth. Staggering realization when you feel like you can actually put somewhat of a tab on the possibility.
