(what really happened): after my friends notice that I really shouldnt be at the party anymore (somewhere around 3am) they try to get me out to the car. After 20 minutes of convincing me that I wouldnt sink into the pavement if I walked on it, I trudge to my ride's car. He opens the back door and says get in. I say am I under arrest? He (wanting me to just get in so we can leave) says yes. I roll around the backseat for the next few hours in my little nightmare while my friends try to navigate the car while tripping themselves (they too had been visited by Legos, and our driver was on a quarter sheet).
