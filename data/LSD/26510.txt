I have tripped many times, but the time that I felt it the most was when I took 2 geltabs with many of my friends.  First, after about 40 minutes after ingestion, everyone became overwhelmed with euphoria to the extreme.  A smile became plastered on each of our faces.  Everything seemed so funny and I became incredibly happy.  But, we didn't actually start seeing visuals until a couple of hours later.  Slowly, you start thinking of some crazy shit that seems to make perfect sense.  Its impossible to explain exactly what trippin is like, is has be to experienced.
