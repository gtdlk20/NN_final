Walking on the sidewalks was great.  We talked the whole time, but I don't remember any of the subjects now.  Both of us kept forgetting what we were talking about. It was really funny in the beginning, but after about the 4th or 5th time you could say it was kind of getting to us.  It was strange how it kept happening to both of us. The conversations shifted towards our memories, long-term and short term.  Matt had the notion that we should carry notepads from then on and constantly write down thoughts that we wouldn't want to forget, so that we would have a lot of information to review when we were older, most of which we would have forgotten by then.  Seems like an okay idea, right?
