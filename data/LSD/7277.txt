Because of the near arrival of parents at this particular house, and given my terrified state, my friends decided it would be best to find a new place to stay at.  At around 6:30 PM, J and B drove me to another friends house, who happened to have a gigantic basement, complete with a ping pong table, air hockey table, huge TV, and tons comfortable furniture.  My girlfriend met up with us at this house, and her presence seemed to comfort me slightly.  However, the real turning point in my trip was when I decided to start playing air hockey.  By applying myself to the world around me, instead of reclining on a couch, I seemed to convince myself that I truly did exist.  The LSD allowed me to play with an unparalleled amount of focus, and I had realizations about myself and the game.  The LSD allowed me to play with an unparalleled amount of focus, and I had realizations about myself and the game.  I saw how air hockey perfectly demonstrated newtons law of motion, that each and every force had an equal and opposite force.  A fast shot on an air hockey table can easily reflect back with the same speed, and the puck is kept in constant motion.  My opponents seemed to try to force their will on the puck, hitting it aggressively, and it only seemed to cause them to score on themselves.  I saw that the way to win was to merely redirect the force and move with the puck, as opposed to forcing my own intention on it.  I think this kind of thinking began to apply to my LSD trip as well, because in the process of playing four air hockey games, I lost my former sense of confusion and fear, and began to simply go along with it.  I went undefeated before the table itself overheated and refused to work.
