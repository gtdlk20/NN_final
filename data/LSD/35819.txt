It was friday night and me and my buddies had planned to do acid for the past week. My buddy Shaun supplied the blotter tabs. I had bought four and was only planning on taking two (since this was my first time), but my friends forced me to take them all at once, so I did. It seemed like forever waiting for the acid to start working (45-60 min). When I started to get high I felt like my legs were soaking in a hottub, it was very relaxing. After about 10 min I started to feel the stronger effects, I couldn't stop laughing, even when I thought about hurtfull, depressing events that happened in my life all I could do was laugh about them. 15 minutes later I was still laughing, but I started to see stuff now. The walls of buildings would seem to sway and buckle, trees would seem to sway but there was no wind.I could hear a disturbance all around me (almost like static). I wandered around town like this for a while. There were times when I felt scared, like I was loseing my mind a very overwhelming feeling. I had to find cover so I went to the teen center. I stayed there and tried to watch T.V. In the back room but I couldnt pay attention so I turned it off. The tv then began to almost split apart but not quite,like it was trying to split apart. I then noticed the floor was doing the same thing. I left the teen center and wandered some more. I had lost my friends so I had no direction. I was so obcest with perfection that I lit my swetter on fire outside the fire station cause I had found some dirt on it.I then went home and layed in bed all night trying to sleep. I look forward to acid again.
