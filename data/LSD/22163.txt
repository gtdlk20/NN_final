I led our little group into the forest stopping on the way to pick up what I thought to be a bone, but turned out to be a stick resembling a short staff with the head of a dragon (still treasure that to this day) As we walked we discussed how the darkness enveloped us in the most comforting way possibly, like we could be anywhere at all hugged by the vastness of infinity. We all hugged and made a den with our blankets, it was wonderful.
