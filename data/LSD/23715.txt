I was overtaken by emotion and found myself retreating within, so I leK Summer alone to get her sleep and walked over to the mirror. The last time Id seen myself was before wed leK for Times Square, so I wanted to check on how my lipstick and wild hair had been doing. It seemed amusing to me how people dont recommend looking at their own reflections in the mirror on acid, yet I would have been way unhappier with my appearance if Id been sober: my hair had fluffed up significantly, and all that was leK of my dark brown stain was a dry-looking line along the outer edges of my lips. I looked so different than I used to on a daily basis.
