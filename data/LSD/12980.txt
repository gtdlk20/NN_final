The synthasesia and 'mental garbage' effects, the most striking aspects of the LSD experience, disappeared after an hour or two.  But I was left with the ability to think weird thoughts.  These thoughts were not so much 'new' as creative extensions of beliefs I already had.  I was able to think about them with peculiar lucidity.  Example: in my line of work lots of people are super egotistical, clawing their way up to a more prestigious position.  I have long been somewhat embarassed about this prestige-whorishness and self-contragulation but unable to prevent it in myself.  On acid, the word 'prestige' actually became a disgusting, vile word.  It didn't make me think of negative attributes, it had negative attributes, in the same way that the thought 'red' is linked to a mental image of the color 'red.'
