I guess that was an attempt at explaining the fourth realization of the night, which dawned upon me as I was pressing said keys! I realized that on a day-to-day basis it was only what I had to define me, not who I was. It wasnt about my qualities, or my personality traits, no, it was about my clothes and my nail polish and my makeup and... it couldnt be that way. Not anymore. This experience was way too spiritual for me to deny my existence as a spirit. As a formerly incredibly nihilist-absurdist person, - I find comfort in chaos - I just couldnt accept meaninglessness anymore, no I had to build up my soul and believe in something greater than me. Something intangible. I needed to be more.
