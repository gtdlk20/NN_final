I have learned a lot though from the experience.  I learned that acid is not something that you want to take very nonchalantly.  Previously I was taking it like it was candy.  I know now how serious this stuff is and how badly this can really mess with your head.  IÂ’ll take more precaution in the future with my dose and my surroundings.
