	So we returned to our apartment again, and sat amidst the now wrinkled and sad confetti bits with our minds absolutely blown to bits. My mind was a blank slate, and I couldn't think of a damn thing to say. But  this whole trip was like a metaphor for life: starting off fun and playful (childhood), moved on to exploration of the world (teenage years), then violently thrust into a strange world, with no other options but wander around wondering what we were going to do next (adulthood), until we got tired and wrinkled and eventually fell asleep (death).
