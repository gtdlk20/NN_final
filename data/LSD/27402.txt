We got to Chris's house and sat in my friend Shaun's van, I asked Chris how he was doing and he said he wasn't doing that well and he thought it was a little too intense too. After talking to Chris for awhile I looked out the window of the van, and saw a pit of alligators and other lizards where grass normally is. I thought this was amazing and couldn't believe how real they looked, and all of a sudden a man riding a horse was charging down the street. Holy shit I thought, he's coming for me. Then he was gone I look all around and the alligators are still there. This isn't good my visuals usually go away after blinking or looking at something else, but this was different they wouldn't leave, are they real or fake I couldn't decided. My mind would not tell me.
