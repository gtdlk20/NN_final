After the show finished I remember trying to take stock of my situation.  Where was I?  Where did I need to go?  Who was I with?  Was I behaving in an appropriate fashion?  I was suddenly transported into a very hostile and confusing world.  Leaving the stadium was difficult - I became paranoid and confused by the crowds of people around me.  There seemed to be a residue of the light show from the concert following me around, wherever I looked I was greeted by brightly flashing lights and gross visual disturbances.  I can honestly say that at this point I was completely unable to seperate the effects of the drug and the reality of what was happening around me.  I heard voices instructing me to do various things, which I thankfully managed to ignore, I felt eyes upon me, at one point I found myself wandering around in a completely different city.  At least that was what my brain was telling me!  I knew I was in Wellington, yet my brain persisted in telling me that I was back in my home town of Dunedin wandering familiar city streets.  I had also become prone to incoherent outbursts and was distrustful of everyone around me.
