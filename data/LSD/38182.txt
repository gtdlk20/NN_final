Here were I live LSD is very expensive and sometimes you don't even get your trips, the dealers steal all our cash, So sometimes I would get a half but not less! Well It seems that every time I trip out something stays with me I don't have hectic flashbacks but strange visions eg: I have a permanet trail shadow following my hands when I move them around and at night all the shadows in my room moves like ghosts!
