I managed after a short while to get back into the rhythm of the party and enjoyed myself for the next few hours. However the drama had not finished yet. I was sitting outside with a few friends in the back garden. One of their friends, who I hardly new, was a bit of a ruffian. He had also had the acid and was going a bit mental. He was talking constantly to the group pacing the garden. The group listened to him and laughed occasionally. I laughed along with the group politely while looking for an excuse to leave as it was obvious that this guy was losing it and could turn violent. Whether he could sense my uncomfortableness  or just didnt like the look of me I dont know, he suddenly stared at me and asked what I was laughing at. Were there was laughter it fell into intense silence. It is hard to explain the sudden dropping feeling that came over me as he made his challenge. There was laughter and a warm fuzzy feeling, then suddenly a deep dropping sensation, silence, a sudden sharp coldness, and a feeling that I was on the spot and had to respond as a failure to could result in violence, to me by him. This sudden flip of events shocked me so severely that I could only manage that I was laughing at nothing. This didnt help matters much and it was only the intervention of mutual friends which calmed the mad fucker down. I left the garden and went inside. I managed to brush of the confrontation and enjoy the rest of the night. The ruffian later apologised for the outburst.
