I can't believe my girlfriend had to sit through the whole class taking notes, I was tripping harder and harder as I thought about what I was thinking about. I was tripping harder and harder as I thought about what I was thinking about. I then realized I was in control of the acid. The harder I wanted to trip, the harder I did. A video was put on the wall for the class to watch, it was 40 minutes long... There was a point where I was watching the doctor speak... And his face would slowly start morphing into a frog, I shit you not. It was incredible... Then all those bricks on the walls began dancing a bit, forming straight lines that went into the ground. That is where I hallucinated the most.
