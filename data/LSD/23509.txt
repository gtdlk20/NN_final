Our acid-uniform was extremely revealing, but it was absolutely perfect for the incredible amounts of paint we were about to pour on each other. I was wearing brown lipstick, and immediately realized it couldnt stay on. I needed to be fully naked, fully raw, so I quickly went to the bathroom to remove it. It was laborious, but entertaining; I tried to use tissues and water, but it smeared a red stain all over my chin - which only made me laugh more. Most people say mirrors arent a good idea on acid, but I have to disagree. I loved looking at myself so happy and carefree.
