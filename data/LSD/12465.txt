It was about 3am at this point, the hallucinations began to wear off and I didnt want to stop tripping. I took another tab and wandered around the house where I met the first friend I tripped with. I told him I took another tab and he said Uh oh. I got kind of angry at this and asked why did he said that. He said Well tomorrow, youre going to be tripping really hard and no one else will be.... Wanker I thought to myself. He doesnt know a fucking thing about LSD, this is his first time doing it. Doesnt he know that since I didnt take 2 at the same time I wont trip THAT hard? Fuck him. Then I explained to him that Ill trip in the same way I just did and Ill be fine. He said Oh, ok. Youre more experienced with drugs so Ill take your word. I calmed down and went upstairs alone to think for myself. I sat down on a friends bed and felt normal. Emotionless, I guess. I heard a loud buzzing noise out of nowhere. Then I heard my friends talking, even though everyone was downstairs. Within seconds I felt like everything was caving in on me and evil faces began to appear everywhere. Amongst a bundle of clothes, on an ipod, etc. I ran downstairs back to my friends and sat in silence with them thinking Youre only happy (can you even say you are?) because youre with friends. In a few hours most of them are going home and youll be alone. Youll have to go back to your house with your lame housemates and youre going to freak the fuck out. Oh, and your girlfriend hates you. I saw evil faces in all objects and began to feel really nervous, until my tripping friend said Hey, Im going for a walk. Space seems like itd be awesome to look at! I felt happier and comfier, I felt like I could talk to him one on one and Id be safer. When we went outside, he told me Im gonna go get F (our other tripping friend), one sec). I told myself, standing outside in the grass completely alone in the dark at 4am, Youre alone now. Fight your fears and just like that I felt completely good about myself. To brighten it even more, my friend told me he wanted to take another tab and would buy the last tab off me! I felt great. Now I had money for some grub during the week AND another partner to trip with for the next few hours. Bad trip phase was really over.
