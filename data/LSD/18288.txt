This overall feeling I had at this stage of the trip was like this strange perception I had of everything that was really only unique to the tryptamines. An abrasive, alien and hyperreal look at the universe. Like a mindful cleanse. I began to see faces everywhere too, similar to when on mushrooms. It actually reminded me in some ways of my last strong mushroom trip the rushing cleansing feeling and the seeing faces everywhere. And my last strong shroom trip was right across the street from where I was now. A little before this change in perception though the LSD trip became much more profound and seemingly hyperdimensional almost. It felt very cosmic as well and at one point unifying and it felt like I saw and touched the universal consciousness where I invaded its essence and it invaded mine. It was a feeling of oneness. I remember we were listening to classic psychedelic rock music (like we often do) and the Jimi Hendrix song Getting My Heart Back Together (the 5 minute version) we were both so taken away by the sound of the guitar and it was so interesting and satisfying the whole song and thats when I feel we really understood where that Jimi Hendrix guitar sound actually comes from and why its so perfect for acid. So electric and vibrational. Music felt so much more vibrational than it usually does when tripping on shrooms. On shrooms music sounds more distorted and echoey but on acid the music seemed to sound better? More ascetically pleasing and more vibrational. Both are very emotionally touching and deep however.
