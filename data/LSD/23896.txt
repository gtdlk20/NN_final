I began to look at the licence plates on the back of the cars, and every single car was from a different state. I wonder how I made the the licence plates appear all diferent, because I know that it was not likely that they were all from different states. I looked up and saw and heard three different scenes, one of a back tire of a dirtbike kicking dirt up, another of firecrackers poping, and the third of different groups of people walking around.
