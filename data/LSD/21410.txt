I cleared the entire day for the trip so that there would be no distractions and I would have plenty of time for the trip itself as well as time to recover. I woke up to the sound of my alarm clock at 6:00 in the morning and had initially planned on ingesting the acid on an empty stomach, but was considerably hungry when I woke up so I ate two pieces of toast with blackberry jam. I washed my face, brushed my teeth, and took the initial dose of 105Î¼g LSD on a single tab of blotter paper by 6:23 AM, approximately one hour before sunrise.
