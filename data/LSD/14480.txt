I always work at 8 oclock on Saturday mornings at Chuck E. Cheeses. The job has always been fun because I work in the kitchen with a lot of my friends and the managers there are amazing. I have been working there for a while and the job is basically second nature, so I thought Id try to have a little bit of fun. One Friday night a friend of mine told me he had some LSD but didnt want to take it anymore, so he sold it to me so I could see if I could successfully have an acid trip during work the next day. Now I am by no means a drug addict, or anything like that, but I do like to experiment with different types of drugs, especially psychedelics to explore my mind and learn more about myself and my environment.
