As I walked, I worried about what was actually going on. I thought for a while that I should stop and spend the night in a grove of trees. I had to be home sometime the next day and so I decided I had to get to my car that night. I thought I would go (?) insane if I did not keep moving. I decided to rid myself of my paraphenalia, and to put my drivers license under the insole of my shoe.
