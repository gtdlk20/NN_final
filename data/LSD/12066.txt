4:15 PM. Well as it turns out, the grocery store that we went to was one that I used to work at. Oh man, this is gonna be weird. As we walked up towards the store through the parking lot I started to have thoughts about when I used to work there. I saw the new recruits pushing carts, doing the old shit that I used to have to do, and now these poor bastards were doing the labor mindlessly like zombies. When we walked through the doors I felt the coolness of the inside air blow against my face like it was decontaminating my whole body. Then it got weird.
