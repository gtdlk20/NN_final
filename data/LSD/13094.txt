The scream alerted the farmers up the hill, whom I was renting the cottage from, as to my strange state, and someone came down to see after me.  I did not recognize the man, although I knew him well as we had talked often.  I thought that he was a 'concept' in my brain, a part of my mind which was oriented to challenge me somehow into solving the 'mystery'.  I thought that all of these bizarre and alien feelings I was having was me entering another level of consciousness, that the mystery I was feeling was the 'test', the challenge, like in classical literature, 'before entering these gates you must face a great challenge.'  I thought this man who came down to see me was like an adversary, a program sprung from my mind.  His questions to me (are you okay? what's going on? etc.) seemed like game.  I remember, embarassingly, that I was laughing and yelling at him.
