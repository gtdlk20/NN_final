Next came more coughing, and eventually I purged. What the fuck? I havent purged on acid since since that sketchy fractal acid blotter I took years and years ago (which I suspected to not be LSD but probably a DO-x compound). I still didnt make the connection that what I had taken today wasnt acid. I thought it was really strange, but figured my anxiousness, my desire to get away from busy roads and pollution was what had made me purge. Everything is possible, as acid is so much a catalyst of my mental processes.
