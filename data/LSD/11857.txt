On the way there it was growing dark.  In this period I experienced some of my last 'trippy' thoughts, prominently including the sensation that eventually 'everything will happen' because of the infinite nature of time.  Arthur countered that an infinite system doesn't work in this manner.  I argued that because the universe continually contracts, reinvents itself, expands, and then contracts and regenerates again, surely after a certain point enough unique universes will have generated for every conceivable possibility to have manifested itself in reality.  I think my point was dismissed as na√Øve.
