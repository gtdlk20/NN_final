LSD is a powerful drug.  It can provide the user with invaluble insight or plunge them into the depths of insanity.  It's impossible for the first time user to know what will occur, so do not decide whether or not to use this drug lightly.  I've been lucky, and found the drug to be a window into insight.  I'd like to share my most recent experience.
