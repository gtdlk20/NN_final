I was sitting in the living room listening to Pink Floyd's first album, The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, when I first noticed a slight change in atmosphere. The walls in my small but high-tech hovel, seemed to start undulating as if they actually breathed with a life of their own. I was startled at first but quickly realized that this must be a direct result of the natural inspiration in which I had imbibed. I slowly floated into a kind of separate reality, construed of a nature totally unknown to me before, but yet, so real. Or at least so it seemed to me at the time. I recalled vague, complicated words written by Aldous Huxley in his treatise on mescaline.... The Doors Of Perception. Chairs and curtains, I KNEW what he meant. The lines, the shapes, the colour. These thoughts all came to me and meandered about and through my head like fleeting spirits from beyond reason. Thats when I realized that profound changes were taking place inside my very head. I was never to be the same again I thought, this is the end all of end alls. This is the key to that realm that has always just been out of reach, just outside of my limited perception. It was as Huxley had said, the flood gates had been opened. I searched in vain for a reason but all reason had floated away like the smoke from my cigarette. My ego had died. My SELF had dissolved into an effervescent cauldron of teeming geometrics. I was one with all. To me, that brought great peace, no fear, and no reason to reason. It was if a great burden had been lifted from my shoulders, I was free. And in that instant I realized, we all are free. It always has been and always will be a matter of perception. And we hold the key.
