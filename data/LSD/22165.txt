We returned back to the room and listened to music and fell deep into hallucinations. Paintings I had done over the past few years covered the walls and the heater sent a current of warm air up, fluttering the prayer fags and over all giving the feeling of the whole room flying through a vast plane, Id look at my friend and we'd turn to the walls and lay back in wonder. The palette of colour in that room was like nothing Ive ever seen.
