It may be worth noting at this point that the trip itself hasnt been overly visual, although visuals are certainly present. I believe that the true force of the LSD trip is psychological in nature. Also abstaining from Cannabis apart from one small joint at the T+3.30 mark did remove a certain chaotic depth that I believe Cannabis adds, it was an altogether more coherent and clear trip which I found enjoyable and useful for the purpose of this trip.
