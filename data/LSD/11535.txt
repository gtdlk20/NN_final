During brief periods of consciousness, I felt like I was adrift in infinite blackness.  I knew the blackness was in no way malevolent, but what simply was.  The elements of my personality/self floated in the blackness in fluid puddles like oil packets in water.  Occasionally, it occurred to me to wonder what the blackness was or what might be on the other side of itif there was another side.  I pretty much decided that the blackness was everything/nothing, but I didnt feel like I had the energy to be too curious.  I was content just to float in between the spasms.  This continued for about two hours.
