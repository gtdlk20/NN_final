It's not like I do it everyday. It's been YEARS since I did it before just recently. And thats fine with me. I was celebrating a 4.00 average for this term in school, and thats for Comp Sci, Math, University Honors and some history courses, not basket weaving. My cums up to 3.54 so I am sitting pretty at school, and work for those who would assume otherwise. Which goes to point out the ole 'amotivational syndrome' is a load of myth also.
