At around 2:30am, I connected with my cat in an incredible way. As if the process of the tracking mechanism in a jet's missile launching system was in reverse, he absolutely freaked out to say the least. Hopping around the patterns on the floor, it was obvious I had affected this creature using my mind and body language.
