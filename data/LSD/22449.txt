We went to another friendsÂ’ place to watch some television around 9pm, and I was still tripping although by this point it had settled down into a more marijuana high, which I dislike. I had a dentist appt. the next morning.  At 10pm, I decided to drive home, this was a HORRIBLE decision.  At 10pm, I decided to drive home, this was a HORRIBLE decision.  I was ok when I started the engine, but right when I started driving I knew that I should have put my car back in park.  I drove in circles for at least 30 minutes before getting onto the freeway, driving on the freeway was a whole other shithole because I was terrified to drive over 65, and could barely drive 40 mph,  I maintained a 60 mph speed the entire way back home, and that was the most horrifying drive of my entire life.  I tried listening to music so I could calm down, but the forest and trees were so luminous and dark.  My car was dark as well since it was nighttime, so that made it even more difficult to focus on the road.  That 20 min. drive turned into an hour and a half since I was tripping way too hard to drive and could not even drive the speed limit.
