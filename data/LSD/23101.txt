Thank Christ that ended. I FINALLY walked relieved through the door. It was officially a Friday night, and I was trippin out. I met up with my friends, who had also taken acid in school and asked them how they were doing and shared my own mind blowing experiences. We were to go hiking at a local park near my house. I drove straight there with my friends from school. We hiked through the park and examined the large lake there. We all loved the nature of it and continued our walks.
