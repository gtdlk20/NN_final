I went and laid down on my mother's bed, thinking it would be comforting.  I curled into a fetal position in the middle of the bed under the sheets, which was incredible. I could imagine what a baby must feel like in the womb. Within moments though, I had the very strong feeling that there were other beings in the room with me, entities about 3 feet tall making strange noises and surrounding the bed.  This was frightening and I got up and went into the other room.  I spent the next hour staring at the close rack with some pants hanging on it.  The clothes were all swaying back and forth with such intensity. It was startling, I never thought one drop of acid could have such a powerful effect.  My friend had laid down in my brother's room and was meditating quietly, and I did the same thing.  I don't remember the hours after I laid down, but when I came to, the major effects were gone.
