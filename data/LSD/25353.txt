After half an hour or so I started feeling queasy an anxious.  A little time after that I started to laugh like crazy for no apparent reasons; basically I just looked at my buddies face (and he was so stoned!) and started to laugh and laugh...it was really funny.  After this insane laughing trip I started looking at some books and thats when the visuals kicked in.  It made no sense.  The letters were moving back and forth fucking up my perception.  At one point I thought I was reading thoughts from my unconscious. At one point I thought I was reading thoughts from my unconscious.  I was amazed by this feeling...overwhelmed I would say.  I felt like a... Recipient of ice cream, and I could dig inside myself, digging out secrets I didn't know of but were there after all.  After putting the book down I started to see things which made me ecstatic.  I had visions of big city landscapes.  I could see it clearly; buildings and skyscrapers in front of me in a distance.  And this is kinda funny 'cause a couple of years later I moved out in the big city...kinda strange.
