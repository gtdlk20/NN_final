Now that I am passed out, I vividly start hallucinating with lots of closed-eye visuals until everything becomes clear, there is a black background and and a high frequency sound starts to appear. I hear it and it felt like it was a sharp knife cutting through my head. By this time I start sweating profusely and start shaking as well (this was what she told me). While all this is happening I start seeing this ball of energy that looked like plasma (?) or ball-lightning comes out through my chest and immediately after I see two golden colored snakes burst through my chest and start spiraling and coiling around this ball-lightning. While they were spiraling I see they were radiating different colored lights and they went ever so high while coiling around. Just after the snakes stop spiraling and coiling around the ball of energy, I see a small entity that was purple-red in color and looked like its a small demon with horns, a pointed tail and a rust colored staff" on its right hand. It quickly climbed up the snakes and goes on top of their head and it looks down at me and gives a wicked grin. I wake up with sweaty hands and head and I see her opening eyes as well.
