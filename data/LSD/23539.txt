Sitting there wasnt as euphorically entrancing as it looked, by the way. As soon as I settled, I just thought... again. I loved to fall into pensiveness, but the more I came up, the more thoughts I had. I couldnt really concentrate on one single thing; everything induced me to question it. I was so removed from the reality around me that everything was overwhelming, and arising simultaneously. But instead of staying separate and going nowhere, it was like all of those questions united into one big reflection - and, after reaching such a promising conclusion on my living situation, I began evaluating other aspects of my life. All of it, all at once.
