T=3:35: There had been a protest nearby earlier in the evening and now there were police sirens.  Uh-oh.  Suddenly my anxiety levels spiked and I felt nauseous.  Not because I thought they were coming for me -- just because of the change in background noise.  'Set and setting'.  I was worried the trip was about to take a turn for the worse.  I had money, no criminal record, had been careful all my life, was being quiet, was safe and undetectable in my apartment.  They were coming for people less careful on the streets.  I thought about how arbitrary the war on drugs was, how police were their own culture and the urban poor were their own culture and the technical professional classes were their own culture and only ever occasionally intersected.  I wasn't hurting anyone, and I would get away with this anyway; meanwhile people far poorer than me who sold things to pay their rent were risking jail time and destroyed lives and homelessness.  It all seemed so artificial.  Structures of social regulation and control.  Ten thousand years ago we had been cavemen and tribesmen; we had taken substances like this for mystical experiences and rites of passage.  There were no controlled substance laws back then -- so arbitrary, some grandstanding congressman trying to make his career on oppressing others who he had never met, had never conversed with, had never even genuinely tried to understand.  The sirens and the sounds of cars and trains blended together into a smooth background soundscape of modernity and anxiety.  I went to the bathroom to lay on the cold tile floor because I suddenly felt overheated and a bit nauseous.
