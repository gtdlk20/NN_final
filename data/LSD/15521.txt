4. [+2:00] Reality is ripping at the seams. Disintegrating. I can recognize what I'm seeing around me, but as I jitter with madness, it just FEELS like everything I've learned about the laws of reality, how things are defined, how they work, is no longer relevant. Nothing is as I thought it was, from the very basics. Time almost stops and each moment seems like the big bang in its importance and magnitude. Then restlessness. How do I deal with this?? Just keep breathing deeply and smile... Communication is, sometimes, almost impossible. Every single word has infinite meanings, and it's hard to put up a sentence that will be comprehensible to others. I start trying, but then forget basic words, and eventually can't follow my own speech. Or I do it right, but my friends completely misinterpret it.
