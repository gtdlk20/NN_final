We make our way back to campus, satisfied with how the brief outing has gone.  I spent some time watching a television program about the planet Earth with my compatriots before remembering that even if I was not feeling hungry at the moment, I would be quite soon.  I say farewell to everyone and head downtown for a sandwich.
