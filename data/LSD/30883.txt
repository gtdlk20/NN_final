As soon as I saw myself, I was shell-shocked. My face striped in red and gold, my legs scribbled in teal and navy, and my tummy yellow and purple - I felt so feral, so animalistic, so wild. I felt like a ferocious version of me. Summer and Dianna turned around to tell me how beautiful I looked, which only fueled this sensation more. Summers face was half-black and half-teal, and she also seemed real and majestic... and Dianna? Diannas face was green! She looked like mother nature! I felt connected to the two of them on a deeper level, like we were a tribe of painted Indians (Im pretty sure that if Id taken two tabs - like we plan to do soon - and felt a more intense high, I would have started to do some powwow dance shit. Summer had been dancing all night already, as she has had dancing training background, and was so in-tune with the harmonies that played, I loved watching her).
