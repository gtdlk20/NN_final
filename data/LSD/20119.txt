T + 13hr.: It is the early hours of the next morning, sometime around 6am or so when I finally carry A up to bed and we pass out. Sleep comes quickly, but is accompanied by an odd dream where I am a street hot dog vendor who is serving little people in my buns rather than hot dogs. I wake up after sleeping almost 11 hours and feel extremely refreshed.
