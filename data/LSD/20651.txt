So anyway, me and G got back into our car and dropped the acid, roughly 8 pm at night, and drove back to his place. We sat down in his room and played some music for a bit waiting for the effects to kick in, the whole time which I spent complaining about how I thought we got ripped off. After 30 mins had passed nothing. So I suggested we smoke some skunkweed I had to help bring on the effects. Whilst on my second joint the trip kicked in. The first thing I can remember is that it felt like one second I wasn't tripping and then the next second I was tripping stronger then I had previuosly before. It was really funny at first because me and G both started tripping at the same time. We decided to walk to another friends house about 3 kilometers away. Whilst walking there the entire time the trip was getting stronger. I would stare at parked cars and see them breathing in and out. Looking at my friend it seemed that his shaved head had now grown dreadlocks and all the trees had faces which were all looking at me.
