I remember ingesting some amount of Dexedrine, which is thoroughly baffling as to how I came across. I recall working myself into a frenzy - induced by some trivial train of thought  and running into the  fading eye, which, in common reality, translated as a passing bus. Next thing Im sitting at a bus stop profusely bleeding from the cranium, my brain spiralling at light speed, analysing the scenery in a blandly cynical manner; fucking bobbing houses inhabited by pointlessly productive 9-5 citizens, thoroughly enlightened watching the idiot-box.uni-directional stimulimotivated by food etc. I must of become bored with myself and the clinical taste now becoming apparent in my mouth as I decided to walk back to the party, not as if I had any sense of geometry or spatial perception for that matter.
