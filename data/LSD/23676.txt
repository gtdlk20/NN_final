We lied down in the dark of Diannas room, in her roommates bed. Summer was quick to settle into sleep, but, as soon as the lights were back off, I was in another universe. The springboard darkness gives anyone tripping is formidable, to say the least. When youre voided, your brain just works to fill it all back in with visuals. My dose was preTy weak, so thats why I think I was able to maintain my cool for so long, when out in the open. There was no chance I was immersed in complete darkness at any point before that part of the trip, and as I had already noted, closed-eye visuals were much clearer than open-eyed ones in the light.
