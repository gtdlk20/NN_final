The drug took maybe 45 minutes  before I noticed an effect after which I swallowed the blotter. I felt a mild euphoria and grinned alot. Madden became more and more difficult to play. I began experiencing interesting visuals, but nothing overpowering (objects shifting very slightly, things taking on a 'glow'). AFter what seemed like a very long time *but in retrospect was likely only 15 minutes or so* I became convinced that because of the low dose this would be the extent of my trip. *The day before one of my friends who'd never tripped before took 8 squares with the guy that gave them to me and thought this was a good beginning dose. I am now glad I started with 4!* I wasn't dissapointed and resolved to try a higher dose the next time I was with my friends.
