Around this time I have trouble putting events in exactly the correct order.  I know that at some point, some of my friends who lived on the same floor as me came over to my room to see what we were doing (they knew that I had taken acid earlier in the day).  What I can't remember is whether or not Arthur and I had already gone outside and come back in before they stopped by my room.  Let me tell the events in the order of most emotional coherency.
