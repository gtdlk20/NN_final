A couple of hours later and I was absolutely caned - I was sweating buckets and could hardly speak.  I would walk through the crowds as if drifing or floating and the people would just melt out of the way.  There were no sudden movements from me - well of course not, I could predict the entire movements of everyone in the building and new exactly when to turn or glide this way and that.  I was dancing a routine through the crowd that had been pre-written for me - it was fantastic.
