We walk back from the beach to the park.  We instantly go back and get our hoodies because of the freezing temperature.  After wandering for over an hour I vow to get in the next line I see.  After I get in line I change my mind and jump over the railing and we continue walking.  We have now reached the exit and getting angry I shout 'I didn't come here to walk, I came to ride rides!'  S leads us to the demon drop.  Suddenly I have intense flashbacks to when I was 8 years old and here with my parents.
