We decided to go for a drive. Usually, I don't drive at all. I don't have my license, or anything. I can't drive a manual at all. Until tonight. What thought overcame my two friends to actually let me drive his manual car, on acid, up a very dangerous gravel road with a cliff on one side. This was one of the most fun experiences of my life.
