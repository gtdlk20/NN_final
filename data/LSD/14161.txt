we walked aimlessly, searching for the Wizard of Oz and a lost gala (reward:200 dollars,we agreed would be spent on more acid, naturally). i settled into the moment with a sigh...the world became butter smooth.i began to sense the onset of my peak and within minute, i began detaching myself from my body. during the odd reality  i was amazed that we were even walking, it seemed surreal!!
