A friend and I took one tab of a new batch that I got recently, looking forward to a nice trip with a walk in Central Park. Unfortunately, even though I purposefully didn't take my meds that morning, it wasn't enough time for them to dissipate enough to actually get a real trip out of it. I *felt* slightly trippy (eg a tiny bit queasy) and if I let my eyes relax and stared at a tree or whatever I could get a little bit of visuals, but my friend reported a really heavy, good trip with lots of visuals and I didn't have that at all.
