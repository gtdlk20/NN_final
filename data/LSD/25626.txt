Anyway, I awaken for my birthday, the tab already stored away in my fridge, I picked up my brand new grinder from the post office, I check through my mail, and I've gotten an email from a Google recruiter (quick opportunity to call my mom so I don't have to ignore her all day). Oh yeah, and it was an absolutely GORGEOUS day - high of 62*F, sunny (so it was absolutely comfortable to be out in pants and a t-shirt), this was looking good. I emptied my pockets of all but my wallet and keys, and popped the tab in my mouth at 12:00 noon. (so that t+1 would be 1:00, etc.). I chilled on my couch with a few of my friends waiting around for the inevitable, all while wondering if I had just eaten a piece of paper...
