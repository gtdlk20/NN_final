Then suddenly while lying on a couch in the living room I felt a pop and it was as if reality went through a paper shredder and those strips of reality were sucked away into the top right of my vision. Those strips were replaced with complete blackness that eventually gave way to a mystical dimension void of space and time. While I was there I lost everything that I had always perceived as me all I was reduced to pure tranquility and I can vaguely remember vibrant reds, yellows, oranges, and purples. I dont remember much about this place other than this. Im not sure how long I was gone but while I was there it felt like eternity. I returned to reality with a wide grin, G and R asked me what happened and it took me a while to gather my thoughts all I could do was just smile and laugh like and insane man. I eventually gathered my thoughts and told them what had happened. They didnt seem to believe me as they had never experienced anything similar on acid. I believe this to be my first ego death experience.
