Suddenly, my friend said, 'Look at this!!' - he had found a tiny, green insect making its way across his arm! It wasnÂ’t making much headway, the hairs seemed too much of an obstacle for it. We collectively realised that we had experienced a unique insight into the world of that insect...its struggles seemed as insignificant to us as our own struggles throughout our own lives! I became aware that I was being shown something, something new, a new truth was making itself gently known to me.
