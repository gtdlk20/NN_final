After having written that, i went to pick up my paycheck. It was close to ten o'clock, and i was peaking.  It should be noted that at nine o'clock I experienced a psychological peak, which plateaued for about two hours. At about ten I experienced a body peak, and around ten thirty  I experienced a visual peak. This was highly unusual.
