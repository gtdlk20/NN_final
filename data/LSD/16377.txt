So, we rode into the city and arrived around 2:30pm, and promptly dropped 2 hits each of a batch of acid we were both pretty familiar with, having tripped off of it before and knowing others who had.  Good middle of the road strengh cid, one tab would get you high but not as high as we felt like.  So, we dropped, and then walked around a bit.  About an hour and a half passed.  We were both tripping quite hard and sitting together in this little garden place we know about downtown, sort of tucked off from the hustle and bustle.  Suddenly, my cell starts ringing. Now, I normally just have my cell on because I like to have it as a clock, since I don't have a watch (actually, I obtained one the day after this).  Anyway, I'd forgot to turn the ring off.  So what the hell, I figured, and I answered.
