The only thing I would really want to change for next time is to have someone else around, it was fun to trip by myself regardless but it got lonely especially considering LSD  is a social drug. Set and setting is everythingÂ… I picked a time that I was in a good mood, in my own apartment, with a job and most of my life in order. This was a memorable, and defining, experience of my life.  And a positive one since I gave this drug its respect and planned for its use.  I plan to order some shrooms from Silk Road next, as far as visuals and colors bleeding into each other I believe shrooms are more of the right choice, and for a great speedy trip that will take me to another dimension of joy and thought acid is the right choice.  I saw many unreal things on acid too, but it seemed to emphasize a transformed consciousness and altered vision rather than super trippy visuals, at least at 300 micrograms.
