9:00 ~ The tabs don't taste bitter or metallic like an nbome, providing me relief on whether it would be or not. (Although I have a fairly trusted but newer connection). My friend, his brother and I we're watching American Horror Story during the Murder House season. Horror films/visual stimuli have never spun me into a bad trip before, so I felt pretty confident in my setting - it is also dark in the room, only lit by the television. I tend to enjoy darker environments when I trip.
