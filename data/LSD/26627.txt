Landon was unable to handle LSD, LSD isnt necessarily or everybody and I dont put any blame on him but he seriously was unable to keep track of thoughts, I'm unsure exactly what happened but there was a really anxious situation and he thought everyone was against him and he got super hostile toward everyone in the room and he ended up projectile vomiting on the floor and just leaving the room to go lay down and at that point shit got crazy. Spencer thought somebody died and was freaking the fuck out and ended up laying down just so he could be out of this mess. In my head I was flying through other lifetimes following an energy beam, the term rolling comes to mind to perfectly describe what I was feeling I swear I lived other lives during that time frame where I was following that energy beam around, the visuals were so intense that I didnt know which reality was the real one.
