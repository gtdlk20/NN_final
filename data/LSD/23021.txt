While many would call this a bad trip, I do not. I have never had a bad trip out of all the many times I have tripped. The experience was just very vivid and weird to me and something to learn from. The visuals were amazing. Especially when driving the yellow lines in the center are awesome. And the deep conversation I had with myself was one of the most intense things ever. I am a weird guy in the fact that I know I will never have a bad trip. You just have to be in the right mind set.
