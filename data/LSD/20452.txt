We sat at the kitchen table some more, and a friend rolled a huge joint. I smoked it with them, just because it was what I would usually do. I talked with drunk people I didn't know. I told everyone that I had a personal conversation with that I was on LSD, and to please excuse me if I was acting strangely. I am sure I was managing to act fairly normal, the energy buzzing beneath my skin was amazing. It was a concious act to keep from gritting my teeth and tightening every muscle in my body.
