On a balcony now,tripping about as hard as I've ever tripped before,eyes fixed on the sky waiting for it to crash down on me or something like that.Suddenly a cloud began to take form of a skeleton warrior riding a dragon straight towards me,oddly enough I wasn't frightened,I was just happy about what I was seeing.Soon my brother had arrived with his friend and they watched as me and Vince tripped balls laughing freely.
