While S and I were waiting for A to come out of the woods, he realizes that we are not in there with him any more. He began to wonder around and soon he finds himself in a cemetery. I cant even imagine what that must have been like for him in the state that he was in. A said that he felt he was in a primal state and all that mattered to him was survival. He went up to one of the graves and saw flowers on it, he picked them up and simply thought eat since that was something people must do to survive. He proceeded to eat the flowers right off the grave and then wondered around until he tripped and fell down a hill. This is when he found S and I.
