Through time I have learned to live with this monster. It's been a year now of constant hallucinating. The hallucinations are not as intense as they first were. I still see people that are not there (I paint clown faces on them now), colors, mainly black, go zooming past my eyes, spheres or balls pass from one hand to the other and into other people's hands, balls of light bounce off of people's heads,almost like a thin layer peeled off of actual people in front of me follow wherever I look, images jump out at me, and when really stressed or over stimulated the voices come back. It's not fun, it's just something I've become accustomed to, and it has improved greatly in the past year. From what I've read this could last 5 years (4 more to go), or permenantly, I pray almost every night and hope that when I wake up in the morning the monster will be gone. Needles to say I do not use drugs or alcohol any more. I was an active addict for 15 years. This has scared me straight. The end.
