We met Wests dealer three days before tripping, and paid about ti45 for two tabs of, supposedly, pure-ass acid that we placed in a fire-engine-red Italian Sicilian Orange Tic Tac box. Turns out, it was a great container, as the red filtered out most light from the substance, and acid is best kept in a cool, dark environment. Summer and I had planned to trip on Saturday night, but we had decided to head to a frat party on Friday, where she didnt have a great experience, and needed one day to recover.
