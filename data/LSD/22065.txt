I am writing this 8 days after the trip, which was a monday nite on a large cruise ship in the Caribbean Sea. I went to dinner with my family, then went back to the cabin with my younger sister. I had decided I would go ahead and try it that nite. So at 8.30pm, I took the acid into the little bathroom with me into the little bathroom and consumed. My sister and I then left to go met our parents at the theatre on the ship to see a show. The show was a musical impersonater that would have been pretty entertaining even if one was completely straight. My family and I sat in a balcony seat overlooking the lower audience and with a decent view of the stage. I could feel it starting to work physically already by this time, around 8.45 or 8.50, while we were waiting for the show to start. I was actually starting to feel a bit nauseated, with the rocking of the ship and a very full stomach. I reminded myself that I could always leave the show if I got to feeling too bad. The bar service man came by and I ordered a sprite, then headed to the restroom. On my way back from the restroom, The Smilies kicked in. I couldn't help it. I was aware I had a silly grin on my face, but luckily it was gone by the time I got back to my seat where my family was.
