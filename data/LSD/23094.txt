When we got back to school it had been about 15 minutes since I had taken it. Some people I knew who were also into LSD asked me if I had taken any at lunch. I replied that I had, and that they shouldn't tell anybody about it. I heard a bell and decided it was time to go to class... So I did. I sat neatly in my chair. The class was a literature class, and we were studying Bram Stoker's Dracula. We were about to watch a version of the movie in our class... Little did I know how horrifying it would be.
