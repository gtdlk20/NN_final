I decided at this point I should probably make my way to somewhere a little less public so returned to the backpackers we were staying at.  Upon arriving in my room I removed a shoe and launched it out the window.  It was closely followed by my other shoe and a packet of cigarettes.  At this point I had a moment of clarity.  It was like the real me had returned.  I was still tripping, as evidenced by the incessant shifting of the walls and floors around me, but I was coherent again.  One of the crew I was with summed it up nicely when they said 'Fuck!!  Where have you been for the last two hours?'  I'm still not sure.  Having come, at least partially, to my senses we went for a bit more of a wander around the inner city, exploring, walking, talking shit.  I was still having a storming trip, but at last I was able to function!!  We ate kebabs, we ate curry, we drank, and I wished I hadn't thrown away my shoes.  Gradually we all returned to earth and made our way back to our room for a fitful sleep.  The trip was over and I had been somewhere I had never been before.
