I felt as though he was judging me. I had to get out of there. I payed him and got on the bus. There were no spaces to sit so I was standing. The whole journey I kept on thinking, 'Everyone is staring at me, judging me in a bad way'. I felt like shit. After my first bus journey ended, I got onto the second bus. I found a seat and sat down. After a few minutes someone sat right next to me staring at me. I looked and it was my good friend. He is religous and thinks highly of me so I didn't want him to find out I was on drugs. The whole time he was talking to me, I was trying not to look him in the eyes because I was very paranoid that he'd see my dilated pupils.
