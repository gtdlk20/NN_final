These hallucinations were the peak of my experience, and I now felt completely at peace and unafraid.  We left the house around 8:30 and went into a nearby town so my companions could cure their case of the munchies.  The car ride was silent aside from the white noise of the air conditioner, which seemed to form soothing music in my ears.
