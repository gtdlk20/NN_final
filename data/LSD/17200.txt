Probably a good 8 or 10 hours after taking the second tab, I was feeling very tired and very good still, like the nice feeling of ecstasy. I just lay down and tripped out for a long time and fell asleep. My dreams were extremely vivid although very abstract. My dreams were more hallucinatory than my waking hallucinations. I felt as if they were real and they confused me much more.
