The pain subsided and I calmed down and I sat back and watched the patterns for a while.  Green and red sparkes were shooting across the floor and all over my hands.  The walls were pulsating and shifting colours and the music was altering its pitch chaotically.  Sitting there I could at last appreciate it for what it was and desperately wanted to work out how it happens.  At that point George came through the door with his girlfriend and they didn't look to pleased.  They asked it I'd noticed the change on the dance floor and George kept on saying about the Ether.  We all agreed to go outside into a square that was part of the building's grounds.  Here we were able to cool down.  I didn't bother speaking but just listend to the whispers of other conversations all around me.  The sound was like the noise of the sea genlty rolling on a shingle beach.
