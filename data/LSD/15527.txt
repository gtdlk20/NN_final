Suddenly I noticed one of my walls, this wall is brown and the lower part of it is fairly dirty from peoples hands touching it. The finger marks appear a whitish sort of colour against the brown wall. When I looked at these marks they spread right up my wall and onto the ceiling but they were no longer just marks they resembled a sort of Asian script. But if I put my ear against the wall and looked at them side on, they appeared to be raised off the wall but now it was just a foggy looking haze that now flowed down off the wall at a very fast pace. It was like watching fog get blown into a valley if you have ever seen this happen.
