Mike, a well-seasoned tripper, got some yellow geltabs from his housemates. They had done it during the day and had basically asserted that they weren't all that potent. The one yellow tab I had done a couple of weeks before had pretty much only given me a slight mindfuck and no visuals, so I wasn't intimidated. So, Mike and I decided to trip that Saturday night.
