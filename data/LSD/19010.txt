There was a group of kids over in the corner, the kids who have seen A Clockwork Orange a few times and try to act crazy, and one of them was saying some very strange things that almost made me violently ill.  He was talking to the other kids, and he said something about opening up the heads of sleeping animals and messing with their brains to see if they would act differently when they woke up. Then he laughed and said he was just kidding.
