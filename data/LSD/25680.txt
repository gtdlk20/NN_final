It was a hot Friday night in July, and my friend Victor had a connection for good acid. I had tripped more than four times prior to this, and Victor and our other friends were fairly experienced as well. It was me, Victor, and a third friend, Benny, with 11 sugarcubes of acid in front of us. This was the beginning of a night that was amazing and yet very unnerving.
