My friend went home and I felt like the night was ruined. I was the highest I've ever been in my life and everything was moving and changing colors very rapidly, and I couldn't stop thinking about the problems in my life. I closed my eyes and I started hearing this old Chinese flute music, and all of a sudden I was in this beautiful place full of colorful trees, rolling grass mountains and a river at the center. The river had rocks in the middle and I could hear the water flowing, it was all very detailed and felt real. All of a sudden I felt some type of presence. I looked to my side and I saw a young Bruce Lee. This kind of creeped me out but made me happy at the same time, because Bruce Lee is a huge inspiration to me. Then I started speaking to him.
