I hate my nails. Catie had painted my nails in uniform for my costume. They were red with white tips. I had never had French tips before. I had never had a manicure before. It seemed worthless. But my hands werent properly representing me. I told myself This is not the way my hands should look. They were fake, it made me feel fake and of something I didnt need or want. I was natural, and this was so artificial. They were inhibiting me, I wanted to cover them up and I even tried gloves, but the gloves didnt fit either, they were not what I needed. They had to remind me again and again, they had just been part of the costume.
