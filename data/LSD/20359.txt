I took the sugar cube around 8 or 8:30pm in front of a 7/11 while the dealer was right there. After he left I walked in the opposite direction down this street to my Russian friend's house which is pretty much already right there. I go inside to do some weed related business I guess and I still have the sugar cube melting in my mouth and my Russian friend saw this and was just kind of laughing and amused by it and kind of surprised but afterwards after I dropped off whatever it is that I needed to I somehow or other linked up with my other friend near 7/11 who is kind of a tweaker but he's not that bad. He's the one who introduced me to the dealer but the dealer was not fucked up or tweakerish at all. Anyways I somehow or another meet with this tweaker kid who I had been hanging out with in that part of town lately anyways, he was gonna smoke me out behind Vons. It was a really kind of run down scummy looking area that was very bleak and almost like a sewer (it was right near a sewer) with peoples back condo windows behind it and we were sitting on these stairs smoking weed and I was looking at the giant whiteish but dark wall for the whole backside of Vons just kind of lumber over me and it began to take on an ominous and abstract sort of vibe. The wall also seemed to kind of ripple but in a mental way and look less like a solid wall/surface and more like a liquid but these effects were super super faint and mostly just mental. The real trip hadn't even started yet this was just the creeping up part similar to mushrooms. Its also important to point out that I very well thought that this 'LSD' was total garbage. I didn't think real LSD was even around anymore. I had taken tons of acid' in the past but it was all bunk or weak crap so I thought that's how this would be but I soon found out I was wrong.
