After this absurdly great and profound experience with what I can only call an entity? I start texting my girlfriend or she started texting me and I somehow or another bring up how I want her to come over here and I want to see her. I didnt realize it was so late though and she was like So you want me to sneak out for the first time? and she was texting me saying OkayIve never snuck out before..here we go.. and then I start getting stressed because I dont want her to get caught or in trouble tonight while Im in this state and Im thinking What?! Never snuck out before? Fuck I cannot manage this right now' and told her forget about it and I told my other friends there what was going on and they were like wtf man no just stay off your phone and they were just telling me how it was just a bad and pointless idea and I agreed it was crazy and wishful thinking. My Russian friend also said he didnt want anyone else Russian there because of the arguments he was having with his mom in Russian. He didnt feel comfortable if someone else who spoke Russian was there. And yes my girlfriend is Russian and speaks it fluently so it made sense that that all around wasnt a good idea.
