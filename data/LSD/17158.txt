The midnight blue sky exploded with billions of stars, some of which were there and some of which were a result of the lsd, these billions of points of light swam around and danced as the music played. The sight was so beautiful that it literally took my breath away. I deeply inhaled and as I did the sky looked like it was getting closer, and when I exhaled the sky got farther away. This process of inhaling and exhaling repeated itself about six times before I actually caught my breath and returned to a normal rate of respiration. Once my respiration rate returned to normal the stars stopped dancing and spread out all across the sky and formed a plethora of geometric shapes; with little white lines connecting each star to another one. These shapes would then slowly rotate while each individual star would subtly change its hue. At this point I realized the song had stopped (the boombox was fucked up) so I took this opportunity to run back to camp and tell deuce and rosy all about it.
