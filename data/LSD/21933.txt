'Having read _Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_ numerous times, and given that I was planning a trip to Vegas to meet some old college buddies for a weekend, I decided that I'd try a hit before boarding the plane. Having only done this 2 previous times, there was a bit of nervousness. Many thoughts of losing it and running rampant through the plane with drool spilling from my lips were streaming through my mind, but I decided that it would be worth the effort. It was. I'd highly recommend this, especially if you are an experienced intrepid traveller. I had no problems on the plane. Was over whelmed with the flight, the earth below, and the sunset that I got to experience on the flight into LV.
