I went back to the spot where we looked at cars, sat on the railing by the balcony, and realized Summer had followed me there. She sang such a beautiful melody, I cant recall what it was, but her voice was beautiful and it made it sound... so far. I was far. I was far from her. I was far from singing. (I should mention, I used to sing too... in New York I still havent goTen the opportunity, or the balls, really, to go for it, and her nonchalance while exposing such talent brought me to a realization - the use of the quote marks is pivotal, in this case).
