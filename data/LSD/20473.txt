My life is changed, I am changed. I am unbelieveably lucky, in that the change was for the better. I'd like to thank everyone who helped me to see the experience correctly. They have opened up many doors for me, gently and persistantly helping me to see the only way to deal with this experience. Things still might have gone badly for me in the end, had I not had help. As it stands, I have no worries.
