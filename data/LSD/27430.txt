I came up from below and looked at the blue and white rope with buoys, It started to move and slither amongst itself like a threatened rattlesnake. I almost went berserko, and immediately we all go out. Heading back to the room should have taken 3 - 4 minutes but instead about 30. Getting to the room was like traversing a maze, very confusing. Space was shifting every which way and my teeth were grinding so much they made sparks. A mirror showed my thin body become even more thin and blue and wrinkled, almost like rotting away, not really freaking me out but making me uncomfortable and seeing how frail my mind is; to be incredibly changed by such a small amount of a small chemical.  I quickly turned away and put my shorts in the dryer.
