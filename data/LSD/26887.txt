My hand all of a sudden got crazy i dont even know how to describe it except it started opening in a weird weird way. Like one finger would move in a tiny jerk which would be followed by another one and so on. But it took a while for it to open completely, I was still feeling crazy, people were looking at my hand going holy shit, he's gone insane. I dont remember most of the rest of the night, But eventually me and a couple of friends went on the train home. The train was soo trippy, whenever it would start slowing down it would make crazy tripped out noises like voosh coom wowr. I cant really type it, its like those crazy noises that synthesisers make when slowing down and speeding up. I got home at like 11:30 cz we took the cid mid day or early afternoon. I fell asleep at 6 in the morning. I was still feeling it a little throught the whole night.
