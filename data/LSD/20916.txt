At T+30 min. Benny ate another sugarcube. I, on the other hand, was already feeling effects of the acid. Whoever dripped these cubes must have had no idea what they were doing, becuase these things had to have been soaked. Anyway, i was driving, which was stupid to begin with, so i had to pull over and let Victor's girlfriend drive. When we arrived at the party it felt neat to get up and walk around. I looked over the fence and some hedges and saw a huge property with an olympic swimming pool and horses. 'Look at the horses', i said to everyone. wow. When i entered the yard, it was nothing more than an inground pool surrounded by concrete:) and this after not even an hour! The party, unfortunately, was terrible. There were parents there and a terrible band was playing dave matthews songs and old friends from high school whom i didn't want to see were there. i was 20 and my friends were in their mid teens. It was terrible.
