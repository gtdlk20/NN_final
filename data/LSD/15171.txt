Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be done casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements were derived, it is reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.]   After dosing, I allowed about thirty minutes to pass to come up a bit and then I sat for a meditation session. I saw many visions that were infinitely complex in structure of goddesses, cities, and pyramids. It all built up to me seeing direct visions of what I perceived as Buddha in meditation posture.
