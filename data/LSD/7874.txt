The spot began to grow so that it covered his entire face. I remained there, 2 feet from the wall, staring at this perfectly normal poster with the most confused look on my face. I stared at if for a few more seconds when M walked in, going to use Cs bathroom. He stopped halfway across the dim room, the only light coming through the hallway door. What the fuck are you doing in here in the dark? Wondering why Jims face is gone and been replaced by a black hole. I replied nonchalantly, still staring the into the darkness over the actors face. M burst out laughing, but not a normal laugh, this one was louder and more prolonged than usual. I concluded that M had started tripping too. You trippin? I'm getting there. I saw some stuff move a minute ago but I was going to look in the mirror. But now I really want to see this black hole. Ha ha, its weird. I know his face is there, but I can't see it at all. Well what is there? Nothing, that is what is so cool. His face is made of nothing, if nothing was a substance. Imagine a static screen on a TV, but frozen still and melting slightly. M looked at me an laughed again, Dude, if I wasnt on three, that would have been the most absurd thing I have ever heard, but I think I know what you are talking about.
