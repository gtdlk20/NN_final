Its not really freaky but I think thats what LSD is suppose to do 'FREAK YOU OUT' anyways when I drink coffee the effect is worse and the longer I go without tripping the worse it gets. So when I take a Trip the effects are gone for about a week , but the hands still makes trails! This all started happening after about 6 trips! They were manily SUN FLOWERS, HOFFMAN'S & MARILYN MONROE's!
