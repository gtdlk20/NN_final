I'm a fan of acid, but I still think you have to know your body well enough before trying anything. I'd done two hits before, and was confident I could handle myself. It's not that I had a bad trip or a train wreck. I simply lost ALL sense of reality. What I thought was just an hour of hypnotic staring at a stream turned out to be an hour of running around like a wild child, and eventually disappearing. I could have run onto to the highway and gotten flattened by a semi and would never have known.  I have scars and scratches and tears in my clothing from that very weird afternoon, and I don't remember getting any of them.
