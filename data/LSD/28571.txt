I went into Mcdee's, and on my way to the entrance I walked through the car park and noticed a man who was standing in the car park. When I looked at his face it appeared rubber-like his chin and forehead were exagarrated he looked a bit cartoony. I entered Mc'dees and waited in line. I dont really remember what I was thinking but I knew it was way to bright and way to intense to be in there on this drug, so I went back to the car.
