I began walking at about 1245 because the walk to the trail on the back roads was a decent mile and a half. I dont walk very fast so I figured this would be a good time to leave. I had recently been drug tested by my parents and came up completley clean, despite have dropped acid the day before. Standard drug tests dont test for Lucy so I wasnt worried. As I'm walking outside my dad is working on the yard and I tell him I'm walking to the trail. And he says', your not like going to drop a hit of acid and walk around and stuff are you?'
