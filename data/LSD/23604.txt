Summer was not convinced at all by my argument, but had probably realized how so far I was, that she didnt have the strength to prove me wrong. We theorized on the nature of direction (Why do cars even move?), the meaning of light (Why are lights on, why are lights on...!), and the altitude of New York City (Imagine jumping...!), before heading back inside. I was much more inquisitive than Summer, who, at every question, decided to wisely admit she just didnt know! with a smile of sincerity painted on her face.
