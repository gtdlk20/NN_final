I had been told that one was enough for a strong trip, but I've been the recipient of a lot of dubious dosage information, and so I ate two with plans to take a third if I didn't feel much within an hour. I ate the initial two around midnight, and the third around 1 am. Within a half hour I was beginning to feel it, and ended up getting a little lost on my way home.
