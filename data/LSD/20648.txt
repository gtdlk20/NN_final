I'm writing this report to make aware to people who are considering taking acid or have experimented with acid before to remember one very important thing, all acid comes in different strengths that can only be known after taking the drug. Unlike a bottle of scotch which has the alcohol content on the side of the bottle, acid comes in many different strengths.
