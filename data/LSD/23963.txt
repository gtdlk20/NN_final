After eating I went down to my room and texted V, asking where the hell he was. He said he was almost ready, and would meet me at my room in 10 minutes. That was the worst 10 minutes IÂ’ve had in a while. I thought i was going to have a panic attack. And I was sure as shit that there was no way I wasnt going to have a nightmare trip thinking this way. V finally showed up. He didnt give a fuck about breakfast so we went outside right away. As we were walking to the little forest where we were going to drop the blotters, V managed to calm me down a little bit. He also mentioned that his roommate had autism. We found a sweet spot, and V  took out the blotters, handed me one, and I put it under my tongue. The dosage was 150 micrograms. The nervousness came back and once again i thought I was going to have a bad trip. V asked if we should smoke a joint. I declined at first, thinking that that was the cause of my first bad trip. But he lighted it anyway, and I took a few hits. This turned out to be a great decision! After just a few minutes my nervousness faded away, and I was calm again.
