A few months ago, I told a friend of mine that I had wanted to try acid since I was ten years old. She laughed and said that I reminded her of Marla in 'Fight Club,' who says at one point says, 'I haven't been fucked like that since grade school!' It's easy to see how, in this society, one would be as shocking as the other. I have, in fact, been fascinated by LSD ever since (oh, and I know it sounds cliched) fifth grade, when I discovered the Beatles. I was never around drugs of any kind, except for alcohol as a child; and don't take my interest at the age of ten to mean that I actually tried it then.
