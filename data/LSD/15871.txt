This illustrated to me the importance of respecting (and never underestimating) the power of drugs.  We all take them to have fun - but there's always the potential for the unexpected to occur.  Everyone should have at least one experience like this.  Especially those who claim to be able to go harder than everyone else.  That was me.  Now I know I'm not chemically invincible and it took me just one tab to teach me that.
