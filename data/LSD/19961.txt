Outside I watched the moon fall behind a hill.  Behind the hill shone a bright and powerful white light.  The white light turned and came down the hill as car head lights. The head lights lifted off the road and beacame stars in the sky.  The trees were all dragons flapping their wings and swimming through the world.  While the boards on the porch were shrinking and stretching beneath my feet.  And thats about all I remember.
