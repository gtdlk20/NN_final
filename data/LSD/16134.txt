Even though I tried to convince him he would be mad about this action in the parking lot, he didn't give a shit and we made our way to the car. Since we could still not goto either of our houses, and had no safe haven to play this trip out, we began our next leg of this trip in my car. We spent the next several hours driving in my car where I had discovered that Matt had been developing a 'Bad Trip'. He quickly became very confused and disoriented with himself. He was unable to keep a constant thought, and was very annoying to me. He would ask several questions to me, completely out of the blue with no real meaning or good answer. I can still remember the most amusing phrase of the evening which spewed out of his mouth more than a dozen times in that ride 'Am I alive, am I dead - or is this backwards?' I didn't know what this comment meant, or how to respond so I calmly tried to talk him out of his bad experience, where I think my words just played worse into the madness in his head. I had many thoughts that we had taken too much, or the doses were contaminated, or that we would be stuck in the trip forever.
