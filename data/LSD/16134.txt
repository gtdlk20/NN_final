I quickly realized that driving was very strange, and seemed dangerous, so we quickly arrived at the discount store. As we exited the car, we were encountered by men with leafblowers blowing garbage out of the lot, and large street sweepers floating across the spaces, which frightened me at first, but managed to keep my head remembering the potential of this drug. Our entrance was amazing, the lights and aisles and cash registers all glistened and morphed beyond the most vivid movie depictions of LSD trips. As we moved throughout the store, I was very disturbed at the people we viewed. Many of their faces scared me and I questioned the moral stability of these people. I even recall a small demon girl running down the cereal aisle, her face was disasterous, it made me naucious to look at her disgusting expressions and horrible body shape.
