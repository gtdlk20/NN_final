During the Winter of 2005 I came across some good quality LSD.  I had only tripped on the substance twice before, but I am very experienced with other hallucinogens.  LSD is tough to come by in Northern Virginia where I live, at least with the few connections I have.  So I purchased 8 hits and took 2 the weekend before to test it out.  I tripped a little bit and got a lot of morphing and coloration changes, but no visuals, leaving me a little disappointed.  The LSD was relatively cheap so I had planned to go into school to take a test and then go home sick right after and chomp down all six of my remaining tabs.
