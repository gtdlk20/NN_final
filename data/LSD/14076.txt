A child exclaims, 'Look at the sun!' and everyone laughs.  God what a sight.  A lake spread out farther than we can even perceive... a red ball of fire diving into it... we have to turn our heads from side to side just to take everything in.  So large, so grand, so FUCKING AMAZING.  And someone behind me is chatting about what so and so did at the charity auction and wasn't that awful and oh my god she didn't!  Feh. Unfortunately, that's not a hallucination.
