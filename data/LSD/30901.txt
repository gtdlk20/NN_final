So, back to the distress. I believe it was caused by the fact that everything around me was too much to handle. I looked over at every single random object around, and it amazed me. It wasnt like it seemed new, or I was seeing it through new eyes - no; I knew exactly what everything was, but I couldnt register it. I couldnt compute or understand it. Everything seemed to have a point, and objects just didnt. They just lied there, and the fact that they did was baffling me. It was funny, and, as always, confusing, at the same time. Everything sparked a whole new trail of thoughts and observations, so when I was forced to just look at things, I couldnt. I had to sit back, and actually observe them, considering them in the most holistic way possible.
