It was really sad, etc, etc.  I won't get into the crazy specifics of how it was. Really unpleasant.  But here's the thing, the highness just... died.  It was like, apart from a slight body high, I just sobered up.  Before I knocked on that door, if I stayed still and looked at the ground, it looked like it was rippling.  If I looked at anything carefully, I saw fractal patterns etched onto them.  All that stopped.  My thinking became clear.  I was able to express myself in words clearly.  And this lasted for the next five hours that I spent with them, at the vets, etc.  It was amazing.  Once I was by myself, away from them (about 12-13 hours after I'd dropped), I was high again, typical burnout.
