As I 'descended'/'coalesced' i realized P. was having a bad trip. The look on his face was unforgettable - 'the pits of hell' - was what it said.  He asked me to take him home and i did.  We walked back in silence.  My 'thought stream' was a sea, too vast and varied to remember.  Deep concern 4 P. was side by side with elation, and a noticeable absence of words from my thoughts.  It was the familiar trippy feeling of an absence of mental static, and being cleansed of the mental impurities that had built up over the course of my life.
