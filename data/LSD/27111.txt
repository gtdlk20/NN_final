We wandered around the park for a while with nothing exciting to report. We smoked a joint and waited and walked. We left the park and headed for the huge graveyard which is also pretty much right next to my house. At this point, the acid was having subtle effects on me. The grass of the graveyard was greener, the sky was bluer, the sun was brighter. This is something that usually happens to me under psychedelics at first and I was used to it. I was also not too taken aback when we passed three or four signs that said 'WATER' very strangely, or so it seemed. The letters were white, on a green background. The font that was used for the sign seemed to have millions of imperfections that I was only then able to pick up because of the drug. The sign seemed to stand out to me, as if WATER was something I should remember and think about.
