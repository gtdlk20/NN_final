When we walked inside Blue C, Summer made sure I had my University ID prepared at the entrance to enter in the building. Yet, yet again, I wasnt impaired. Tapping the card and pressing the digits that represented my birthdate wasnt difficult, it was natural, it was all that I needed. I remembered my birth, and where I was now, and the recurring thought of how far Id come from my Nowhereland made my knees weak with joy.
