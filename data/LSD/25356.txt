When I think about this trip and any other acid trip I made in my life; it always made me realize something about myself or our beautiful mother earth or the universe.  This particular trip made me see I had a changing personality.  Which is true.  As I grow older I can't help but realize that I am an unstable human being constantly changing and evolving...Anyways every trip was a revelation.  I love it and I can't wait the proper moment to do it again!
