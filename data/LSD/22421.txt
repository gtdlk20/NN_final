At the 8 hour mark I started yawning (noticed that I had not yawned at all since taking the microdose) and by 10 hours I was in bed and drifting off to sleep.  I slept well that night even without smoking any cannabis and in the presence of a lot of loud partygoers.  I had some minor stomach upset that day and the day after, but nothing too serious.  Overall it was a nicely enjoyable, yet subtle experience and I would definitely repeat it!
