I was not at all an experienced drug user. It was my freshman year in high school and I had been smoking weed for approximately 2 years and I drank, but that's as far as my drug use went. Well, I had been wanting to try harder and better things for a while and then my friend gave me 2 geltabs (I cannot recall what kind, but someone I know who has tripped over 120 times told me it was very strong!). Well, it was after school and I was alone so I decided not to take it.
