The object of the game, while ungrokkable to a level 1 entity such as myself, did not appear to be entirely benevelent. For that matter, Chako was not benevelent at all, and posessed of a rather demonic ambience. Anyhow, as Chako's pawn, i was to face another, someone else's pawn, but whether this other was human, when, where and on which plane was not made clear. At this point, the the effects of the lucidant were waning, and i was pulled out of the web, with no reluctance i must say.
