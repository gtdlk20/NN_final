Summer still stood silent, and I smiled at her, even more abused when I added, But it does have meaning... for me, She looked back and raised her eyebrows, Really? she asked. I couldnt tell whether she was actually interested, or in her own world, faking it, but I thought it was important to respond, and present my sixth realization, It keeps my home alive, within me. Thats what habits do. Habits are just our ways to remind ourselves that were our own home. Theyre familiar, and keep a bridge between all the change... they just dont change. Obviously I was speaking for myself: a lot of people have found health and benefits in stopping to smoke, or whatever nasty thing they might have been doing. But I am not planning on it, I need to remind myself that I have a home within me, one that wont change no matter where I go.
