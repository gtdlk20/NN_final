I do know the Army and Navy use the same test as the Air force and all three use Brooks Lab. When any test regardless of the drug comes up positive the lab re-runs the test if the test comes under fire by the soldier the lab will run the test again at the same lab instead of another lab. (Jacked up I think) Wrongful use of LSD in the military can get you 5yr's in jail. The thing to remember is LSD has four components, You have ISO LSD and LSD which breakdown into four parts or isomers, and L and D on each. We know that the only active component of LSD under which it is reasonably likely that a person would feel the effects is the D isomer of the LSD so we would ignore the L isomer of LSD, the D isomer of ISO LSD and the L isomer of ISO LSD. So it is possible to come in contact with LSD and feel NO effect. I hope this will help someone.
