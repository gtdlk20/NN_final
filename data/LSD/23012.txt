After about a half hour of that Zee was farely drunk off of some liquor as well as B. Then Zee's dad woke up and realized that there were more people than expected in the house and all he wanted was Ally out of the house. I couldn't just let her walk home so I had to split as well. Which was really good because we could not stay in that place much longer. We wanted to be around people and we already thought that the night was coming to an end at that place when we just started tripping about an hour ago. And Zee and B would not let me drive but now they had no choice but to let us go. Ally and I hopped in my car and lit a cigarette. We just kept watching how the cigarette burns and how great it looks while it does its thing. We didn't know where to go after that so I pulled over at a grocery store parking lot. I Say to myself 'it's fucking halloween night, there is deffinetly a party somewhere.' I phone up my buddy A and he was already plastered from the massive party he is having. He yells at me for tripping and not being at his party, so we head on over to A's house.
