I was no longer peaking but definitely still feeling effects. We went back to our campsite later and I had a blast just improvising on my guitar. I felt like I played more rhythmically and creatively than I ever have, which was cool. I started playing the rhythm guitar part for Dark Star and jammed on it with one of my friends and it was a blast. All in all, it was a really great trip and I felt like I benefited from being able to see the world through a different lens for a day. I was able to more objectively look at my life and my personality, and I feel that was of great value. I feel like there is so much more that I could write about it, but its so hard to put that type of experience to words.  I think music festivals are perfect settings for doing acid I look forward to doing it again some time down the road.
