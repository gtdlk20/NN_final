We took our drugs around 10, as soon as they kicked in we became wrapped into the movie we were watching, it was snowing in my room, the cold air of the atmosphere, steamed on our skin, like pouring cold water on a hot frying pan.. The room was breathing, walls were bending, we could tell there was a war or something like it going on outside from all the flashing lights and shaking of the room.. I had to pee all the sudden, so I got up to go to the bathroom, the journey 4 feet seemed like a walk across the desert, once inside the bathroom, I could see that my reflection was not me, I thought, who am I, is this what I look like, and why is my face dripping, I'm not sure if I ever even got a chance pee because I became intranced by the character that supposely was my reflection.. I remember thinking to myself, this is my reality, and if yours is anywhere close to mine, then your fucked...
