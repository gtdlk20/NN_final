I and three of my friends (well refer to them as J, H & S throughout the story) decided to spend a long summer day in the Botanical Gardens on LSD. At around 11am we had settled down in a beautiful spot in the gardens. H had just bought an Ehrlichs reagent testing kit. I had met the dealer over Tinder and hence we did not trust him completely and were nervous about being given 25I-NBOMe or another type research chemical we were not familiar with. The kit indicated LSD. I & H took a full tab (sold as 150ug/tab); S & J took half a tab each as it was their first time.
