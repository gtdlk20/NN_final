I tell Chris whats going on he isn't doing well either but by far better than I'm doing. He tells me to go with him to see Shaun. I don't want to leave the gators were still there, he convinces me to go with him somehow. Inside Shaun's house the concrete floor is nothing but crocodile heads, and then blue and orange snakes apear and I can feel them crawling beneath my feet. Finally, Shaun shows up my whole body is shaking and I've chewed a straw into almost nothing. Shaun trys to calm me down but he can't help. So we leave.
