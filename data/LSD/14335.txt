I remembering noticing how different the motion of other cars seemed to be. Again, they weren't physically in places they shouldn't be at any given point; they never took up more or less space than they should. Yet, the motion itself seemed far more fluid, more like the way that water moves than solid objects. It's an effect I've noticed again on subsequent trips.
