As we got back into the room, we shut the door and I started to look at some of the art in the room. Was at this point I started to believe Id peaked as the visuals were becoming much, much more insane compared to our last trip. The art and posters were literally exploding for me, faces breaking apart, morphing and pulsing as they grew smaller and larger, things sliding apart, pieces of the drawings appeared 3D and seemed to come out of the posters/paintings, rainbows and halos around what seemed to be everything, and etc. Was an amazingly beautiful view for me. Sounds as if it would be scary to see these things happen but in the moment for me, it was just a sense of omg this is fucking awesome lol.
