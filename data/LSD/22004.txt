When my ego had returned from vacation, my friend and I sat in awe and could only say wow. I felt as if the universe had been passed into the neurons of my brain and engraved in my gentics. Preconscious cellular processes were now understood to me. I could feel the platlets in my blood cells forming. The quick of my fingernails pushing and growing every so slowly. At 8:00 after taking a walk into the woods and playing catch with a water bottle, we went inside to have breakfast. We laughed our balls off at his dad telling old fighing stories and looking at his face still looking like a goblin. I went back home about 9:30 and fought off falling asleep until I gave in and slept for hours. My dreams were strange and acted like an exstension of the trip. When I woke up the next morning I felt refreshed and viewed life in a new aspcet.I also now knew that I could stop my ever nagging mind from bothering me when I needed to, just as wizard of oz had shown me. That experience sparked a burning passion for knowledge, spirituality and a zest for life I sometimes have forgotten in this fast paced and hurried life Americans lead nowadays.
