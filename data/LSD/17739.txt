On the walk back there were big demons in the sky throwing lightening bolts down the the earth and when I mean big I mean giant like 400 metres tall.  It was the coolest thing I've ever seen ever, hands down. They kept shifting their stance moving about and twisting. I started coming down a bit at this point and could vaguely make out people in the distance although they were covered in a  shrowd of movement, colours and general distortion. We saw a woman in her house and stared at her which must have freaked her out as it was like 5 in the morning and we were out of our faces. But she was virtually unregnisable and impossible to define.
