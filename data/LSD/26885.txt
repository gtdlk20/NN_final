Finally the CD ended. I was completely lost. I wasn't able to comprehend how the music could have stopped. I took out the cd and sat there feeling like a part of me had just been lost bugging out. I started to pace the room and talk to myself for 15 mins. Then I was I need the floyd and tried to get it to work again. I put the cd in and couldn't find the play buttong so i just started pushing all the buttons on the stereo. I couldn't get the damn thing to play. I was tripping balls. I started asking the cd to play itself, trying to cajole it into playing for me. Then I was like ok, Im tripping balls, But there are a limited amount of buttons, i can do this. After another 5 minutes of intense analysis and and examination, and attempting to comprehend my loss, I found the button and was like ahhhhh im back. Then everyone came back, but I wasn't sure if they existed or not. And i wasn't trusting myself to interact with them, I felt like I had been through this insane trip and couldn't possibly even relate to them.
