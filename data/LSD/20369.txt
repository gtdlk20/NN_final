Something about the lamp lighting from her driveway shining on her and the tree behind her with just darkness behind the tree and the strange mysterious look of the tree itself I got this really dark mythical type vibe and these really fantasy-driven, imaginative, crazy and kind of fantasy inspired delusional thoughts and feelings about her and the place I was at. This developed into visuals as well as altered perceptions of what I was seeing. I started getting feelings and visions that she was some kind of witch or mythological character and I was trespassing on herswamp?cabin? In her woods?.I dont know I was just having the most retarded, crazy, folklorish and eerie thoughts just constantly coming to my mind and not in a psychotic or intense way but I could just feel my imagination running wild and showing itself on my visual perception of her and this setting. ItIt was at this point that I knew this was actual LSD and that it clearly was still around today lol. Put me in a pretty good mood too. Thats also when the trip fully hit me and when I entered pretty much what I consider the real LSD space where nothing seemed normal. Nothing, and it hit me much harder and faster and more sudden than mushrooms ever had. It was like dabbing hash oil vs smoking weed; it just hit me all at once instead of gradually and in an undulating fashion like with mushrooms.
