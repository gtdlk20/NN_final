Eventually, my friend Arthur got his hands on two tabs, and we decided we'd take it together one weekend when he was home for spring break.  It was late March and the weather was relatively warm and clear, although it was windy.  Inevitably I felt a little bit of apprehension, but I was mostly relaxed and I wasn't too troubled by ruminating on the coming trip Â– I stayed very present minded and just went with it.  My only fear was that I would have a bad trip, and even then it was a fear faintly held and I didn't waste any attention on it.
