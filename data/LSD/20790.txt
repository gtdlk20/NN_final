Soon enough, I was doing acid at school, by myself, each day. My dose would increase throughout the week so that I always had the same buzz. It seemed that if I did half a tab on Monday, that on Tuesday, I would need a full tab to experience what I felt on Monday. By Friday I would be up to 3 or 4 tabs at most. I wouldn't do it on Sundays and rarely did it on Saturdays. This went on for about 5 months. You can do the math, but, despite the way you look at it, that is a hell of allot of acid!
