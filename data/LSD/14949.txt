My friend and I finally went into an art museum that weÂ’d planned to visit for some time. We went inside, paid our money and wandered into a gallery. At this point, it was as if I had entered an alternate dimension. Every surface moved and shifted and as I walked into the gallery it was as if I was walking into a liquid room.
