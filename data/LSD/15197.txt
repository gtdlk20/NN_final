I posted this for the psyhonauts that might have experienced similar and are attempting to reintegrate something of this nature. Honestly, I shouldn't have dropped acid. It was foolish and had it not been for my mother, great harm could have happened to me. I also think that I would have lost it completely and forever had I been genetically predisposed to schizophrenia and other similar illnesses. The only thing I've been predisposed to on a genetic level is depression and ADHD, both of which are continually lifting from me drastically after this experience.
