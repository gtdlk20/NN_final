Anyway, it took 1 hour and 45 minutes before I felt anything so I was wondering if we'd been sold blotter paper with no acid on it. When I started feeling something I was relieved. At around 11pm I started tripping hard. At the time I was on MSN trying to type. The keyboard was becoming increasingly difficult to see as it was pulsing and dancing around, like a boat on sea.
