I had to deal with my friends parents, he told them I was sick. I couldn't converse with them, the images of them talking was muddled with sound from events in a different time. I tried to drink water, hoping it would calm me down, I must have drunk about 7 glasses. The strange thing was I couldn't feel myself drinking the water until later when I was lying face down on a bed. Time was going very slowly, not one minute had passed on my friends bedside clock since I went to lie down. I walked the corridors of his house, shadows were intimidating, almost hellish and then lay outside for what felt like 30 minutes, came inside, got another drink, checked the clock and it was 2 minutes later than when I last checked it. I was in hysterics, I thought I was trapped in this distorted time forever. I went to see what my friend was doing, he was watching stigmata: this did not help my experience. At some point I snapped out of my auto-pilot like state the drug had given me and suggested we go to the beach.
