I woke up excited next morning, eager to begin my trip.  It had just begun to sprinkle snowflakes on this beautiful Virginian morning.  I arrived to take my test at 8:00 AM sharp.  I brought the LSD with me and had decided that I wanted to be tripping when I got back home, so 15 minutes into my 45 minute examination, I ate my tabs.
