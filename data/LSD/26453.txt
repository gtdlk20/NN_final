One day I decided to indulge on my own, which I really do enjoy at times. I took 2 blotters, which I secured from a rave a few day earlier. The acid began to take effect and let down its unrelenting power upon my willful mind. General color pattern changes and breathing and molding occured. I sat and watched a candle move around for quite a while.
