We visited various exhibits, first a bird sanctuary, all of us that were tripping were in mouth-gaping awe at the beauty of it all, the tranquility and pleasantness of the experience. This experience was often interrupted by a non-tripper making small talk. This slowly got on my nerves but I ignored the person making the comment, feeling on a higher plane to them. Everyone that was tripping was feeling it now, the 2 guys I didn't know were a little freaked as they didn't really know what to expect. I already felt more at ease and closer to these 2 guys than I did with my other friends who I'd known for over 10 years. Myself and the other 3 elected to do a detour through a botanical garden which was probably my best choice of the day. A light mist coming from overhead sprinklers was so pleasant, and my friend made me put my hand through some spiderweb, it felt smooth and pliable. I guess when you're tripping solid objects feel a bit more web-like in any case: movable but still firm. I could of stayed in the garden forever.
