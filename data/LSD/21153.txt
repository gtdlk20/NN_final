In the light, the visuals had faded, and all I felt was somewhat energetic and euphoric.  I danced for a while longer, and then looked up again around 4 AM, and the people outside of the dance area looked very blurred--somewhat similar to the appearance the world takes on under the effects of nitrous oxide.  Sometimes, when people moved, they appeared to be leaving trails, but this was only the case when they were farther off, not right in front of me.
