I used to do acid whenever I could get my hands on it in high school.  (Generally every weekend).  I loved it and always had a great time for about the first 2 years of doing it.  I never really had strong visuals, but would come to meaningful conclusions about the world and have powerful realizations.  I also enjoyed laughing my ass off at the insanity of the human race.  After a while something changed though.  I began to have bad trip after bad trip.  I would get paranoid and had trouble trusting the people I was with.  I thought that they were laughing at me and staring at me, wondering what was wrong with me.  I also developed anxiety problems.  I'm not sure what changed but I can no longer handle acid anymore and I'm kind of sad about that, but well, there's always mushrooms.
