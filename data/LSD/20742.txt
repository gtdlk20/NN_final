I've never tried any drugs other than weed, so when my friend suggested that a group of us trip, I was interested.  Of course, being the paranoid nerd that I am, I went online and did my research.  Had to make sure I wasn't in danger of dying off of two hits of acid...yeah I am paranoid.  Probably why acid wasn't such a good choice of drugs for me.
