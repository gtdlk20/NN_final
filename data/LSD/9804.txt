Having not tripped for a few months, I decided to grab three tabs of acid and have some fun.  I took them at 6 pm on a Tuesday night.  This seemed silly, especially since I had to go to work the next morning, but there was no time in the next few weeks in which I'd be able to use the acid, so I decided to go for it.  I was alone in my room - I didn't want to freak out my roommates, they have no idea that I've ever touched drugs, and I couldn't find anyone to trip with.  However, I had had experience with psychedelic drugs, including acid, so I was sure I would be able to handle it.
