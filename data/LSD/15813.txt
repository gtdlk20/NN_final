The journey continues.  I dont know for how long, is there any time on an acid trip?  And then its over.  The music climaxes, the crowd surges, the energy peaks.  Wolfmother have gone and the lights come on and we have to deal with reality.  Get out of the concert hall, try not to grin too much at strangers, find my friends, make our way home.  We attempt to collect ourselves and start to walk in the direction of the city, looking for a taxi.  My legs are weightless and I cant feel the cold, I want to walk until dawn.  But the speed and the headlights of the zooming cars are jarring, and finally we climb into one and ride to the embrace of home.  With trance cranking on the stereo, a book of Alex Gray paintings to transfix me, and my friends beside me on the couch, I can drift calmly through my altered reality.
