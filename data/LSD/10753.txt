The trip continued to a scene similar to the movie Contact with Jodie Foster. I found myself saying good-byes to everyone I have ever known, and everything I was in my life. I was in a little space capsule and I blasted off through the cosmos. I was space traveling, a large part of my ego was missing. But I was still there as in I could think and be like  wow - this is interesting.
