I started looking around to see what things looked like now.  I had over the past few weeks hooked up my bedroom with all kinds of cool stuff in preparation for this trip- blacklights, psychedelic blacklight posters, lava lamps, incense, and of course my new couch.  Being after Christmas I had a new Sony blu ray player to go with my TV, and had made a DVD with my favorite metal videos.  With much effort I made my way over to my set to put them on.
