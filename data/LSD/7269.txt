Upon arriving at the grocery store, my trip took a turn for the worse.  I am not sure whether it was that I was simply overwhelmed by the experience, or if the way I staggered my doses altered things, but I became very confused.  The grocery store was crowded, and in my state, the crowding was further amplified.  I kept losing my train of thought as I was distracted by dozens of signs and fellow shoppers.  My friends chose a few snacks then went to the express aisle.  While standing in line with them, I felt sudden rushes of anxiety and confusion.  Every object that had the potential to carry an image (mirrors, windows, television screens, electronic cash registers) seemed to flash pictures and words at me at blindingly fast rates.  I felt as if I could not properly feel my body, and that at any moment I would soil myself without realizing it, in the middle of a crowded grocery store.
