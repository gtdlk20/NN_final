The trip ended after about 8 hours.  That night, I smoked pot again, and I noticed, no visuals, but everything that was close up looked really blurry.  I couldn't even read a book.  I looked in the mirror and my pupils were very dialated, so I thought maybe the acid was like coming back, since I smoked.  No big deal.
