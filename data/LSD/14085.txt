T=3:45: I suddenly felt more lucid, remembered what it was to be human.  No longer nauseous, I took a big drink of water (have to stay hydrated) and an anti-anxiety supplement that I keep handy.  I often do have anxiety.  (... in retrospect that should perhaps have concerned me.)  I went back to my bed and thought about the visualizations of alien reincarnations.  The patterns in the ceiling and door were still quite vibrant and beautiful, their colors varying gradually in saturation.
