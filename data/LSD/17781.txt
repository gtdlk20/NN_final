We made it up to our tent, although unfortunately, I thought the ground below was wriggling with rattle snakes.  Chair fortunately was not deluded by the ground, and we successfully planted ourselves in front of our tent again.  This time the lights were all turned on, as it was dark, and that was a whole new dimension, seeing the lights from above.  The stream of cars was still snaking through the hills, and the tent city of desert dwellers was swelling.  I zeroed in on a particular truck with a little camper, and watched it bumping along.  When the truck hit a particularly large bump, the back end dipped down, and the corner of it spiraled down and swirled to mix with the dirt.  I explained this to Chair, who laughed.
