It was a Monday night at my home and my roommate had picked up some LSD tabs from a pretty reliable source. He cut roughly 3/4 of a tab and tested it with a reagent kit to ensure it was legitimate, and then ate it. He asked if I wanted a tab, and I said no at first as it was a Monday night and I had classes the next day. After about 20 minutes, I thought about it again and decided to take it, since I wasn't sure when the next time I was going to have an opportunity to drop again.
