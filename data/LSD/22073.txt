I leaned over the rail and thought about how dumb that last incident had been. I wished I had a friend there to take care of me, but I was alone, head full of lsd, roaming a huge ship with three thousand other occupants on the middle of the ocean in goddamned nowhere. I watched the waves and continued to think. The waves caused by the ship were entertaining to watch. After a few moments, I stopped seeing waves. Instead, I saw milk. The entire ocean had turned to milk, covered with fruit loops. We were now traveling upon The Cereal Sea. The cereal then turned back into the dark water it had been before, but I was seeing the waves as dark stemed flowers with dark coloured petals. A sea of flowers. I continued to watch the waves, and they continued to evolve into new things. Each stage of evolution was a bit odder than the previous one.
