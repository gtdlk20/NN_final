So I popped the two tabs under my tongue, did the usual 'if it's bitter it's a spitter' routine. No taste, seemed to check out fine. I managed to find a nice quiet spot in the middle of a park to relax, and just have a good time. I waited in anticipation for the acid to kick in (Roughly 40-45 minutes for me). It was a really sunny day, the birds were singing their songs and I generally just felt quite pleasant.
