We were told we'd be on this road for an hour before reaching our stop.  Jess and I couldn't believe it, the 40 minutes had already seemed like forever.  Rocks in the sides of hills took strange shapes and the landscape filled us with awe.  I was asking if we were lost about every 10 minutes.  Jess and I were constantly afraid for our lives as we wound up and down mountains on the tiny road with no guardrails, but cheerfully so.  The sun set on the way, making a beautiful color on the mountainous horizon.
