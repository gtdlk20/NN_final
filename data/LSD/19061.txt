After the game (at this time I was clearly plateauing) my friend K suggested a boat ride. This idea caught my attention immediately and I ran to secure a spot in the back of the boat. After cracking a few jokes with my friend R who was accompanying me in the back of the boat(and crying after laughing for so long) we left the shore and began to cruise the black waters of the lake. I recall repeating 'the stars sure are good tonight' several times, to anyone who would listen. Out in the country away from the city lights we were privy to thousands of twinkling stars. These stars were the focus of my hallucinations. I had never seen anything so beautiful as the stars that night, but I wasn't viewing them the same way as I did when sober. Tonight (on LSD) the stars seemed to be on several different planes of dimension. By this I mean that I could tell how far or near stars were, which galaxies shown the brightest and found it extremely easy to mentally map our boats progress by merely using the stars. It felt like if we were to boat to the edge of the lake we could just continue our journey out into the stars and space. They (the stars) were projected in a sort of 3D real-time where depth, distance, brightness, and location all merged together making me feel as if I could navigate our boat to anywhere in the world with no problems if I so desired. One last note about the night sky is that I found (and still hold, strangely enough)a deep interest in flying planes. Since the stars were so detailed in their location and depth I could see EXACTLY where the plane's trajectory was from and where it was leading it. Imagine viewing the sky, not as a 2D plane of reference, but more of a 3D aviary where I could see up to, under, and around all sides of a plane in the night sky. It gives me a very real feeling of superior vision.
