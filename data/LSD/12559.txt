About an hour after I had dosed, I decided to take a lengthy walk. As I got dressed for the cold weather outside, the wood grain on my closet door began to dance about.  Wood grain is a foolproof illusion-initiator and it made me glad for the familiar sight.  Exiting the building, I ran into a friend of mine who commented on the grin I was wearing and wished me a good trip. I tried to think of where I should go, and remembering a great bike-path route that followed alongside a highway before curving back towards campus,  coming to the conclusion that there would be no better peak to my trip than by myself in nature. While on my walk, I became very appreciative of the increased sensitivity to light that I was receiving. The way shadows and beams emitted from streetlights play with each other when under the influence of psychs has always been one of my favorite little marvels, and during the nighttime in winter the refractions of light hitting falling snowflakes and ice on the ground is even more pleasing. The clear night sky gave a wonderful display of constellations that shimmered on a backdrop of blacks and blues.
