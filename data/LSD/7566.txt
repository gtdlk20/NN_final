After eating, we went back to Douglas' dorm which was on the other side of the campus.  We spent a little while there playing Mario Kart and listening to music.  Music remained dull, although at this point I was definitely coming down.  After chilling a while Douglas decided to smoke a bowl so the three of us all headed out to the woods, where we had originally gone after dosing, so he could smoke.
