I instantly ran into my room as soon as I got home, stripped myself down naked and just completely lost control of my body. I collapsed into my bed, and proceeded to melt into my bedroom. I felt this sort of spiritual energy flowing through my room and me (almost a bit like the force in star wars), and essentially let go of my consciousness and let it fly away from my body on this 'wave', like an ocean current. I had some sort of higher being connect to me telepathically again, but this time it seemed to tell me the language of the universe. It made me see and understand how the world works, and that all of my worries and regrets were complete bullshit. It taught me that the world and all of the crap that comes with it is merely a social construct. When it comes down to primal instincts, none of it matters. It transported me through a galaxy of wordless philosophies. Things like this are only explainable when one actually takes the substance.
