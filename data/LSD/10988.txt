I was finally starting to enjoy myself again for a little while, but it was short lived. Kate and Ben had run off, and everyone was just being very loud outside. I started worrying again. A bit later I felt too cold outside, so we all eventually made our way back inside. It wasn't but a minute later the doorbell rang. Tim went and answered the door. It was the cops. They wanted to talk to me, since I lived at the house. I was panicking again. I could hardly even talk. I went outside to speak with the officer, who said they had gotten a 'welfare check' call. I kept trying to convince the officer that everything was fine, and that no one had done anything. I also kept saying that I did not want them searching my house under any circumstances. I couldn't think very straight at the time, as I was at the peak of my trip now. I just kept repeating that I didn't want them searching my house. This officer kind of 'gave up' on me for awhile, while another officer came out to talk to me. This officer tried to talk to me on a much more personal level. He said how he knew we were on something, and that his guess was acid. I didn't say a 'yes' or a no' but my facial expression did change when I realized he knew what was up. He continued talking to me on a personal level, and started going on about he used to 'sell dope at my age'. Then he started talking about how he turned his life around, and that I needed to, too.
