Upstairs everyone was lying or sitting down.  I had to pick my way through all the bodies and sit down.  We sat for a while and I was able to cool down a bit.  Someone tapped me twice on the shoulder.  I looked round but noone was even near me.  I freaked!  I wasn't bolloxed enough that I couldn't mistake that tap.  And I sure as hell knew that no-one was near me.  'What's up?'  George asked.  'blddysbbbllblbl...um'  I replied in good effort and then pointed to my sticker on my chest.  It had gone!  Oh my god, had the mysterious tapper pinched it or had I imagined those people downstairs?  I hadn't imagined the fiver that was for sure.  Panic was on its way back again.
