Needing no further explanation Me and S buy the tickets.  I could tell that C was hoping he would get them and realizes he still has to pay 42 dollars.  His acid must be affecting him because he didn't give the man any money and he still tried to grab at the tickets. After walking in the gates C chews up the map and we are lost for the rest of the day.
