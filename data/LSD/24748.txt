This is a rewrite of a dream labeled 'Lousy Dream Lived Out with LSD' posted elsewhere.  I choose to rewrite it because that report was written approximately five hours after the dream ended, and was my attempt to solidify the events of the night, it does not focus on what I learned that night. At that point, I had no idea just what I'd learned that night. Of course.
