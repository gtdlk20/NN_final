	We had eventually made it to the bench to smoke. After we did everything of less-than-bright quality had temporarily gone from my vision. Seeing only an array of streetlights and stars. We got back into the car (not sure the intent of this was, if any) We were driving, bumping music, late at night, on Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, in Utah nonetheless, yet there was this sense that nothing could go wrong, like I was protected from harm and any other terrible event that could befall on me, other than my own psyche I guess. While in the passenger seat of my friends car, I had let out a loud gasp of terror as I clutch my mouth in horror. And pointed at this terrible thing as it lay in the road. Landon (the driver) exclaimed  You saw it to?!
