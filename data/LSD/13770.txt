I could probably keep going on and on about what acid did to me, I had such a myriad of thoughts and experiences on this trip. It would be defeating for me to continue on that though. There is one solid thing I got of this. Humans can't comprehend all this stuff. ItÂ’s just too much for us. That is where art, music, culture, cooking, everything comes from. Everything people strive for, its just us trying to get by as much as we can within the whole world sphere that we're part of. We can't figure out the logos, we can't get a finger on all the reasons. I think this taste I got of it last night was a lesson. It was a lesson to just live my life out and not get so enveloped in trying to get answers. Yes, faith is important and I feel humble towards God now, but I think the key is just not to dwell on this stuff. I think that God, or whatever good is out there, is taking care of us, and we're ignorant children that can't comprehend His divinity. I just need to get by.
