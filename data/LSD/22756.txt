When the joints were rolled we proceeded outside into the night and climbed on top of the restaurant my friend worked at. Up there on that roof we watched the town below and smoked joints. On the way down I almost stepped off the roof due to a lack of being in my body. This scared the shit out of me and I slapped myself back into it and climbed down the ladder.
