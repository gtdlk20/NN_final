My friends told me the next day that I was talking about the plane and all the 'people trying to escape the city' in the poster for like 2 hours. I don't remember what time we ended up passing out but it was starting to get light out so I know it was early morning.  The first thing I looked at was that poster.  It was of a bunch of mushrooms.  And all I could think of was how the hell I ever saw a plane.  Over all, I'd say I had a good experience. Except for the brief period I thought my friends were going to murder me.  Like I said though...I'm a naturally paranoid person.
