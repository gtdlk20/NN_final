We got back to our seats just in time for the half time show. It was the Cavs wheel chair basketball team. Now there is nothing funny about disabled people, but under the circumstances this was almost too much. Just when I thought I couldn't take any more and was about to lose it another voice came over the loudspeaker. It was an advertisement for Disney on Ice and a tiny sounding Disney voice said at what seemed like a million miles an hour 'sleepyhappydopeygrumpysneezybashfuldoc!!!!' What I heard was more like 'stumpy lumpy dumpy grumpy wheezy trash-ho cock' I choked back my laughter. My dad turned and looked at me and again asked if I was ok. I again hunched over and pretended to moan in pain. The rest of the game/trip was more of the same.
