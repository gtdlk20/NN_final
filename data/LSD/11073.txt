W really wanted to move on, so we decided to go down to the boat house by the lake, and maybe take a walk along the railroad tracks right next to it. In order to do this, we would likely encounter some heavy foot traffic, since we would have to walk down the main road that goes through campus for a while. Well, as long as we kept going and don't get distracted along the way, I guessed that would be allright.
