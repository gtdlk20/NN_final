After listening to music we had decided to go chill in another room and let ourselves drift off completely. At this time a weird vibe had started to flood the room and everyone could feel it. An friend C wanted to watch Alice and Wonderland witch would have been a glorious idea if the only working dvd player wasn't right near A's fathers room. C couldn't get his mind off it and it was extremely annoying because he kept saying 'Want to watch Alice,' and we told him we were going to at 1:00 to get his mind off of it. We were all tripping insanely hard more than I had ever before.
