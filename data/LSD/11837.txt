When we got into the woods, Arthur took out two joints and we sat down on a dry log.  He told me it was a good idea to smoke while we were coming up, especially for me, so that the transition to altered consciousness would be less jarring.  Before I had even finished my joint, I noticed how unusual this high was in comparison to times I had smoked before.  There was a super-real quality to the world around me, and my thinking felt very abnormal and disordered.  It's very difficult to explain; I want to say that it felt like my mind was crowded and cloudy, almost as if lots of little thoughts were passing under the lens of my awareness it felt like my mind was crowded and cloudy, almost as if lots of little thoughts were passing under the lens of my awareness  never in their entirety, but in little fragments  discrete segments of bigger thoughts, confusing and strange because their meaning was lost entirely now without their full context.  Despite how this description may sound, I was having a very good time at this point and I still was really excited.
