No more than perhaps ten or fifteen minutes later, I was in a software store, looking at video games, we a sudden, quickly-rising sense of panic and apprehension came over me.  I began to think, 'Perhaps it was poison, or they mixed it improperly!  I might be about to die!'  I left the store immediately and sat down on a bench in the mall's atrium, trying to get my head straight.  I remembered in the past that music had calmed me when I felt anxious on LSD, so I got out my CD player and tried to listen to acoustic guitar music, but even that was way too much.  And I was freaking out because I was like 20 minutes into the trip -- not even close to the peak -- and I was already overwhelmed.  Fortunately, even at this point, I was a fairly experienced solo tripper, so even with my mind out in space, my body was functioning on a basic survival sort of level.
