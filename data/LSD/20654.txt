G and D eventually convinced me that I would be alright and we left his house to go to the local 24 hour shop to buy some munchies. When I was walking in I couldn't stop looking at things. Everything was swirling and melting into each other then going back to normal then melting again. At one point the man behind the counter came up too me and asked me if I could close the door to the fridge which had the coca cola in it because I was standing there looking at it with the door open for about 15 minutes. This seemed like only a minute or so. I eventually grabbed a snickers bar and a coke and went to the counter. All I could do was stare at the man, because he was staring at me. It felt like I was staring at him for about 5 minutes or so before I reached into my pocket and grabbed a ten dollar note out which I promptly spent another 5 minutes staring at. I'm not actually sure if this was the actual time spent but my time perception was completely out the door.
