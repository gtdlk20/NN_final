Final descent: When I got home, my dogs went crazy. It was around 12:30 in the morning and theyd been alone for a few hours. My girlfriend had decided to spend the night at her friends house. I needed some time alone. I realized I hadnt had any time alone all day. I did a little bit of cleaning and gave the dogs some attention, but they were too excited to cuddle. I was worried about them playing too rough and hurting each other, but I decided to have faith in them and just let them get their energy out so we could sleep later. They were fine. I boiled some water for tea, but I couldnt definitely conclude that I had any decaf in the house, so I just relaxed with some hot water. I made a special Comedown playlist on my computer. It was like hearing music for the first time. While this sensation is very common on acid, I was still taken aback by the clarity of the music, wishing to experience it all the time. At 1am I sat down and recorded a video of myself talking about my day and my experiences for a minute or two. I barely scratched the surface. I made myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and finally realized just how hungry I was. Still, my stomach would only accept so much food at one time.
