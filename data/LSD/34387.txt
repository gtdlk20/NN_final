Friday morning we left St. George and headed for Vegas.  We smoked some shwag on the way down the canyon and jammed to the Doors, and talked nonsense till we got to Vegas.  When we got to Vegas we met up with some mutual friends, one of which attends UNLV and lives in the dorms, which is where we slept.  Friday night everyone found tickets to the Phish show, so we all went and had an awsome time.
