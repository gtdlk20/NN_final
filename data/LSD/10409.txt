I decided to write a message to myself and save it into my mobile phone, so that I could remind myself of it in the future and generally have it handy as a way of connecting with the experience that was sure to fade as the drug wore off.  I wrote You are truly loved by someone when you are loved for what you are at heart.  Not for what you are trying to be, or for what they want you to be.  Within everyone there is a true notion of who they really are.  Their true inner self as such.  In everyday life such a notion gets buried in most people by the acting and role-playing we feel necessary to conduct.  People act in a manner that they think other people would want or expect them to act in, out of the fear that they wont be accepted if they dont.  Our big game of acceptance I coined it; everyone constructing a persona that they feel will allow others to accept them.  This was also cast aside by the LSD mind state.  I reconnected with my true self, a childlike, fun-loving, happy-go-lucky individual.  Something that had been semi-buried under a constructed exterior.
