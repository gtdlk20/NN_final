Instead me and my wife decided to take a look around on foot since we where new to the place and had pretty much stayed resting around camp the whole day. As it turned out the area we now entered had bright signs and lots of people with multicolored glowing glowsitcks and blinking light emitting diodes witch led to a visionary bubble bath of  colors and confusion. I went into the registration tent where I saw  the familiar glow of computer screens but when I walked up to one of them I found that I was unable to decipher the text nor was able to comprehend how to operate the machine. After some hilarious moments I retuned out to my wife without registering.
