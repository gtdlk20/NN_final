We sat comfortably in the basement as I began my space-out. About an hour and a half later, the people I was with decided they were going to visit someone else who lived outside of the town we were in. I decided I would be better off going along with those I knew than walking around town looking for someone else I knew to spend my time with. It can be a long night by yourself if you're not comfortable and at home.
