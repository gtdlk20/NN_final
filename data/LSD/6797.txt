Its the last day of our honeymoon. Wed scrambled to find a camping spot for our acid trip, and the place we found is perfect and serene. Its part of a larger, established campground, which were not used to since we usually stay off of logging roads. But its a Tuesday night, its fairly secluded, and we dont have to worry about bears or wild animals while were tripping.
