As it was nearing midnight, I could tell W was getting really tired, so I finally convinced him that I was safe to be on my own (as long as he put out all the candles).  He told me I could do what I wanted as long as I promised not to go outside.  At this point I was getting a lot of trails and colorful vibrations at the edges of objects, especially things with bold designs. I really liked this.
