We went back inside, and the lightshow was more intense than ever. The whole room was purple, and I felt like I was in space or something. The dubstep music was literally fucking my mind: It sounded like alien music and it was just so odd but so moving, I just could not get over how amazing it sounded. No, not sounded. I wasnt hearing music anymore, I was feeling it: absorbing it with my whole body. It was a three-hour mind orgasm, theres no better way to describe it. I remember at one point, N asked me what time I wanted to leave. I replied, Time? I dont care about time. Time isnt real, its an entity made up by man, and all it does is cause problems. I then realized she was probably bored by now. I was having the time of my life, and she was probably tired of it and ready to leave. I wanted so badly for her to be in the same state of mind as me, and I realized I would never be able to explain to her how I felt at that moment. I am trying my best to explain it now, but words truly do not do justice to the LSD experience. I guess the best word to sum up the whole experience is, whoooooooaaaaaaaaaahh.
