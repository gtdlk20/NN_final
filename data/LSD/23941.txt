It was fairly late one night in the early summer. At around 11:30 my friend Matt and I decided to stay up late and partake in an LSD experience. What I had was actually one really large square on the plain kind of blotter without pre-sized squares, and it was about 2 large hits' worth. Anyway, we decided to go for a walk to compliment the onset of the experience.  The setting was a pleasant residential area.
