T+2 hours: I touch my sunglasses as I'm holding them in my hand and close my eyes. Reality begins to unfold and I swear I was able to enter other dimensions and if I had stayed longer then experience time travel (that's what I figured out in my acid-head). Finally we realise we are kind of dehydrated as it's like 3:00 and about 95 degrees. I'm scared to go back to my house though because of my dad and the cop but we just wing it and start walking.
