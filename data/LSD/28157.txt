Right as we were about to panic (we were in no condition to deal with other people at this point) two guys stumbled out of the car with two cartons of orange juice!  I can't remember thier story but they were tripping also, driving across the state.  They left us a carton of OJ and we smoked them up, and they went on their way. Analyzing the encounter, they seemed to be just a couple of farmer's kids out having fun like we were.  They came from such a different background compared to four little candy ravers, and we never would have met them, least make friends with them if it weren't for the drugs bringing us together.  Not long after they left we decided to continue up further into the mountains.
