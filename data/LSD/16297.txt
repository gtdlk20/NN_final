You can call me Delysid.  I am in my early twenties.  Up until the experience which I'm about to divulge, I was, in my own opinion, fairly inexperienced with drugs of any sort.  Of course, like most Americans, I had consumed large amounts of caffine over my lifetime.  I had smoked pot in high school, but due to the group I smoked with, never got much enjoyment out of it.  I had consumed alcohol in small amounts up until just months before the experience when I started drinking heavily habitually, but still not quite to the extreme of alcoholism.  I had always had an interest in 'drugs'.  Even as a child I used to love reading in first aid books and encyclopedias about the effects of all types of substances, illicit or not.  But it was the weeks I finally read the cult science fiction calssic 'The Illuminatus! Trilogy' that I first considered trying psychedelics.
