At about the 2 hour mark exactly T began to feel her effects fully and for some reason it overwhelmed her and she I guess blacked out, fortunately for no more than 4-5 seconds. Unfortunately for me I was just beginning to peak as she went limp (she was sitting on B at the time so he was able to cradle her and comforted her when she came to). Even though it was only for a few seconds, and before I knew it she was completely fine and really enjoying her trip, my mind began to run with the idea of what would we do if she really isnt fine, we are all tripping what do we do,etc. Fortunately everyone besides myself and C had taken LSD many times before and they were able to calm me down get me to get back into the music which seemed to ease my mind. Even though I calmed down I will never forget  the fear, the only way I can describe how I felt it was as it I was on top of a building on the ledge, and someone came behind me and tried to push me over the edge, that sense of adrenaline and intense fear was what I was feeling for probably about 45 minutes.  It took every bit of me keep my sanity together over the whole issue.
