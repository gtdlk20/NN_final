Anyway, I was listening to my walkman and I go outside of my homie's pad. It was already getting dark, but then I started to notice that everything began to move with the rhythm of the music (I was listening to some Jimi Hendrix). It was so intense how the timing was just exact, it would slow down then pick up pace. The sounds I heard in the music resembled life, it was like reality was represented by the music and I could feel myself floating. I let my eyes go out of focus and then I saw hundreds of little pictures of me right in front of my eyes, like I was staring at myself from behind while I was looking into a mirror. I looked to the sky and I saw the stars forming geometric shapes. I have never had an LSD trip like this before, this was something else.
