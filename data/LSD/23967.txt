We went back to the school, and I decided to have a shower in my room. This is were the acid peaked. As I was standing in the shower I started to see some weird shit on the shower curtain. I saw a beaver, standing on his hind legs with a crown on his head. I found out he was a king, and that his army was going to war against an evil lion. It was like seeing a movie. Suddenly I came back to myself again, and thought to myself that I was really tripping. I tried to focus on the shower curtain again, and this time I felt like I was in a space ship. I had the feeling that I was racing through space with an enormous speed. It started to feel a little too real, and at one point I thought I saw some aliens behind the shower curtain. I became scared and turned off the shower and layed in bed for a while.
