I have had many trips since that night, including one recent trip during the day. I had been frustrated with myself before we dosed that day. For awhile I had been thinking beautiful thoughts without the mind-enhancing substances. But I felt that I was on the verge of something extraordinary. Something that will come into play in the near future. It turned out to be how to save the world. But I hadn't encountered that just yet.
