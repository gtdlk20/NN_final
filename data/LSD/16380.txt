It was late October, 2005. I had been tripping on acid a couple of times before, first in early 2005 and the second time shortly after midsummer. They had been pretty intense trips both, first was very visual with a short panic attack-experience because of big dosage (7 drops of liquid LSD) and the second was more mental with just 1 drop and spent outside in nature with profound perceptions about nature and myself and the involvement of fractal geometry present in everything around us.
