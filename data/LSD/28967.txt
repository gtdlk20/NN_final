I've had social drinks since, because fucking-everybody-and-their-gottdamned-uncle drinks and it's hard to avoid, but it's 1 or 2 to be polite and that's all. What transpires next is dismaying and reinforcing at the same time, a room full of people get drunk and I don't, I won't, I can't betray what Thompson called "the Great Magnet", but those who imbibe become shameless. Animals looking to rut or throw up. Disgusting.
