Outside, J called another friend of ours, B, who invited us to his room to play a round of Nazi Zombies.  I got myself under control in B's room while he and J played videogames but still had an anxious, nervous undercurrent to everything I did.  After a few minutes we had to leave B so he could study so J and I stepped outside and I called a friend of mine, M, who was a very experienced tripper.  I told M I was on acid and he immediately asked if everything was beautiful and perfect.  I told him it was more strange than I had expected, almost too disjointed from reality and he helped to talk me down.  Just hearing his voice practically lifted the anxious feeling from my trip and made me feel comfortable again.  He told me some websites to go to and by the end of our conversation I felt like I had risen above the trip and it was no longer in control.
