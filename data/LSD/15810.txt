Im standing in a room the size of a warehouse, dark and crowded with bodies shimmering with energy that will soon turn to sweat and cheers.  I feel waves of excitement through my body  is it from the chemicals inside of me or the tension of a crowd of people nursing cheap beers and trying not to stare expectantly at the empty stage?  The room goes black, a collective yell comes from our throats, both primal and civilized at the same time.  And then our noise is eclipsed by drums, guitars, synths, and a voice like liquid meets velvet, like wine.  My body shakes, my toes tap, my head nods, my energy radiates outward and mingles with that of the people around me.  I can feel an involuntary grin spread across my face  the music, the energy, the acid surging through my veins, it all brings me closer to bliss.  I turn to J to see if he feels it and can see it in his smile, in the ways his eyes glow a bit brighter, in the movements of his body.
