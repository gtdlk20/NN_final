The more extrospective the trip became, the more in tune I was with my senses, the more I was able to be aware of the moment I was in--which is to say the more I became aware of existing. As soon as I caught on to this, my mind was suddenly racing and my blissful moment had ended. I stepped back inside and the extrospection instantaneously turned to seemingly infinite introspection as though someone had flipped a switch. It then dawned on me that what I might be experiencing was akin to what some have described as an Ego-Death.
