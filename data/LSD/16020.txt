An hour into the trip, I'm already regretting it. Just wondering why I decided to do this again on a completely random night where I had work in the morning. To top that off, M had done meth earlier in the night so while he was tripping, he wouldn't shut the fuck up. We'd keep talking to each other and trying to figure things out but he would start blabbering off about something else that didn't have anything to do with what we were talking about at the time. This started to get really annoying while we were tripping in my house so we decided to take a walk outside to trip. This is where it got really weird and the same things were happening. We kept doing the same thing over and over, arguing in constant repetition about the same things over and over and never figuring anything out. We were mad at each other for a while, which was awful. We were having a bad trip, but we started coming back to normal and figuring things out in our minds. We were finally connecting again like we used to and started having a fun fun comedown.
