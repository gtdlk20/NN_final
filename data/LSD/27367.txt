The first hallucination I had was when I entered one of the chill out bars.  The very first thing I saw was the stone slabs that they used for the floor.  Then I saw the some grungy people with green army coats in the corner and then a spilt drink to my right.  It was dark here and quite crowded.  In that split second my brain had already made up its mind on where it thought it was.  Quickly the bar melted and revealed the dungeon that I was really in.  I moved slowly through looking at the dripping water and the rats that scurried out of my way.  Prisoners of some other era lay dormant in their green macs in the corners.  The stone walls had green alghi and other damp patches everywhere.  I had to shake my head before the bar materiallised.  'For gods sake' I reminded myself, 'its a fucking bar'.  As I ordered another bottle of water the images kept repeating.  I didn't panic though - it was interesting and I remember thinking how it could happen that anyone could possibly get from a bar to a dungeon cell.
