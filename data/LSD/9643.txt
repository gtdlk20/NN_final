We smoked some more weed and now that I was finally able to disconnect as my friends had stopped talking as much I was able to really trip. I ran down the hill back to the house and it felt as if my body was alive as if it was some primitive instinct to run down steep hills through bushes, as we hunt our prey or whatever. I was pouncing and leaping from here to there. It was one truly amazing exhilarating feelings. Like all my senses were so accurately divided to achieve peak efficiency during this moment.
