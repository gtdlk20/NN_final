I notice that J is being really quiet which was a huge departure from the joy and awe he was feeling just before I went to grab another dose for me and A. I ask him what's wrong and immediately he goes shhhhh! Dude the cops might hear us. I laughed it off and told him not to worry about it we as we were pretty far from anyone in the woods that we were in. Especially far from any cops. However, over the next 5-10 minutes his paranoia and anxiousness started skyrocketing to the point that he announced he wanted to go back to his dorm and be alone. So I decided I could walk J back and meet up with my friends after.
