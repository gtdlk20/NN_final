We entered the rave at the very start, around 11:00pm.  All of my friends were going to be rolling, but I'd been tired of it lately and hoped that I could find something a bit more interesting somewhere at the rave.  My hopes were fulfilled.  I told the guy I wanted 3 hits, and he asked me to buy at least 20, but I didn't have the money.  He told me 3 would be fine, so I tore what appeared to be 3 hits off of what I thought was a 10 strip (it was unmarked) and took it.  About 15 mintues later, I realized that he had wanted me to buy 20, and the 10 strip looked a bit wide, and...you get the picture.
