I saw a cat calling for me and I looked into its eyes and realized that I began to communicate with it. I really understood what it wanted. I think it was a stray cat and it seemed to be lonely. I could see what it was thinking, and it undersood how I felt. Let me tell you, I'm not a cat person, but I started to pet it and it felt grateful for my company. All of a sudden it sounded like it was whispering words to me. Though I couldn't understand what it was saying, I felt it was speaking truths. My bro and T were just sittin' there on the couch just tripping, laughing at everything, man. But I saw this and it seemed as though I knew why it was like this and I couldn't explain it. I could still hear the cat then I said, 'Farewell, little guy and good luck.' I went back into the room and tried to tell these guys what was happening, but they were laughing too much, so I couldn't blame them.
