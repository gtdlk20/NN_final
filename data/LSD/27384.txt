On a seperate occasion I took 5 doses of lsd and felt nothing but a bout of hot flashes and anxiety.  My pupils never dialated but I did feel dosed.  All effects stopped thereafter and my peers who had taken only 1 hit of acid were bouncing off the walls and they ended up having an 8 hour trip. I ended up going to sleep about 2 and a half hours after consuming the 5 sugar cubes.
