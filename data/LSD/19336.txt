Anyway the next day I missed uni as my head wasnt intact at all. In the morning the tv still had the skull and all that breeze although my mate couldn't see it anymore, and all the photos still had one eye.  I sat on a park bench and a butterfly flew around me three times. It landed becide me  and its wings folded up then started distorting and crunching into different shapes. It looked so real. I actually thought it was real. The grass around me formed patterns that were completely obvious. I returned to my flat and all the posters on my wall were distoring and growing lumps out of their heads so I ripped them off the wall. Peoples heads were distoring all that day, I was worried it would stay like that forever and I prayed to god to cure me. The only remnants of the trip after that day lasted about two months were ever time I grew paranoid and I was with some they grew a giant smile and their eyes turned black, oh and things looked like they were moving when they werent. I also had some crazy closed eye visuals for a while aswell. Thank you for listening as this is a good outlet for what I experienced. If this gets posted I might put up some of my other experinces and id be interested to see if anyone can make any sense of it.
