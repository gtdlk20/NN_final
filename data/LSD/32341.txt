I remember wanting to have sex on lsd to see what effects it would have on me and the visuals. So me and my bf has sex and everything seemed normal visually. However, sensually was a different story I could feel everything, every bump, graze and glide. The colour around started to get brighter and move faster and as my orgasm built up so did the visuals. The colours became more vivid and the shapes became more structured and fixed together. Like a perfect puzzle. The closer my orgasm came to be the more shapes would appear and colours that I didnÂ’t even know existed tarted showing up around me. And I shit you not at the climax it was like a firework display going off around me. Each shape exploded into what looked like pixie dust, it was all so bright and overwhelming tbh. It took me a while to come back around. I sat there for ages just gazing at the ceiling understanding what had just happened.
