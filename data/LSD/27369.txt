I met with George who asked if I wanted to up to the balcony to calm down.  I nodded and followed like a zombie.  I passed a couple of people collecting for children in need who collered me for money - I think I gave them a fiver - they knew I was totalled and slapped a sticker on my chest.  I remember they made it cover the face of mona lisa I had printed with fractals and a spliff.  They thought it was funny.  I just wanted to get away from their voices that were changing pitch from high to low and back again.
