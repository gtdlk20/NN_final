I remember looking at somebody telling them they need to calm down they're too high and they need to relax and they look so fucked up, then my mates explained to me later I was talking to myself in the mirror. I ended up staring into my long hair seeing it move and change colour and light intensity without actually moving it or doing anything. The walls of my mates house were breathing heavily at the same time as I was. The walls and I had synchronised breathing patterns for awhile when I started seeing patterns on the ceiling. I felt a bit surprised but not in a bad way, so I tried to close my eyes and relax for a moment but experienced intense closed eye visuals which were more colourful and more abstract patterns than with my eyes open.
