We took the metro and in there some weird stuff was happening with me which I cant write here as it needs a lot of background story but I was seeing a lot of the part of reality as frames presented to me to perform certain actions. I strongly had the feeling that this was the work of the devil and sensed eerily felt that there was lot of magic involved in my experience. After we get down the metro she starts saying something was touching her before she got down and she felt nasty the way that thing was touching her in the train. She was constantly pointing to someone and it wasnt there. We go  to each of our homes respectively and dont talk for two or three hours until at 2 am she texts me saying shes still hearing voices talking to her and she cant control them. One spoke in Persian and was laughing and another in English. She was freaking out. I was in my room, it was dark and was trying to sleep but I couldnt  because something kept squishing the water bottle that was in the room.
