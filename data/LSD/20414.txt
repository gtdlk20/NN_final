My friend was probably in a whole other stage of the acid trip at this point, he was probably at the eerie mythological swirly colorful stage. I can see artwork really grabbing a hold of your creativity and imagination at that stage but in this new stage I was in I had already gone through that trance and this stage was more clearheaded but my perception of everything was soo different and more real'. Around this time our Russian friend told us to leave the house temporarily like walk around the block or something and come back in a bit and so we did and I remember going outside the feeling I had about myself I felt so primitive and human but also like an animal. Hard to explain really but I was just in this very primal fight or flight mindset. Not as intense and as atavistic as the primal feeling from shrooms, this was a little more cartoony and surreal and felt less wild.  But this primal fight or flight feeling was very clear and there; like anything could happen at anytime whether good or bad and I would have to be front and center to deal with it. I had no more concept of material things or possessions and personal property and I think this is when my ego started to vanish and become small and my vulnerability started to go up. We made our way out of his mini condo driveway area after making a few confusing stops on his property under this large tree. The whole area was very dark and hidden and had a strange but sort of nice vibe. All these different locations gave off such different vibes it was really quite interesting. It was like LSD was just the magnifier of everything. The giant tree over us looked so weird and different, all the plants and trees did.. My tripping friend was doing something on his phone, we then leave and walk around the main street for a bit then eventually come back to the Russian friends place.
