The moon was waning at this point and as I recall it was maybe 2:30-3:30am and the moon was just rising, so we opened my blinds and let the moonlight be the sole illimunation of the room. As I recall I tried to read a book in the moonlight but couldn't make out the letters, and she decided to read my handhelt CD player and got something really deep out of it.
