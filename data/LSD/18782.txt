It was a very gentle ascent into the trip, I must have spent the next few hours walking around enjoying the visuals as they became more intense, and was reporting my observations to a friend I was speaking to on a voice call. This part of the trip was almost entirely extrospective, I was engulfed by the senses. I recall listening to On the Beach by Neil Young, running my fingers against the crisp texture of the paint on the walls while I watched as the world around me breathed and changed.
