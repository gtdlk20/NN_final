IÂ’ve had a small cap of 100ug LSD (it was mixed with sugar and put in an empty pill capsule) sitting in my refrigerator for a while. Being interested in microdosing, but was unsure how.  After a long internet search, decided to put the full cap in 100ml of vodka. Wanted to wait for 24hours before having some, but that same day I was going to be part of a Contact Improvisation JAM (a space for movement improvisation either alone or with more people), so I was very interested on how would touch feel with microdosing.
