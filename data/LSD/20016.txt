Within the first 20 minutes I felt a sudden change. It was subtile yet distinct. I was wondering if this was placebo or not. The next hour or so was quite uneventful. I smoked some weed on my balcony and went back in by the computer; youtube. Watching old BF3 sketches was very fun. Actually at this point everything started to become very funny.
