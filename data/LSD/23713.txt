I thought about it, but it was hard to come to any sort of long-term conclusion on casual relationships on acid. Deep within me, I knew my relationship (and I dont mean romantic) with West was more or less meaningless; it was something I had thought about while I was sober. Yet, on acid, I had no opinions, no desires, no sense of what made sense and what did not, so, I ended up repeating I dont know at least fiKeen times. Yet again, I was a neutral sponge.
