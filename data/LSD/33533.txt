We have now journeyed to the first ride of the day, the power tower, because of the small wait.  While standing in line I break two more hits of acid off the strip, giving one to C and taking one myself bringing my dose to 2 and his to 3.  I knew that it hadn't been an hour and a half and my acid hasn't even started really kicking in yet but I figure if it's taking this long it must not be very strong acid.
