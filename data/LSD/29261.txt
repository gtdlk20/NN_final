After a while Justin drove me to another friends house after taking Vince and me off roading for a little while.When I arrived at his house I was just about to peak.Everything in his house took part in this pychodelic extraviganza taking me for a ride.The spirals upon his pipe began to spin,designes and symbols around the room spinning or doing something else unorthodox,his carpet turned to sea below me and the designes on them began to spin.By this time everythign was going great for me,untill I made the mistake of going on the interenet and posting a bulliten on myspace about me peaking on LSD,and of course my girl friend read this and was not happy at all,in fact she was about to break up with me,and even with all of that going on it did not affect me in the least.I would have expected that experiance to send me into a burning downward spiral straight into a bad trip,but it did'nt.
