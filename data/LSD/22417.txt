I had a strong urge to make some art and my concentration was on point- I focused in on small details and created a detailed ink drawing partially from my imagination and also based on the patterns I was seeing in the trees and landscape around me.  I felt very content with where I was, and also comfortable with the idea of going and doing something else if the opportunity arose.
