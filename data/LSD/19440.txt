7:00 PM - We had probably only traveled a hundred yards in the span of an hour. Thankfully, going back is much quicker than going forward. My bad mood dissolves within moments, and I cheer up with every step I take. Liam and I walk ahead of the other three and express our relief at overcoming such a trying situation. I comment on how dynamic the trip has been, and resolve to think twice before going for another hike on LSD.
