Further along the way, Liam plucks a large yellow lily and hands it to me. Its stamens reach out at me in an explicitly sexual manner. This sends me on a new train of thought, and I turn the flower over in my hand, marveling at its natural, organic sexuality and the way it stains my fingers yellow. When I mention this to my comrades, they just laugh, and Rene jokingly calls me a pervert. I am not upset at my peers for their reaction, but I do begin to dislike speaking in this state. I dislike the sound of my own voice and, occasionally, the sound of othersÂ’. Throughout the trip, I will frequently recommit myself to vows of silence and request that others keep their voices low.
