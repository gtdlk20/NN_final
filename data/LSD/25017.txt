So I slip the blotter onto my tongue, with that pre-trip tension in my stomach.  Then I go downstairs to my living room, and pop on the TV.  It's about 45 minutes later I notice the first effects.  The windows in the room had white lacy curtains with flower designs.  These flowers began to swirl majestically, while the curtains swayed in the acid breeze.  Then I looked at my couch, it was divided up into perfectly symmetrical squares that were all rotating counter-clockwise.  So I thought, 'well here I go'.  I only watched TV for another 10-15 minutes before I decided I should go to my room, throw on some music, turn the lights off, and lay in bed.
