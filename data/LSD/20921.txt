After retreating to the computer room and chatting online for a bit, i found a pen and began to write. i was still touched by my experiences outside, and i began to write 'thank you' all over the desk with a purple marker. Soon i could see tiny fuzz balls spinning on a grid inside the ink, and i flew down close and close as the ink swirled and formed patterns. I cut up a board game, producing a piece of cardboard that read 'the original memory game'. Kim came to visit me and after flirting with her for a bit we went back to join the other two. I hung my sign on the wall, where it remains to this day. Victor and Kim went off and Benny was watching Fantasia, so i sat down on the floor with Benny and we started to analyze the film. I have never seen anything more amazing than 'fantasia'. Never. 'A night on bald mountain' blew my mind. Benny and i bonded and began to get philosophical.
