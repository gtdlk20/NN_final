It was my birthday.  It was July 9th in the extraordinary summer of 2003.  I just turned 21 and all was peachy.  I had 5 days off of work and I was on a road-trip to see my best friend in the world, Nathan.  At the time he went to school in Alabama and I was at U of M.  Last time we were together had been over a year ago.  At that point, he had come to visit me and we painted the town red.  Needless to say I was very excited to go see him.  I had never been to his condo before and was so anxious to give my friend a ginormous hug.  Since I had just turned 21, I was of legal stature to buy beer and we just planned on getting really shitty.  I am not much of a drinker, but sometimes it's wonderful to just get hammered and reminisce.
