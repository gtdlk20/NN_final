It was a day like any other, my friends and I were just sitting around and had nothing to do, in an attempt to buy marijuana the dealer had just ran out, but he had acid for sale for 8$ a tab. My whole life I had been curious to try acid, I always wanted to know what it was like to hallicinate.  The other friends thought it was a bad idea, so they left, leaving me and my other good friend who was also interested.  We bought 6 tabs then went back to his house.
