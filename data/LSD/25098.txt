about 3 days ago my younger brother ken, dad, and i traveled to a concert where the dead were playing with willy nelson. when my dad told me about it, the one thing i was thinking about was if we could find any lsd... we were walking through the parking lot to the concert (which was just a giant grass field) it was about 85 degrees out and everybody was walking through rows of cars looking for anybody with the drug of their choice. at about noon, i was walking with my brother between rows of cars and many, many tiedye shirts and i saw a very pretty girl with colorful tatoos on her  mesh fabric and fairy wings comming out of her back walk by dotting the tip of her toungue with her index finger. 'ken, look its the acid faerie!' i whispered to my brother and turned around to follow her.
