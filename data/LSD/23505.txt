Something you must know about me, I am extremely paranoid about my hair. I need to constantly straighten it every time I wash it (its naturally frizzy/wavy), and Id just done that for the occasion, earlier on the day. Having paint in my hair would have made it crusty and dirty, so as soon as I saw it there, I exclaimed, Dianna! Not my hair!, still laughing, of course. She conceded, but didnt let go of my face, Okay, but you still need some more color. At that point, Summer came up from behind, and began painting the back of Diannas legs, who then sneaked up on me, and stroked a huge red line on my face. I hadnt even realized it, but a painting battle was ensuing. Dianna was so into it, she began painting both herself and us, by squeezing the tubes directly on our skin. She recommended Summer and I both change in shorts and sports bras, so we could all paint each other.
