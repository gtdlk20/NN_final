I have become increasingly close with my friend who moved here to Miami from New York about nine months ago; weÂ’ll call her S for the remaining of the report. I pretty much consider her as a sister by this point. What gave me the idea to try it with her was a recurring dream that I had in which we both took it and biked through the forest and ended up in the most serene setting. In this vivid dream we both lied down on a long sloped grass hill with a large lake at the bottom while we watched the sun set behind the mountains (I have no idea where I even conceived this place considering there are no mountains anywhere near Miami). After this I told her about dream and asked her what she though about making it happen. She has not done any drugs before in her life, so I was surprised to hear that she was open to the idea. I assured her that the drug is not what the media portrays it to be, and that we would plan it out perfectly so that nothing could go wrong. Although she was originally going to try smoking weed before this, it never quite happened and I am actually pretty glad. She is the most active, hilarious girl I know, so I would hate to see her so lazy and out of it after smoking. I asked her to trust me about the misconceptions about LSD, and reassured her that everything would be ok. We planned to trip the next weekend.
