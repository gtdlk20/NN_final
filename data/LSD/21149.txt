I have not had a lot of experience with hallucinogens; the number of times I've tripped can be counted on one hand.  In an effort to keep from scaring myself, I've tried to keep my doses relatively low--but I've found myself to be somewhat hardheaded when it comes to the effectiveness of drugs in general, so for this experience, I decided to up my dose a bit.
