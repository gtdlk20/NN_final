When we got outside, she was not quite as impresed.  I imagine I was having a slightly more visual experience than she.  But she wanted to go for a walk.  I of course, being the more nervous of the two of us, was worried about this concept.  But being so joyous at my new eyes, I had to oblige.  I said we should go to the end of my neighborhood and back.  I put my hand on my cheek as we walked and it seemed that I could feel EVERYTHING about my cheek.  On the way back, we passed a bush with purple flowers.  She picked one for each of us.  I twirled mine between my fingers until we got back to the house.  But a feeling was growing as I twirled it and finally in front of the house I pinpointed the nature of it.  I could sware I felt the life of the thing.  It felt like an insect squirming between my fingers.  I had to drop it.
