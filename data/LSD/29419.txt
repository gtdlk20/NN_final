It all started one Saturday night, when I decided to spend the night over at Daniel's house. Two other friends, Kevin and Sean were also staying over at Daniel's house, too. Daniel's older brother, David, was also staying there. Sean came and picked me up and drove to Daniel's house, even though Kevin and Daniel weren't going to be there for about another two hours. Once we got there, we just watched T.V. with David. A co-worker of mine (at that time) called me and said he had some acid for $5 a hit. So, I decided to buy six hits. That's two for me, two for Sean, and two for Franz (another friend of ours that wasn't spending the night at Daniel's house). After purchasing the acid, we drove to Franz's house to drop off his two hits. When we arrived back to Daniel's house, I examined the acid: small, white paper blotter with a red triangle in the middle.
