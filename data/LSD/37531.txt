The night goes well, I had a fantastic time, and was able to sleep soundly when I wanted to. Next morning as I lifted my head off the couch images of the whole room moved along with my eyes. I shook my head, rubbed my eyes, and the first thing I say to myself is 'oh shit.' I've heard of 'permanant' trips happening to people, but I never really knew what that actually meant. I never thought it would happen to me. I had no clue of what was going on with myself. I kept seeing things move, people that weren't really there, objects appearing really close to my face or extreamly far away, colors, what's happening?
