We leave the woods, and I make sure to stop for a second to look up at the stars - I had wanted to lie down, but the grass was very wet. It was a very clear day, and you could see tons of stars. Two things happened to me during that.  At one point, I totally heard a rave that didn't exist going on around there, and sort of had the experience in my head to some degree - definitely auditory hallucinations, and a bit on that chronospatial, but not too much. Also, for the first time I totally understood constellations. I had always been able to pick out the shapes and such, but this time, I was actually able to see the horses, the people up there, superimposed over the stars. That was pretty cool.
