As I had expected, the visuals were not wholly intense at this point, but I noticed that if I stared at certain objects for any length of time, they would bobble and shift slightly. I decided to stretch my tense muscles for a bit and attempt to meditate. After about ten minutes I deemed it a lost cause. I had been easily able to focus on previous mushroom trips, but my current state proved too energetic for me to remain calm.
