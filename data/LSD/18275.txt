When I snapped back to reality I was stunned. I didn't even think experiences like that were possible.. I had the most intensely puzzled look on my face when I snapped back and realized I was just sitting there staring off into space on the desk not looking at them. After this I look at them and notice my friend who took the acid is now laughing hysterically and talking louder and my Russian friend has to tell him to quiet down because itÂ’s late and his mom was trying to relax in her room or something. I can tell he's feeling it and he can tell too and those bong loads probably intensified it for him like it did for me.
