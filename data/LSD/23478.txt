Predictably, New York City drugs are expensive. West recommended one gram for each of us as a threshold dose (both Summer and I are 52 and about 110 lbs., so it typically doesnt take a lot for us to be affected), but his dealers prices would have forced us to spend ti50 on it, which he said wasnt worth it. Earlier on the week, a friend of mine, Remy, had taken shrooms, and was only able to trip on 2g. This would have brought the total of our supposed expenses to $100, which I just could not spend on drugs (yet I have probably already spent it on cigarettes, go figure). West then recommended us just going with acid instead. I was reluctant, since I believed shrooms would have been a better initiation, as they were more natural, and I wasnt too eager to put such harsh chemicals through my body. West claimed it wasnt much of a difference, and that he had started with LSD anyways. That wasnt enough to convince me, since one of Wests go-to catch phrases waking up in the morning was I need to get fucked up before breakfast. Sobriety is overrated. I didnt wish to end up like that, so I checked in with Summer and she was okay with acid instead of shrooms. I was desperate to begin my career as a psychonaut, so I gave in at my best friends request.
