I also know now that going into these states is not about recording what I can of them so that I can explain it all to myself when I come back down. ItÂ’s an awakening of sorts. I come to understand that the ego is something that is birthed from a state of egolessness. So being in the psychedelic moment is to be without the ego. To try to understand is to have the ego present.
