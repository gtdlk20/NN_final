This kind of emotionally bothered my other tripping friend who was still coming up but whatever. The situation would only get more off putting and emotionally striking later down the line he and I just didnt know this. I remember eventually at some point my friend is fully tripping hes just staring at the painting on the wall behind me. It was a rustic relief painting that was actually pretty cool and looked pretty creative and semi appealing at the time and I just for some reason decided to be kind of an asshole and say na..it looks like shit kinda. Just..fake haha and looking back it really didnt but I couldnt help but feel how fake everything man made seemed. The painting and wall seemed very shadowy and alive but also subject to possible distortions. It was a really weird kind of perception.
