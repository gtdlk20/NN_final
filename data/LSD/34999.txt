Then people started shooting off fireworks and I got scared and ran away. After that I had psychic visions of God,Moses, and all religious dietes telling me that I was the chosen one and to lead the enslaves people to The Sea of Tides. I was also felling very happy, the greatest I have ever felt. I smoked my second blunt and thats where the colored trails set in. The were everywhere. Then I started spacing out and I saw a glowing larve come out of a door with a huge eye in the middle. The eye was telling me to join forces with it in the battle against evil. It was weird but also cool.
