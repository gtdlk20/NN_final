I felt extrememly uneasy and anxious almost paranoid.  I decided to get on IRC and talk to some 'experts' I knew.  As indicated by a so-called 'expert' i started watching Tom and Jerry.  My friend started laughing his balls off, while I could only think of how bad it must be to be the little mouse helpless to such a predator as a large cat.  However, again this i believe is only specific to me and furthermore sprouted from an incident that occurred only a month before.  Anyway i felt that what i needed to do was just lay down and relax and listen to some music.  So I got in my bed and realized that it would all be over soon and that i should just enjoy it while i could. So I just relaxed and listened to some Bob Marley and closed my eyes and looked at all the patterns and amazing visuals that I was seeing.  There were so many that I cannot remember them all, however, there are two that stuck out in my mind.  One occurred after my friend had insisted on turning out the lights and turning off the TV.  I was staring at my wall and noticed how it looked almost like liquid, so I decided to touch it and when I did, it rippled and some of the 'liquid' came off on my hand and quickly started engulfing my entire hand, I loved this, it was right out of the matrix.  Another wonderful visual that I experienced was when I suddenly felt this urge to stare at my fingers.  My index and middle finger suddenly turned into cartoon baby blue-jay's.
