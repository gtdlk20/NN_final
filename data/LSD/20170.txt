The conversation was good for a while, but eventually I began to talk without a breath for what seemed like forever. When Dad asked if he could get a word in, I said, 'Just overpower me,' ego full throttle now. Dad snapped back, 'listen to yourself....' Well these three words triggered a hellishly abusive, psychologically damaging, introspective character assassination on myself which I in fact still battle with at times to this day. All of the clarity and joy that had been present since the previous experience, was suddenly replaced with insanity, fear, and a despair that can only be understood by those who have experienced the abyss of darkness induced by a catastrophic trip. Would I ever recover from this? I deserved it didn't I? Who the hell did I think I was? God? ....Well God sure put me in my place that day. The rebuilding, I knew, could take a lifetime.
