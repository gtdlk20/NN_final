I realize how much friendship plays a crucial roll in how I maintain a day to day life - simple things like a chat conversation affect me in so many subtle ways that must built up in some way. It becomes apparent to me music taste is heavily influenced on one's personal tempo. As far as hallucinations go, I visually witnessed the question of whether God exists in my desk, and it's impossible for me to answer with logical thinking. However, do I really think all of this is possible because of chance?
