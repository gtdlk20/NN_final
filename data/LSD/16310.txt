We each made our way then to our respective restrooms.  The men's of course, had no line, while there was a long one in the women's.  I had to wait by the restrooms for Entheogen.  I heard a lot of random noises coming from inside and even at one point got so nervous as to call her cell phone.  She was fine of course.
