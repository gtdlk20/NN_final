My pupils were almost occupying the entire rim of my iris, and one could barely tell what my eye color was. The more I looked through that thin stroke of hazel-brown, the more I penetrated my soul and saw within me.

I could be without my body, because all I needed was clothes and accessories to define my iconography, as opposed to my soul.
