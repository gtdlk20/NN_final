T+3.5 hours: At about the time my friend and her girlfriend arrive we've actually went past the peak and plateaued at a VERY nice medium. The visuals were excellent but we were totally in control, it was as if the acid wasn't even altering are thoughts and we were just happy as hell. We chilled out in my room with my friends and she was telling the most intense stories. She was flailing her arms around and it made the most amazing tracers as anyone who's done acid knows, the tracers with your hands are just awesome. We had an awesome time with them, and we hung outside a bit later. The ants and bugs were awesome to watch as you'd see butterflys and there would be multiple ones (tracers) or ants walking with trails behind them.
