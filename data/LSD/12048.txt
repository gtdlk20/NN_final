It was around this time I wanted to go and relax and enjoy my trip. 'I'm gonna go inside and lay down,' I said. As I walked through the door I noticed Zac's picture. It was an oriental dragon flying through the clouds with some sort of kanji next to it. The dragon looked as if it was coming out of the picture and moving and twisting it's long body through the room as the clouds came out with it. 'Wow,' I said. How something so beautiful can be so bad? The dragon turned towards me and opened its mouth and inside I saw the earth, the room was making noise and the clouds seeping out of the poster started making thunder and lightning, it was so overwhelming. I started to notice that my eyes were burning and I blinked, and it was all gone, and the room was quiet again. The dragon was back in his frame just gliding through the background. 'That was cool.' It was all that I could say, the experience had left me in complete awe. How long had I been standing there I wondered, had my thoughts began to rip the very fabrics of time and space? I knew I was in the thick of it; I'd gone down the rabbit hole and walked through the doors of perception. Now all I could do was take the ride.
