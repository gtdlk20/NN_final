When I managed to tear myself away from that scene, Mike and I went into his housemate's room, which had a ton of psychedelic posters and tie-dyed stuff in it. The posters looked incredible and almost three-dimensional. I then got on the bed, which was a waterbed, and lay on my back, staring at the ceiling. Above me, a huge black-and-orange tie-dyed sheet was draped across the ceiling. This was when the tie-dye lines started coming alive, slowly at first, and then they started hauling ass, going crazy. Mike had put some weird trippy electronic music on earlier, and I screamed for him to turn it off. It sounded menacing.
