After what seemed like eons, we realized dawn was breaking outside and we wanted to go for a stroll.  Up we walked on the slick street behind my house.  The trees were totally encased in ice down to the last twig.  The sun reflecting through this giant prism was unforgettable and amazingly beautiful.  All of a sudden, we heard a loud 'crack', and an enormous tree (70' oak) fell across the street right behind us in slow motion.  The noise and sight were unbelieveable, drugs or no drugs!  We were so awe-struck, that we questioned whether it had really happened or not.  After a minute of playing on the tree, we chose for it to be real.  It entirely blocked the street and narrowly missed crushing two parked cars.  We continued walking.  Sometimes I felt too conspicuous to be outdoors whilst blowing up so hard.  I thought that I was throwing up my insides and turning back out in a continuous cycle of mental v physical awareness.  It proceeded like a hollow, flexible and crystalline cylinder at light speed through the universe...continuously rolling and sliding in impossibly complex patterns, such was my consciousness.  The meditation was intense and beautiful.
