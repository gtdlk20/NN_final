12:00- This is where things got interesting. In a split second, the acid just overtook my mind, kind of like a wave crashing down on the shore. I closed my eyes and saw my first acid CEV. It was 3d red and yellow squares moving in opposite directions. Suddenly they parted and a smiling sun came out from between them. Its expression comforted me and its sun rays washed a warm and comforting light over me. I fell back on the couch and looked at the ceiling. It turned 3D and started morphing into kaleidoscopic patterns. I was amazed! It felt like I had a car battery hooked up to my spine and felt waves of electricity pulsing through my whole body. I still had the acid in my mouth so I swallowed it and started laughing like a maniac. I got up and ran into the bathroom to look in the mirror. Now, if I had never tripped before, this probably would have freaked me out. But it was awesome! I looked like an alien, my pupils were HUGE, and my face kept morphing and changing shape. I stared in the mirror for a while.
