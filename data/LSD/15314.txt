I woke up the next morning at 6:45, just like every other Saturday morning to prepare for work. I took a shower, made breakfast, and got in my car almost forgetting the two magical pieces of paper wrapped in aluminum foil in my wallet. I put the LSD on my tongue on the way to work, knowing it wouldnt kick in for about another half hour or so. Luckily there was another guy opening in the kitchen with me so it wouldnt be too ridiculously busy. I took care of a few things that needed to be done before anything, like sweeping the parking lot and stocking up on all of the toppings for the day. Then came time to roll out dough. This is usually an easy task, but this was not a usual morning. The LSD had started to take effect.
