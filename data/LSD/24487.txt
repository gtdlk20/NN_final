By the time we got to the festival area we were both starting to feel very upbeat and giggly. After walking all the way there we sat in the grass near one of the stages and waited for the show to start while we checked out the schedule and planned our day. We cracked some jokes and were laughing really hard. When the show started, we went up to the front. The band was awesome and it felt great to move to the music.
