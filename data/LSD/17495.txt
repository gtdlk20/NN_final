So now that I'm done preaching, I'll get into the experience.  Me and my friend were bored one night, and put 10 dollars down on a bottle of liquor before coming home, with the intention of getting pleasantly inebriated and laughing at the television.  Well, this changed when a certain friend showed up with a vial of LSD.  Interested in jumping down the psychedelic waterfall, we got our money back on the alcohol and bought a hit for each of us, which was dropped on our tongue.  We quickly drove home, wary of drug effects hitting us while I was driving, and started to buzz a little as we arrived at my house. The effects I had experienced many times before had hit my brain, and we spent the next 6 hours or so laughing like idiots, smoking cigarettes and generally having a good time just looking at the curtains and house plants gently swaying in wind that wasn't there.  About 7 hours into our trip, we figured the experience was pretty much over, and sat down to watch a movie.  We couldn't have been more mistaken.  At one instant, my friend was flashing the lights on and off, and I was laughing.  The next instant, all hell broke loose in my mind.  It was as if the switch that controls my perception of reality was yanked out of my brain.  It must have both hit us at the same time, because suddenly my friend wasn't smiling anymore...he had the look that an infant must have on his face the first time he experiences a thunderstorm -fear and wonder.  The conversation that took place at this moment will shed some light on our state of mind..
