About 16:00 next day I came home, threw my clothes on the floor, turned on video of guided meditation by Alan Watts and went into a meditation that lasted until 22:00. Then I ate some rice, checked my email and went to sleep, smiling at my future and being so intrigued of what will happen after I die. I knew that the best part is ahead.
