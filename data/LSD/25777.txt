11.00pm the prospect of being out at this time when the pubs were being turned out was terrifying we couldnt get my bag from jacks house because he wouldn't let us go back for fear of his parents we decided to go back to petes after a very pointless walk,still, the tracers were interesting. It was at this point when dave decided to talk for the first time it was quite relieving to hear his voice cos I was beginning to think he was braindead he said he was having a real bad trip and I told him to remember that it was only down to the drugs why he felt like this I told him to let it all go again (sounding like a damn broken lp) and he simply just looked confused there was no getting through to this boy, although someone on acid trying to explain their thoughts to another person on acid is the most futile thing ever. We ended up at petes house again after walking what felt like miles and miles (actual distance - 1/2 mile)
