I remember they were talking about something and laughing but I wasn't paying attention to them. I was just being high on acid laughing at random things, laughing at essentially nothing really and then they see me laughing and they I guess were talking about some kind of inside joke or something that happened to just them and they thought I was laughing with them just to be cool or something even though I wasn't even listening or paying attention to them I was just laughing at nothing because I was on acid and they tried talking shit haha. I don't know how they forgot I was on acid and that people who are tripping are obviously going to laugh at nothing and I wasn't even listening to their conversation anyways but this didn't occur to them. Not sure if I have explained it to them or not but it just really sort of annoyed me. My Russian friend was actually doing that the whole night, he kept treating us like we weren't on anything or like he somehow forgot that we were tripping. He even mentioned at some point that he forgot. It's probably because everyone who was there was pretty much just experienced with and knowledgable about psilocybin mushrooms and they all take that drug fairly seriously, it seems that it was both of them but now it's just my Russian friend who didn't take acid too seriously.
