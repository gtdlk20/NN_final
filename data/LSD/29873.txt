Around 10:45 we head inside after the cig and go to Zee's room. Zee's room is full of vibrant colors so this was amazing. Ally and I just layed on the floor staring at everything in amazement. We kept on staring at the rug on the floor that had streets all over it like a little kids play rug. The roads were moving all over the place and the tracers were intense. The euphoria was kicking in to high gear and we were both happier than ever. I knew what was going on and what to expect so I wasn't sayin much about the hallucinations. Ally kept talking about the roads on the rug and how they are moving. After awhile I was finishing her sentences. She would start saying 'Just look at how they..' and I would end with 'Dude I know.'
