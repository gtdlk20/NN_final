The next day was a bit hazy, and contrasts were enhanced, but otherwise I felt great. For that matter, I felt as if I had been somehow enhanced spiritually by the experience. Whether it was the moon nugget hunt, or the magical exploding wall, I couldn't be sure. One thing, though, I WAS sure of. Next time, I'm trying it at a rave. Should be interesting.
