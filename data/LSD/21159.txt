When I got back to my house, I went to my backyard clubhouse with my friends and smoked a bowl.  Marijuana obviously potentiates the hallucinogenic effects of LSD, because before I smoked, I really didn't see anything...but afterwards, the wood-paneled walls were swirling like plasma, with little spots of lights on them in rapidly changing colors.
