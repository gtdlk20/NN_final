Actually I think it was my second time doing cocaine that I was thinking of..ya it was my second time and it was when I was sniffing really pure coke at the lake. I imagined in my head or felt like I was there again somehow in THIS acid trip like I began to see or imagine all those tall trees around me again like I was in that certain part of the lake again on that day. It was like I was reliving the experience and feeling like I was in 2 places at one. Since the coke was so pure that day it so absolutely reeked like diesel way more than the average coke and the vivd memory (flashback) of it going up my nose or what it was like to go up my nose was so intense I felt like I could smell it in my nose at that moment quite clearly and feel it so grotesquely and vividly and I didnt like it, it was a disappointed vulgar feeling attached to it and it was all while feeling this really deep complex state of mind where I had no sense of self importance whatsoever and I felt very emotionally vulnerable. I started thinking about how hard drugs like that are so awful and so cringy in this egoless and disclosing psychedelic mindset I was in. I was thinking about how absolutely terrible and disgusting poisonousness drugs like alcohol, cocaine, meth and heroin are and I at the time couldnt understand why people did that stuff in the first place. It all seemed so vulgar and so toxic and unnecessary. It felt like those kinds of fucked up drugs and activities only distracted people from the bigger more beautiful picture and took them farther away from what was actually real.
