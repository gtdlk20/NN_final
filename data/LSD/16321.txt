The effects began within about half an hour--I was giggly and high-feeling. We were watching 'Team America,' and I was laughing myself to tears. Within an hour of taking the acid, I was beginning to trip. The signs of an oncoming trip were by now familiar to me--a vague purplish tint to everything, shadows that grew, moved, breathed, and generally crept about in ways that shadows shouldn't. It was time, my roommate Kate decided, for a run to get a sandwich (for her) and cigarettes (for me). My hallucinations were quickly becoming much more intense than anything I'd ever experienced; putting on makeup before going out became a 30-minute adventure I'm not even going to bother trying to describe. When we finally made it to the convenience store (let's not give out names here), I was beginning to peak--and this peak lasted hours.
