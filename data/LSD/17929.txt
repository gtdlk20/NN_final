This helped a lot, and it inspired me to call a friend. I don't think I outright asked for help, but she spoke to me very plainly, asking what was going on. I explained I had taken the acid her friends had sold me and I was very confused and scared and ... But suddenly, the most interesting thing happened. As I tried to explain what was happening, I tried to find a center or a problem or a locus of my experience, and I could not find it at all. It was as if a great space had just become apparent. I still felt quite high, but I had to conclude that absolutely nothing weird was happening. I had taken this drug, and, moments ago, I had been completely delirious, but now it seemed as if there was nothing but a kind of dumbfounded responsiveness. It was all happening and yet nothing was happening. It was all happening and yet nothing was happening.
