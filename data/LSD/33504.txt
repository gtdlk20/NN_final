I have now been driving on the highway for about fifteen minutes.  Spencer pulls out the blunt I rolled earlier and we smoke it.  The blunt hits very harsh, there is more paper than marijuana and I'm slightly disappointed.  The blunt gets me pretty high nevertheless and the drive becomes much more enjoyable.  I even turn up the music and giggle a little bit.  I feel very excited and hopeful about the day that's about to happen.
