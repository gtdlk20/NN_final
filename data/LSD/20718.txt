The best part of the trip was how it opened my eyes to the world around me...and I felt the goddess in everything, including myself, and I saw the god in my fiance, he WAS the god, and I WAS the goddess.... it was like playing make believe... I was, for the first time since childhood, filled with complete awe and wonder.... everything went well until my stomach started to feel kind of cramped so I went and got a bath... and the walls started to melt and it kind of freaked me out... being inside really got me down.... we spent the rest of the trip laying in bed, watching the ceiling, trying to go to sleep... he came down about 10 in the morning, but I wasn't back to relative normalcy until about 24 hour after I took the acid.....
