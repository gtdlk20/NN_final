Bill's car stereo is one of the best I have ever heard.  When it's turned up and the windows rolled down you can hear it from literally miles away, we were fortunate to have it with us that night.  As we were listening to DJ Dan while acending deeper into the forest and farther from the rest of the world we decided to pull over and explore.  The moon was full, and the entire forest was ours, it might as well have been some beautiful new green planet we were on.  We found ourselves in a little valley with a stream in the middle and forrested mountains on two sides, with the sky clear and every star shining.  Marcus and I decided to take a walk down to the stream while Bill and Jamal broke some new glowsticks and danced in the middle of the road.  After several hours (or minutes?  you can never tell on this drug) I was thinking that there couldn't be another human within 20 miles of where we were.  Right as I converted this thought into words, a car drove by, saw the glowsticks, hit the brakes and turned around and stopped.
