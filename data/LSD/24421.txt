After the garden detour, S became very freaked and said he couldn't go on, we alerted the group to this fact and said we needed a chill-out point. We sat on the grass for a few moments but I still felt on top of the world, a little freaked by S, I guess I thought it could happen to me shortly too. During the next half hour I walked with all non-trippers to several other exhibitions. Some animals I felt a strong connection with, such as the elephants. Several exhibited a coloured glow and I thought how pleasant this primeval existence would be. I trailed the group and reflected on several things regarding our behavior to animals. Somewhere around this point I decided I really have to visit africa at some stage in my life. A forced people to visit the african exhibit with me and the meer cats were wonderous. Their behavioural patterns changed so quickly and they seemed as content as I. They quickly moved from digging to play fighting, to sleeping. The ground around them and everywhere was starting to swirl quite vigorously at this point, it was getting very intense. I could feel my senses starting to merge, light, sound, touch, hearing, smell and for all of them starting to intensify. I tried to follow people through the nocturnal house but after 5 steps I became terrified and fell to the floor. I couldn't see anything at all, everywhere was black and it felt like I was stuck in a box full of mirrors. My friend had to lead me crawling out, I felt like a bit of a fool seeing other visitors coming in the entrance. Things were definitely starting to heat up.
