Sometime thereafter I was flooded with massive, reveletory perceptions of 'eternal cosmic well-being' and began laughing uncontrollably and blurting out things like 'It's okay!!!  Everythings going to be okay!!!' etc etc.  At this point my roomate emerged and was upset as he claimed I was very loud and so he couldn't sleep.  Finally I managed to get a semblance of a grip on myself and promised to keep quiet.  This was nearly impossible and so I resorted to hiding behind the couch and smothering my laughter with a pillow.
