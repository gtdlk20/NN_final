When the band arrived on stage and launched into the first few songs I remember thinking that whoever had made this batch of acid had done so with this very concert in mind.  The music, the lights and the crowd seemed to gel into one unseperable and ever changing entity.  I was entirely overwhelmed (in a good way) by the whole experience!  The concert seemed to go on for ever, encore after beautiful encore.  By the end of the show I was almost in a trance, standing almost completely still among a crowd of 40,000 feeling the music, the lights and the acid wash over, through and around me.  A strong trip - yes.  But certainly a good one!!
