Well last night it was cold and rainy. I was alone, just broken up with my girlfriend. I was sad, very depressed.... Not only beecause we broke up, but it was also glomy and rainy out. Well I had a few of these pills left from a party this past weekend. They are double stacked yello gators. Now I would never roll alone, but I was in a terrible mood and E has always lifted me up to a happy mood.
