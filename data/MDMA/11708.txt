My nausea disappeared, and D and I started caressing each other. We took our time, slowly touching each others skin in a careful manner. It felt heavenly, as if my sensibility had grown exponentially. We eventually started making out, for many songs, enjoying every second of that magical feeling. We knew we shouldnt have any sexual expectations in a situation like this because MDMA usually causes erectile dysfunction. But everything felt perfect, and D decided to go down on me. I dont think I can remember any situation were I felt any closer to the highest realm of pleasure. It was amazing, it felt like forever. Eventually we started having sex, in a slow tempo. D said that even though he wasnt able to finish, he felt incredible during the performance. He also mentioned that his penis felt weird, like rubber, although still firm. Meanwhile, I was in heaven. After this, it started pouring outside. Lightning could be seen through the curtains at the windows. It also roared with thunder. We were suddenly immersed in another world, in a cabin in the tropical forest. The music melted with the natural sounds.
