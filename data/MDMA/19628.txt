Our high lasted about 6 hours, hers going well into daylight because she started so late in comparison. The short time my girlfriend and I shared under the MDMA shaped the beginnings of this relationship in a very loving and caring way, and it has been a very strong aftermath. I have yet to take any more MDMA or do any other substances to date, but I plan on rolling with my (now) girlfriend in a private setting sometime soon so that we may continue what started that night privately. As for my best friend, he was able to tell me how much of a friend I was, and I was able to see that I had been neglecting his friendship over the past couple of months, and Ecstasy helped me reforge my bond with him.
