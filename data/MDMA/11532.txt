I just wanted to revisit my last experience report and share some new insights with you all.  Since taking E back in September, I've been diagnosed with a slightly overactive thyroid. That's what's been causing my heart palpitations. I was told that stimulants of any kind, coffee, chocolate, and especially E should be avoided.  Hence, my wild night alone was really due to my condition (which I had no clue about at the time!) being overly stimulated by the E. I was placed on a beta-blocker, atenolol, to take care of the palps.
