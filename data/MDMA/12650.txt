I had one pill left at this point and my friend had left the class to go to a doctorÂ’s appointment. Since when I had taken only one pill earlier it  hadn't done as much as I would have liked  it too I decided to swallow this fourth and last pill. By the time school ended at 3:20 my whole body felt great and I couldn't help but smile at everybody. I had half and hour to get to work and it usually takes me 40 minutes to walk to work, but today it only took me 30 minutes and in this time I smoked 3 cigarettes on the way, had a coffee, and stopped to buy food. I was amazed at how little time it had taken me to get there.
