3 hours later that I took the pill, I could realize that that effect was coming down, but I was still able to enjoy it. I could realize that that effect was coming down, but I was still able to enjoy it. 30 minutes later, my legs and back started to feel tired because of all the dancing and it was the sign to leave the party and go rest. When we got at our house I noticed that I could sleep normally if I wanted, but my friends said that smoking marijuana was good for relaxing more and it also combines well, so I did it too, then I slept easily. The day after I was very tired (it was very nice to stay resting in the bed) but happy with the experience. Therefore, summarizing, my first experience with ecstasy was incredible, with no collateral effects at all, not even increased heart rate.
