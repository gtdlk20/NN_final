My girlfriend and I each had one roll, and we took pretty pictures of it on our tongues and such, until we crushed them on a glass table and wrapped them into parachutes (using toilet paper). I left a line of the crushed powder out so I would be able to take it intranasally later. My girlfriend decided to follow suit, and we took the parachutes.
