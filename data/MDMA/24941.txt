this was one hilarious experience I never wanted to have again.  i knew my moments in the secret theater to be very true, but understood how it might have scared the people who observed. I made a promise that I'd go home and do my homework, and that I'd never be a homeless druggy.  I had decided on living an appearingly 'normal' life.  like the RENDAN that Hakim Bey had wrote about.  i wanted to be who i was, but i did not want to alarm the others.  so i would follow their rules, while the entire time undermining them.
