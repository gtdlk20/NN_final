Well I left a few hours lated, very sad, yet happy at the same time.  We saw each other again and it was awsome, we both still felt the same way.  However now it's all messed up.  We go to different colleges and haven't seen each other for a long time.  We still talk sometimes, but don't know what to do.  This is where E can cause confusion.  However I still wouldn't trade that night for anything!
