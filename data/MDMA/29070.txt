Now its about 6:30pm and Im wondering why they were letting people in yet, since the event started at 7pm, and the opening act from was supposed to be amazing. A homeless black guy was pushing through the crowd saying Hash and Opium, trying to make a quick buck off some gullible e-tard. Everyones smoking cigarettes, some weed. The predominant age group of everyone I say was about 17-20, a lot of younger than one might expect. The line has barely moved. Some people are rolling. This one girl was walking up and talking to random people, while feeling herself and having involuntary jaw movements/teeth grinding (total signs of being on ecstasy). She even came up to my sister and complimented her hair, which is ironic because my sister was complaining about how bad her hair looked the whole day. Another guy was standing close to us, stomping his feet and chewing his gum fiercely. We could hear the rushing bass on the other side of fence and eagerly wanted to get through the gates.
