Upon the offer of a friend of mine, I had decided to take the plunge and try MDMA with three friends: one had about 5 prior experiences, another had just rolled for the first time two weeks earlier, and the third was my ex-girlfriend (ex at the time of rolling, as well) who had once before taken MDMA which, according to her, resulted in a horrific experience.
