Among the many party accessories that we had was a glowing dolphin - you'd press a button and he would start to glow in different colours (red, blue, green). My friend started playing with the dolphin, moving him up and down gently in the way that a dolphin swims, and we were drawn to it like flies to light. It was so captivating; the different lights almost magnetised to our eyes and we felt like it was magical. I (very, very, very sadly) dropped it, and it was an EXTREMELY depressing moment for a few seconds, I felt like crying because of the strong bond that I had made with the dolphin for the past 5 mins (I'd been kissing the dolphin and raising it as my own together with my friends B, T, another T I guess and L). However, L put the parts together, and although it didn't stay, we put the dolphin (Augustus) in his bag and carried him around with us, telling each other that he would live on in our hearts. This put me back in the amazing mood that I was in, and we couldn't get out of it.
