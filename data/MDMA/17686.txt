After a while I went back inside and started to dancing to the music. It took about 45 mins before I felt a slight tingling of the legs, which I supposed was the first effects of the substance. The onset was slow and steady (I have been told commercial E comes on much faster due to the impurities and other substances which are often in the pills) and almost without noticing I began to feel better. My tiredness started to fade and I began to feel very happy. It wasnÂ’t so much euphoria I experienced, as a feeling of being carefree. I enjoyed talking to my friends and having a good time, and really entered into a state of enjoying to dance to the music, losing interest in what other people might think of me. The (for me) usual bit of anxiety associated with parties with many people and dancing fell away.
