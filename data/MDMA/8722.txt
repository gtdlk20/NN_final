When we got to the rave, which was located at this huge indoor theme park called the Funplex, we met up with Hs sort-of boyfriend, D, and some of his friends. They were drunk and already dancing around a little. I was determined to have a good night sober, despite all the setbacks. I wandered around and was jammin a bit, but wasnt much into it. I decided to try and get some molly right there, asking around a bit. I finally ran into a guy who said he could get me a capsule. I know its dangerous to get drugs from random strangers, but I had a good feeling about the guy. He was rolling himself and told me that he was determined that I would have a good time to. He took me to this room where there was a rollerskating rink and I purchase a white capsule for $20 from his friend. I didnt want to spend that much, but I was willing to pay it with no other alternative. I immediately swallowed the pill.
