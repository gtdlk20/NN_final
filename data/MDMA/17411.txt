By the time we drove back it was starting to get a little light outside and we gathered in the living room and talked as the sun rose. When it was fully morning some of us were starting to come down, so we decided to smoke another few bowls, having heard that being high makes your roll get its strength back. I have to say it worked pretty well; I was rolling pretty hard for the next three hours after. At about two in the afternoon, (13 full hours later!) I left the house and returned to my own home. It might have just been the weed, but I was still feeling the effects of the Ecstasy, they were just weaker than before. I went to work around five, still a little E-tarded and running on zero hours of sleep. Thanks to two judiciously timed cans of Rockstar, I made it through my shift fairly easily and without incident. I went to sleep and woke up nine hours later feeling absolutely amazing. I didnÂ’t believe I was still rolling, but it sure felt like it.
