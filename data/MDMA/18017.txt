Eventually we all left and I endured more stoney silence in the taxi with them.  I was relieved to get home and find my Dad still up.  He'd not only taken another E, he was also drinking beer and smoking cannabis.  My brother came down to see me although he should really have been asleep.  My mum woke up as well and came to talk to us for a bit.  Then they went back upstairs and I sat with my Dad.  He seemed quite mellow and I was feeling a bit low after the terrible club experience, so we were content to sit talking, listening to good music and watching random TV on mute.  He offered me some beer but I don't like to mix things and opted for some apple juice.
