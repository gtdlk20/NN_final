12:20 PM  I reached a point from this little 20min mini-trip where it got so strong, that I began to almost worry.  Keep in mind though, this was not a panicky, anxious worry at all.  Just more of like an oh my gosh...what is happening to me right now/this is way overwhelming.  I immediately looked at my friend (who the pill hadn't fully hit yet) and said, 'umm, I think I need to go outside'...so we worked our way outside, and immediately I felt better, back to a more manageable coherent rolling state.   I was so blown away at what had just happened for the last 20 minutes...it was incredible.
