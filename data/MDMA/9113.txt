 C and I then agreed to take a shower, because showers are quite nice on comedowns. When we were in the bathroom, though, we could not figure out how to turn the shower faucet on, we could only have the lower spout running. The shower was rather old-school and was quite foreign to us. We sat down and the slowly raising water felt incredible. After a little bit though C announces, I think Im burning. She stands up and her lower half is a bit red. Holy crap! Yeah, turn it down a bit I replied. That is one of the downsides I mentioned earlier: its harder to feel pain when on MDMA, so its easier to get hurt/burnt/etc. I turned off the normal lights and brought in the glow toys. C and me sat and enjoyed each others company in the bath. It was at this point where more epiphanies began to occur.
