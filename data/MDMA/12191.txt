I have used ecstasy many times in the past eighteen months, each time is different, absorbing, and magical. This particular night found me and my two best friends (T & C) alone together in our town, ready for anything. I remained sober for the beginning of our night while the other two drank quite a bit of alcohol. To this day I believe alcohol diminishes the effects of E, and wouldnÂ’t recommend it at all. At 12.30am we all dropped together. The usual chemical taste settled on my tongue as I quickly downed a glass of water. We three girls always drop together in the same way ('one, two, three swallow') then we wait to come on.
