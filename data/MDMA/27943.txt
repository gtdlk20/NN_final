It took about a half hour/ 40 min. Until I was suddenly hit, like a fucking brick wall crashing on my head. I turned around I was completely in a daze, the room seemed brighter and yet their was this very light fog or mist all around. Then the waves came, it's hard to describe it but it's kind of like when I am on a roller coaster just before that big fall and my stomach feels completely empty and light as a feather and then whooosh! My entire body had these wonderful rolling sensations all over, like someone was taking a feather and just lightly taking it up and down. My mind had never felt this way! At first, I was overwhelmed but I soon was in heaven, nothing could worsen my mood, after a few minutes school was out and I preceeded outside with my friend.
