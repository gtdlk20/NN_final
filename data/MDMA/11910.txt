I think what happened was a massive serotonin deficit, which is why it had felt so similar to the experience of withdrawing from antidepressants. The fact I had done MDMA several days in a row, and then such a huge dose on the final night, definitely compounded this. I am not sure why I was so affected on this particular occasion, when I had done similar quantities in the past with no ill effects, but it may be related to my older age (Im in my early 30s now, whereas most of my heavier drug use was in my early/mid twenties) and the fact I hadnt been doing substances regularly at all in the years preceding it. What I have learned from this is that I am going to refrain from doing MDMA multiple nights in a row from now on What I have learned from this is that I am going to refrain from doing MDMA multiple nights in a row from now on, and I am going to have more restraint in terms of redosing throughout a night-I definitely, definitely, didnt need those extra finger dips or bumps I took after midnight, I was just doing it because it was there and offered to me.
