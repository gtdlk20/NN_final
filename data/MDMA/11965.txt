A friend and I took it.  I was warned that I would make me weak in the knees and dehydrated.  We went in a big group to the concert but only 2 of us took it.  I took it about 20 minutes before the concert started.  I found a friend from highschool in the crowd and smoked a spliff with him as the band did a great rendition of Cop Shoot Cop.  The show was going to be amazing, I knew this even before the drug began to kick in.  The first thing I noticed that changed was that I began to blink rapidly, almost with the rhythm.  I was bouncing my hand off my thigh with the rhythm as well.  Then I saw spots from the lights, they looked like leopard spots and they danced among the blinking lights, I don't know if the blinking came from the stage or from my eyes, but those spots were dancing.
