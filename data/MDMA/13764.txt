Anyway, the worst was yet to come.  I was standing there with my buddy admist a crowd of euphoric ravers when all of a sudden, the lights came on and the music stopped.  I can't describe the feeling I had at the time when I looked around at a bunch of clueless individuals being harrased by an onslaught of cops.  I was sitting down and smoking a cigarette when a cop scared the hell out of my buddy and I into leaving the venue.  We had no idea what to do nor where to go...so we just followed the crowd.  I was still tripping pretty hard when we met a really cool couple and decided to follow them since they knew what was going on.  It didn't occur to me that something was different about this *e* until I tried to converse with the others.  It was a struggle to get all the words out of my mouth for a sentence.  I wasn't sure if anyone else coulld tell, but it really struck me when the couple said they had taken the 'pure loves' as well.  They were really knowledgable ravers and extremely nice people, but it scared the hell out of me when I saw their reaction to my response of how many hits we had taken.  They had only taken a half tab each and appeared to be rolling pretty hard.
