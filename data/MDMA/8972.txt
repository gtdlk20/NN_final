I began researching the MDMA vault on a reputable website, weighing all the pros and cons and learning about all the preventative measures one should take when using E responsibly. Of particular importance was the Peter Jennings ABC News documentary Ecstasy Rising. I watched it on YouTube and found it to dispel a lot of myths that I had unfortunately swallowed as fact a long time ago. Based on that program, and the countless positive experience reports, I decided that E might not be as bad as everyone thinks it is. In fact, it seemed to me that the only people who reported bad experiences with the drug were using it completely irresponsibly anyway, combing large doses with alcohol and pot and any number of other drugs. Conversely, those who took solely MDMA in the right dosage and stayed safe reported amazing effects. I decided that I would try it.
