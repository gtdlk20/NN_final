My first experience with MDMA was spontaneous and unplanned.  It was a beautiful and sunny Saturday in August, and I was over at my friend DÂ’s house.  D had thrown a small party the last night (that I had unfortunately been unable to attend), and most of my best friends were there, albeit very hungover.
