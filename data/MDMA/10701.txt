Then it was the end.  As always I felt like it couldn't possibly have been long enough.  I marvelled at how my back and shoulders didn't hurt at all after standing so long.  We left the venue and walked back up the road, enthusing about the gig.  I still felt very high and tried to persuade my Dad to come clubbing with me.  He wouldn't, so I made arrangements to meet my friend and her sisters at some random club they were in.  We got back to the house and I changed out of my sweaty clothes into something better for clubbing.
