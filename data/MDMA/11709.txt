The feeling of relaxation was extreme. I thought IÂ’d probably like to dance and jump like I did in other rolls, but this was totally different. My body felt heavy, but soft and beautiful. At about 2.30 am, we did a redose of 50 mg each. All the feelings I mentioned before became exacerbated in about ten minutes. Also, my head started to hurt, and this headache became stronger quickly. I decided to take 500mg naproxen and laid down. I remained in a conscious state similar to the wake-sleep limbo, and the pain went away.
