It makes me wonder... What if we could feel this way all the time? Imagine the love, the freindship, the things we would get done. The confidence you feel with this drug is crazy. It literally makes you feel as if you had just won 10 million dollars. That warm funny feeling of happiness you get in your stomach when your getting married, going to pick up your new car, and the jittery anticipation you get when trying to sleep on Chritmas eve.. I have seen the light with this drug, and have thus posed the question: 'If it is possible to have these feelings, and feel these riviting emotions, why must we as humans rely on a pill for this. If we could feel this way, why do we feel normal, Why instead of feeling simply normal, can't we feel this great? Why do we have to experience the depression and pitfalls of our minds, if it is possible to feel this much more free. Imagine if everyone felt like they were rolling. Imagine all the worlds people with those kind of boosted feelings. Everyone happy, everyone confident, everyone loving. Imagine. It is possible, it is real. It's the mixing of chemicals in our brains. And because of this, I hope someday medical science finds a way to induce this feeling without causeing harm to the body. And when it is found, we, the people, will take this world to heights never before imagined. For you see, when your on 'E' anything is possible.
