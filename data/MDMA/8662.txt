As the relative intensity decrescendos I find it less important to keep detailed notes.  I am simply repeating myself and not gleaning any new perspectives.  I continue to talk with Jean-Ralphio until he leaves to attend a night class.   I have no appetite or strong desire for social interaction outside of my close friends.  Based on this, I decide to not go out for dinner and opt instead for mild conversation and a beer with one of my good mates (who also lives in this house) who has arrived home.
