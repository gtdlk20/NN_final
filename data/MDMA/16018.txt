On the day of the festival we arrived at my friend's house and before leaving our dealer cancelled on us, leading us to get all depressed. Although we knew the risk that we were going to take, we decided that as we had looked forward to this for so long, we would try and get some MDMA in the festival.  We have already bought some reliable, tested molly for our next roll.
