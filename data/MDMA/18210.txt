Sure, there were some ups and downs. But it happens  I think it can be part of the experience, if only to teach resistance to negative thoughts and feel positive about the smaller negative things in life. Ecstasy can teach me so much about how to be myself. How to relax and not focus on smaller negatives. How to consciously change my outlook on things if I apply what I experienced to how I live my life. That doesnt mean that I can be happy with the flick of a switch, but my attitude can simply prevail over certain situations.
