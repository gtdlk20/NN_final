45 minutes later, while out on the dance floor, the feeling of euphoria took over me and I was hearing the thumping club music on a whole new level.  I had been dancing with a group of guys who were already tweaking and I was now on their level.  We danced hard, rubbed each other and kissed.  It suddenly dawned on me that just about everyone in the club was on E!  I couldn't remember a better time dancing and every song was my favorite song for the 7 minutes it was on.
