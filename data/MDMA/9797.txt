        Damn! A lot more time passed than I expected. Almost half an hour since I turned out the lights. I've been in my peak for a while. Laying in bed, I was having a pretty entactogenic trip. I thought about alot of mundane things, examining a lot of things going on in my life right now, nothing that's unusually interesting. Eventually it shifted into thoughts about various women in my life, mostly ones from long ago, and oddly, a lot of them girls I never had any real romantic interest in (consciously at least). MDMA has a very feminine nature, so I guess its only natural... Anyway, I'm not looking for an entactogenic trip, so I got up and turned on the lights.
