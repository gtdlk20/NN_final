Cannabis evokes new psychedelia. Earlier was extremely introspective and euphoric, but it wasn't "trippy" - vision was brighter, sound was louder and clearer with a hint of extra-dimensionality, but remained subtle. Vision is now more vibrant, time is noticeably dilating in a way reminiscent of the "waves" of a psilocybin comedown.
