I tried writing about my first experience with Ecstasy in my diary, but I think I left it too long and some of the memories had faded.  This time, I want to record everything I can remember while it's still fresh!  So it's the day after, and I'm sitting at my pc chilling out with some Zero 7 on the stereo.  As with my first time on E, my 'supplier' was my Dad.  Perhaps this is a bit strange, but my parents have vast experience with recreational drugs compared to me.  Virtually no one else I know does anything more than smoke cannabis.  Also I can trust my parents to give me the good stuff - as they know what they're doing and have already tried some of the batch.
