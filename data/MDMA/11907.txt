On Thursday, my symptoms started to marginally improve, although I had a new weird headache far back in my head behind both ears. I managed to leave the house for a short while to pick up some 5 HTP, Magnesium, and some Vitamin C, which I immediately started taking (200 mg of 5 HTP). I was still feeling exceptionally dizzy/had the intense brain zap effect whenever I tried to move too quickly, and l had the ringing in my ears, but was feeling less nauseous. I still felt extremely tired and was out of breath just from walking around the store. I still spent most of this day in bed as well.
