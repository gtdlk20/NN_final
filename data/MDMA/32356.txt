After regaining composure, sort of, I opened my eyes again held my knees close, blocked out the voices, and actually enjoyed the hilarity of what I was watching even though I was shaking and kind of freaking out as the e was coming on stronger. Then the voices of my fellow rollers starting to get to my high and I definitely felt like I had to vom, but I felt like I had control over it. I just went downstairs and vomited in the toilet down there (which is what happens basically at the beginning of whenever I roll) and felt better. When I came back upstairs I felt like they were on my level and we all chilled in the dark with the computer playing music and watching the screen. We'd drink water ritually and made sure to do everything together at the same time, and make sure we were all feeling good and were comfortable, but it really just felt like we were all freaking out and I wish it could've been more chill. When we came down from the e we took some sedatives to make it less painful, but the morale of the group then plummeted and the other people I was rollin with were miserable and it bummed me out big time. I just wanted to be alone.
