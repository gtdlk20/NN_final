We waited in the line up for a good twenty minutes before the door man finally let us in.  We got through the security search, turned the corner and WOW............. There I was, what seemed like a wave of bodies dancing infront of me.  The music was superb, the place was packed with beautiful people just dancing the night away.  The lights were flashing, lasers were beaming in all colours and in all directions and the place was just setting off such a wonderful, friendly vibe.  I looked at my watch and it was nearly 2:00am.  I have dropped the pill nearly an hour ago and still I felt nothing.  I waited another twenty minutes or so, and I slowly began to lose hopes for a buzz of any sort...This was just not going to happen...or was it?  I am usually really tired after a 12 hour restaurant shift but for some reason I was wide awake and my energy seemed to have increased. No, it's all in my head I thought.  Slowly I excused myself from my friends and decided to head to the patio for some relief from the heat.  The place was so packed that it took about a minute to travel a 10 meter distance.  I finally got to the patio and KABOOOOM!!!!!  I suddenly began to feel an incredably warm feeling coming from withing my body.  My skin began to tingle, my mind became clearer than ever, and everything was happening so fast! I have never felt better in my entire life! I felt as if I weighed no more than ten pounds. I did not even care that my friends were all inside.  I was happy. I was happy where I was, just the way I was.  It was great. Trying to cope with all these uplifting changes in my mood and my body I leaned beside the bar in order to analyze this type of high.  As I stood there, nodding my head to the music which now sounded even better, I began to feel dehydrated.
