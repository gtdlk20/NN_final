I again said that my other friends who had taken the E with me could not be left alone, and I said that I would go into the bathroom to wash my face and maybe that would make me feel better. I went into the bathroom and tried to urinate but could not bring myself to stand still in front of the urinal. So I stopped tryin, then I went and splashed water on my face.  I then looked in the mirror and when I looked in the mirror the water was drippin off my face but I thought that it was my skin. This is when I realized that what I had taken could have been E mixed with something else.
