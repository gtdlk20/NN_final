Eventually the peak of my XTC wore off and I was suddenly annoyed with having all these people in MY house.  They suddenly became annoying little flies that had to be shooed away. So I kicked them all out except for my boyfriend. After they all left, excluding my boyfriend, I felt much better and was even beginging to feel euphoric again. He and I engaged in oral, vaginal, and anal sex for about four to five hours, something never done before.
