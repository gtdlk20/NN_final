The first thing my sister and I do is light a menthol cigarette and look around. Such a crazy atmosphere. Walking through the entrance was like stepping into a whole new world, especially from standing in line right outside for 5 hours. Everyone you see is on ecstasy, or whatever preferred substance, but most likely ecstasy. I see people dancing intensely, horribly in fact, but no one cares. People are just feeling the music and dancing freely by themselves. Other people are sitting on the ground getting light shows, some massaging each other, some just totally zoned out. The music at this point is sounding so intense and amazing I cant but help but put my arms up and literally just feel the music. I look around, everyone is smiling. Some people, random strangers, stop and say hi before walking to whatever their destination may be. Theres no hate. Everyone is respectful of everyone else, no matter how crazy he or she might be perceived in the real world. The energy and atmosphere I feel at raves like this is something Ive never experienced anywhere else and doubt I ever will.
