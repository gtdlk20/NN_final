Two very close friends and I were staying in a large rented caravan/mobile home for four nights at a small campsite in the New Forest area of England.  The village we stayed in is a tiny, picturesque location complete with a nice country pub and village green, which is occupied by a few wild horses during the day.  Despite coming here twice before, we still thought of ourselves as strangers in this small, isolated, rural community.  It kind of reminded me of old Western films where three horsemen would arrive in a small outback town, causing suspicion and edginess amongst the locals.  Except our horses were bikes Â– we were there to go mountain biking in the surrounding forest area, you see.
