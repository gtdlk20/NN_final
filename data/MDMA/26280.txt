I am on birth control (Yaz), that is the only prescription drug that either of us are on. We did smoke weed that day, before and during the roll. We didnt fast, as we honestly werent expecting to actually be getting these, as we had been trying for weeks. Then (we actually got really high and split a small pizza :-O) around midnight Saturday night I get a phone call from our friend B. B said he could get them and have them dropped off at around 12:30. I talked to D and we were excited, we were finally able to get them. It had been months since either of us rolled. It had been months since either of us rolled. The price was 10 per, which is pretty average around my area.
