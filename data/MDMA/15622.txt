At around 12 the X I snorted hit me. Wow. Everything was so beautiful. My senses ran amok. I welcomed it. I looked at ash who was just cheesing, a huge grin on her face. She pinched my cheek, and was like. 'You are so pretty!' I gave her a look, so she just giggled. Most of us were shedding clothing by now. We turned off the lights, and blasted some good trance music. We just get up and started having a huge grind. Me and Ashley and Shane. We are all friends, and we really didn't think much of it.
