Two days after this experience however, I noted a kind of lingering dizziness which continues now, a day later. I noted a kind of lingering dizziness which continues now, a day later. It is a tingly lightness that doesn't feel bad, or weakening, but does remind me of the very early onset of a fainting feeling. There is no 'downer' mood alteration whatsoever - which I suspect has something to do with the cleanliness of the substance - but the fact that this dizziness has been going on now for about 36 hours, I am mildly concerned, but comforted by the fact that  this effect can continue for 'up to' 4 weeks in most cases.
