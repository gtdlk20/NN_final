C brought out this foamy bath stuff that kids use in their baths. Its colored and fun to play with. I brought it out and began to analyze the product; I realized that kids usually would go crazy with this stuff and spray out huge amounts of the foam and cover their bodies in it  for fun. But it was also a cleaning product. So when kids think theyre just having fun with the foam its also cleaning them. When the foam hits the water, it eventually dissolves into it and makes the water a cleaning agent as well. I shared these thoughts with C very humorously, while completely coating my body in the foam with a huge smile on my face. It was delightful. I also thought about the stages of life, and how when C and me were in the tub, it was like in early childhood, sucking on pacifiers (or the teat of the mother). And I thought about the idea of Mother Nature, and how Mother is God in the eyes of a child. I came to the conclusion that when youre on E, its like youre FEELING God. When youre very young and youre sucking on your mothers teat, it is similar to sucking on a pacifier on Ecstasy. Or like when youre eating, serotonin is released. Mother nature (God) is nourishing you when you eat or are on MDMA, or so your brain thinks.
