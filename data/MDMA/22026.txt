S and I always part ways for a substantial portion of the raves we attend. There were four rooms, and I decided to explore them all. I kept returning to the room with the blue lights, where there was nothing but Jungle. That isn't my favourite, but there was something comforting in the room that kept drawing me back. Perhaps it was the lights. I think I had dropped my third pill at this point, so it must have been between 2 and 3am. I was sitting alone when this guy 'D' came over and sat with me. He began telling me of this horrible car crash he was in that resulted in him being paralyzed for some time. He eventually said screw that and decided to take his life and body back. Now he's strong and happy, and can walk or run anywhere he pleases. I told him of my being shot in the head, and the results. We were amazed with each others stories, and spent most of the night hanging out.
