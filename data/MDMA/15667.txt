I'll first start out with a quick history of my experiences, I'm a daily pot smoker for about a year and half, have experimented with shrooms a few times, opium once, coke once, painkillers and antianxiety pills, and a few months ago tried ecstasy for the 1st time. I had received the small blue pill with an imprinted cash sign for $20. Apparently it was some serious x and I had been waiting a long time to finally do it. So it was just before 7th period, I popped the little pill in the bathroom and returned to class, eagerly awaiting for the effects to come on.
