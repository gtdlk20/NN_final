So my Dad and I had some tickets to see UK dance act Underworld.  You may have heard their most famous song 'Born Slippy' back in the 90's.  When my Dad spoke to me about the gig a few weeks ago, he notified me that he had some Ecstasy saved up for it and would offer me some at the time.  I was excited about the prospect, but also a little nervous.  I had enjoyed my first experience with the drug over a year ago, at a festival in Holland while watching the Prodigy.  But I hadn't had any since, and find it hard to block out the alarming 'drugs will kill you' messages that I had been fed at school.
