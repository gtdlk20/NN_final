I made several notes throughout the evening following the last timestamp included in the report.  I ended up staying awake until about 3:30 AM [T + 13:11].  Given my previous experimentation with MDMA I was surprised at my ability to sleep so early without using Z-Drugs, benzodiazepines, or excessive alcohol.  I consumed around six beers during the course of the evening (nothing unusual for me around the time this experience occurred).  I never felt much of the traditional alcohol effects but I did detect some extra physical sedation.  As I alluded to above, the effects of the MDMA had a long slow decline.  I chose to not elaborate fully on my evening (past the last timestamp) because I donÂ’t believe there was anything particularly unique or useful for others to read.  Detailed commentary from 7:20 PM to 3:30 AM + 1 would have been several additional pages that I believe would have provided little to no additional data.
