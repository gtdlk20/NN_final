About an hour afterward, we decided to go to bed. I smoked another bowl because I felt I wouldn't be able to sleep otherwise. Our bed felt amazing. I wouldn't say I slept deeply, and I did wake up pretty often, but sleeping was very enjoyable and I felt refreshed when I woke up 7 hours later, which is unusual for me.
