However, Sunday night was a nightmare like Ive never experienced before.  I was lying in bed with my boyfriend, almost asleep but already in a nightmare.  I was in an auditorium with flashing lights.  There were little girls surrounding me.  They were all looking at me smiling.  Their eyes were perfect black circles, dark and deep, sucking me into their world.  I couldnt take it anymore and pulled myself out with a gasp of fresh air.  I woke my boyfriend up and told him to turn the lights on for me, that I was having a nightmare.  He told me everything was okay and to go back to sleep.  The second I put my head back down on the pillow I was sucked back into the dark.  The girls with the extremely dilated eyes smiling at me, digging into their hearts.  Their faces started to swirl as they passed their black hearts over to me.  It was so horrifying but I couldn't stop staring at them.  They were terrifying and loving at the same time, almost like the drugs I have been using.  I woke up to my boyfriend shaking me, telling me to wake up.
