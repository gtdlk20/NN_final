He suggested we put on some music (he was 'rolling' also). We are both huge trance fans, so we put on our favorite 3 hour trance mix. Music never sounded so good. I sat there with my head down, moving to the music. I felt like I was part of the song. Like the song was a soundtrack to how I was feeling at that exact moment. I could physically feel every beat. Every word being sung.
