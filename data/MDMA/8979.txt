I walked to my desk and pulled out a piece of paper, and wrote myself a note, to remind me later of this revelation. Afterwards, I opened a drawer with some old Christmas cards and mementos in it, and began looking through them. I felt so much love for all the people in them  grandparents, friends etc.  that I wished they were there right then so I could tell them how much I cared about them.
