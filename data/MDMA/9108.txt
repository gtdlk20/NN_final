 We were completely twacked at this point, for lack of a better word. Occasionally I would lean over and kiss C very intimately. At this point also found something interesting. When I was forced to do something with my mouth, like kiss my girlfriend, the jaw clenching/mouth pursing/sucking/smacking stopped. And I found that with concentration I could control the clenching but I wasnt about to concentrate my entire night on not clenching.
