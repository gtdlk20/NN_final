I didnÂ’t have any pressing concerns or worries prior to ingestion but somehow I feel massive emotional relief.  An all-encompassing knowledge that everything will be all right dominates my thoughts.  A wide grin is plastered across my face.  I roll my head slowly from side to side.  I flex and stretch my appendages, arching my toes and clenching my fists overhead.  Goddamn I feel amazing.  Every inch of me is radiating euphoria.  My forearms and chest have a strong buzzing sensation that emanates from my innermost core out towards my skin.  This internal glow is not dissimilar from a strong dosage of morphine or oxycodone but there is not even a hint of nausea or other discomfort of any kind.
