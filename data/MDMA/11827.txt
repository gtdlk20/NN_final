My friend/dealer thinks that I might just be one of those people who needs a higher dose, but I'm a huge lightweight for literally everything I've ever used. 3 drinks and I'm drunk, 3 bong rips and I'm toasted, and I would never be able to handle more than 150-175 micrograms of LSD. I wonder if the cymbalta (an SNRI) has temporarily or permanently changed the way my serotonin receptors work. I've heard it can take months to years, if at all, for that to function to become normal again. Maybe I'll try again someday with a slightly higher dose, but I'll be satisfied with LSD in the meantime.
