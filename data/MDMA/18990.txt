The biggest event of the night though occured about midway thought.  We all basically forced James to take a shower, since showering while rolling is incredable, its like an orgasm that lasts as long as the hot water.  While he was showering, Jen said to Sarah but loud enough for me to hear easily that she was 'SO in love with James'.  Sarah then told me that Jen had been in love with James for the last year. Upon hearing this I became even more overjoyed, because I knew that James felt the same way.
