So - this experience was in early August. I got my MDMA from an extremely trusted, close friend. He researches the biochemistry of all of the drugs he uses and sells; he's also currently a chemistry student so he can at least make better sense of the research than someone with no background. He tests everything for purity before he sells it as well, and plenty of people had already rolled from the same batch as mine and had very typical experiences.
