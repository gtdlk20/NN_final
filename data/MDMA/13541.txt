Although it is frustrating trying to recall and express in a satisfactory manner what the experience was, I would definitely like many more experiences with MDMA (although I haven't been craving the drug whatsoever.) I feel that, after the experience, I can actually cope with life's curveballs much better and enjoy, just that much more, it's pleasurable experiences.
