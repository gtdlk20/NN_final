The walk was about a mile. When we got back to the car, she had gotten hungry (I had been grazing on poundcake, so I wasnt particularly  ungry). Around here, most places are closed by 12am, so we wound up going to the supermarket which is now open 24hrs. She couldnt decide what she wanted so we wandered aimlessly for a bit.
