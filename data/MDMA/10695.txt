As we approached, we saw a man and a woman standing at the bottom of the stairs.  They offered to swap their standing tickets for our seated tickets.  It sounded too good to be true, so my Dad asked them why they wanted to sit.  The man explained that the woman was pregnant, even pulling aside her jacket to demonstrate the bump.  We examined their tickets alongside ours in case they were forgeries - one of the things I like about ecstasy, in comparison to alcohol for example, is that people seem less likely to make stupid mistakes.  Satisfied that the tickets were real we happily swapped and headed back to the main hall, amazed at our luck.  I felt a little apprehensive approaching the same ticket checker with a different ticket, but she didn't remark on it.  Once inside we went to the bar and got cups of water with ice.  Despite all our delays, the hall was virtually empty and the support band hadn't even started.  We sat down on the floor and chattered away again.  The amphetamine side of E seems to affect me quite strongly and the urge to talk is very strong.  Perhaps because I'm naturally quite reticent, my mind welcomes the opportunity to spill out all its thoughts instead of holding them in.
