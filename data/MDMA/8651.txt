My mood is impeccable.  I love the authenticity of my emotions right now!  My ego is slightly inflated  I feel enlightened and am aware of my newly acquired clairvoyant abilities.  I feel incredibly in tune with both Jean-Ralphio and our other friend, reading every tiny facial cue with a higher degree of skillfulness than normal.  I no longer feel the intense physical interconnectivity to nature although I am acutely aware of what I perceive to be absolute truths: simple yet grand idealistic concepts such as If I maintain awareness of the big picture; nothing should ever be worth stressing over.  I have the intrinsic sense that I should be teaching or demonstrating these ideas.  The universes functionality is obvious and clear to me.  What I consider to be the crux of existence, how to live life happily, is no longer a mystery.
