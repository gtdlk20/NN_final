On the Eve of the Millenium, I ventured out with many of my friends to party the new year in. We had already passed the countdown and it was getting late, about 1 or 2 am. My friends Joe, Mike and Nester all showed up at the party I was at and asked if I wanted to go with them to rave. I agreed because I am a big lover of the rave scene. So we all piled into Mike's car and went to his house. Joe said he Mike got 4 hits of x and we were all going to share. We all took a hit. I remember Joe came up to me, put the pill in my hand and handed me the Gatorade. I drank it down and he said ' Don't think about it, and it will hit you quicker' So we proceeded to Mike's Bedroom and we all sat around talking. Mike put on some Bjork, and we all just enjoyed the music.
