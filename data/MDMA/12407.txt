I've read stories that talk about how MDMA can help people with PTSD to remember traumatic experiences and bring positivity to them. In this case having an eating disorder in the past throwing up helped me relate positive emotions instead of negative ones to my eating disorders. Which I thought was pretty cool yet weird?
