I have taken ecstasy about 10 times in a number of environments and I feel a loss of magic in the drug.  I remember the first time I took this drug, I was overwhelmed with emotions I have never felt.  It was unbelievable.  But now, its nothing special.  I think it is because i learned to control my roll.  I know how to handle it now.
