This got much worse after about 10 more minutes. I started seeing people. I was neither frightened nor comfortable with my hallucinations but I know for sure I was 100% awake and wasnt dreaming or anything. I was lying in my bed and I kept seeing figures of my ex boyfriend, whom Im still very close friends with. Hed be sitting beside my bed and Id clearly see him as if he was actually there. Hed be moving his hand slightly and Id also capture his movement, making things seem extremely realistic. Then I would reach out to him, hed turn around slightly, but then as I get closer hed fade away and disappear. Then hed reappear in a bit at a different location in my room, and do the exact same thing all over again. This happened multiple times. I truly believed he was there in my room at the time because it was so realistic. It was crazy.
