At my lowest point, 7 days after I had injested the MDMA, I actually considered suicide.  And, seemingly, over a fight with my best friend and stolen items.  3 days after that, a full 10 days after my mind-blowing trip, I woke up, and everything was right with the world.  Everything was back in perspective.  I realized that everything that had been stolen could be replaced, most likely with the help of a check from the airlines.  I also realized that my best friend and I had been pretty co-dependant over the last year, and some time and separation would do us both some good.
