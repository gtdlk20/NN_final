One final thing I forgot to mention, halfway through the rave some guy came up to me, showed me my own ID and was like 'Are you Dani??' I'm like 'Yeah man, how did you get my ID?' and he told me that he'd been looking for me for 20 minutes because he had found my wallet on the floor with everything else (money, cards, etc.) Never before did I feel so much love for a stranger than I did then. The fact he'd gone out of his way to help me, and that there wasn't a single thing missing (when I had loads of cash inside) restored my absolute faith in humanity. I must have been hugging and thanking the guy for 10 minutes all in all, and him and his friends hung out with us for a bit which was an unbelievable experience and overall an amazing stroke of good luck.
