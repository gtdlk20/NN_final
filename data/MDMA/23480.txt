My next experience I intend to plan a little better. I will have the day off of work before hand so that I won't feel too fatigued (and work usually makes me grumpy too), and I want to try taking a little 5 HTP for the week prior, to hopefully give me a little bit of a serotonin boost. I fully intend to keep an open mind. :)
