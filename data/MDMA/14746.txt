Normally we are e-ravers. We use e at raves. The music and the people potentiate it. But we feel like E showed us its true colors last night and we're not sure we will ever use it at a rave again. I really think that E is a wonderful AID. A HELPER. Without the prior relationship, we wouldn't have felt as in love as we did. I think everyone should be able to use this drug.
