The second time I tried ecstacy I was at the same friends' apartment. It was a Friday night about a month and a half later. This time there were about 10 more people. Most of whom I had never met before. This time I had a pill waiting for me when I got there, it was supposed to be the best thing around. A female aquaintance and I took our pills at the same time. She had only rolled for the first time the day before this. About a half hour into the pill neither one of us had felt anything. The only other person that took the same kind of pill was rolling out of his mind, but it was his first time. We assumed that there was something wrong, it also seemed like we had been waiting forever. So we each bought another pill, a different kind from a different person. We took those. Man. It was a speedy roll. And it was a great one. I can't say it was better than the first but it was different. The female and I became really close that night, not sexually. The next morning it seemed just like the morning after the first roll. A day later I was severely constipated, bleeding from the rectum and almost went to the hospital. Since then I have been /extremely/ hesistant about ever trying ecstacy again. But I came to the Vaults of Erowid tonight and read enough info on MDMA that I feel like I understand why that happened. One of the article said that a larger than 150mg dose of MDMA just causes a speedier roll and increased side effects, no more euphoria, no longer roll, nothing really worth the extra $25 or the extra side effects. Point being 1 is enough.
