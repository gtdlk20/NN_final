Static visual noise: a shimmering of black, silver, and grey akin to an old television set with no signal, is growing stronger and stronger.  The effect is covering everything I see.  Each leaf, the ground, the walkway, and even the air is somehow wrapped in semi-translucent static.  The visual noise grows in intensity and each block of static grows larger, pixelating my vision to increasingly lower quality resolutions.  The static is starting to play tricks on my mind.  Is it white or is it black? Is it a large number of small pieces or just a few big chunks?  The latter of those questions really starts to become a difficult inquiry as the noise increases to the point that it is hiding objects behind it.  Objects turn into shapes, which are then further disguised as my depth perception pops them in and out of the vibrating background.  I feel like I canÂ’t focus my eyes correctly and have the sensation of each eye focusing in a different direction. I am overwhelmed and hold begin to hold my breath as I wait to see what happens next.
