We are pretty cautious people and Sam has some heart problems so we took half a pill each to start us off. The pills were gummy bear shaped and looked like tie dye colors. They were really hard to cut in half so they were really broken up and powdered when we took them. We went into bed in the dark cuddling under the covers. Within under 15 minutes I could feel this intensity creeping in. It was a feeling in my chest of fear and uncertainty. We tried calming each other down I really try to respect the drug and clear my mind as much as I can before and after I take it.
