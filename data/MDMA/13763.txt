When we arrived @ the event around midnight, I already had butterflies in my stomach from the anticipation of partying once again.  There was no time to waste so my buddy and I both dropped a tab and began to meander around the fairgrounds to absorb the festivities.  We decided to find the room that Oakie and BT were spinning so we could get a good spot on the dance floor.  Once we found the trance room, BT was just beginning his set.  This is when I noticed the usual numbing and weak-feelings associated with the first wave of the drug, but I also noticed something more powerful on this occasion.  It wasn't the usual, 'I'm ready to dance feeling,' but overall I was pretty fucked up, overwhelmed, and really FEELING the music.  I was so pumped up for the night that I took the other two tablets.  When Oakenfold came on, I only recall bits and pieces of the set b/c I was in another world.  The songs were extremely intense and satisfying.  I usually dance the night away, but on this occasion I just stood there dunbfounded, with my hands over my head occasionally glancing at my buddy to see how he was doing.  I could definitely tell the feeling was mutual.  I was very content, but not extremely euphoric.  I was more clueless and brain-dead than anything.  Yes, it was kind of frightening to be  that 'zombie-like,' not knowing how to take a picture with a camera or put cigarettes back into a carton.  Pretty pathetic, huh?  Thats what I thought...er believed at the time.  My vision was so skewed that I couldn't tell what was dancing next to me...a cute girl or a troll.  I had to keep telling myself that it was a cute girl.  I enjoy being fucked up, but it felt as if my mind was completely depleted of neurons.
