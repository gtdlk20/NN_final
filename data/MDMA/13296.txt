She overtook me and got to the bottom of the stairs, but she stopped there and waited for me. When I got there we met each other's eyes and I realised she was so gorgeous. She was smiling at me not because she had taken a pill, but because I looked pretty silly trying to walk down those stairs. We began chatting and I noticed my hearing had changed, the way I could hear her voice so clearly and everything else was distorted. I also remember how my eyes were affected. The light was so bright as I talked to her there and her green fluffy outfit really caught my attention. She asked if I wanted to dance and I obliged. She took my hand to help me up those stairs and after a while of dancing I kissed her on her cheek and thanked her for being so kind.
