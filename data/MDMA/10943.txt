We got back to the Bay and found W almost immediately. He said he wasn't feeling anything yet but T was feeling the first effects. I on the other hand had been thrown into a full roll with no sight of it stopping. The uneasyness had ceased and I was very, very happy. As the 3 of us walked around, A huge grin was plasted on my face, I was floating above the ground in complete warm euphoria. As we looked for a spot to watch the fireworks from, I noticed that the police base station was surrounded by a blue canvas type fabric. By this time it was dark and a very bright flood light had illuminated this blue canvas stuff from the inside of the compound, it looked amazing at least. It glowed like a magical force field around this installation of which I couldn't enter. I commented this to T and W, both agreed it was quite trippy. As we went past I dragged my finger tips across the surface and felt its interesting texture. It was rough and almost alien.
