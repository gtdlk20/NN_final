Forgetting all about smoking, we went to get the pills. On the way Marcus (good friend, and raver) called me and asked what I was up to. I told him the whole story, and he asked if he could join because for some strange reason he felt like rolling from the second he woke up that morning. I said sure, seeing as how we were getting 2 more hits than we needed. When we got back with the pills that were blue and had imprints of little bears on them, we couldn't wait and each swallowed one half at about 11:30 pm.
