The moment of my realization of the euphoria can be specifically isolated: after partaking of another bowl of marijuana, I looked up behind me at a Bob Marley poster on the wall, and there was a sudden *click*, and, at that moment, everything was right in the world. From this point on, my memory of the experience is quite delinear, but many key moments I recall.
