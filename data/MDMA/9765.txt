Whilst they carried on their conversations I sat trying to come to terms with my condition, all I could do was stare out over the river. Slowly, over a few minutes my heart rate dropped, my sweat dried,cooling my skin. Staring at the river, the reflections, the persistent gentle flow, the greatest calmness I have ever felt descended on me,like all sense away from man revealed an endless coming into being.
