I went downstairs again and we hurried to leave.  We'd only been able to get seated tickets and wanted to be sure of a good view.  The venue wasn't far away, but we planned to get a bus to be there in plenty of time.  It happened that there was an international football game on and the area was full of drunken football fans going into the city centre to celebrate after the match.  Before we left I called my partner and tried to leave him a message, but I realised I was incoherent and said I would talk to him later.  As we were about to leave he rang me back and I talked a little to him while we walked to the bus stop.  I could hardly focus on what he was saying however and felt an urgency about getting to the gig, so I soon said goodbye to him.
