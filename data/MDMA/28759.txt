After an hour I began to feel very mellow.  Thoughts came to mind about graduate work in philosophy -- feeling that I was one with all and the authors. I got up the courage to get a pop on the main floor of my building.  I ran into two ladies I knew.  I found myself hugging them.  They were quite responsive.  For several hours I had feelings of oneness with the universe, and felt peaceful and relaxed.  I felt as though I could have slept, but didn't want to as I felt so rested and at ease.
