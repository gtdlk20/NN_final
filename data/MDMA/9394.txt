As fascinating as the trip my have been, my real purpose in writing about this experience is regarding the aftermath.  We packed up and left that day, driving back to L.A.  I felt good, refreshed and well rested, and felt that I had achieved my goal of opening my psychic awareness, and looked forward to seeing how it would effect my life.
