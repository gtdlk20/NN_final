My brain my head feels like its jerking a little side my side it is so happy this is the best way to spend Saturday by myself. I dont feel bad at all anymore that I didnt see any friends. This is amazing.  I shall talk to someone on the phone in a little bit when he gets off work, but they are not over at my house so I dont have to worry about making them comfortable and I can get off the phone any time I want. Being at home I dont have to worry about where I am and how I get home. I can just be happy. Taking break from writing, just staring off into space want to feel instead of think.
