I'm not going to write about how it felt.  But I will say this, it cannot really be described.  It is pure bliss.  Nirvana is the best description I can come up with.  I think more clearly about myself and about my relationships with others than I ever have, and I come to some major revelations and learn a huge amount about myself and others.  This is the empathic quality everyone talks about.  This quality or rather what happened due ot this quality is what I am going to write about from here on out in this narrative.
