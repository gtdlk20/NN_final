Well, my job is done.  I showed the girls how to smoke and buy weed, now MDMA, and probably shrooms at some point.  You know, I think the DEA has it all wrong when they say talk to your kids about drugs.  Well, I do. And to me, there are some really bad drugs.  Meth and cocaine are not good to do.  Period.  But if my kids want to do drugs, then I help them pick the good ones and then show them how to do it, and explain the difference between recreational and self medication. I think that's why some kids die from drugs because  they never talked to someone who really loves them and shows them how to actually do them safely.
