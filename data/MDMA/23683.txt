Much of the rest of the night was spent clenching my jaws (something I did regret the next day) and experiencing severe Dejï¿½ Vu; although I know that I had never before taken MDMA in my life, almost everything I was perceiving felt as if it had happened to me before (something that I also experienced with psilocbin.)
