Despite, or perhaps because of, the faster acting (insufflation and intravenous) routes of administration on my second and third dosage events, I never felt the oral dosage ratchet up the extremity of effects.  I suspect some of the ocean depth power was a result of the large oral dose.  I hypothesize that without the first dosage, the experience may have been more pushy and stimulating.
