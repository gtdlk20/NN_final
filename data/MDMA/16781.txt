At this point I started calm down, and was like, 'This can't already be the come down.' It was only 1:45am. So we ate more. I noticed that it definately came in waves, unlike the e pill I had eaten a few months earlier. I also noticed that this was much less intense then the e pill, meaning I wasn't talking nearly as fast, I wasn't as ridiculously psyched, I was just very warm and chilled out. I likened the molly to being a warm glass of milk.
