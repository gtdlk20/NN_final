I also saw illuminating colors bouncing off the corners of my room, purple, blue, and green. I recall seeing the color purple the most. At about 5:40 I think my eyes reached maximum dilated because I could no longer see anything on my phone but I know I wanted to see the sunrise so keeping track of time was very difficult. However we managed to see the sunrise! Kinda.... Also, I was reaching my second peak at this time and I managed it much better than the first. The cold sweats made me feel good and I started to see the 'technology' in my phone. My Phone was made up of grids and all these different colors swirling together, when I would scroll up to try and read what I typed all of the words would move in patterns. Using my phone at this point was impossible I tried to pick different songs but I couldn't see any words on my phone so I gave up.
