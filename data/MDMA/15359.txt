I wasn't feeling any different after 30 minutes went by so I was started feeling a little ancy. Then my friend suggested that we take a drive in his jeep through the back country roads. I was in the back seat waiting for the pill to kick in then finally the vibrations of the trans music in the jeep sounded sooo good. I LOVED THIS MUSIC! I never relized how awesome it sounded till then. MY body started to automatically move on its own, I couldnt keep my body still. I wanted a cigarette so bad. My friend handed me one and I slowly breathed it in, and felt how smooth it was trickling down my throat. Smoking never felt sooo good. Just then after 15 of not stopping, I felt really hot. So hot that I needed to get out of the jeep.
