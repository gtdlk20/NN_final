Final Thoughts: MDMA by itself is not speedy, at least that's how it was for me. Everyone is different and anyone else could have had different reactions to this drug. But based on what I have experienced before, pure MDMA takes a little while to kick in and lasts around 8 hours. It also doesn't really get me hyper and speedy. I can also think without my thoughts racing. I think that it is a shame that most E is not pure MDMA. It is usually a mix of MDA, MDE, and methamphetamine and about half of it out there has some MDMA in it, but I really will almost never find pure stuff unless I am lucky enough again.
