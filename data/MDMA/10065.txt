My mood was very elevated- content, extremely happy, but not hyper.  I felt chill and relaxed by default, but could easily excite myself as I experienced new sensations during different movements.  In that sense it didn't feel particularly more 'up' or 'down' in terms of stimulant/depressant effect... the trip just went with the flow of whatever I did or wanted, and either a more sedate or more excited side could come out.
