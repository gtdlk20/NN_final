I recently rolled X again at a L.A. rave, but this time i didnt smoke cannabis, and its a total different experience! Nothing was clouded, everything was 'beautiful' every person who walked by was beautiful, every light, the music, everything. The experience wasnt as long as the first one (peak effects lasting around 3 hrs, probably due to dosage, and purity), but the experience was extremely better. the problem was, i had the mdma hangover the second time around. the day after i was ok, but the second day after, was the most depressing day ever. i was crying all day, most of it was over nothing. when i did have a reason to cry, it was because i wanted to do X again. Even though the after effects are sometimes harsh (depression etc..), X is still my drug of choice.
