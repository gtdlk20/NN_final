At about 11PM, me and 4 others detached from the other 4 to try and find some molly. We initially were only able to find 2 'questionable' pills to say the least (the dealer didn't seem very convinced that they were anything, and they seemed too small to be molly) and 2 of my friends decided to take it. I don't think it had any effect on them, as we met another dealer around 20 minutes later and the effects started to hit 1 hour after this original dose. Therefore, we concluded that they bought 'fake molly'. Anyway, we found a dealer whose product seemed more reliable. He told us that the dosage was 150mg and we bought 9 pills, one for each of us that was there. We met up with our other friends and swallowed our pills.
