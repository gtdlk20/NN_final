Once A got back to the seat where she was sitting, I walked out into the yard.  I started to notice that I was preoccupied, looking at the sky and lights, much like I was staring into visions induced by mushrooms.  I closed my eyes, and it seemed as though all of the emotion that was flowing within me was expressing itself in closed eye visuals.  It was as if I was seeing love and passion.  I opened my eyes, and just as well, there were visuals in the sky.  I was amazed, and I walked up to J.  I looked at him and said, this isnt MDMA, its MDA.  Every description of effects Ive ever read about MDA was running through me.  I was rolling so hard that my eyes kept rolling in the back of my head in pure Ecstasy.  As I opened them, my eyes twitched with Nystagmus.  When they twitched, the lights softened as if they were bright fireflies in the midst of a misty summer night.  There was a comforting blurry vision as well as the visuals that softly entered my visual field.  I was, as many people that are into Ecstasy would say, blowing up.  I have never rolled that hard, and I was tripping on top of that.
