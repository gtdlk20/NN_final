As soon as we get to the park, Michael hurts himself.  His collarbone was already fractured, so he was in a lot of pain.  The ecstasy enhances the compulsion to take care of him in a doting, maternal sort of way.  He lays his head in my lap, and I talk him through it... although, looking back, talking probably didn't do much of anything for him.
