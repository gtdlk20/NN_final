6:00 We are totally there.  The girls have huge black pupils, they are holding hands, reciting stories from their earlier years, petting dogs, and loving life...I am watching them and feeling maternal and incredibly loving. They go to Starbucks and I watch them chat the clerk up for water. (My girls are really pretty, so this is fun to watch this guy interact with these two VERY friendly girls - he must know they are rolling). They talk to a guy who is selling matchbook kites on the street and say they would totally buy them if they had money. The street vendor gives them two kites for free. They walk into a men's underwear store and again flirt outrageously with the clerk (who is obviously very gay, but loving it and flirting back - amazing).
