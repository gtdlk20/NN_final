T+ 2:30: Take a walk to the coffeeshop, which I'm not craving substantially unlike every other day of my life, but it still sounds nice.  We come back shortly after and decide to insufflate half of our second pills.  I don't know why I suggest this, as we tried this last time and it was quite awful.  I guess I just enjoy the act of snorting substances... and I also think that the pill may hit me faster than the last one.  After completing what seemed like an extremely large amount of powder, we eat the other halves.
