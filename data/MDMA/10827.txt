I was afraid I would not have an experience at all, because most positive effects I read about come from interactions with other people, and I am all but alone, my only companion being my faithful, ever-loving dog Chico a.k.a. Chic the sneak. Maybe we should call him C for privacy purposes. But I am definitely beginning to feel some effects. Nausea is more pronounced, lights and colors are very warm and bright. My hands and feet are sweating very slightly, which means my body temp is definitely higher than normal. My heart rate has increased approximately 10 bpm. Leather feels very good, so good, so cool, almost dark and mysterious. Now, the increase in bpm and sweating, I also experience those effects on meth. However the difference is that on meth, it is frightening, sometimes to the point that I fear for my life. But on ecstasy I am not afraid.
