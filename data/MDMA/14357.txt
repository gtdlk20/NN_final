Friend just called me. Breathy tone to voice I guess I thought I  could sound somewhat normal but I guess not. But I dont care. Oh god I hate high/drunk calling so much. But this is different. It is not omg I am bragging that I am drunk and I want you to hear how stupid I sound so you can see how drunk I am. This is I really want to connect with you but I dont think I can handle you being right here with me because I need to handle what is going on with myself right now. 
