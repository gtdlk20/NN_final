I took the tablet at about 2am, the come up for a pill for me is almost always between 50-70 minutes after ingestion so at 3am you can imagine I was expecting something to happen soon... nothing.  3.30am came, still nothing.  4am came, nothing.  At this point I decidedly accepted I wasn't going to get an effect, I am not the type of person to ingest more unknown substances in the hope of feeling an effect.  However at 4.30am I felt something, not an MDMA come-up though, more like a slight warm feeling thats not too dissimilar.  After this initial feeling which lasted about 5minutes I felt noticeably different.  Not the warm, loved-up feeling of ecstasy however, more like feeling tired when youre wide awake.  I found myself constantly stretching and wanting to move - the wanting to move feeling was a lot like when youre looking for something but you cant remember what it is youre looking for so you just search hoping when you see it you will know thats what you wanted.  I tried moving about different rooms of my house, lying down in places, sitting in others, I couldn't find where I wanted to be.
