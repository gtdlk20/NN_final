I told a friend about this experience and he pondered whether it might have been my mind and body telling me to stop using ecstasy so much, that I was imagining Kandi Girls: strangely happy girls with dilated eyes, pouring their love out to me but in a way that might hurt themselves.  It may have been my mind telling me that ecstasy could only make me happy to a certain extent.  After that it, the happiness would be false, a strange, dark happiness that, like the Kandi Girls, could lead to injury of my mind and body.
