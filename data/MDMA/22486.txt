Unfortunately, everybody except me took a dirty pill. So, at most, they felt good, and relaxed, but were way below the level I was at. There was a tropical storm Arlene going by us and it was raining outside. They wanted to go to a jacuzzi, and they begged me to go with them. I was in the most strongest part of my ecstacy, and I begged them not to go. I was NOT going to get wet. I didn't want to get wet. I didn't want to leave the apartment. So, I told them to go and I would stay.
