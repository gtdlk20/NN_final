I made comments about things, observations as we walked by the water then closer to downtown. The city was bustling  something I liked to watch from a distance but didnt want to be involved in. I enjoyed walking. The movement felt nice, the air felt nice. Some things I pointed out to Jan made her happy and excited. Other things bothered her. For example, the shared bike racks, she did not like. Can we not talk about that? She would say. And I would happily oblige. I could not predict what Jan would or would not like. It was like a game. But I did not like it because I didnt understand the rules of the game. The walk was slow as we stopped many times for people to go to the bathroom/cross the street/buy a snack.
