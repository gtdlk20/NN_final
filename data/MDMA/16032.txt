The final 'bad' thing about the night was that as I felt so loving towards all my friends, I bought like 20 waters for us and stuffed them into our bags. The bill was like $60 USD (on JUST water). I kind of don't regret it, because I knew they would have done the exact same thing to me at the time if they had thought of it, because we were all just feeling so good. Nonetheless I regretted it the next day, hahaha.
