My bro put on some music that he knew sounded particularly brilliant while rolling.  I cant emphasise enough how good the music sounded.  The best way I can describe it is as if every note of the song was bouncing into my head and through my soul, the music was coming from within me.  It was much louder and clearer than normal.  While the music played I lay on the bed rubbing the quilt and running my fingers through my mates hair.  All of a sudden I realised how grateful I was to my brother for playing this music for us and for generally how much I loved him.  I hugged him and that felt great. I told him I was very fond of him (which I would never normally do).  Then I hugged my mate and told him how good of a friend he was.  The rest of the night I spent chattting contently with my mate and listening to the music and absorbing the whole experience.
