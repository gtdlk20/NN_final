After what I can only guess was about three and a half hours of happiness so intence that it was almost overwhelming I started to come down.  Coming down off 'e' really wasn't that bad.  I simply felt that it was time to stop.  A walm calm feeling overcame me and I felt the need to sit and just observe and enjoy other people.  The only downside was that at this point I noticed that my jaw was rather sore from being clenched all night.  Also the next day I definitly felt mentaly slowed, but still warm and peaceful.
