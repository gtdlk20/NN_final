At this point I usually go and hug my flatmate. But when I got there I was greeted by her boyfriend. He jumped up as he saw me. He had a smile on his face from ear to ear. I was moving to the music, a wicked drum and bass track that flowed through my body and into my limbs. I did a little cross-over leg move as the sea of fellow stompers parted on the dance floor. He said to me that I was the little brother he never had and if I or my flatmate were ever in need he would be there for us. I shook his hand the only way I knew how, with respect and sincerity. Then I hugged him and told him that he was the big brother I never had.
