Will I do it again?  Probably not.  I dont like to say things definitively, but unless my life course changes drastically I doubt I will ever develop the tolerance for MDMA to make such a dosage remotely safe or enjoyable.  With less tolerance, I have attempted to replicate the magical mental space I achieved during this experience at smaller, safer dosages.  Several of these attempts were enjoyable, but they were much more standard in their qualities (high energy, big euphoria, conversation fiending, music enhancement, insomnia, etc.).  Other attempts were uncomfortable both physically and mentally, leaving me paranoid, dehydrated, and feeling like I poisoned my body.  I tried to find the sweet spot, the point where I skipped over traditional rolling effects and reached the beautiful enlightened space I found myself in during this experience, but never succeeded.  I either fell short or went too far into uncomfortable intensity.  Although I did not scientifically titrate dosages while resetting my tolerance to try and duplicate this experience, I sense this afternoon was, in many ways, unrepeatable.  This experience was a perfect concoction of time, place, tolerance, material quality, set, and setting.  The unrepeatability, rather than the intensity or anything else, allows me to categorize this as one of the few personal experiences I would label as a ++++.
