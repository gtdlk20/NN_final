I am entering a state of pure relaxation.  This is going beyond the everything will be okay sensation that I often feel on MDMA or benzodiazepines.  I cant comprehend negativity and have no interest in worries about the past or future.  I am only processing the here and now as it drips past.  The concept of time has melted away to the point that I cant grasp the concept of a now or a then.  A moment is eternity; eternity is a moment.  As such, I am incapable of thinking of the past or the present.  I can only witness what is happening in each moment | eternity as it occurs.  This is a blissful state of existence.
