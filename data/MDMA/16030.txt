We made dozens of friends, etc., hugged, danced with random people, the feelings of empathy that we had were unreal. I think at about 4am I got temporarily separated from my friends and felt some anxiety and depression. It was all fine though, despite my phone not having battery, we had set up a meeting point and I found them in 5 minutes which brought back all of my happiness.
