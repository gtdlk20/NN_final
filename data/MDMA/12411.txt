Moving on, we were laying in bed again and just enjoying the colors and patterns. I started to see almost like a glass forcefield a few inches below my ceiling and I could see waves of energy, almost like I could see the movements in the air around the room. I also would put my head down and it felt as if I went into another dimension and I would have conversations with people, but I would answer out loud and immediately pick my head up and ask Marc why I just said that? I did this about 4 or 5 times.
