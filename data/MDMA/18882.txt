Back in the garden we went into my conservatory, which is situated at the back of the garden.  We stuck on some music that would satisfy our mood  Supercat  Too Greedy.  There was some water there from earlier that day, and being the obsessive bastards we are we ate another 1 at T:03:00, declaring it to DEFINTELY be the last.
