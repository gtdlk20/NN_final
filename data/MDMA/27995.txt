Later after the party a few days later, I had realized how hard I was rolling, and everybody there was pretty much pissed off at me because I wouldn't stop talking. Honestly, I understood the rude awakening, and I have since then, learned how to improve upon my rolling etiquette. Testing the endurance of the body is one thing, but not knowing the limitations is dangerous. I know I could have gotten some really undesired effects if I took anymore.
