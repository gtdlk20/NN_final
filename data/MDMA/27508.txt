I felt like I was coming down a bit after an hour and a half and thought it was a bit too early for that but soon enough, I was going back up. Since it wasn't nearly as good as the first wave. P and I decided to go and smoke another bowl. The combination of the rising second wave and the weed was amazing. I found a stuffed bear and alternated stroking it and people. Everything was so soft and I was so happy.
