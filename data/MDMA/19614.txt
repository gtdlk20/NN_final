I took my pills over the course of two hours in half-pill doses, but it took more than an hour for my first dose to take any effect. I guess it's true that on your first time, you don't know what your feeling, so I may have been touched beforehand without knowing. My female friend came late and took her pills well after I was under the influence. What I first noticed were physical effects. Rush of blood to the head, warm feeling, 'soft' visuals (kind of a slow motion).
