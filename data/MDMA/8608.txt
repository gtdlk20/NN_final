I tap the baggie once again to drop MDMA onto the scale; I begin to develop a sweat.  The window is wide open allowing cool air to flow into the room.  I feel the breeze across every goose bump on my skin.  My sense of touch is already sky rocketing in sensitivity.  I shudder as the first major wave of euphoria crashes over me.  I feel real nice.  My awareness of the synthetic nature of the effects has disappeared.  I sit and revel in this liftoff moment that feels just oh so good.  I am a solid + on the Shulgin Rating Scale and rapidly heading upwards.
