About two hours after I took my first dose, It occurred to me that I was very nearly down. I decided to take the 25mg I had set aside, knowing that a full capsule would probably be too much for me. I didn't realize how fast the comedown would be, and thought I could prolong my experience. What ended up happening was that I came down entirely and then very quickly came up (although nowhere near as up as I had been) again. I experienced this as moderate anxiety and discomfort, both physical and mental. E pointed out that I seemed less comfortable, and reassured me that we didn't have to discuss anything that was difficult for me. Hearing that was extremely helpful, as I tend to worry very much about how he is feeling, and that I am making him uncomfortable. He was getting toward the end of his experience.
