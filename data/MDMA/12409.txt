I noticed Marc was clenching his jaw and I remembered I had gummies left over so I offered him one to maybe make him relax his jaw, we both started to eat it and the flavor was crazy, nothing like I've ever tasted before then all of a sudden I say out loud 'ew the texture just changed' and as I was saying that Marc made a disgusted face and we both were comparing it to sand dissolving in our mouths. We saw a lot of the same patterns and I thought it was weird we both felt the same texture while eating the gummy. I could see colors in Marc's face, red and blue lines going up and across almost like a plaid pattern, and parts of his body were glowing different colors, it's almost like I could see through him in a way. I remember telling him how beautiful he looked and we were both extremely loving and complimented each other a lot. It felt so good just to be in each other's presence.
