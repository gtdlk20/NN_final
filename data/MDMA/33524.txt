   My business partner and I have been very close friends for many years. He is 29 and far more liberal than I.  Last June he began several conversations about ectasy.  Because of my responses - 'anyone would have to be nuts to fool with any of that stuff' - he dropped the subject.  Following several more attempts to introduce the subject, he finally admitted in September - 'Don't flip out' that he tried MDMA.  He also convinced me to at least try it.  I did.  Like many the first time was terrifying, 'Oh God, why did I agree to this?'  Vomitting, total lack of control.  I now realize that the discomfort was caused more by anxiety than by the drug. My partner never left my side, even when I had my head in the bowl.  He was very reassuring.  Since that time we have been partying about every two weeks.
