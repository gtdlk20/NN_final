As someone who has struggled with addiction I would have thought that such a wonderful experience would trigger the urge to do it again and again, but I'm happy to report that was not the case.  From the age of 22 to 26 I ingested MDMA on average from 2-3 times per year.  After the first 2 instances I upped my dosage to 1 and 1/2 pills, and eventually up to 2 pills.  Over the years I never noticed any side effects afterwards, aside from perhaps a feeling of sluggishness or some hazy memory for the next day.  For my 30th birthday the same best friend gifted me again with MDMA, the first I had done in 3 years, and this is the trip that I would like to talk about.
