We decided we needed to move away from the bad trip and we went into the bathroom, out of nowhere I leaned over the sink and puked. After a few seconds I felt fine and dandy. All I remember after this is having a really long intense discussion of who he could sleep with to get back at me for some things I did. Somewhere around then maybe an hour and a half in or so we decided to take our second hit as well as smoke some more. By then we were naked just for freedom, I was shivering though, sitting on my couch watching him get something from the fridge. I was rolling hard then all of a sudden he was in pink happy bunny super hero pajamas. I was about to ask him where the hell he found them and why he was wearing them until I realized that it was a very vivid soft layer of hallucination. They kept appearing and disappearing the whole night. After that he sat down and I know he was talking, but all I could see was his mouth moving and all I could hear was happy carnival music. Like I was on a merry go round. My rug started moving like a snake. I know I was seeing a lot, but I can't even remember it because it hit me so hard. (This was in a fully lit room mind you.)
