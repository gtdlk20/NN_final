It all started when I was invited to a huge rave by a new friend I had met at a party in the past weekend. I was really excited because I had searched for the rave scene for years as well as some good molly and has thus far been unable to find either. I didnÂ’t even know that molly existed until the last summer, from Bonnaroo. I live in Houston and another friend of mine told me that he would be getting a new shipment of pure MDMA from California, something I was very much looking forward to.
