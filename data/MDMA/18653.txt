The most perfect moment I have ever, ever experienced occurred as the sun finally rose. I have absolutely no recolection of it actually getting brighter outside, just of the sun shifting across the sky in front of my eyes. At that moment everything fit. The music we were listening to, the people I was with and the beauty I was witnessing. Although sunrise is a daily occurance this sunrise is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. The colours were vibrant and alive, and I was so extremely happy at that moment because the earth chose to wake up in front of me. I felt the sunshine rays reach out and wraped around me. The warmth from the sun was a great hug that I never wanted to let me go. We turned the music off right after the sun shifted and it was then we could hear the birds singing and the town start to awake as well, there was frost (or dew) on the grass, nature is so beautiful. Luckily we did catch this beauty on video, a friend of mine taped the whole sunrise on his cellphone, music and all.
