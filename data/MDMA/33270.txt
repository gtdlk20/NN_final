Lots of glowsticks in different varities.  I prefered the 15 inch glowsticks my friend was able to get ahold of. Although the standard 4-6 inchers are great to learn on, although I learned on the 15's =).  The trail you will see later on in the roll are amazing.  If someone knows how to use them right, you can BLOW UP from these easily(more on this later).
