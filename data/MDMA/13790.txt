One weekend my friend asked me to join their group so I did. Once I got there they were handing them out so it took 1 new superman tab. The place was just a big living room with all the furniture pushed to the sides with mattresses on the floor with room enough to dance and a dj at the end, and was very dimly lighted. At first I thought that nothing was going to happen, but people around me were all suddenly peaking people fainting people hugging people spinning it was wild, all of a sudden the room came to life and everything started to feel better. I decided to get up from my seat to look around and thatÂ’s when it hit me!
