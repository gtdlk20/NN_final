I have the worst work shift of my life followed by a good good sleep.  I wake up and I am still high, e tarded beyond all belief.  I have the second shittiest work shift of my life.  I fall asleep.  I am still e tarded.  3 days later, can't think straight.  One week later, I am still a zombie.  Two weeks later, no change.  I am starting to panic.  Have I fucked myself up for the rest of my life?  I smoke pot to alleviate my worries.  One night I sit curled up in a ball with a blanket over me in a recliner.  I writhe as I feel that I have let a demon into my body.  After that I start seeing shadows that disappear when I look at them.  They creep along in the corner of my vision.  The move on their own.  They are malevolent.  Am I going schizo?  Three weeks later, I am starting to feel a very slight improvement.  Hope!  One night I walk into the woods alone.  The demon is still with me.  I am terrified beyond all belief.  I stand in a clearing and stare at the moon.  I feel like I am surrounded by evil.  I feel like I am unsafe.  I am afraid that my insanity will envelope me and I will be lost forever.  I focus on my body.  More and more.  I focus on the feelings in my body.  My thought stops and my awareness expands.  The demon is still there, but now it is incorporeal.  Over the next few days it fades and gets weaker.  It is losing power.  My cohesiveness is returning.  Two months later, I am back to normal.
