I was feeling pretty good, but it was probably because we had smoked some good shit. I first realized I was rolling when we were all sitting on M's couch and I was eating a Laffy Taffy. I read the joke: What do you call a skeleton who won't work? Lazybones. I was laughing for a good five minutes and my face felt very warm. From then on I felt very happy. P wasn't feeling anything yet until M started playing his cello and it sounded like a choir of angels. It was ten times better than the best music on cannabis alone. I was lost in the music until he stopped and both P and I objected to the loss of the heavenly sound.
