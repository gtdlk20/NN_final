The next morning I woke up, and everything and everyone was back to normal. I'd say the whole trip was 8+ hours, including waiting for the effects to start. My buddy D, said that he kept seeing huge insects walking on top of the tent and that 'something' kept whispering to him throughout the night. To this day I still don't know for sure what it was that we took. From reading up on some different substances and experiences, I believe it may have been Mescaline. The only other ones I've read up on that sound similar would be 2-CB or one of 2-CB's cousins. Either way what a trip it was.
