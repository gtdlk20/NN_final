I tingled all over as we listened to Infected Mushroom songs and talked. I analyzed every part of every song. The more I listened the more I felt the music. Every sound made me feel differently. Some music actually made me feel as if something bad was going to happen every second, but that was only the songs with yelling in them, the non-progressive and non-Infected Mushroom songs. My hand was flowing when I finally was able to draw, several friends went off in search of pens, markers, something and had come back with nothing but two more went to someone's house and brought back a much needed pen.
