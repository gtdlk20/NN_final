This was Marquis tested (blackish-purple and some fizzing), so I guessed it was genuine. I'd tried Molly a few times orally so I had an idea of what to expect, albeit faster and stronger in on-set. I weighed out 75mgs of crystal on my .000 scale, crushed the crystals to powder, and while I knew it would burn from watching others do it, it wasn't as bad as I thought. I've had Yopo--this really wasn't so bad. The effects were a lot quicker, I am now about 40 minutes into the snorted-MDMA experience, and it feels more like edging toward the 2 hour mark of an oral dose. This also means the roll will be much shorter, but I'm fine with that.
