I also remember that there was a point where I was kneeling down, kissing the earth and thanking god-knows-what for having created such an amazing world to live in. I've never been religious and I didn't feel religious then. As I contemplated about what brought about such an amazing world, I realized how lucky we are to be able to live in it. As I kept kneeling, my friends around me started massaging my head and hair and it felt godly - so silk and soft, reinforcing the feelings of love for the earth and my friends that I had.
