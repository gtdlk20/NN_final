About 4 or 5 hours in the come down was awkward, and almost as fast as the come up. I felt weird. Stretched, empty, almost depressed. This didn't last long though. Some more water and a nice strong cheese (high in salt and tryptophan you see, salted nuts would be a good alternative if you don't eat cheese) brought me level again, to enjoy residual good feelings.
