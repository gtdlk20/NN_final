The intention of me doing this was to have the hardest blow up possible at the peak effects of ecstasy.  I believe, without a doubt, that I achieved this.  I will never do it again, because I know it won't be as good the second time.  I did get a bonus for my efforts though. I had a tobacco habit of about 3 packs a week. I had a pack of cigarettes for my roll, as I always do.  I smoked on my way home and in my afterglow the rest of the day. I had three left when I woke up the next morning.  I lit one up on my way to work and noticed that I wasn't getting any type of physical pleasure from my cigarette.  No relief, relaxation, nothing at all.  I finished the pack at work, and still nothing.  The remainder of the week I had no physical cravings whatsoever.  Apparantly such a small rush created by nicotine no longer pleasured my body after such a powerful experience.  Now all I had to do was beat the mental habit (smoke on my break, after meals, etc.), and that was the easy part.  The physical addiction was gone.  So I successfully quit smoking after trying on and off for the past year.  I'm not recommending this as a cure for smoking, e-dive at your own risk, but man, what a RUSH!
