As we are walking back, my body is tensing and I am getting the onset slowly. My pupils are getting bigger, I notice as I step into his bathroom. Now my troubles begin. At 5:15, I am coming up and it is overwhelming as I was prepared for. Again, I calm myself down and say it will get better. My boyfriend and I are sitting on my friend's bed, and I get very cold. My friend closes the windows, turns the techno up and we listen to music in the dark room. He turns off a lamp and I freak. 'No, don't turn that off. Keep it on. I'm scared.' So he turns it back on. MDMA typically makes me very anxious, which is bizarre for a drug that is intended to induce happiness. Usually, I like to get settled in and experience the drug in one position. I cannot stand things moving or the setting changing. It disturbs me greatly.
