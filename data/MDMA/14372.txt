If you analyze off of a drug, then you can go in circles and drive yourself crazy. I try to google psychology stuff on the internet to analyze myself, but thats so dry from a book, and from studies. We are such  individual people, that we need to not worry about the averages and percentages of the normal person, and be confident with our own analysis. Everything makes sense right now. I want to call my friend now. Give him insight. Probably wondering what took me so long to call him back.  I really dont want to get away from writing, but here I go again being introverted and self absorbed that I want to analyze myself. I need to connect with another person. Live.
