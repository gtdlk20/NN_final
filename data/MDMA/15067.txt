After 25-35 minutes I feel super relaxed, and I would say tired and lazy. I dont feel like doing anything just sitting in the warm place with music and smoking a cigarette. Then after time I am only relaxed, but not tired or lazy and then energy comes to me slowly and I begin to feel very social, talkative, friendly and there is happy vibes and love and unity with people and lots of empathy and interest in other peoples lives.
