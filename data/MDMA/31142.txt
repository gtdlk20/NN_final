Well, its the next day, and I feel reborn. I had previously been very afraid to try ecstasy, but to my great surprise, It was a very fun and peaceful. I was at my friends property near a river and some friends had been doing this for the past couple of days, so I tried it. It was awesome, I felt nothing but pure peace, I was also drinking a lot of beer with no noticeable bad effects. I feel reborn today. No hangover present at all. One funny thing was when I got home at around 3:30 AM i walked out into my front yard, and sat down to look at the sky, my cat came over to me and I just kept petting him and telling him i loved him. I felt so connected to everything living, I was capable of empathizing with anyone or anything. It was a very personal but also a social experience, I will cherish this experience forever.
