I have only taken E twice and I plan on taking it again, but at the maximum frequency of every six months. The second time I took it I was with my girlfriend and we were able to explore the depths of our relationship and become closer in the process. Ecstasy helped make our relationship more communicative. The memory and contemplation of my experience on E brings new insights several months after I have taken it.
