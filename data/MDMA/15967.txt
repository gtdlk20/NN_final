We stay sitting down as he's rolling too hard to want to move, he's just nodding his head along with the sounds, looking everywhere, like a small child. We call his best friend to tell him he's fine, and we tell him we're really thankful, and he's a good friend. My friends come up to us, and we all sit outside enjoying the fresh air while smoking another joint. At this point, my boyfriend is still rolling too hard, and he's just in the moment. He tells me he feels the present, is in the present, and as I see him I hope he's happy and his friends won't blame me for his bad trip, and he seems to read my mind and says he doesn't regret it. We lose sight of our friends, as I stay with him because he's still too high. A guy in a white panama comes up to us and gives him a block of sugar. He's chewing on his bubble gum harder than ever. My teeth are grinding, but I only had one piece of chewing gum, and he needed it much more than me. Absolutely manic experience. Absolutely psychotic.
