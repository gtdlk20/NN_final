The challenge I now face is to integrate everything Ive learned and realized into my life. To conquer the fear I realized was there, and to learn to live in a way which is more in tune with my real me, or the kind of god-self I felt when using MDMA. I dont think it will be easy, but I very much feel this experience could be truly life-changing.
