Then around 10.45 or so, I don't know what it was, maybe just getting up to open a window because things seemed a little warm, but all of a sudden, with no hint of warning or noticable change whatsoever, everything was completely different. I felt the universal empathy before I could process it properly, but when it came out as recognisable thoughts, it was something along the lines that everyone deserved to be loved and deserved the chance to love each other and that all of the unconscious mental debris and crippling social convention and order that held it back was a result of the expression of these needs being blocked, or being unaware that the needs actually existed because of a lifetime of enforced internal and external repression. 'Everything is beautiful except hatred and order' I wrote at one point in the experience, as well as some rather less concise stuff about the limiting effects of ritual, convention and unthinking conformity, repressed and unadmitted general love, and the limitations of language.
