My focus is drawn to my physical body.  I havent been paying much attention to it since prior to my visit to the monochromatic world.  Suddenly I am very aware of it.  Aware is a mild word; I feel like I am shaking with pleasure.  Full tilt, unbridled euphoria thunders through me from head to toe.  Despite the enormity of these feelings, they still feel manageable.  Concerns of dosing too aggressively have essentially left my mind completely.  My special connection to nature is diminishing but I have tremendous connection to the world outside my brain: every person, plant, and animal are my siblings and friends.  Im overwhelmed with happiness, joy, and love.  As cheesy and cliché as this sounds, its exactly how I feel.  There is no synthetic nature to my positivity  I feel like I have come out of a cocoon of anxiety, worry, and negativity.  An entrapment I was unaware I was being restrained by.  By no means have I been in a poor mood lately, but in this moment I am realizing I have forgotten what pure happiness feels like.  I bask in the sunlight that is now perfectly shining through my window, soaking up the rays and the perfection of this moment.
