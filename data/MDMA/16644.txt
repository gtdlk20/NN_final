So, the night of the event (jam band kinda thing,  but pretty massive) comes and I'm stoked... I take the igloo and the euro with, just in case the igloo isnt strong enough.. I'm determined to have a 'strong experience'.. Sadly, i go by myself, but given the nature of ecstasy, i figure ill make friends.. I always see people rolling at concerts.. I also pack up with some blue glowsticks with ropes, and a vix inhaler..
