I did MDMA (.5g over a period of 2 days) the last weekend of June 2010. Previously that year I had been taking SSRI's for depression and I was concerned that this would affect my overall 'high' (Which I'm sure it did). When I did plateau, it was medium strength, and short. And when I came down, I did not experience a crash followed by a hangover, in fact I had a sense of well-being and clarity after the effects of the drug wore off. (Although I think that I may have developed HPPD after this dosing.)
