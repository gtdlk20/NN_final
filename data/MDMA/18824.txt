By this time I was dehydrated and sketchin out and this was not fun. I was alone, scared and cold so I found my friends them being high to thinking that they were smart said chug water and don't stop. After that I felt more sick at the time I was walking around I was watching a big tv screen and below was a guy dancing then he fell off the stage and hit the ground and then they showed him on the screen. So I left. I went outside it was cold then thats when the hot dog came up for a visit. I got a ride home then once at home I could not sleep. When I finally left my room I felt that everyone was out to get me. Then for the next 4 days at school I still felt high and I felt there was still something wrong and now everytime I dose I only get a good peak then its over.
