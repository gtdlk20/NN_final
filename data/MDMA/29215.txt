I personally don't believe I would have ever reached that point without the use of a psychoactive drug; which is why the 'I don't need drugs to have a good time' attitude is rather puzzling to me. I suppose the question is does it matter anyway, some people get on perfectly without either the use of drugs or reaching that state; my answer would be yes, it does matter a lot, or I wouldn't look for it, and having been made aware for the existence of such a state I don't think I will ever stop looking.
