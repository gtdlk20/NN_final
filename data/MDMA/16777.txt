Welp, a few things. I've taken e before a few times, but never pure mdma powder. Also, I have been friends with my boyfriend for many years, many many years, best friends, and about eight months ago he kissed me one night and we've been together ever since. Except for periods of extensive fighting over the past two months, which have caused me to move out. Most recently I had to be physically removed from the 'premises' aka our home because I was being violent and causing a domestic disturbance. I digress (but  these things generally resolve themselves).
