Notes: The magic definitely came back. Maybe it takes awhile! The bitterness is still there. I personally don't think you should drink alcohol anytime in the 24 hours of a good mdma experience, but that's a personal choice. Smoking weed helps coming down, but right now I'm still pretty perspirey and hot. But that could be summer.  Pant pant pant. And I've never walked so much in my life.  This is why I was a size 5 in the 80's!!  Better living through chemistry!
