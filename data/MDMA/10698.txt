We danced like crazy, each new track sounding better than the last.  Despite this, I still kept checking the time and notified my Dad when an hour had passed so that we could go get another drink.  Again I felt impressed that I could remember to check the time when I was otherwise so carried away with it all.  I decided to have an orange juice this time, thinking something with a taste would reduce the temptation to gulp it down.  We went back to dance again, I benevolently allowed a man to have a sip of my orange juice so he could wash down some drugs he was taking.  I was clenching my jaw and grinding my teeth quite a lot, the next morning I discovered my lip was horribly swollen where I had bitten it.  I'd bitten the inside of my cheek and my tongue as well.
