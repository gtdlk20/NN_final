My friend had just moved into his new apartment, and we figured that we'd do a few hits of e to celebrate with some other friends of ours. Everything was going pretty well, we took our pills at around the same time and talked as we waited for the drugs to start taking effect. Around 30 minutes after everyone had swallowed their pills we started to feel those shivers and other body sensations, very common as you start to feel the drug. Soon after everyone had neared their peak, and were talking and hugging each other. All except me.
