+1:50 I am definitely rolling now. I finally get my turn to go up to the counter I ask for a pack of Marlboro Medium 100s and the cashier is talking to me about how someone spilled a Slurpee on the counter because they were high. And telling me how wrong it is to get high, all I could think about is how sad it is that someone could be so judgmental. I believe that if its your body and your mind and choosing to responsibly alter it isnt necessarily a terrible thing. After I go D buys 2 packs of gum after smelling every pack in the store.
