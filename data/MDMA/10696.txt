At this point my Dad offered me more E and I decided to take one more.  He passed it to me in a clandestine fashion and I swallowed it straight away.  We talked away and sipped our water.  I was very aware of not drinking too much.  At one point I went to the toilets, only to find I couldn't pee.  I reported this to my Dad - not information I would normally share with anyone!  He reassured me that funny things like that sometimes happen on E.  Eventually the support band came on and we stood up, dancing a little but saving our energy for the main act.  As the hall gradually filled up, there seemed to be a mass feeling of anticipation - something amazing was surely just around the corner.
