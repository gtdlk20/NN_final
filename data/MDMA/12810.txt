After reading that Ecstasy generally hits no later than 2 hours after ingestion, I was a bit disappointed when 12:30AM rolled around. The rest of the people wanted to smoke a little bit more, and I smoked with them, taking 3 bong (Not gravity bong) hits. Moderately feeling the cannabis, I followed the crowd up to a dark room with a great sounds system, and listened to 'The Dark Side of the Moon' for about 30 minutes.
