It was about 3 months ago that I rolled for the first time. I was really determined to try this drug, but never really got down to getting it. Soon enough I was overwhelmed by my curiosity and had to indulge in this thing called 'X-ing'. I was with a few friends, and they're practically all best friends, so I felt comfortable with it. Everyone around me also took the pill. It was Ash and mines first time--so we were really rolling face by the time we were 'up'. First we sat and relaxed-watching a tiny little black and white tv. I felt as if i was sitting outside of my body, that's how relaxed i was. I had my eyes focused so deeply into the tv, that everything around the tv was moving and swirling. My friend poked me as i was being so quiet, i was just so caught up in this feeling of relaxation. My friend looked at me and told me she was getting mad because she felt she had wasted her money because she wasn't feeling anything. We got up to go smoke a cigarette which sounded so good at the time. As we were walking down the stairs, i felt as if i was being carried down the stairs. My body was so light, it was crazy to think it was even me. Suddenly, Ash looked at me and just got this big smile on her face. Her roll had kicked in.
