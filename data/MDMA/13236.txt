At this point, I took a single Blue Dolphin (Tested as 100% MDMA) pill, with a glass of water. Given the time, and that it is a Sunday night (meaning I have obligations Monday at ~ 10:00, logic would dictate that I had better just plan on not sleeping, with, of course, the help of my friend MDMA. In my bedroom I have a about a 350 watt audio setup, a tv/dvd player, and my laptop, luckily with my newly installed cable internet, for entertainment. Unfortunately, I do not have a fog machine, strobe light, photons or other visual / lighting effects, but Windows Media Player and WinAmp visualizations have taken their place adequitely. Also, during the night I had about 10 or 12 glasses of cold water, but I didnt feel it was necessary to note the individual glasses on the timeline :P
