I was still quite high from the final E, but it was very different to earlier.  I was a little disappointed about the clubbing but it was nice to sit and be warm, listening to some decent music.  A song by Primal Scream with the words, 'Drifting, drifting' repeated many times made me feel very peaceful.  I was definitely coming down but I still had this wierd feeling that something great was about to happen.  It was annoying that my rational mind kept interfering to tell me nothing much was going to happen except going to bed soon and not getting much sleep.
