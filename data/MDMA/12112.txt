I met my friend, and we had a great time.  We used to really enjoy drinking together, so thats what we did.  We got fairly drunk, then somewhere around 2 or 3, we went back to my place and drank the few beers I had around.  As it got later, the idea of waking up to go to this shitty temp office job was starting to haunt me.  I remember specifically feeling really bitter about the idea of having to cut our hang short just so I could go to bed and make it in to work.  Then, I remember kind of making a decision that there was no way in hell I was going to let something I didnt give a shit about take precedence over spending time with my friend.  I went and got more beer, and we drank until about 4 or 5, then he took off, back to where he was staying.  I was starting, in the background, to feel really wound up with a lot of unhappiness and dread about the next day  not necessarily just about going to work, but about being back in my life, which at the time seemed complicated and not too enjoyable.
