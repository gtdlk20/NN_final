I met a girl at a club when I first began doing ecstasy. Surprisingly, she came on to me (it seemed) and we hit it off well. As time progressed, and the new experience and atmosphere of ecstasy and raving entered my life, I was very cautious. I was kinda hesitant about having a relationship with her, she was a part of this new period of my life and I felt wary about anything related to it. I wasn't mean to her but I was very cautious. As time progressed we spoke on and off.
