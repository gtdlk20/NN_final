We couldn't have gone more than 10 steps down the trail when the pleasure became more too intense and overwhelming.  Despite how good it felt, it was out of control.  I felt that I was beginning to lose my vision, and felt the intense pleasure was taking over my body and soon my mind.  I collapsed, unable to stand, and was convinced I was going to die.  'Please, help me, it's too strong, it's too strong, make it stop, it's too much...' I cried to my boyfriend and then warned him that I was going to pass out.  I was panicked and could not see, but could hear him assuring me it would be OK, coaching my breathing, could feel him rubbing my back, etc. and I was thinking 'god, I don't want to die but what a god damned pleasurable way to die... we should all be so lucky to die like this... but I don't want to die... why isn't he taking me to a hospital?'
