I was able to think things through so clearly, and I enjoyed this a lot. Even after the second pill I cant quite say I was feeling euphoric, but more  Im not sure how to explain it. I was thinking things so deeply that it made me slightly emotional but not extremely sad emotional. I was confident in my thoughts. I was thinking of things from the past a lot, reflecting on the life Ive had. It was slightly overwhelming because every memory I thought of was brought to me with so much detail.
