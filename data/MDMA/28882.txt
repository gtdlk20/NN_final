After cooling off (as it was really hot in the main room) M and I returned to the main room and started dancing around and jamming to Tiesto (I love his music, I feel like it speaks to my soul!). Just then this guy wearing a hat that looked like the Mad Hatters hat from Alice in Wonderland approached us and he had a glove on one hand that had different colored lights on each finger and on the other a glove that had small vibrating squares down the entire palmer surface of the hand.  He then rubbed up and down my back with the vibrating one and held the one with lights in front of my face and moved his fingers. Normally this would been weird for me (a random dude putting his hands on me) but under the empathogenic effects of the gift from Dr. Shulgin, I didnt care, the sensation was extremely pleasant.
