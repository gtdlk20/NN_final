First of all, I'm from Holland, 18 years old and you could call me a typical Dutch kid: the first time I smoked weed was at 12 years old and I didn't stop ever since. I knew, in the future, I was going to use drugs and when I was fifteen, after some online research, somewhere in june I had my first mushroom trip and it was great. We had dried shrooms(can't remember what kind)and I took about 5 medium sized ones. Since then I used mushrooms every one, one and a half month in summer and once every three months in winter(something like that).
