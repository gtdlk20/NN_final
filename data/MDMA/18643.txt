I did feel perfect as the music and my drawing flowed hand in hand. I write at one point 'get off of my cloud, or hey join me...' above a venus flytrap-like drawing. I reacll why I did this: The Rolling Stones have a song with lyrics which say 'hey, you, get off of my cloud' and as I drew I thought of this. I thought it was far too mean and exclusive and I decided whoever wanted onto my cloud can join me. I really wanted to explain that to everyone at the time it was happening but I got side-tracked by the existing conversation and the music and I forgot.
