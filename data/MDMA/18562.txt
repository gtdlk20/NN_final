I danced for like the longest time, about an hour, I'd say, but it just felt to me like it was going on forever. Occasionally I would get some bad vibes from my friend. I could tell she was kind of upset, she was on MSN and talking to her people and I guess one of them pissed her off or something. I didn't even have to be in the room with her, like I could feel the bad energies emitting from her being. So I just left the room and later on I got fed up with her being sad, it was bringing me down too. I demanded her to disconnect her Internet and I dragged her away from the computer and I told her to let go of all her bad feelings and dance with me, just feel the music. She just couldn't get into it. She wasn't in the same place I was in. I hugged her and I kissed her but she wasn't in the same place. I hurt inside. I left her alone, she was madly pedaling away on her exercise bike, I could hear what she was thinking 'Go faster fatty,' I could hear her calling herself fat in her head so I told her she wasn't fat 'cos she just isn't, and I kept on dancing.
