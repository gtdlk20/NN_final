Anyway I hurried over to my parents house for some quick food before the 7pm 'doors open' time.  My Dad advised me to take the E before eating dinner as he claimed it would take an hour to kick in.  He told me 'Two tablets is a low dose, five is rather a lot.'  Being a cautious creature, I was happy just to take two.  He had four.  I swallowed them down quickly with some mineral water.  My much younger brother was in the house and we didn't want him to see anything.  We sat down to eat the food my Dad had made.  After no more than twenty minutes I started to feel very cold.  I wasn't sure, was it the drugs, was it just a bit cold?  The hairs on my arms were standing up.  Soon after, still eating, I experienced a 'swimmy' feeling and felt unco-ordinated.  I said to my Dad, 'I'm feeling a bit funny already.'  He said I might be right.  The food became rather unappetising after that and I couldn't finish it.  I quickly went upstairs to change my top and put some make up on.  When I looked in the mirror I could see my pupils were huuuuge.  I decided against using my eyeliner - I was afraid I might poke it into my eye!
