I didn't pay much attention to what time it was when I dosed, but the first effects came along after about 20-30 mins in the form of a desperate need to poop. It was only when I turned the bathroom light on that it really hit me. And BOY did it hit me! The room was covered in an orange glow (It's normally a clean off-white). My body and mind were in absolute chaos. I was warm in every sense of the word, except for my fingers, which were cold. I managed to grab a quick look at my pupils in the mirror (yep, massive) before collapsing onto the toilet.
