It was a Friday night and a male friend of mine picked me up from my house (about 7pm). He said that we were going to go to a small fast food place to 'pick up' - which ment get E - . I had rolled about 2 weeks before that and had had a good time, so I decided to prepare my mind for a really clear X-perience. I tired to expell all negative vibes in my body by tensing up differnt parts of my body and relaxing them in about 10 seconds. I went from head down to toes while I lay in the car seat in reclined position. I felt very at ease.
