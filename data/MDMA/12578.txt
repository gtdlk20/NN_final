We hung out all night.. didn't kiss.. didn't have sex... we DID TALK... let me tell you. I have read and heard people talk about having bonding experiences and being able to open up but I've never been in the right atmosphere. But this time I took full advantage of it.. I don't remember every detail but afterwards it felt as if the world itself had been lifted off my shoulder. We talked about us first meeting, why I was hesitant about speaking to her, I discussed my family, my mom, the list goes on. It was the best 'therapy session' I had ever had.
