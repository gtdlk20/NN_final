This is kind of a 'non-trip' report, but I think it's worth sharing.  I thought I'd try 'plugging' an E (anal insertion) because of the supposedly higher absorbtion.  I'm moderately experienced with a wide range of drugs (K hole fun, Salvia not), but have only taken E twice before (both oral).  The first time could certainly be described as 'profound'.  I think you know what I mean.  Anyhow, I have a scale to gauge the E experience against.
