Getting the pills was a semi-complicated process, which involved picking up a drunk kid to give us directions to the kid's house who was selling it to us.  We picked up 3 pills, and as a nice gesture I dropped the kid off 20 minutes away.  He had popped a pill when he got in my car and by the time we had gotten to the destination his pupils had gotten huge, and he became extremely talkative, I noticed that he had called an ex-girlfriend and was trying to explain the mechanics of their relationship in one of the nicest ways I've ever heard.  Stoner and I walked him into the house he was staying at, he walked around feeling the carpet and kept making a girl rub his face.  This heightened my curiosity in taking the pill.  I drove home and picked up a Gatorade on the way back to my house and took the pill with the drink right before going into my house.  My original gameplan was to hang out in my basement and watch some movies and play some video games.  I wasn't aware of the intense feelings, and for some reason I just planned it out as if I were smoking some cannabis.  It was about 2:00am by the time we had taken the pills and gotten down my basement.  Within 20 minutes Stoner noticeably starting feeling it, he continually petted the pillows in my basement, and petted my cat.  His desire to hold a conversation increased greatly although the content of the conversations consisted of 'TIMMMAH! YOU FEELING IT?'.
