+6:40. Shortly before getting to my parent's home, her 3rd memory recall episode occurred, but due to the drug mostly having worn off she wasn't as prepared to handle it. Beginning to cry, she began asking why he abused her, how could anyone claim to love you when you beg them not to physically hurt you as they ignore your pleas and assault you so badly you fear for your life? We arrived at my parent's house and I was able to explain to her how this memory just reinforced the fact things would never be the same. If she went back, he would just beat her again, it would never stop, and this memory came to solidify her conviction to put whatever love she had for him in the past.
