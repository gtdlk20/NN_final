Overall I am surprised by the presentation of the intensity of effects.  While truly record setting on my personal scale, the effects were deep, powerful, and insightful.  There was no fast paced rolling.  I do not believe tolerance kept me from the jaw-clench, chatterbox, overly lovey sensations, or regrettable under-the-influence decision making that often occur when I take medium to high-level dosages of MDMA.  It felt more like I got in the fast lane of the euphoric stimulant superhighway and blew past my previous all time highs with this substance.  The surpassing of previous thresholds was so quick that I found myself immediately transported into a one-of-a-kind transcendental form of existence.
