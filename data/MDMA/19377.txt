At T+60 (midnight), I felt some weird tinglings about the brain, usually a precusor to the full-on MDMA experience, but the rush was not coming (I usually take T+90 to peak).  Others in the group were experiencing the same thing, even those who usually peak at T+30.  But the tingling continued to intensify and by T+120 (1am) the full force came crashing down upon us.  Some strobing visual effects were present, but as we had nothing particularly interesting to look at, other hallucinations were not observed.  We were pretty floored for a short period of time, but regained our heads fairly quickly.  Some reported feelings of nausea, (2 vomiters) but I felt no worse than shrooms or MDMA.
