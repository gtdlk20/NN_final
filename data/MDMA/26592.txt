I took MDMA the first time when I was 21 yo during a journey in Spain with 6 friends of mine and it was great, amazing only good vibes; then I took it now and then (like once per month) in electronic or drum 'n' bass festivals and techno raves but I definitely found my dimension in GOA parties, open-air spaces along the weekend in central Italy near Bologna until I was 27. In this period we experiences two really bad trips but after some time it was fine again. In the past 3 years I stop because the situation and the people I was hanging around changed but this winter I went to a minimal/electronic event and I took some MDMA again.
