Jan 5th: After taking 7 milligrams of Adderall, I feel similar to yesterday, but not as dreamy. I get very tired after doing the simplest of tasks. IÂ’m now taking vitamin C for the cold and it seems to be much better. Introspection is at its highest today. Motivation to actually do anything is zero. Eyesight is better, still not clear.
