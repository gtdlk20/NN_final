Two days later I have decided to stop using drugs and get clean. My body feels abused and I am very mentally cloudy. I rarely get depressed but the last few weeks have been a struggle, and drugs are not helping. This is definitely not me at my greatest potential and so I have resolved to do better. I suspect a portion of this motivation is coming from my MDMA experience. I smoked weed today and all it did for me was create more of these thoughts, albeit much stronger and more emotionally charged.
