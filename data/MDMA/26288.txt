+1:30 we got to the gas station, the stars looked so beautiful on our walk. And I felt so in love with and connected to D. When we walked in the gas station I felt as if as I was warming up my body was buzzing. It was like everything was beautiful and I could feel its energy, and its place in the world. We were stuck standing behind this woman who had to buy like 100 lotto tickets. We were waiting in line for 20 minutes and all we wanted was cigarettes.
