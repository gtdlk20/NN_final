I took my first one and anxiously awaited.  After about fifteen minutes I began to feel a dreamlike warmth wrapping around my body.  The onset began slowly and gradually like I was being lifted up   and the world around my slowly became more open and brighter.  After about ten minutes my stomach became a little queasy but I didnt feel as if I was going to throw up.  It felt like a little ball in my stomach but then felt as if it was expanding throughout my body, but as it spread it went from a queasy feeling to a rushing tingling sensation it moved out and then up in a rush throughout my face and it felt as though  it moved all the way to the tip of my hip length hair. It had been a long time since I had felt a rush so clean and pure but at the same time intense.  It was a perfect moment.  I opened my huge eyes and saw my home for the first time in this frame of mind  since Hurricane Katrina.  I felt a beautiful sense of certainty and completion looking around and seeing my home even though progress is still minimal.  And for the first time I saw good in the devastation I survived.  I thought about how we had no money, no home and FEMA would not aid us, but I thought of everything we accomplished since then.  For the first time in over a year I didnt fell bitter about what happened to me I was happy about it.  One of the worst things that could ever happen to someone happened to me its over and I survivedIm still picking up the pieces but I realized God wouldnt have taken me this far just to let me fall.
