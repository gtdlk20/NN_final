I have always suffered from this condition. Sex was always painful in the beginning and the area would become swollen and extremely painful after a few minutes. I used to blame it on my former and current partners' penis size, but that really has nothing to do with it. I have not had any trauma, I am open about sex, I have a very loving partner with whom I have had great experiences, so it made no sense to me.
