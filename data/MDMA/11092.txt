All in all, if used the right way, I truly believe ecstasy is an amazing drug. It makes me feel so much closer to loved ones, and the feelings are completely real, unlike being drunk, where I just want to say 'I love everyone!!' and I don't really mean it. On E, I feel like I can say anything and have people respond in a good way. I want to pour my heart out and share my wonderful feelings with everyone else. I highly reccommend it, but only if you have thought and planned ahead, and know the risks and precautions involved. This is not a drug to be fucked with, but it has great benefits if used correctly.
