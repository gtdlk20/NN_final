A girl that I had never met before, but is a good friend of my male friend who was driving came along. The people who were on E were my female friend, the girl and myself. The new girl sat in the back with me while I waited for my pill to kick in. We all decided to go to this rave where there were supposed to be really good visuals. About 15 minutes later, I started to feel very relaxed and at ease. All the problems of my past week drifted away and the muscle excersises I did previously made my muscles relax. This was at about 8:15 or so. The music in the car had a really strong bass line and the vibrations were going into my hands that were on each side of me. A kind of undescribable 'traveling' sound was coming up louder and louder in the music as if someone was falling in a tunnel. As soon as it reached the climax of that song, I started to feel really strong vibrations going up my spine and into my brain. It felt like someone was 'plucking' my brain and it was wonderful. I looked over to the girl I had just met next to me and I realized how beautiful she was. I am bi-sexual, but I had never really acted upon any feelings I had for other women. I closed my eyes and put my head down on my knees. I really enjoyed the feeling of my head against my knees as if I was menting into pure love for this girl.
