I took 120mg at around 1pm. A friend of mine took his dose only 20 minutes before. We were just at home, hanging out with our close friends in a relaxed environment. About an hour in I was able to see it affecting him. Slowly getting more giddy, being totally fascinated with touch, etc. So I waited for my turn since I was only 20 minutes behind, after all. I got plenty of body load. Like the same kind of tenseness that I've felt on LSD so many times. I thought this was a good sign and I kept waiting, but nothing really happened beyond that. No change in mood, no tactile fun. I checked and my pupils were extremely dilated - I felt reassured that, yes, I was in fact on drugs. My friend was having a great time and wandered off after a while with a third friend who was on LSD. And I kind of just laid there, listening to music for several hours. Not because the music was having some different effect on me, but because I was extremely relaxed to the point of not really being able/motivated to do anything else. Actually, I felt really sleepy. I tried to nap because I had given up at that point on having a typical rolling experience, but I couldn't sleep at all because I was still on a psychedelic. So for at least half of the time, I laid on the couch with my eyes closed, listening to music, and physically tense from the body load. for at least half of the time, I laid on the couch with my eyes closed, listening to music, and physically tense from the body load. I had other sober friends around; I didn't feel like talking to them at all. I ate dinner at one point and later took a melatonin when I wanted to go to bed.
