I pick up Michael and another friend whom we'll call Don from their house.  Both are very excited, I'd say as excited as I am, even though they won't be dropping any e-bombs.  We drive to a park by a lake that we've designated as our meeting spot.  My ecstasy is starting to kick in, so I drop my second pill with 2 vitamin C tablets.  The rap music we have playing sounds amazing to my ecstasy-infused ears, but my mindset is still pretty sober.  Usually, it hits me harder, but I had a full stomach and had just done ecstasy the night before.
