The big day came 1 year and 7 days after my last experience.  The scenario was a rave in the parking lot of a shopping mall (I live in a 2 million people city, so there was a lot of people there), best DJs in the country would be there and I was looking forward to it.  And, the most important, we (me and 3 friends) finally had the pills.
