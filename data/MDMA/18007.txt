Another point I remember is when they played a song called 'King of Snake'.  The only lyrics I'd ever made out from this song before were basically 'King of snake, king of snake'.  This time however, I could swear he was sometimes singing 'You've got to drink, drink, drink, drink and pee, drink and pee.'  Then later, 'There's a lot of teeth grinding, teeth grinding.'  Naturally I took this to be a direct reference to, or even advice to, the people in the crowd who had taken Ecstasy.  This knowledge of, and acceptance of, the drug use of the audience made me feel like there was a strong connection and sympathy between Underworld and the rest of us.  Another time I remember is when the screen on the stage showed the audience - everyone cheered and waved at themselves.  Then the pictures of the audience started to move about, in a way that was very reminiscent of how people move when they dance.
