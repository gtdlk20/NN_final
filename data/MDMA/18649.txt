A note to consider, I am not the most talkative member of my group of friends, meaning I'm not the class clown or the joker member of the group which is always conversing and socialzing. I mostly just like to chill and enjoy their company. However, as the effects of the pill became apparent, I enetered a whole new world with these people I'd never experienced. Suddenly, I was the center of attention. I sat in the middle and began talking, began taking charge. Listening to every word with heart and undivided attention I quickly recived the attention of the whole household. Talking louder, I spoke with more confidence and emotion in my words and facial expressions than I had ever before all awhile being and feeling totally sincere. Everything that came out of my mouth was funny, smart, or inspirational. The awkwardness was gone.
