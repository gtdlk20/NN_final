I arrived at the diving center at ten minutes until 10 am on a monday morning, when I expected it to be the least busy.  I checked in, and saw there was only one person diving with me.  The instructor asked if anyone had to go to the bathroom before we got started, so I said yes, went into a stall, and popped the pill at 10 exactly.
