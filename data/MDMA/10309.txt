When we arrive at the mall I discover yet another quality of the MDMA; movement is effortless.  I am walking more gracefully and easily than I ever thought was possible.  Another interesting thing I noticed is that women seemed drawn to me.  Every one that passed me smiled back, with many even going so far as to strike up conversations or make flirty remarks as we went by.  Its marvelous what can happen when one sends out such pure, positive vibes.
