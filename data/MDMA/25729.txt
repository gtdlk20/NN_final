An officer of the law decided to stop in and the party was busted. All I could say to my friend was 'after party after party.' I wanted to roll and roll and roll. Thank god there is a natural shut off point it seems or even my will power would be tested. However, I was still rolling the next day when I had to get on my flight and was doing little dancemoves down the terminal. I was still rolling when I woke up the next day and proceeded to turn on the house and trance. This was also an incredible time as I just thought and danced, thought and danced alone in my room.
