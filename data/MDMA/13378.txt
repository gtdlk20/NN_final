A buddy of mine, we'll call J, picked up some E from a friend of his about a week prior to our trip. Another friend of mine, who we'll call P, had never tried ecstasy and really wanted to have an experience with it. It was in the middle of the summer and we'd all been rollin for the most part of summer, just eatin any e that came by(not a good idea at all). That summer pretty much came to a halt after our experience. We all met up at a buddys place and swallowed our pills down with a bit of water. We decided to go walk to a nearby park with J and P and smoke some joints, it was about an hour after we had eatin our E and nothing was going on, nothing at all, no one was feeling a thing. We walked to yet another nearby park to sell a gram of weed to a friend. When we got there it was about 2+ since we dropped our pills, we were rollin like there was no tomorrow. I was talking a lot more than I would usually talk on E, letting some personal information to people who I didnt know too well at all. That was only a start though, I had basically no feeling of euphoria that I would usually get on E, I was thinking to myself, 'Holy fuck I think I've lost the magic of ecstasy'. Both my two buddys felt basically the same as I had described to them.
