After dosing we went about getting the music together, and gathering water and blankets and the other creature comforts we enjoyed while tripping.  When we could start to feel it come on we decided to run up and down the stairs a few times to get the blood pumping.  We felt kind of ridiculous so were laughing and having a good time.  My friend was starting to feel it pretty strong, so I loaded the bong for her to smoke some pot.  So she did and immediately started feeling sick.   I held her hair as she threw up.  Although she did trip that night, I estimate that she lost about half of her original dose, and so she didn't have as intense an experience as I did.
