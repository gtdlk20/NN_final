NEXT DAY: still feeling super, still rubbing things, talking, thoughts are simple and stress is gone. Sunlight on face is divine. Thinking changes. I'm more friendly, accepting, music is still super, I bonded with all the stuff we listened while rolling. No stress, thoughts like a child, why can't world be friendly? Can't watch violence, too hurtful.Couldn't stand being alone. That night I felt very sad, but still wanted to talk and have fun. Make sure you will be around friends for following two days. Don't drink on following two nights, it puts you somewhere between x come down and drunk, very strange and not good.
