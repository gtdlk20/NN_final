Suddenly he reappeared and we started walking very quickly towards the venue.  I felt light and floaty, it was easy to hurry along.  It was much later than we had intended by now, although my perception of time was very distorted and I kept checking it on my phone.  We chatted away, feeling more relaxed now that we were on the move.  I had an awfully dry mouth by this time so we stopped in a corner shop to buy some water.  We sipped some and I felt better.  At the start of our walk I felt very cold and my Dad gave me his jacket to wear.  But by the time we reached the corner shop I was feeling very warm and gave him back the jacket, taking off my sweater as well.
