Around 5PM I went home and went to bed, and didn't wake up until 10AM the next morning, and I had a dream that lasted all night.  It was a dream that I was on acid, I had all sorts of other dreams, but I was on acid in every dream I had that night, it was pretty strange, and it was the nicest night of sleep in a long time.
