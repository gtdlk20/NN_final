Occasionally during the buildup in songs (almost to the climax), thousands of strobe lights would go off, and my eyes would go out of focus and roll to the back of my head. It was such an intense, awesome feeling. During one song I held on to my sister and yelled, Holy shit! I cant handle this! Then I was given countless numbers of light shows, all of which were absolutely amazing. Ryans friend Timmy gave me a lightshow with an orbit and I was in a total trance, in a total world. My eyes just focus completely on the lights (then blur out), the feel of the bass rushing through my veins, and the high pitch of the synthesizers flowing so smoothly. It was indescribable. Ryan was sitting next to me looking at me get the light show, though I was so in a trance I didnt know he was there and until Timmy said holy shit, this guys already fucked up! and then Ryan yelled thats called over-stimulation!!! Nevertheless, it was all amazing. Timmy or Ryan, I honestly dont remember which gave me an incredible neck and head massage where he would rotate my whole head and then do lots of meticulous things with his fingers that I could feel in detail. It felt like I was visiting a chiropractor. Every touch felt so precise, not to mention, so damn good.
