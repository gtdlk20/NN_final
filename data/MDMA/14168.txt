from the restaurant I made a phonecall to my Father who drove me home.  by this time I was still feeling some secondary effects such as dizziness and serenity. but generally I could understand the situation, and easily respond to it.  i had told my Father that I didn't really enjoy the show at the Theater, and had decided I'd had enough and wanted to go home.  He believed me.
