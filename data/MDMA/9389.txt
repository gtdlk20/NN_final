I sat with my friend for a long time and we talked about her future, and the people that she would meet and we made great plans.  By now my friend was starting to come down, so she went upstairs to lay down and go to sleep.  Dawn was coming but I was still very much awake and I felt as though I was downloading information from above constantly.  Among the information I received was how to protect myself while in an open state psychically, as well as the kind of information I should pass on when I see someone's future, and the kind of information that I should keep to myself.
