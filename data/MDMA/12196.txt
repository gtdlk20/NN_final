As for coming down the next day is a nothing day for me, not hungry, not sleepy, but my brain is in too much of a recovery mode for anything too strenuous. We generally spend the day together reliving the ride. Enjoying each other. The day after is usually a day that requires more strength to function, I fall deeply into a state of sadness. Tears flow because of stupid things. It is as if all the flaws that were gone whilst I was rolling become magnified by a hundred. But I wouldnÂ’t trade this sadness for a night pinging of my guts, ever.
