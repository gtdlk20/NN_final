The first thing I did when I woke up was give me and C a 5-HTP and vitamin B6. I believe I actually took two 5-HTPs. Which just about saved me. We had to leave and get back to my house fairly early. Surprisingly I didnt feeling entirely horrible at first. I was just very scattered, mentally, and I found it difficult to motivate myself to clean stuff. Eventually, however, we gathered all of our stuff and got it ready to go. We did a final check and left our room with our stuff. We had to make two trips to the parking garage but Im kind of glad for it. Right about when I first left the hotel room, as I was shutting the door, I felt the comedown really hit me. I felt like dying. Anxiety and severe depression crept in, mixed with whatever residual effects of alcohol. Thankfully the 5-HTP began to work its magic as I started walking around and breathing in the cool, fresh, outside air. We loaded up the car and checked out. I felt pretty decent again as we were walking to the check out/in office. So here is a good tip for comedowns: take the supplements, and go for a walk, as shitty as it feels. It will help flush out some of the toxins. We checked out and drove home. The drive back was pretty decent. I didnt feel too horrible and the traffic wasnt too bad.
