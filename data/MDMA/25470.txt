GOR was kind enough to babysit me that night.  He was the guy who made the trips to the bathroom sink to fill up my water bottles.  I highly recommend anyone who has never rolled and raved for the first time to attach themselves to a veteran who knows what they are doing.  A good friend who won't pull some shady shit and try to slip his hand in your pants because your rolling.  Someone who will help out the vibe, and make sure you are not doing something stupid (like drinking alchohol or anything that isn't water).
