It surprises me how people go to raves and dance. I guess thats what extroverts are into doing, but I guess this confirms the mystery of if Im an introvert or an extrovert. I am an introvert who likes to please other people, but feels awkward doing so because I am so introverted. Because I am introverted, I care what people think of me. I get lonely so thats when I want to see other people. I dont like having millions of friends because thats just too much work! I want to have time to myself! You cant get deep with so many people at once!! I like having few friends. Then again, I worry about calling them so much. I worry what they think of me. They are introverts who are subtle and just like to have normal lives. I want to enjoy the extremes of life. I think I scare them. I attach to them because I want to be close to people. I really hope that I dont suffocate them. I moved away from home, yet I have to talk to them so much.
