In closing, I would just like to mention briefly some differences from this trip compared to past trips.  First of all, the place where we were staying was a powerful and magical place, and I was having visual weirdness and strange feelings even before we took the MDMA.  In past trips there, I have noticed that my body feels strangely heavy and light alternately, and that I have always been more psychic there than elsewhere.  Also, in the past when I ingest ecstasy, I'm always the last of my group to feel it.  It seems that I metabolize drugs slower than other people.  This time I felt it almost as soon as my friend did.  And, toward the end of the night, when other people are coming in for a soft landing and look forward to staying up a while and talking, I have always crashed very hard and all at once, followed by four or five hours of sleep, and then what I call a 'slow day', usually a big meal and lots of TV. watching, but not much else.  Perhaps sitting in the park for a while, enjoying the way the sun feels.
