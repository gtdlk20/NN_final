I will never forget the experience described in this report and I hope to continue to draw inspiration from it in the future.  In some ways that fateful afternoon where I skipped class to ingest powders reset my personal scale for happiness and interconnectedness between other people, the planet we live on, and myself.  IÂ’ve experienced relief from anxiety and stress through a number of substances before but this provided more than temporary suppression of negative feelings.  This obliterated them to the point that I was able to re-realize how wonderful living can be.
