After drinking the second dose about 15-20 minutes went by, then it all came on at once. First I felt my body go completely numb, however I could tell I had the cold sweats almost instantly. Marc and I immediately got down on our knees facing each other and started running our hands through my carpet and touching our legs, my dog also came over and she got some good pets and we rubbed our faces against hers she felt incredibly soft and smooth. After a little bit we got up and moved to the couch, I think we were trying to collect our thoughts and really figure out what was happening.
