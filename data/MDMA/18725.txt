The third time I tried XTC, I did it at my home with 4 other friends. The previous times I had done it with only my boyfriend. I planned on having a 'rolling party' while my parents were out of town. I took my pill when my boyfriend did, before my friends got there. When I was in my garage smoking a cigarette I suddenly vomited blue kool-aid all over the floor! I had never vomited from XTC before. However, this did not make the experience any less pleasent, I would say it made it even better! With vomit all over my face and clothes I looked horrible but felt wonderful. I walked up the stairs to the shower and I felt like I was walking throught Jell-O. The shower afterward was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced in my life. It felt like I was being enveloped in a warm soothing liquid blanket that made me feel safe. I returned to my friends who were now rolling in the garage. One was dancing to Lords of Acid and feeling her body all over. One was sucking on a pacifier. One was smoking weed, and one was just sitting there petting my cat.
