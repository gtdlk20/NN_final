Based on my experience with this substance long ago (fifteen or so years), I can report that I am certain it was very clean, and there were no physical hangovers. I spent most of the time stretching, and had a mild sweat during which time I felt that I was flushing out deep seated toxins from my body through the E and the stretching.
