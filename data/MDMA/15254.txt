I should note that I used far less material than usual for an oral dose; in a capsule I take at least 200mgs and usually boost. 75mgs seems to be pretty cool, and the side effects of my larger oral doses are minimized: No sweating, jaw clenching, overheating, urine retention or Nystigymus (eye wiggle that makes it hard to read) seem to be present. To minimize these unpleasant effects from the higher oral doses I need to achieve any effects from MDMA, I may stick to this ROA. It's corrosive, but so was all that cocaine, and I'm not nearly as big an Ecstasy guy as I was for cocaine. I don't think a few times a year is gonna do any more damage than coke already has.
