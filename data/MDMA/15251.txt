I am not a fan of snorting drugs, mostly due to bad experiences with cocaine where the insufflation never stops and real damage occurs, it hurts to breathe through the nose, horribly colored snot, and of course, the blood. I snorted my way to having pinholes for sinuses, I just kept doing it because the other option was a cook-up, and I didn't want to go down that road...again. The practice of insufflation stuck as something I do not enjoy. Snorting is my least favorite ROA for any compound, though I still do it from time to time if the mood is right. DPT for instance, is a powerful tryptamine along the lines of DMT, but it needs to be vaped or snorted for a proper effect. I hear vaping DPT feels even weirder than snorting it, so that's the ROA I decided on. To make this brief, on occasion I bite the bullet and roll up a $20 to make some powder(s) disappear. Today, for reasons no one can rightly explain, I wanted to find out what snorted MDMA feels like.
