I had procured a couple of tablet of MDMA from a reliable source, and was told it was very good and pure X. Up to this point, my wife and I had an extensive drug history, with years of IV use. I was curious to find out what mainlined MDMA was like. I crushed the tablet in a spoon, disolved it in water and drew the liquid into a syringe. There was a little undissolved substance left. I tied off and got a register immediately. I pushed it in. I started to feel a ringer coming on like shooting coke, but less pronounced, but then I was hit by the X. All material reality around me turned into molecules of color, very random and confused, and it sounded like chipmonks chattering in my mind. Chip and Dale from those old cartoons. I sat dumbly down on the bed and said to my wife, 'better do only half, my dear.' My body just expelled all this sweat. I must have dumped a gallon of sweat five minutes. The thought came to me that this might mean a trip to the hospital. The rush continued for about a half hour or so. It just kept coming on and on like some trainwreck. Very unpleasant and frightening. I had to remove all my clothes as they were soaking wet. Finally the rush tapered off and I felt I was out of danger. I vowed never to do something so stupid ever again. I haven't picked up a rig since I feel like I almost died and my head got so hot, I'm sure I fried more than a couple of neurons.
