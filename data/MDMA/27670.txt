The come down was horrific  I do not usually suffer from hangovers and even when I have consumed a large volume of alcohol I generally only experience mild discomfort/upset stomach.  Headache was equivocal to a migraine, jaw extremely sore from clenching/grinding the previous night.  My stomach was also very painful however this could possibly be attributed to alcohol or a current medical condition.  I experienced extreme dizziness/vertigo for the following 2 days.  I felt a return to the trip at around 14 hours after consumption.  Appetite loss lasted until 42 hours after ingestion.
