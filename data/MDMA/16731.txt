At first I started seeing a hutch to my right. At first I started seeing a hutch to my right. It was very vivid and had a ton of detail it was dark and woven.  Then I looked up at the street lights and they changed colors from yellow to orange and had a glass lamp over them.  Then when I was looking past the street light I saw a round almost like a baby toy but it was bigger than my neighbors two story house and it had squares in it and some popped out with different signs on it. I closed my eyes to see if it was really there but it wasnÂ’t it disappeared.  Then I told my friend what I saw and he said he could see the hutch but not the ball. Then when I looked straight ahead where there was a dead tree with no leaves on it the tree turned into a palm tree with really bright colored branches that moved in the wind. They were baby blue, baby pink, yellow and the bottom of the tree was like a palm tree it was really really pretty.  Then I left my back door open and all the lights were out and there was this dog that was walking in and out of my house and a man appeared in the doorway he looked almost like a hunter but he never came out of the doorway.  He seemed like he was a hunter.  Then there was another dog that came out and went back in throughout my trip. I think that my neighbor really made me paranoid but this felt so real it was crazy.
