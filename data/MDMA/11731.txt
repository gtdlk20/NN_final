I didnt have to wait long - within perhaps 15 minutes my vision and spatial perception began to distort; my body became very warm and I had extremely vivid closed-eye hallucinations, like lightning on the back of my eyelids. I became very afraid, as this was not how I remembered the climb feeling on x I became very afraid, as this was not how I remembered the climb feeling on x (more of a wave of pleasure), and I feared we may have taken something else (just writing this is making my hands sweat). I stood and felt a burning sensation in my head as if my brain were on fire. I opened the window and began taking off my clothes slowly, and asked E, making sure to keep my voice very calm and measured, if he had his phone handy in case we had to call the emergency services. I was convinced at this point that I was going to die (though I was not outwardly in hysterics). E was evidently also beginning to feel it, as he began talking very quickly and moving with jerky motions. At least, I believe this is the case, though my time perception may have been skewed and only made it seem that way. I asked E to talk more slowly and laid down on the floor, closing my eyes and breathing deeply. (EDIT: E says he was not feeling the effects by this point; my perception was simply distorted enough to see him as if he was in fast-forward.)
