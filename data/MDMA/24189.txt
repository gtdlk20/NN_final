I suddenly felt all warm and slight dizziness but that was alright. My friends walked up to me to ask if I was feeling alright and I said yes. Thats when the party really started picking up and I started to jump dance and move around. For someone of my build I do not dance at all, I'm more of a spectator but for that night I felt like dancing and didnt care what they were thinking.
