The rest of the night I hung out with my sister and Ryans group again, doing the same as wed been doing all night. I remember looking at my phone and realizing everything was about to end in 15 minutes and told my sister, I dont want this to end! and she replied They should just keep it goin. Finally it was over. No more flashy lights. No more intense music. The arena we were in was once again just that. We left and I was still happy and feeling the drug, but it was definitely slowly dissipating. It didnt help that almost everyone else was pretty much down at this point. We walked back to the hotel at 4am. We head up to Ryans room where my sister and I use the restroom and then head to our car. At this point Im coming down and feel extremely physical tired, but my brain...the best way to describe it is, it felt like there was a storm in my brain. Just like 1314230423 things going on at once. At this point I realize Ive been on a drug for the past few hours! We then attempted to drive to my brothers apartment in Orange County. My sister, who was no longer under the influence was driving. She kept smoking cigarettes in the car, and that made me feel nauseous, even though Id been smoking a lot throughout the night. Then she turned up some trance on her radio real loud and I just had to turn it down cuz it made my head throb with pain. I got this super horrible headache right smack in the center of my forehead. I had this weird feeling like taking 3 that night might have been too much, but then I told myself that I just needed to go to bed. It was all in my mind. We finally arrive to my brothers place and I immediately hop in bed and try to sleep, even though my head was still ringing. Coming down on e is when you realize, Damn, this is a DRUG. It aint pot or alcohol. My brain felt used.
