My decision to try MDMA was strictly for therapeutic purposes. I used pure MDMA crystal (tested) in all 3 experiences. The setting was inside my home. On the last two experiences, I prepared with blankets, meditation music, ginger tea and ginger candy drops. I fasted the night before and had dry toast before taking the dose.
