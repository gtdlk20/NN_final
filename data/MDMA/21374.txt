My second experience with ecstasy was 1 month and a half later than the first one. I had promised myself that I was going to take a 2 months break at least, but the situation was really good to use it, so I did it. This time, it wasnt in a nightclub, but in a large event that plays diverse kinds of music, like Brazilian funk, Brazilian Sertanejo and also deep music at the end. I felt different from the first one, maybe because of the composition of the tablet or maybe because of the vibe of the event. I was feeling a strong necessity for talking with my friends, to open up my feelings and be sincere with things I couldnt say sober (after I realized that I was indeed saying things that are true and I couldnt say sober but some little lies were being said too, because of the emotional boost). It was very pleasant, the bond we made and the profundity of the talks. I saw one of my best friends kissing a girl that I liked and I was very comfortable with it, with no bad feelings at all and even a good feeling about the couple. Then I started kissing a girl in the party, my mouth was very dry at the start but it got better during the kiss and drinking beer. The sensation of the kiss was very good, not beyond incredible like I expected it but still nice.
