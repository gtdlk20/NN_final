Last night, while I was at a party in the famous hippie enclave, a charming little village on the outskirts of Amsterdam. The people who live and work there are mainly artists, writers, old hippies and otherwise alternative folks. They host and organize many artistic and cultural activities there. Among which is a monthly goa/psytrance party, which is held in the old church near the center of the village. A party in a church means a wonderful atmosphere of course, heightened by the many projections on the walls and other light effects. The church is rather small though, so apart from a bar and dance floor there isnÂ’t much to see there.
