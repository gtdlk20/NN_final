Then I began to sweat and sweat and sweat.  My blinking increased speed and then everything went black.  And I saw changing colors on a black canvas.  Green, blue, red, and then I saw a black silhouette of a face in front of me, with the backdrop being the black colored canvas.  Then I saw another silhouette, and a third.  The silhouettes were evenly spaced in a circle almost.  I knew this was wierd.  Then I hear my name being called, and called, and called.  Then I realize that I was lying on my back looking up at the ceiling of the venue.  The changing colors had been the lights from the stage reflecting off of the ceiling.  The silhouettes were people around me that were trying to get me to wake up.
