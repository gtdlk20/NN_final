As a resident of the city of New Orleans, I have had more than my share of mind-altering substances.  I also just 2 months ago just was able to return home due to the devastation my city faced.  I suffered PTS after the storm and frequently found myself depressed over everything I know gone.  My whole life literally gone in a flash all my possessions, gone.  Friends family an entire community gone.  After I found myself always lamenting the past, wanting it back, more or less trying to find a way to get it back.  The country doesnÂ’t realize what we went through and are still going through.  Progress is so minimal and help is so hard to get.
