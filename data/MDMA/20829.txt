A good friend of mine, who I dont get to see very often, was visiting the city I live in, and flying out the next morning.  We made plans for me to call him after getting back from the airport (which was around 10pm), and I did.  I had to work the next day (the temp office job during the day, then teach for a couple hours in the evening), and probably considered not drinking very much and getting home relatively early, but I didnt give it too much thought.
