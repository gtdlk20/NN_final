Incidentally, in the end, quitting that office job was a good thing.  It was utterly meaningless to me and a waste of time.  I regret that I did it in such a way that left the temp agency in a bad position, but burning that bridge was a kind of final moving-on thing for me.  Since then, I havent taken a single crappy job just because its easier than figuring out what it is I actually want to do.
