As I chain-smoked (as a smoker on Ecstacy I do!), he told me about his recent time at university. He had vaguely told me about this before. About how he had taken too many drugs and had ended up hearing voices. When he had told me about this before he said it with a grin: 'I heard voices and everything! Crraaazzzyyy!' But now he was telling me EXACTLY what had happened - how the voices had become constant for him. How these voices had said horrible things to him. How he had grown to be paranoid all the time. How his life had become a living hell. How he had taken a belt, and attached one end to his windowsill. How he had looped the other end around his neck and jumped out of a 3rd storey window.
