I started listening to music as I wrote. It was absolutely amazing; I tried listening to a lot of things and Im going to have to be a hippie and say classic rock sounded the best to me, probably because thats my all time favorite. The sounds of guitars just took my breath away. I also tried listening to techno and trance, it was pretty good but it didnt beat my favorite genre. Around 2:00am I decided to take my third pill.
