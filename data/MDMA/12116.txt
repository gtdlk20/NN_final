So, I guess my experience is that set and setting matter, even with E.  And that it seems possible that ecstasy couldve affected my brain in a way that made me more susceptible to depression afterwards, at least when I was already leaning towards it.  It also seems possible that ecstasy just has the potential to bring up unconscious material that isnt always pleasant, in the days following the high  my unhappiness was definitely there long before this particular roll, it was just sort of buried.  Ive found a lot of stuff online about depression following ecstasy use (independent of set or setting), and the whole losing the magic phenomenon, and my experience might be an instance of one or both of those.  In any case, I think its valuable for anyone taking ecstasy (at least if youre relatively new to it), to know that people can get depressed afterwards.  But we dont necessarily, so the point of knowing isnt to worry about it.  Its just to know that if it happens to you, youre not the only one, and for many people it doesnt last that long.  I wish I had known that in the days following my roll, it might have made dealing with it a lot easier.
