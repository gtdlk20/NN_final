Either way, my buddy and I had nothing to do and were too fucked up to drive since the cops were closing the event...at 4 in the morning!  Luckily we had our 2 friends to guide us to another after party.  Of course, as luck would have it, there was no after party...but instead, someone played a cruel trick and posted a bunk one on a flier...which happened to be on a make-belief street.  I remember spending three hours triping hard (*e* has never lasted this long at this level of power) and following a crowd of zombie-looking ravers to a party that never existed.  It was pure hell...having the effects of the *e* wear off...only to see the real evil in the town and in all its residents and ravers.  It was straight out of Jacob's Ladder, the movie.
