We got over this whole thing quickly and just got back to the talking and whatever.  Around this time R asked me if I would front him a pill for him and A to split, and he assured me he would pay me back in a few days.  Mistake number two here for me, as I ended up not getting money from either of those two, and instead spent over 100 dollars that night, pills and weed combined.  Anyway, this is around t+1 30- 1 45 and I believe this is when I hit my first 'peak' as I was standing somewhat close to the fire, and I started to get insanely strong head and chest rushes.  I began to get worried, thinking I had OD'd, or was dehydrating so I asked R for some of his water.  I then realized how close I was to the massive bonfire, so I walked 20 feet back and sat down on the cool grass, taking off my sweatshirt and holding the cool water bottle to my chest.  I felt almost immediately better, and I was super speedy at this point.  Like my legs were bouncing around on their own accord, my whole body was rocking back and forth and I was just smiling huge the entire time.  This is when it really kicked in. I went from feeling fantastic, to feeling in-fucking-credible.  Thoughts flying a mile a minute, full closed-eye visuals, and all sorts of revelations about my life, what I want to do with it, my friends, etc.  The whole night I was wishing very much that I had my best friend with me to share in the experience, but he was busy that night.
