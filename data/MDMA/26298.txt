Somehow, around 8am we crashed. First I started getting really cold, so I wrapped myself in a blanket and it felt SOOO good. It was warm and cozy. D spent the night, and when I finally allowed him under my blanket he held me all night. I had some weird dreams but I donÂ’t really remember what they were.
