I have since had another dream with similar characteristics and so have 3 of my friends. I was sleeping next to my boyfriend the next time it happened, and when I woke up from the nightmare, I looked at him and he was shaking and jerking in his sleep. I woke him up and he had also been having bad dreams. They are similar: somebody or something is trying to hurt you or kill you and you think you wake up but your're really still sleeping.
