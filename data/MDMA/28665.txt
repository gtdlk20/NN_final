The trance stage was unbelievable because although I hadn't liked trance before the festival, I could see how it was perfect for the happy vibe that we were all in, our bodies seemed to devour the long buildups and melodies that were played. Every now and then the DJs would drop some absolute throwbacks that we used to listen to in our childhood and incorporate it into their mixes, and my heart would get so happy from singing to the lyrics that I'd heard 1000 times before. My brain was thinking so quick - I kept thinking to myself, how is it that we listen to these exact songs millions of times before this, but only get wild at festivals? I decided it was the vibe of everyone that was there and the pure love that everyone was showing towards the music. Whenever I conversed with somebody it would be at an incredibly fast pace.
