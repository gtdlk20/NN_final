Seeing as how it would be a risky night, being in the very same house as my sleeping parents, our first thought was to only take half a pill. So around 1:30am we took half a pill each. We waited about 50min with no effects. So around 2:20am we popped the other half. Within 30min, the only experienced user began feeling the drug's effects. She looked like she was having orgasms on my bedroom floor. She claimed it was the sensation of her shoulders rolling against my bed frame. Still my other friend and I felt nothing. So the experienced user took our hands and started to 'guide' us into the euphoric trip.  Which to my surprise worked.
