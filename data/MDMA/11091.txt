After this, even though our high was wearing off, we went into this store called In A Tranz, which just sells all these raver accessories and trippy stuff. We bought two little 99 cent glowsticks and chewed on them for the rest of the night, and just had fun staring at the strobe lights in the glow store. We got our ride home at about 9:00 pm, and I hugged G goodbye and thanked her for the evening. I then came home and proceeded to be unnaturally outgoing with my family, and took a warm bath and just relaxed and thought back over the night.
