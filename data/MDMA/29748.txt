I started thinking about alot of things that had been bothering me within the past few months.  I started realizing that I was growing a hatred towards different aspects of life itself, and that the hatred was directed at the wrong source.  All the while I should have been hating the true evil of the world, I was blaming our society, government, and culture for many things that were distressing me.  The MDA seemed to point me in the right direction, and help me understand that these underlying evils need to be pointed out, and lived against instead of lashing out against the government and society.  I started thinking about communism, and its bleeding into America.  People donÂ’t even realize it.  But with all the realizations, all I could really do is reaffirm my faith in God.  It is the only place I find peace of mind.  I believe the MDA pointed me to it.
