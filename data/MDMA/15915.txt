T+120min  -  for the past hour or so, I feel like I'm living for the first time, air seems to flow through me, there is not a single bad feeling or mood anywhere, I feel enhanced, reborn, and honest to say, this was probably  my happiest moment in my life. It seemed like my body was stretched, and I was a net, as music, thoughts, insight, and absolute ecstasy (thus the name) went straight through my entire body.  So much energy, so much happiness, I said to my self Oh my god  I was so happy that I could experience such a drug in my lifetime.  And I hold it as a very valuable memory.
