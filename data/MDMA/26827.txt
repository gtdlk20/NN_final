But in the end, I witnessed her making out with some half-naked guy in the corner.. and I felt my heart break.  I never got to say goodbye-- my friends caught up with me and dragged me outside and into the car.  We were headed for an afterparty.  And it was only midnight.  It felt like an eternity had gone by. I cried myself to sleep for two or three days.  And I never even got her phone number.
