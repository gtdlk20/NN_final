Do not take all of the capsules at once. My first time I took 2, then when that started to wear off I took the third. Then the rest of the times I have done it, I took one, waited like 30 minutes, took the 2nd, waited about 35-50 minutes and then took the third. You can really take as many as you want as long as they are spaced out. The molly I got was usually $15 per capsule but sometimes was $20.
