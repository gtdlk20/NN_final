We hit the town and suddenly I started to trip balls.  I've done a lot of acid, done some mescaline, eaten some crazy shrooms, and never tripped this hard in my life.  All the trees became people with their faces painted gold with crazy costumes on.  I honestly didn't know the difference between reality and my hallucinations.  My cigarette smoke became solid people that I would have to ask someone I knew was real if they were real or not.  The entire time, it didn't bother me.  Even though I didn't know the people I was hanging out with, I knew they had tripped before and didn't think I was crazy.  I still had never been happier.  I remember asking one person if he had a book written on his arm in strange heiroglyphics, when I realized everyone had those strange patterns all over them, I apologized to him and explained I had eaten a lot of drugs and was hallucinating.
