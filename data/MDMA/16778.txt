So after fighting all day on valentines day and I had been waitressing for seven hours at a restaurant, he decided that I could come over and we could hang out on the condition that if he asked me to leave, I had to leave. Around eleven I get to the house determined to cheer him up so first I act goofy, then I announce that I want to eat the molly and if he won't eat it with me I'll do it all by myself. He just had surgery on his nose so we ate it instead, first he licked his finger and dipped in the powder and fed it to me, then he ate some. We hung out for an hour, nothing really happened, so we ate more.
