We waited a bit and managed to get on a bus.  We sat at the back chattering nonsense, anticipating the gig and so on.  Suddenly my Dad said, 'Oh my God, I don't have THE TICKETS!'  He looked at me in horror.  I had a better grip on reality than he did, and quickly jumped up saying we'd have to get off the bus.  We had to push past a lot of drunk men who had got on after us.  As I passed a man near the front he said jovially, 'Have a good night!' Then he looked at me more closely and said, 'I'm sure you will...'  I thought he must have noticed my huge eyes.
