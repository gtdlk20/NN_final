The next few hours after B returned went without any more problems, and so the hours flew by.  We all talked and smoked a lot of weed the entire time, and overall it really was a great night.   We all started to crash at around 5 in the morning, so we went to sleep.  I woke up the next morning after only 5 hours of sleep, but strangely felt incredible still, and ended up having so much energy that I walked/hitch-hiked home instead of waiting around for 3 hours for my ride.
