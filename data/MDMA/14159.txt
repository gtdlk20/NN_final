this all seemed very logical at the time.  i assure you. under 'normal' law, this is CRAZY! but at the time i had felt 'normal' to be my enemy, 'normal' to be the product of years of fear, guilt and embarassment.  i felt 'normal' to be disgusting lies.  and even now, after returning to 'normal', i speak under embassassment and guilt for what i have done.  in a way, i've come back to my senses.  but in another way, i've built back up that wall, that 'disgusting barrier'.
