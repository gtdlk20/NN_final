So I began to really let myself go and not care how I seemed or appeared, what matters is that -I- love what I'm doing. Body language and psychology will transmit this to everyone around me. I literally raved and jigged about as if I was alone for about 2 hours  people began to sit by me, take pictures of me  A few people came and shook my hand, my mate Harry spotted me and came over (I think he was feeling a bit drained from the ecstasy he took) and I told him how Id come off the MDMA but had been listening to music for and hour, and about how I had work in the morning at 11:00 and it was about 4 or 5. He looked like he felt sorry for me, but I told him it was worth it, which it most certainly was. This comment amazed him and he promptly ran off to dance with a big grin. I blocked out the majority of things going on around me just to zone in the music  but it was awesome to know that I had inspired these people just by truly expressing myself without a concern for judgment.
