MDMA was a wonderfully positive experience and I would love to do it again at some point, but right now IÂ’ve got every intention to stay away from drugs. Something I noted was that as soon as I started thinking about my kids from work, it was almost impossible not to think about their impact on my life. I knew that a good part of my depression was because of losing them, but when I took ecstasy I was filled with so much self-love that I felt I owed it to myself to explore it. It got me thinking at the level I was subconsciously avoiding and definitely brought me a little more clarity and peace.
