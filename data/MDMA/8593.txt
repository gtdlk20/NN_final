I was reflecting on this experience in a nostalgic manner a few months ago.  My memory is generally below average, but the smells, sights, and sounds of this experience flood back with very little effort.  This is what initially triggered the idea of writing about this day so long after the fact.  I figured it would be an enjoyable project if only for myself.  I knew I had handwritten notes from the experience in a journal, but I feared they would be far too sparse to put together something I was comfortable sharing with the internet.
