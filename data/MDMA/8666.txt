The next morning I did not experience any negative hangover type effects.  In fact, I felt well rested and filled with positive thoughts and feelings.  Stress was nowhere to be found.  I continued to experience abnormally high levels of happiness and abnormally low amounts of stress for over a week.  Anhedonia was not present during this elongated after-effects period.  I felt almost the exact opposite.  I was motivated and engaged in both physical and mental activities.  Most notably I found myself mentally rejuvenated: excited to be a positive force of energy in every interaction I encountered.
