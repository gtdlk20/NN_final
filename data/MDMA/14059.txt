Finally we got up and started skating. It felt awesome, gliding across the floor. I had a little trouble because I wasnt used to it, but C guided me. We had a great time and then rejoined D and H, who were on the dance floor grooving to some hip hop techno beats. The words of the song consisted of hey bitch get out the way repeated incessantly. I am very sensitive to the lyrical content of songs, especially when tripping or high, and I began to feel very uncomfortable. I asked my newfound friend, C, to join me in a different room which was filled with an amazing light show.
