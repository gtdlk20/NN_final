Fast forward half an hour and I'm feeling abnormally happy, I can feel the music in my stomach, as the techno booms away. Everyone is hugging and kissing each other, so I join in, definitely feeling the love. I dance away the night, and explore the squat. I feel like a million bucks. I dropped my second 125mg of MDMA about 5 hours after the first, and its around 5 AM. I throw up 45 minutes later, but I think most of the MDMA has entered my system. We continue raving away with my friends until about 9AM when the music stops.
