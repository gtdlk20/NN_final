About a half hour after that I started to feel kinda tingly and thought 'Shit, this is it!!!' and ran to the bathroom to check out my pupils. FREAKIN' HUGE SON. So I ran back and forth to the bathroom a couple times, my pupils were monstrosities, I was afraid the black was going to seep out of the 1mm of brown left and just pour into my eye (not because I was paranoid or freaking out, but because I was like, whoa, dem eyes is huge).
