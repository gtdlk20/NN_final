The concerns about overdoing the dosage have melted away.  I still cannot feel my body.  In fact, I am not really aware of its existence.  I am also not very present in my own first person mind.  The me that is currently melted together with the nature in front of me, is not me.  This is not the same ego-death I have experienced on other substances before.  Im more present than that, if only by a sliver.  In this second-hand existence my I (whatever I am), consists of my vision and a highly altered version of my mental being, but not my hearing or physical body.  Inside this monochromatic world there is only silence and a physical sedation that is so strong I cannot register sensations of touch.  There also seems to be no time here, at least not in the linear measurable sense of hours, minutes, and seconds.  All I know for sure is that time feels timeless: simultaneously endless and instantaneous.  My visual field contains almost no movement of any kind.  I dont get the sense that my vision is frozen, but the scene outside my window is eerily still.  I havent seen a person or car pass by.  Even the breeze has disappeared, leaving the foliage suspiciously stationary.
