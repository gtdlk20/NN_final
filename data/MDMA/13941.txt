After this experience I took two weeks off from MDMA usage.  The break felt healthy and I didnÂ’t experience any cravings to take more during this stretch of time.  My next MDMA ingestion was documented in my notes at 250 mg and I had a darn good time.  No loss of magic was felt and my tolerance seemingly dropped back down to nonexistent.
