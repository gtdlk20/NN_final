I was trying to involve myself in their conversation, but I had a really hard time following along. Their sentences didn't seem to make sense, I was deeply confused and nervous. My vision was erratic and kept shaking violently from side to side. I had pronounced visual tracers as well. This made me anxious, as I had never experienced such intense visuals while on e. No one else seemed to be having this reaction except me. As the trip went on these unexpected effects gradually wore off and I was able to understand what others were saying and doing. I was disappointing that I hadn't experienced any of the euphoric and pleasant feelings I was used to getting on e, but relieved that the night was over.
