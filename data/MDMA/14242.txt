PREPARATIONS: I spread out velvet blanket on floor, got a seashell or brush or other textured object to rub with. Washed dishes, spilled about fifty drinks. Drank OJ it makes the E hit harder.Got pacifiers I wanted to chew up anything. Prepared soft pretty music or techno dance music. Cleared the floor of all stuff. Made sure I had next day(s) off from responsibility. Next day I was still half rolling. Everything is good idea, but still didn't want to do anything that is negative like go to work.Dropped at 10PM. Nothing hit til 12:30 except strange feeling of something going on inside, but that means its the best kind.Break tablet into powder, it'll hit harder & faster.
