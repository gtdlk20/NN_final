In conclusion, Words are a sorry excuse to describe what a good pill of X can do to one.  I felt as if my sole purpose of living was to experience that exact moment of.well.ecstasy.  I Havent done ecstasy since then, but I plan to have many more encounters with this amazing drug.  I hope someone learns something from my experience.
