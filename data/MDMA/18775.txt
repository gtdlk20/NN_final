Simply in the 5-minute walk to the theater, we encountered some pretty weird things. I felt like the entire world knew we had taken E, and just wanted to do things to try and enhance the high for us. There was some crazy man on stilts wearing a jester's costume, and he walked right up to us, bent down, and yelled something in our faces. Well, mine and G's natural response was to scream and run away, but G later told me she wished she would have asked the guy if she could have touched his pants. After this, we saw one of those carts that sell little items, and there were these remote-controlled mini flying saucers with blinking, flashing lights and spaceship noises. Everyone playing with them seemed to be flying them right at our faces.
