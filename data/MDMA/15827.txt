We took each our pill at 8:10 pm, we watched a video of Psychedsubstance about the effects of MDMA. 10 minutes into the video she became really weird, her eyes rolled back, she started moving like a squid and said 'Aaah my skin'. I was a little happier and more attracted to her than normal, but I still felt sober. A few minutes later I felt like all my movement was flowing and I moved as if I was drunk. She asked 'What is life?', I said 'Life is a dance'. We undressed, not to have sex, just to be naked because that is what felt natural. Time was really sped up the next two hours. Within those two hours we took a shower together, laid on the floor of the hall and I gave her a house tour. We compared the hair of our asses and spent a lot of time in front of the mirror looking at our naked bodies. We talked about a closet in my living room we thought was weird.
