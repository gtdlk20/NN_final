Ive heard what people say about ecstasy possibly messing with your serotonin levels, and affecting your brain chemistry in a way that could make it chemically more difficult for you to feel happy.  As far as I know, this is still controversial, so I dont believe it or not believe it.  I do know that Id taken ecstasy several times in years past and had never experienced any kind of severe depression afterwards.  But if I had to describe the way I felt in the days Ive just talked about, it would be just that:  that it felt like my brain was chemically unable to feel happy.
