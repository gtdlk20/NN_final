The trip I wanted to talk about was the third roll I ever experienced. My girlfriend and I decided to go to an Infected Mushroom concert (psychedelic techno/trance) in San Fransisco. In preparation I found a hotel in walking distance from the concert.  We bought 7 more blue hearts (they were very good, and popular I suppose), as well as an 8th of decent quality cannabis. We also picked up a 12-pack of Corona because a beer is nice on the comedown. I also had done a plethora of research on MDMA and picked up a bunch of Vitamin C, Vitamin B6, and 5-HTP. We packed up my small car full of blankets, pillows, drugs/alcohol, change of clothes, music players, and a backpack full of E toys (squishy things, essential oils, glow sticks, flashing balls, pacifiers, etc). We stopped at our favorite burrito shop and ate half of our giant burritos, while sorting out some issues we were having (commitment type stuff).  We were good to go.
