All in all, I was basically debilitated for an entire week by this experience, and it was definitely pretty scary at points, feeling like perhaps I had done some irreversible damage to myself. Being able to read online other peopleÂ’s similar experiences with this, and that they did recover from it, definitely helped to reassure me that I was eventually going to be ok.
