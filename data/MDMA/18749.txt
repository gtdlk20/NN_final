I took X 10-15 times so far. each time i do it, i trip on something new except glow stix, those are always interesting to me). The first time it was all about lasers. after that i went deeper - touching, sounds (music, sounds around me, people talking,etc.), i went exploring beats and voices. I could listen to a song and separate each single sound it's made of. But last time i went raving, I had it all together. whatta feelin'. An incredible laser show, along with an awesome combination of disco lights, strobe lights, and fog. DJ playing some great beats. I had my best friends with me, massaging me, tripping me out with all kinds of lights.
