Many emotions I had been unaware of before, or I had been suppressing came to the surface. But I wasnt frightened by them.. I looked at them with understanding and a great feeling of mildness. Complete compassion with myself and all other people, I would say. I felt at home in the universe, everything being safe and feeling completely cared for, like an infant in the cradle. Ive never felt that way before, and especially during the last few months I was very much out of touch with myself and generally quite miserable.
