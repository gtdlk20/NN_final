During the next hour, I began feeling like I was coming up. Everything felt a little strange, like there was a new perspective and my movements were more pronounced. it was kind of an uneasy feeling, I wasnÂ’t sure what would happen next. Finally, within a second, I was just there. I felt utter joy and happiness in the moment and was ecstatic to be there. I grinned and told H I was finally feeling it. I was so happy and just wanted to dance freely. I was so parched and was also really glad that I had smuggled in my camelbak with 3 liters of water.
