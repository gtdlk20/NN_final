10:00 - I'm talking to my friend Casey, whom lives in California. He's a real good friend of mine. We get to talking more, and he asks me if I'd like to talk with him on the phone. I'm ecstatic, I can't think of anything better right now to listen to awesome tunes, dance around and discuss things with my great friend. We get to talking about so many things, society, culture, so many broad topics were discussed. My mind was not blank, I could let words ROLL from my tongue without hesitation. It was BRILLIANT!
