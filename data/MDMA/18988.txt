She also talked about how when we had first started being friends she had realized that I was so unbelieveably lonely, and after that had realized that we were in fact the kinds of people who should have been next door neighbors and best friends our entire lives.  I had never before realized that I had been so lonely back then or even that I still was reletively short on friends.  But those I have I would trust to take a bullet for me simply because they know that I would for them.  This was a major revelation for me and since the roll I have incorporated it into myself in a big way. I had been to a degree acting the way I thought whoever I was with wanted me to (at college at least, with James and Sarah never) and I have since stopped.
