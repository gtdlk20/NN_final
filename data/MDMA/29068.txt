These events are all about freely expressing yourself, so you see a wide range of people. You mostly see the kandi kids, who wear tons of kandi (beads) and suck on pacifiers; however, anything you could possibly imagine youll see. As were standing there a group of people came and stood behind us. A tall girl with blond 80s rock hair came and she stood out for some reason. My sister and I were standing, minding our own business, and I hear a flamboyant gay guy talking behind us, so I turn around to find out it was the tall blond girl we had seen. Also while standing in line I noticed a guy wearing a tutu, he was obviously rolling (it was easy to tell); all of a sudden he started running and I noticed another guy wearing a tutu. They run up to each other from opposite directions, jump up, and hug each other. It was quite a site to see, but we just looked at each other, shrugged, and minded our own business.
