We waited, eagerly.  In about 30 min, I felt vaguely buzzed, or more just relaxed.  It was an almost identical feeling to drinking a beer on an empty stomach (I told you I was a lightweight).  More relaxed and chill though, than alcohol, but similar.  It was definitely nothing like the intense physical euphoria of ecstasy I'd taken in the past.  My boyfriend said he felt a little 'different' but hardly noticeable (although he had smoked some weed a short while earlier so was already mildly stoned).  We waited another 30 min or maybe it was an hour, and nothing really changed.  Frustrated, we decided to take more.  I suggested we take an entire additional capsule each, but he thought we should just take another half each for now (and thank god for that!).
