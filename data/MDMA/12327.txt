I was disallusioned. Where were we? Who was I? What was going on? I was dizzy. I took a big gulp of water and leaned my head back. All I can remember thinking was that the music was too loud, I was too high. Instead of feeling buzzed, I felt drained, like I was slipping. I started to panic. I begged B to let us sit in the car in silence. We did for about 15 minutes. I leaned my head on B's shoulder, feeling my eyes close. My hands were dripping with sweat. B urged me to keep my eyes open and drink water. I did. I think I was scaring him. He put his arm around me, and slowly I came back to reality, the powerful overwhelming high surging through me.
