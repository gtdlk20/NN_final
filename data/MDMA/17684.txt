I was quite tired when arriving at the party, due to having a short and troubled sleep the night before. I had been to a conference in Amsterdam during the day, and eaten with a friend afterwards, and I had been doubting whether it would be wise to go to the party.. seeing that the first bus would leave no sooner than 8.30 AM.. making for a long night. So as I went with my friends (eight in total, including me) I had a can of energy drink and some cola for that necessary caffeine rush. Upon arriving at the party, we had a look about and proceeded to dance for some time. When we went for a drink, a friend of mine (well call him D.) told me he had brought some MDMA for me. Hes prepared a lower-than-normal dose, since he knew Im one for careful experimenting when it comes to psychoactive substances. So, after some talking, me and two other friends decided to try MDMA (a first time for two of us, including me). We each had about the same dose, to theirs had been a normal dose split and put into water. Lets say about 80 mg. I believe this must have been at about 2 AM. The substance ingested was believed to be pure MDMA, mixed with some baking powder (with 80% MDMA).
