The remainder of the night was more of the same; we eventually joined the rest of the group at another casino that wasn't nearly as enjoyable.   There was a lot of anxiety and indecision within the rest of the group about where to go and what to do, but we were able to shake it off and enjoy ourselves.    I think this never would have happened before we took the time off.
