I felt very sorry for the negative things I had done and said to other people, the pain I had caused them. But I understood it was all a result of ignorance and fear. Fear of myself and fear of other people. I had never realized before how many of my actions had fear as a underlying emotion. A constantly felled need to protect myself, to not show myself the way I really was, to prevent other people from hurting me.
