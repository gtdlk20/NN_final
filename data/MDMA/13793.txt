To make a long story short the place, crowd, ambience, music and company made a world of difference. Only when I am away from all that hustle and bustle of daily routines do you feel this extraordinary sense of belongingness. The general mood of the night was that of joy and carefree. The people I was with were all on it and had lots of experience and they all understood what one can do on it so they did not react. I canÂ’t stress the point enough that it is the mood, company, and place that maximized the soothing effect.
