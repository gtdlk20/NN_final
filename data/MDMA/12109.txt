So heres what the experience was:  I was in another country for a family celebration, and at the celebration, a friend of a relative offered me an E.  I took it and when it came on it felt pretty good, though it was a bit strange for me to be in a situation where I was high, and had to sort of hide it (or at least not act freely in a high way).  That probably affected the intensity of my experience a little, and it wasnt a particularly memorable one.  I felt good, and I felt the rolling feeling of E, but it wasnt all-encompassing or blissed out.  Definitely not comparable to a few experiences Id had before.  It just kind of made the night more interesting.  It just kind of made the night more interesting.  We were at the party for a while, then another friend of his took us to a café and someone elses house.  Again, I felt good the whole time, but it wasnt too memorable.  Actually, I kind of remember regretting that I wasnt rolling with people I knew better in a more familiar and relaxed setting.  But it wasnt uncomfortable.
