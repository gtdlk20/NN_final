Amazingly, my peak wore of over 20 minutes after the concert.. I hung around and had some even better conversations.. I think the final hour of X is the best for therapy, because you are empathetic and you social barriers are still down, but you arent rushing so hard your mind is clouded.. you feel very lucid.. I had a nice conversation with a girl from alabama, and she talked with me until i was sober enough to drive.. The final comedown wasnt even as bad as an amphetamine comedown! I even got to sleep easier. The next day i still felt a connection to people and i felt happy and energized.. I think prozac on the comdown helped alot..
