T+2:00 - This is definitely different than street ecstasy that I have had in the past. It doesn't feel really speedy, but I feel REALLY euphoric. I was actually able to sit down on my couch and really relax. I decide to put on some really mellow instrumental music (Explosions in the Sky). I don't really feel like getting up and running around, I feel like I just want to chill.
