On the way back to Ds, the effects decreased in potency (it was 4 or so hours since ingestion).  The comedown was worlds apart from cocaine or other such happy drugs.  As the chemicals effects gradually wore off my own warm glow and serenity of spirit replaced them.  I was not bothered with wanting more of the drug, nor did I once think about re-dosing.
