We had been preparing for my friend R's 16th birthday for about a month. We were all going to roll, some people for their first time. The party was planned entirely for an ecstasy trip. I couldnt wait until 7:00 (when the party started) so I crushed a pill after school and drank the powder. When taken this way it kicks in a lot faster and harder but lasts about 3-4 hours. I was still rolling when I got to the party, but I took another pill. I never dance, so I wasn't sure what kind of things I would do, but it was fun and I think I made an idiot of myself when I talked to people that weren't rolling. I had this really weird feeling of connection with this girl, B, I had never met. I haven't seen her other than at the party, but at the time she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. I was going to talk to her when R tells me he just asked her out. Immediately the thought of wanting her changed to being incredibly happy for them, but I was also envious of R. After dancing, I sat by the fire with R and B and we just talked about random things. I had a reason to be connected with R, who is my good friend, but I now realize I dont even know B. Sometime during the party, my friend A gave me a small dose of ketamine, which I snorted and got threshold effects.
