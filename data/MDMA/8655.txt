The intensity of the experience has dropped down from the peak it reached in the first few hours following ingestion.  I still feel deeply under the influence but in an enlightened and natural way.  Id classify this as a very unique and strong +++ on the Shulgin Rating Scale.   Im calm and not feeling overwhelmed or over simulated in the least.  I feel incredibly peaceful in my mind, body, and movements.  My physical body is wrapped up in a beautifully balanced mixture of sensations.  There is a warm flow that emits from my bones and pushes slowly out to the edge my skin.  On the surface, my arm hair and skin are hypersensitive but not uncomfortably so.  I possess no excessive energy.  Sedation swirls through my veins and saturates my muscles.  My comfort is ultimate not matter if I am standing, sitting, or lying down. My eyes focus normally and I have no nystagmus.
