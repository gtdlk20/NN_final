So I danced the night away with a feeling of over all goodness/wellness, I felt smug like nothing bad was going to happen, I mingled with the people made a new friend or so. The music seemed to keep getting better and better and there I was about to peak when my friends decided to take me for a spin. They spun me like I have never before been spun and now I know what it does it totally disoriented, adding to the already slight intoxication I felt from the pill. After that I took some time out to curl up with my girlfriend who I brought along who only after 10 mins was hit, while it takes me longer to feel anything thatÂ’s why at first I thought it was over rated.
