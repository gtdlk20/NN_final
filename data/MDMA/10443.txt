5:30 As we are walking and talking about the day, we all come up, VERY smooth.  Back in the day, I always got really nauseated. We all feel great, no nausea, but Girl#2 says she feels a bit funny.  We sit down on the park bench and talk and talk about how great we feel and how much we all really love each other. I put the non=nausea down to taking ginger previous to ingestion. Maybe.
