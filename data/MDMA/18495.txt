As we sat at our chosen vantage spot, it was apparant that T and W were both E-ing like a mother fucker. The first fireworks began at 8:00 and we all settled into the show.  A few weeks early I recalled T commenting about a experience he had read about a guy who took a pill then went rock climbing. As the MDMA took hold he looked over to a mountain in the distance and could not look at it, its beauty blinding him. The Fireworks were just that. I was truly not worthy of this sight. The explosions of colour in the open sky, I wanted to look away but I couldn't. These simple pyrotechnics grabed me. My stomach and chest tensed with patriotic pride as we celebrated this wonderful nation.
