At about 11 30, I was coming down a tiny bit but still have the time of my life,at this point I started grinding my teeth, so my friend gave me some gum to chew on because he said thats the worst thing to be doing.  So at about 12 o clock everyones gone except me and two of my friends one passed out and the other with a joint in his hand, he comes up to me and says 'wanna go smoke this?'  so we go in his backyard and me and him are just talking smoking a nice joint having a really chill time,  at that point my roll started to come back because everything was just so chill and so easy going.  Everything went right.  At about 1 o clock I started coming down again,  I was coming down very smoothly and I didnt crash at all.  But I still felt like going out and having a good time with friends.
