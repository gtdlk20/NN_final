I must also explain that I had never been skydiving before, and I was searching for the ultimate rush (obviously).  I called a skydiving resort near my home and asked questions concerning my dive.  The first thing was I wanted a tandem dive, which consists of a professional diver strapped to the first-time diver's back to assist in pulling the ripcord for the parachute and in steering towards the landing spot. This was obviously for safety purposes. Also, training was less time consuming for a tandem dive.  I also asked how long I'd be waiting to jump from the time I arrive and check in.  If you're an experienced user of E, then you know there is only a certain time frame for the peak effects.  So I made the appointment for two weeks later and I was set.
