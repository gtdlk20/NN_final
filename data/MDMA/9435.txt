Then I silently asked God to send an angel to watch over us. And quickly I became aware of another presence drawing near. It was utterly real - although, again, I could see nothing. The presnce felt like protection, love, a confirmation, a smile, like a brother looking out for us. As Chris continued talking to me, I often smiled at this presence over Chris's shoulder (I could sense exactly where it was standing.)
