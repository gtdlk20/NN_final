First let me give a brief history of what drugs I have experimented with. Everything I have done has been purely recreational in nature. Over the last year, I have taken mushrooms twice. Over the last year and a half I have taken vicodin and oxycotin approximately 5 times each. I have smoked marajuana 4 times. I have taken valium once. I tried nutmeg once but did not take enough to have any notible effect aside from a slight stomach discomfort. I have taken Ecstasy 3 time before, all three times were at raves, and as such with many many other people (only one pill). I have never had a bad trip/experience with any of the above, except the first time I took Ecstasy and didn't drink enough water. I didn't experience any problems other than a bit of an overheated feeling until I splashed some ice water on my face and drank a good ammount of water, but it was luckily the only 'negative' experience I have had with drugs. I am currently writing this at the trailing end of my experience, as to best capture the mood of the eveing.
