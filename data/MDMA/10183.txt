T+18:00 - Man I slept like a baby. It only took me about 15 minutes to fall asleep despite the fact that I could still feel the roll. I don't even feel like shit right now like I normally do. I usually am really depressed the next day and I feel just fine right now. I don't think I could sit down and work on my dissertation or anything, but I don't feel empty and sad.
