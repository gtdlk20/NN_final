And lastly, be VERY carefull who you get it from.  I've had two friends end up in the hospital from bad pills.  Too many people want to make a fast buck and are willing to risk your health for it.  That and remember, moderation is key.  MDMA very likely _IS_ neurotoxic...in other words...do it too much and you really could become an 'e-tard'.
