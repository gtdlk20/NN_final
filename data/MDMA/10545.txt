I really felt, for the first time in my life, completely at ease with the universe and everything in it, including myself. I was able to see myself and all my emotions with absolute clarity. I was able to think quite clear and logical, but not in a detached way. I was very much in tune with my emotions, without being overtaken by them. If God was able to open my head and look in, this is the way he mustÂ’ve experience things.
