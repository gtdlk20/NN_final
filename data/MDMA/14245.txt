SECOND DAY: still feeling X at 1/8 power, sad, Can't stand being alone, still bonded to place and music and people of Roll, very much so worth it though. I'd be ok if I could just be around someone. Feeling sick like I have a cold, x reduces immune defense. final drop to reality a slap in the face. Take vitamins & 5-htp to reduce depression some, take prozac at PEAK + 6 to reduce depression and bad stuff happening to brain. I didn't do either of those. Very addicting mentally, like its the most worthy thing for me, worth time & money, job and priorites want to be pushed aside but I know I won't let that happen and its just a thought.
