I was all set up with my boyfriend to do it at my house. We started tripping around 8 and we picked up a 40 piece of marijuana so we would be chilled out. We came up after 20 mins and I started dancing for him for about 20 mins or more. The music was so intense and unbelievable. The song Exstacy by DJ Tiesto always gets me keyed up now. After the dancing I was out of breath in need of water. I had set up 2 cube like tents in my living room to hang out in. They were beautiful. I was rambling on about society and the boxes they try to keep us in. Me and my boyfriend made vows to each other, smoking a blunt and started talking about things buried beneath the surface. He confessed to me things about his childhood and I could imagine everything he described to me He confessed to me things about his childhood and I could imagine everything he described to me, I was just as fearful as he was as he vividly remembered the things he couldn't before. I on the other hand, hadn't had a chance to speak. And after all of his confessions, I had on big one. He was in the middle of telling me how much he loved me, and I shot it all to hell. I couldn't hold it in anymore, I was so afraid, he looked so angry. He was so incredibly angry. I was shaking and he called me a fucking whore. I thought he was going to kill me right then and there. But he calmed down. After a while I felt nauseous from all the tension.
