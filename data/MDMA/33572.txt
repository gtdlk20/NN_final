We went upstairs to the lounge to chill and I was the most talkative I had ever been.  Unfortunately, he was getting tired and wanted to go home.  He invited me over and I had to weigh the options of staying at the club and continuing my E adventure, or going home with him which would mean I wouldn't have to drive an hour home.  I opted to go with him.
