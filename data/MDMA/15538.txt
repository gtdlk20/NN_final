A close friend of mine came by and I waved her over. She knew I was rolling and told me and the boys to hop in her convertible. So there we are, my two best friends and I and a gorgeous girl with the top-dropped on a beautiful autumn night. She popped in Chemical Brothers and drove to the nearby mall. We proceeded to explore the entire circle drive around the mall at 80mph, blowing every stop sign and wailing into the night with our hands extended. The cool wind blowing against my face felt fantastic, and I stared in wonder at the trees whizzing past the car. Looking at the guys and knowing they were feeling the same way I was made me feel a genuine connection with them, like we had a unique bond that was unlike any other. Seeing her drive the car was extremely sexy and sensual, and I felt a tightening in my chest that resembled love at first sight. I wanted to reach out and kiss her cheek, feeling her soft hand on my face and her breath against my neck. It was an extremely sexual feeling and one that I have not forgotten.
