Well, here is where I learned more about myself than ever before. I had tried acid (1.5 blotter) 2 months prior to this experience and loved absolutely everything about it. I also discovered that often on psycodelic drugs (acid/mush/mescaline) my mind creates images that are designed to frighten me. However it seems that anytime these frightening images would appear it would just only take me deeper into the most blissful parts of the different drugs it has happened on. Occasionally I would delve deep into these scary euphorias, but if it ever became overwhelming I could simply turn on a few lights and everything would return to normal. I think I also may react much more to shadows than light.
