T said nothing the whole time. I don't think he even blinked the whole 30 minutes. Half way through W leaned over and said that he thought he should tell his parents he loved them more. I put my hand on his shoulder and said what a good thing that was and how he should go with it. The fireworks ended with a great grand finale. The crowd cheered and I felt complete. The E began to come down, probably with the thought that we would have to go home and face our parents soon. It was a pleasant feeling and like I said before it felt like there a missing chunk of my being that was replaced.
