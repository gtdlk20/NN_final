My good friend G and I decided to take it together. We've been through a lot together, and have recently become very close, so I knew it would be a pretty intense emotional experience. It was also G's first time taking E, so I was excited to show her how much fun it could be and how great of a time we would have. We decided to go see a movie, but not just any movie: The Polar Express, The I-max Experience! You know, those crazy 3D movies with the glasses. Of course, those movies would be amazing on any substance, but E seemed to fit it pretty perfectly. We were going to be in public, and being high in public can be dangerous. But, since we were going to be around a lot of people, we didn't worry about anyone noticing. We just decided to make up a code name for talking about E, if we had to, so we decided on the name 'Boo Radley', though I can't remember why.
