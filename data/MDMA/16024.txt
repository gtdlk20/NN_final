The next DJ to come up was one that we'd been looking forward to the most - Oliver Heldens. I am a HUGE fan of his music, and for me, he is probably my favourite DJ out there. So to see him live, in that state of pure, unimaginable amounts of joy, was crazy for me. His music started playing and I began to shuffle like I'd never danced before, together with my friends B, T and M. I just couldn't stop dancing, I had never felt more liberated and open in my whole life. Some strangers got impressed by our shuffling and decided to make a circle around us, and when I realized and looked up I stared laughing and smiling with everyone. I started talking to them (had to be really loud) while we danced and made some amazing friends. I probably hugged and kissed about 20 strangers, telling them how much I loved them I probably hugged and kissed about 20 strangers, telling them how much I loved them (again sorry if it's repetitive but I just felt so lovey that it's all i could do). I guess I looked pretty messed up cause they'd hug me and laugh and say like 'How much did you take?' and I'd just grin.
