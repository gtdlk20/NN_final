I open the packaging on the syringe and needle.  The MDMA solution is drawn up through the cotton ball.  I am at 100% focus as I steady my right hand with the tip of the needle hovering just above my median cubital vein about an inch and a half below my elbowÂ’s crease.  I insert the needle at a shallow angle.  No pain or other sensation is noticed as I break the skin.  I register the plunger backwards and an immediate swirl of crimson in the barrel tells me I have successfully accessed the intended vein.  Using my teeth and left hand I awkwardly loosen the Thera-Band until it falls to the floor.  I administer the injection over 10 seconds.
