12:30 - 2:10 PM:  Wonderful, clear roll.  Had all the typical MDMA effects...just on the stronger side.  Danced the rest of the show away, completely into the beats.  A couple light shows during this time, which were amazing as always.  Show ended, both my friend and I were still in the middle of our roll though.
