Finally after much searching, I see my friends and I rush over to them, in hopes that maybe my friend 'D' is ok. But it's my other 2 buddies I came down with. The tell me that D is in the tent already and that he had been quiet for most the time they had saw him. I get in the tent and sure enough there's D laying down, but his eyes are open. I ask how he's holding up and he grunts at me. I tell him about all the crazy shit that I was seeing and all the other stuff that had happened. He tells me that he's too scared to go outside and that he too had been seeing some incredibly disturbing stuff. So I get comfy and we lay there talking about the normal drug induced, existential topics.
