Then something happened that was just amazing.  I disappeared into a vision of the earth, then I started to zoom away from the earth, and it was all so familiar and felt so wonderful, I have been here before, the universe.  Suddenly, a wave of nausia snapped me out of that.  I got up and walked outside, and went into the corner of the yard.  I realized that I felt alot better outside cause it was pretty cold, I must of been getting pretty hot.  But that still didn't stop me from puking, it was by far the easiest puke ive ever had though.  Then I layed outside for a while to cool off.  I kept seeing people in the corners of my eyes, but when I would look, there would be no one there.
