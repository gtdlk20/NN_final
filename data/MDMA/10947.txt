We got back to our friends house at around 10:00 and all I could think of was a drink. I got picked up from his place at around 10:10 and went home completely drained. I had a shower which was almost orgasmic, I was still rolling when I got home but my hopeless tiredness took over and I retired to bed. My thoughts bouncing of the experiences of the day before falling silent as I drifted into sleep.
