After this period passed I was filled with paranoia. I was sweating a lot, was unable to communicate, and was stuck in this club with nobody to bring me home.  I looked at my friend who had taken the same kind of pill from the same people and he was dancin away. I, on the other hand, was completely convinced that my life was going to end that night. I went in and out of this state of paranoia, but i would only stay out of it for about 1 minute.  Then, and this is the part that really freaked me out. A friend of mine who was sober asked me if I wanted to go back to the hotel and I said yes, but my other friend was also on E and could not be left alone. It was at this point that I yellled that I was going to kill myself (this is how strong the paranoia was), needless to say my friend grabbed me and stopped me and told me that he was takin me back to the hotel.
