As we leave the store, I am grinning ear-to-ear and practically weightless.  When we are in BÂ’s car a few moments later, he puts a CD on and cranks up the volume.  The pumping beats of the techno fill me with energy and euphoria.  I cannot resist frenetically pumping my fist and bobbing my head to the music.  I grin, fully aware of how ridiculous I must look but loving every minute of this wonderful chemical.
