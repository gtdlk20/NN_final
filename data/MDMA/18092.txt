The next morning was fine.  About 12pm vertigo kicked in for a moment, briefly I have the shakes and still am having hot flashes that cause sweating.  I then went about my day.  In the evening I took what was left of my party favorite, and felt great sipping on some ice water watching a movie.  Sexual thoughts are at an all-time high, however the male performance from such high doses are not to my liking :/  not matter what! so charming a woman is great, if I want to get giggled about later!
