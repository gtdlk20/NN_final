I normally am socially introverted, and have difficulty initiating conversations with people.. X eliminates any embarassment, social hangups, and fear of rejection that you may have with strangers, escpecially girls for me (I was even rejected once, and i just shook it off as their loss).. Talking essentially came with ease and my mormally poor self image was boosted by 1000%.. When i looked in the mirror i notcied my attractive qualities, instead of dwellling on the negative.. My eyes were the coolest things in the world. Girls would come up and hug me, cuz they knew the E feeling, and it was the most postive reinforcement ever.. Warm energy flows thru you and you see people as genuine beings instead of just people..
