Shortly after we took our doses, we decided to lay down on the bed and watch some TV. We watched The Simpsons for about 20 minutes, when I felt my vision become very bright and blurry. I could not focus on the TV anymore, my eyes became tired if I tried to do so. We turned off the TV and put some music on, and stayed still. I had begun to feel nauseous, something that seems to be fundamental in any psychedelic experience I take part in. However, soon I gave in to the music, closed my eyes, and became filled with a sense of smooth wellbeing. Everything was going to be beautiful.
