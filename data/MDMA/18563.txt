i first tried ecstasy at a friends party in May of 2000, and i had the best time of my life. When the X started kicking in, we smoked some cannabis, so the full effects of the X were cloudy. I didnt seem to notice that things were more 'beautiful' as people say, but the touch and hearing senses were greatly magnified. the total peak effects were about 3 1/2 hrs, then the come down. The next day, i didnt have the mdma hangover, but i did obssessivly want to do it again. in about a week the want for X had diminished, but i did want to do it again.
