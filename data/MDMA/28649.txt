About 30 minutes later, we realized that it had started to hit. I had done significant amounts of research (together with my friend B - we were sort of taking responsibility for everyone, as we'd done the most research and knew what to expect) but nothing could describe that feeling of pure happiness that overcame me. I know, I know, it sounds stereotypical, but I couldn't stop hugging my friends, SCREAMING at them how much I fucking loved them while the DJs (in the deep house stage) dropped some absolute bangers. We were going mental, feeling an intense amount of love for each other that none of us had ever experienced before. I've never been an amazing dancer (average, I guess) but my body was swaying to every single beat coming out of the speakers.
