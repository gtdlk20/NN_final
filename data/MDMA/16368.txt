I took .2 grams of 'molly' that day and not as much as 5 minutes later was feeling the euphoric feeleings.  After this I did not look back.  I had no thoughts of the journal entry I had read online months before, but instead just thought about what a good time I was having at this concert.  My 'come down,' as many would call it, was not harsh by any means. I also realized that I had peaked for the entire concert.
