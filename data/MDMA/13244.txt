I'm up to the superb feeling of being at the peak of my current Ecstasy experience. I decide to take a nice warm shower now. I read in a form a while ago, that it is really fun to shower with the lights off, and have a strobe light in the bathroom. Now, as I don't have an actual strobe light, I set my computer on the bathroom counter, facing the mirror, and the effect was incredibe. It was completely sensory pleasing experience with the hot water, washing my hair, hearing the music, and seeing the strobe light effect. It was of equal enjoyment to getting a salp massage and a light show simultaneously at a rave, to put it in perspective.
