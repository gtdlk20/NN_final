I'm still rolling a little, so I decide to go swimming.  The lake would normally be too dirty for my taste, but the water felt phenomenal.  It was one of those spiritual epiphany sort of moments, swimming in my underwear alone at night, I felt as though I had all I needed.  Of course, sober, I know I could not be happy for eternity swimming in a lake in my underwear, but at the moment it felt completely right.
