It was a good experience.  It was my first totally different experience with E with me not saying 'I love you' to everyone i saw.  It was something different and indeed unique.  I recommend an outdoor rave or a camping trip where you can drop with nature.  Yeah yeah, it's a cheesy story but it's really something different.
