After descending into my friend's well-furnished and comfortable basement to listen to music as a group, the second pill was starting to take effect as well. At this point, nothing felt better than being touched, or touching others. Even the rubbing of ice on and intense muscle rubs I was giving to my friends there didn't give me the slightest of pause; our touches had no sexual lust to them, they were merely expressions of our feelings toward eachother as human beings.
