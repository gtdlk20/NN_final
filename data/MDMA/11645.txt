The rave finished at 6AM, after which I had to take an hour-long train trip to get home. This was when I realized how much more MDMA than usual I had taken. I was looking at my eyes and admiring my huge pupils, and started completely tripping out. I can't remember what I saw, though I wish I could. Any time something changed the rhythm - the train hitting a corner, stopping at a station, or someone talking to me - I would snap back into reality, though it wouldn't be more than 1 minute before I was tripping again. It was incredible.
