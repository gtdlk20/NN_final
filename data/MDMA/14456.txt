I feel good, I said, laughing, I feel weird. And I was okay with feeling weird. I put my hands out in front of me and opened and closed my fingers. I liked the way it felt.  It felt like I had regained some control and that I was able to become one with my surroundings, however odd they were. This feeling didnt last long.
