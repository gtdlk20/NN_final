In Summary: I find Ecstasy to be a tad boring. It is a very physical drug, and I take drugs mainly for intellectual purposes. Ecstasy has its place: for young people either at raves, or some venue where the physical nature can be enjoyed, or for young people interested in a stronger drug experience, but not confident to take a drug like LSD/Psilocybin which takes more mental control and curiosity to have a good time. Ecstasy forces me into the Euphoria, which could be beneficial to those who have second doubts about hard drugs that would otherwise cause them to have a bad trip. The only thing that irritated me was that it fooled me, because it came on much later than the standard time frame, I was not expecting it. I believe the late onset time was a combination of my bodyweight, the fact that I had eaten recently, and that the initial effects were probably hidden by the cannabis.
