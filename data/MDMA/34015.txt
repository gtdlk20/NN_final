I began screaming that my skin was drippin off my face, and then i ran back out to the dance floor. Everybody was dancing away even my friend that had taken the same pill that I had. I saw one of my friends was not dancing and he saw the petrified look on my face and asked if I wanted to go back to the room. He has no idea what was happening to me cause he had been in another section of the club for the entire night.
