We arrived at the club downtown and found out that some of the members of our group couldnt get in because of what they were wearing. We proceeded, against my will, to a club/bar in a snotty area of the city that I avoid. Somewhere I feel completely out of place even when I am sober. Again, I felt like an observer in a place I didnt belong. The décor was ridiculous, it seemed for the setting  rustic feeling, wood-paneled everything, chalkboard drink menus, with a stuffed deer head overlooking the bars patrons, mostly 20-something, clean-cut, probably finance professionals. I went to the bathroom myself and felt the stares of all of the nicely dressed women, fully aware of my dirty Doc Martens, crocheted halter top and trippy-printed shorts. I will never fit in in a place like this, I thought. But that was okay to me. After four years of trying to somehow relate to my peers at business school, it was okay to me that I didnt fit in with them. This was probably the most positive revelation of my night.
