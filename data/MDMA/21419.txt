At this point I wasn't seeing much of anything but my vision seemed to be skipping and everything felt as if it was in slow motion. Then Marc instantly felt like puking (which we expected might happen) so it wasn't troubling. As he went upstairs I began to walk around my room feeling the carpet on my feet. I've never experienced this type of sensation before I've only smoked weed and gotten drunk so I wasn't sure how to handle it. I've only smoked weed and gotten drunk so I wasn't sure how to handle it. I went upstairs and started pacing, freaking myself out, luckily I tried this with someone I love and trust so Marc put me down on the floor and started to rub my back and tell me everything was fine. He started the shower and we both got in and then I felt the nausea. I leaned over then tub and puked into the toilet. After this I started to try and make myself throw up by sticking my fingers down my throat. I thought it would make me feel better but nothing would come out.
