I continue talking to him and I get a 3rd rush. Even more intense than the previous 2. That was it for me. I thought I was dieing. I wanted to cry and I couldn't concentrate on anything. I was pacing back and forth very fast and my hallway was waving around and I was scared to walk down it. I was telling my dealer that I think I was going to tell my dad to take me to the hospital. (I don't freak with every drug..but when I experience the un-expected I do freak out.) I ripped off my shirt because it was getting hot and I had this rash all over my chest..and I spazzed big time. My dealer told me it was just from the heat and I trusted him.
