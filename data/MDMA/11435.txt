I met up with my friends in a parking lot near the nightclub at approximately 12:45am.  Thinking that they would already be drunk I was quite surprised when instead of holding hidden booze in their hands they were holding just plain water bottles.  What kind of fun is that??? Sipping on water for a good time? Sounds crazy to me, I thought.  It wasn't until my friend pulled out about a dozen little orange pills from his pocket that I finally realized that they were doing some kind of drugs.  Never having done E before or any drugs for that matter I felt a little out of place.  And than the convincing started... It took a good half hour before I finally agreed to drop with them.  When I first handled the tiny pill I thought it was some kind of a joke.  How can such a little,orange pill, with a goofy 'BIG MAC' stamp on it possibly make me high for hours??? It simply looked like a Flinstones children's multivitamin to me.  Well being late as it was I decided to put all pesimism aside and drop the pill...
