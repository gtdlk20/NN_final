As we were going we were actually pulled over by a cop because our driver was very tired from work and supposedly went slightly over the line.  He was completely sober at the time, but had an 18 of beer in his trunk and we had 5 e pills along with some weed, a few bowls.  We just kept calm and explained it off, and the cop just told us to get where we were going and stay there.  We politely agreed and continued on our way.  This sort of phazed me at the time but I quickly forgot about it.  I just figured I should completely explain my set and the setting.
