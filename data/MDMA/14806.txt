I'm not sure what we even talked about for those 8 hours, I only remember laying in my room enjoying the trip atmosphere chain smoking and passing out. When I woke up my jaw was so glued shut I could barely fit my index finger in the opening, there was cigarettes and ash all over the entire house. Burn holes and gum stuck to floor and blankets. I rolled so hard I blacked so much of it out. I have not much recollection of anything else.
