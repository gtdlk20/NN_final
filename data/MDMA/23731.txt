Before my year-long fast, I was taking 120-150 about 4 times a year. After breaking the fast with this relationship, I did MDMA a few times where I took 100-120 mg, with 2C-B on the tail end of the MDMA. This lead to major body load, fuzziness of memory, and overall fucked-up-ness. The next day, I didn't remember much content, just that I was having wacky fun the night before. But it's no longer that interesting to me, if I can't recall what transpired. So I went back to being really cautious, and not seeking out MDMA.
