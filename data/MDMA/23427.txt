Anyway, I could feel my comedown from my peak.  It was only fucking 12am, so another two of my friends and I decided to go for a walk.  We end up dropping 1 tab each.  I peak all over again except this time, I'm surrounded by tall trees and walking around and around.  Then, the hallucinations started happening with me seeing people that weren't there, electricity flying through the air, gates and doors to other places, a beach which disappeared once i tried to pick up some 'sand', and roads that led straight into the forest.  I was fucked up, and soon the realization of the beauty of nature faded and soon I felt bad for leaving my friends behind.  Yeah, that goddamn 'lovey' feeling started to kick in and I went back into my tent and chilled with everyone else.  I started talking some nonsense though like I would blurt out 'How much is admission to the theme park?' and 'I wanna drink some mocha at a coffee shop with DSL internet access'.  Don't ask me why, but these things just came out of my mouth without me realizing it.
