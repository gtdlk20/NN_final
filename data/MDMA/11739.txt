As for mood effects, the trip has resulted in more than just a (very) nice memory. Besides the panic attack, I have had an elevated mood for the past five days and have felt much more capable of handling stressors and my workload. I feel a stronger connection with E, and less of the feeling of emptiness that usually occurs immediately after his visits end. I havenÂ’t had any hint of a mood event, and am not scared of another one occurring anytime in the near future. In all, I feel like a much calmer, more reflective version of myself.
