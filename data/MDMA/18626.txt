Well, time to get to the funny part of this story. I visited various friends during the course of my roll, and was finally headed to my final destination (home) at about 4:30 a.m. When I had left my last friend's house, I thought the roll was pretty much over, but the ensuing shutter vision and zone-outs proved me wrong. Anyways, there I was, driving down a major highway, listening to trance and zoning out heavily, when I came to my intersection. I was sitting there in the left-turn lane for what seemed like forever, and when the green arrow came on, I made my turn. But what to my wandering eyes should appear, fucking COP LIGHTS right behind my ASS! I pulled over right away and was amazed at how relaxed I felt.
