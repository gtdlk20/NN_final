Fast forward, after about 20 minutes sitting on the toilet thinking I was going to die, things started to settle down. The walls were shifting slightly, and the sensation of hot water as I washed my hands was exquisite. I decided to listen to some music. Santana - Black Magic Woman, a fantastic piece sober, filled me. I HAD to dance. A playlist appeared on YouTube, a mix of psychedelic rock and good old rock and roll. I knew I was in for a good time from here onwards. Dancing, immersed in the music. Running my hands through my hair felt good!
