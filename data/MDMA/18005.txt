I remember dancing a lot and being very sweaty, but the rest of the gig is a bit of a blur of music, lights and people.  A few moments stand out very vividly however.  When they played Born Slippy, everyone loved it of course.  As the last few bars of the music rang out, the crowd was bathed in a strong white light and everyone waved their arms ecstatically, or I think they did since I couldn't actually see much.  I had this very strange idea that this was an accurate representation of the gates of heaven.  I don't even believe in heaven, but I just thought that if it existed it would be like this - this light and this music welcoming us all.  It was truly transcendent and as I type, just thinking about it produces a strong emotional response in me.
