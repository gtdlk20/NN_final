~11:30pm -- I felt the comedown, a little bit. It was a gradual comedown, most unlike my previous experiences. I felt stimulated and there was no fatigue like I usually felt. I decided to finally just lay down and relax and talk to friends for a bit. I passed multiple hours just waiting for myself to come down completely.
