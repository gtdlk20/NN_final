On molly, I wasn't mean at all. If someone said anything that was even a little bit mean, I would say 'hey, that's not very nice.' I was also very forgiving on molly. Not only was I forgiving, but I always shared my feelings toward others that were deep inside me that I wasn't even able to realize existed until I was on molly. They were always nice feelings too.
