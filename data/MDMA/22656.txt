Seeing all the other bodies moving with so much energy in time to the music filled me with the most intense joy.  I felt part of some huge beautiful piece of art.  The music was tearing a whole in my chest so intense was my joy.  I sat on the couches for awhile and cuddled and then we had gum and vics vapor rub and mentholated nose sniffers which we blew in each others eyes.  As the high began to wear off of its peak a friend and I split another pill, this time a purple pressed will with a star on it.  We bit it in half and then crunched it up in our mouths even though it tasted nasty because we wanted the drug to hit our system as soon as possible.  We danced some more to the point where we couldn't stop, it was muscle memory.
