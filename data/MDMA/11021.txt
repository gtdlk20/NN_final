At one point I wrapped my blanket around myself because I was cold, the cold was giving me a strange feeling. My organs began to feel like a burden, they were too heavy. My stomach would only feel bad after my peaks so everytime my stomach began to feel awful I would take another half of a pill. I then felt fine again, as if I could run for hours, although instead of running for hours I sat beneath the bright lights of a school. I thought of the irony of leaning on the wall of an elementary school listening to psytrance and progressive music, disagreeing with and disobeying(through debate, feelings and actions) many, many theories, ways of behaving and morals school tries to engrain in its students. I sat on this thought for quite awhile although I`m unsure if I actually expressed it to anyone.
