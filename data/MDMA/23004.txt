I have never felt 'fucked up' at all while rolling.  There is no haze which fogs the brain; there is no inability to control my physical actions, unlike alcohol.  I would describe it somewhat as the opposite of 'fucked up.'  There is a stripping away of an outer core, one which normally holds me to all of the societal fears of opening up to people and seeing my world with clear, fresh eyes.  To experience MDMA is to experience a kind of purity in the world, not an adulteration.
