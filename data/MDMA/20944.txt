I only take birth control pills, and ibuprofen whenever I have migraines, which does happen quite often. They are the ones called 'aura migraines', I get some visual disturbances sometimes before the attack, I feel nauseous and have problems speaking, and I sometimes even vomit because of the pain. I haven't found a way to remedy that yet. However, I did manage to fix another health issue I have and I never thought I could do that, so I am optimistic about it. :)
