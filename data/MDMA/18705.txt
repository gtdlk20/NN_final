When we got back to the hotel I wanted to jump off the balcony but controlled my desire and ran back to my room and jumped into my bed. I finally felt a sense of calmness and lovingness (you know, the usual effects of E) and then I fell asleep. My friends said that when they got back to the hotel I was moaning for help in my sleep but they just check on me periodically to make sure that i was still breathing.
