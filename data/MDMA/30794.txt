We had planned this night for a while now and were very excited.  Before getting the pills we smoked a few bowls and drank a few beers, which may or may not have effected the outcome.  Anyway, at around 11 PM we got our 3 G-spot stamped pills and took them at 11:33.  Around midnight I began feeling warm inside while my two friends were not feeling anything yet.  Another half hour past and I felt at complete peace with myself and was very talkative, my two other friends still don't feel anything.  Finally at around 1 AM my friend L begins to feel it but M is still not feeling anything.  It really didn't get any better than this and at around 3 AM we all just felt completely tired and fell asleep.
