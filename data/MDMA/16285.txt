Then I walked back down toward the water. I wasn't so very high, and I felt that I could stand being around people again. I walked and began to think about the people in my life. I had little imaginary chats with some of them, especially Elaine, Veronica, Claire, and my Dad. You know, I got my Dad a Father's Day card that said this: 'Dad, you're one of a kind!' Then inside, 'So if I turned out a little unusual, it's partly your fault!' Actually, it didn't say 'fault', it said something gentler than that, but I can't remember what it was. When I saw it I decided to buy it immediately. But as I was standing in the checkout line I had second thoughts. I thought it just might make my Dad feel bad. But I bought it and sent it anyway. So yesterday I had this imaginary conversation with my Dad, and I said, 'Dad, I didn't buy that card, you bought it! Why did you buy me such a crappy Father's Day card?'
