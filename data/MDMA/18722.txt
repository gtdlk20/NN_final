2:30 AM: I began to crave more 'feeling' and since I was sure 1/2 a dose was too weak by now, I felt ready to take a whole one now. The BF also took another whole and a half. I began to feel very much like my BF and I were connected without my having to run my mouth or influence the bonding experience whatsoever. I was pleased to just be quiet and watch and listen. I felt that he could leave the house and walk down the street and we would still be in the same room somehow. I felt very secure and loved and had no need to question or doubt this. At this point I felt free to tune out and listen to my headphone while he did the same. Just being in the same room with him was enough and I didn't feel obligated to be 'entertaining' or to attract attention to myself at all.
