Ecstasy has changed my life. My experiences with it have been the most pleasurable of my life. This is not to say they have been the best because there is nothing , or rather I should say there was nothing soul fullfilling about my nights, days and weekends with MDMA. But, it has been soul fullfilling in the way it has caused me to examine and live my life after. When I dance I think. Its like my body is in glory while my mind is too. I have carried over this into my everyday life. Since I have started doing x I have done as much research as I can on the little devil. My heart aches because of the fact that long term tolerance is so easily built up and I may be damaging my precious axons. This might be good though as otherwise I would worry about a state of depression a few years down the road from now when the last of my youth is gone - for an atheist its like god saying you get this many incredible times, enjoy.
