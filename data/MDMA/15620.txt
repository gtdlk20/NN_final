I left the house with my good girlfriend at around 11. We go to our local dealer, who is also a good friend of ours. We sit there for a while, just talking while one of the dudes there looked for his phone charger. We hit the bubbler full of some KB bud. Laughing at him. We took it in stride when our guy told us he scored some killer X. He gives me and Ash 3 blue peace signs each for free. We were excited.
