I do not usually experience the usual after effects that Sam has like a headache and being super irritable but I did bite a good chunk of the inside of my lip off which looked pretty gross. This was the first night of the week at the beach that we took MDMA after a few nights of taking it in a row I was plunged into a moderately bad depression. I really do not advise doing this multiple times a week It really depleted my serotonin levels for a while after. I came away from this trip with a closer relationship with my boyfriend and a new understanding of the ocean as the land between the living and dead.
