I have a mild case of bipolar type 2, for which I do not take SSRIs or mood stabilizers (I prefer to seek non-prescription alternatives, and think the current resurgence of interest from the psychiatric community in the area of psychedelic therapy is very promising). I have some state-dependent anxiety, but do not normally experience panic attacks. My long-distance boyfriend and co-tripper, E, is 25, around 70 kg and 178 cm with no psychiatric diagnoses, though I sometimes suspect him of having Aspergers tendencies :D I take 200 mg of caffeine in pill form each morning, though by the time of the trip in question this had surely been metabolized already. According to my gene scan (23andme), Im a fast metabolizer of certain drugs, especially stimulants, and have a high likelihood of treatment resistance with many SSRIs, which is relevant here, as MDMA may have a similar mechanism of action to SSRIs.
