My friends and I had brought dozens of different party accessories that we were sharing with the crowd, especially some kaleidoscope glasses that I had brought. You'd put them on and the different colours would refract. This, in combination with the lights emanating from the stage, would make every stranger grin as soon as they put them on. I got even more happy based off their reactions, and when I told some girls that had been dancing and talking to us for a while that they could keep using it for a few more minutes (after she gave them back) she kissed me on the lips, I kissed her back. It was funny because it wasn't sexual in any way, I didn't feel aroused at all, I just felt pure love for her.
