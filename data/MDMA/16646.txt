When they are finished, I drop the igloo.. tastes bitter, good sign. I go and sit in the grass and wait.. I start noticing some perceptual changes.. Like the tendency to notice things more. Nothing strong.. When the band comes on i feel the come up.. Theres this warm sensation that encompasses my entire midsection.. Its that feeling you get when you desperatly want to be held.. My mood lifts and i go and dance with some pepple i dont know, but dont talk to them.. this pill isnt very strong.. in fact these are the same weak effects i got with the euros.. So after 30 min i pop the other pill and keep dancing.. Up tot this point im feeling good, but not rolling.. I would have this little peaks of excitment that went along with the peaks in the music.. I was at a ++.. Then the second pill hit..
