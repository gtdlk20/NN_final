Last weekend several of my closest friends and I attended a rave in Seattle.  We had been planning and anticipating this rave for weeks, so by the time we arrived we were so excited that it was nearly unbearable.  Every possible detail of our little vacation had been worked out so there was nothing that could distract or worry us.  We were totaly free to have a good time.  Before we left we had aquired a quantity of ecstasy from a very trustworthy source and tested it to be sure of its purity.
