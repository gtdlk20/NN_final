LOTS OF WATER - YOU WILL DEHYDRATE without you even feeling it.  Drink a glass or 2 every now and then, more so if your dancing and sweating alot(I sweat a SHIT loud, we'll get to that later.)  I prefer to keep a nice zephrahills bottle in my back pocket while dancing, to have easy access.  Make sure the water is easy to get too, otherwise while rolling/dancing you will not want to stop.
