The next 2 days were just like the previous, dead man walking mode, but the 3rd day, something awful happened, a crash that was unbearable. I have had 'terrible tuesdays' before, but not ones where they last an entire week and a half more! Depression was all i knew for those long, long days. I couldnt eat or sleep properly, i was always in a bad mood, not the usual blank mood i get from a hangover, and found myself crying about something every single day! I was in such a bad mood that when an argument arose over getting a free sandwich from my friends work, i thought about literally killing him. I knew what it was, my brain was fried and it would take awhile to normalize. This brought me to the conclusion that i need to abstain from all drugs for awhile, and wait at least a month before i drop again, but that is even tenative. I was droppin for the wrong reasons, just to have a lil more fun in an altered reality. E shouldnt be done just to do it, you should do it when it will be useful, like parties and little get togethers. It isnt like Bud where you can use it all the damn time, this stuff will harm you in very very bad ways.
