The next day on Sunday I felt terrible, couldn't eat and had depression and anxiety occurring. Today is now Monday and I woke up feeling almost worse then the day before. Extreme depression and continuing anxiety, also I haven't eaten all day and still am not hungry. I am thinking about going to see a doctor because I just cannot put up with this feeling.
