By this time I really feel like I'm peaking, and hard. As D is talking to me, I look over once and he has the same demon mouth, that I had been seeing all night, but it doesn't freak me out as much when it belongs to someone I know. I look over a second time and he looks like a freakin anime cartoon character. This amazes me, all his features are hand drawn it seems, and I have a hard time focusing on what he's talking about. The third time I look at him, he looks EXACTLY like my friend Steve. It basically IS Steve, but the voice belongs to D, so very strange this drug is. I lay back and start to look around at the tent. I see peoples shadows dancing on the sides, and at times the shadows change and take on shapes of random animals. I look at the blanket thats covering me, which is decorated with a type of vine pattern, and as I stare the vines from the blanket actually start to grow. Up the sides of the tent I watch as these vines grow and wrap around each other, and at one point they actually cover most of the inside of the tent as I watch in amazement.
