T+60min  -  I decide I've been out here on the deck long enough, but I couldve stayed there all night just  feeling the nature and atmosphere. I start walking to my room and I notice my movement feels a little more.how do I say this.. Robot-ninja. I felt a little clanky, and a slight imbalance, but also very quick and  smooth. I go in my room and check my pupils. Oh yeah! I'm rollin baby! They were huge. I played some Oakenfold, Tiesto, JedI Mind tricks, TVOTR, and others.
