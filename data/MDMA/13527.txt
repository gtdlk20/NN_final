Prior to my first experience with MDMA, I had never before recreationally taken a substance more 'severe' than marijuana. This being said, I had been smoking marijuana on an almost daily basis for quite some time, and was eager for a different experience. (Is marijuana a gateway drug? Undoubtedly, in my opinion.)
