When we got there, around 10pm, I saw groups of friends dressed in colors and beads greeting each other like family. Sebra and I walked hand in hand as we went inside. The building was small and there werenÂ’t many people there. There was a guy spinning and the speakers were booming with loud beats. My brother Gabriel introduced us to some friends and we were soon recognized as newbies for the night. I met Lyric a small girl with a stuffed animal backpack and back rimmed eyeglasses. She reached in her bag and pulled out a string filled with bracelets. She proceeded to find one she said she had made for me specifically. She asked for my hand and held the bracelet on her fingers. As we held hands she curled the bracelet on to my wrist. The bracelet had beautiful, purple, magenta, and green beads in circles that resembled grapes. I love it!
