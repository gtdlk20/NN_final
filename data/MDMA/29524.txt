The length, intensity, control and power of my first MDMA trip is without comparison.  I had previously tried marijuana and smokeable DMT and subsequently I have tried psilocybin and Ayhuaska.  My Shaman informs me that he knows only one other person who has had an experience like mine and I would like to hear from other people who have.  I can only describe some of my trip here so I will talk to you about my ring and mirror, my psychic abilities, my increased physical strength and some proofs in religion.  I will keep my relationship with the Hindu Goddess Kali private! Remember that this entire trip lasted for an astonishing seven hours, not bad for a lifetimes worth of experience, but it was exhausting.
