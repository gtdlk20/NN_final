I took the 2 epills at like 2:15 and they kicked in real fast because I hadn't eaten anything but a bagel and a piece of fruit. I was with others who were rolling as well, but my high was definitely coming on harder and stronger and I couldn't deal with their fast talking. I turned some dvd on earlier that I thought may be sweet to watch rollin and tried to focus on it but it felt like my vision was darting back and forth and I needed to close my eyes and try to chill.
