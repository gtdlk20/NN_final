But soon after I needed two to get me where one took me.  ridiculously (may I emphasize RIDICULOUSLY) soon after, 2 wouldn't cut it and I'd need three.  When you're in highschool and mooching off your parents... wasting anywhere from 30-60 bucks in one night (maybe more, depending on where you're going, what you're doing, etc...) can raise a lot of questions for your parents.  Besides, no one wants to be wasting that much money chronically and not have anything to show for it.
