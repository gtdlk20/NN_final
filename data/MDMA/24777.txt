The instructor and I waddled up to the open side of the plane with him strapped to my waist and we squatted down. He leaned his weight on me, and we fell out of the plane at 13,000 feet.  The next thing I know I'm falling in spread-eagle formation at 110 mph with my jaw wired open blowin up harder than I ever thought possible.  I didn't even have to breathe very deep because air was getting shoved down my throat so fast.  All I could hear was the wind just screaming in my ears.  My whole body was numb, and the view I had of the whole scene (mountains, little square farm plots, and a tiny little town to my right) was slightly covered in a white haze and my vision was slightly distorted, which I expected under those circumstances.  I shut my eyes to see what that would be like in the freefall, and about 3 seconds later the instructor pulled the cord.  All the noise stopped, I was sitting upright, and I had a serene 5 minute ride to the ground on a beautiful day in the desert.
