After about 30-40 minutes of having fun outside, I came back in to discover that the party was winding down. The 1st time smokers were sounds asleep, and the nymphos had found their rooms. I sat on the stairs in the dark, and was joined by the host, my friend, and a couple of girls. The conversation was excellent. I thought someone might think it weird that I was vigorously rubbing the carpet, and my eyes were moving quick from place to place, but I guess it was too dark. After the conversation, I found a bed to sleep in at about 3:30 AM. I turned out the lights, and had a slight panic attack, but I talked myself out of it. Tired because of the cannabis, yet amped up because of the X, I found it incredibly frustration to try and sleep. I finally managed to about an hour later.
