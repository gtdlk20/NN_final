Now this is the thing, I live in Northeast Brazil where the rave scene is almost nonexistant and finding pills is harder than hell.  After coming back home I spent more than a year without taking E, but I never forgot my 5 special nights.  I kept planning the day when I would take it again, spent a lot of time searching online information about the drug, probably read every single experience report on MDMA.
