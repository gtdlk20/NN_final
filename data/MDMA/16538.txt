Around the 3 hour mark of being high, I started getting really hot and sweaty, and I went outside for a little bit. It had just started snowing, and the sun was rising. The snow was glistening, untouched, and it was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. My trip lasted for about six hours, and then I started sketching out really bad. As my trip neared the end, I got a feeling of bitterness wash over me. I didn't want it to end. I had the worst crash, I didn't cry, but my friend did. She was holding her head, asking why she felt so bad, why did it have to end. We went to the coffee shop around the corner, but all I felt was bad vibes, and I just wanted to go home and sleep. I couldn't sleep all day, and I still felt horrible the next day. I was very depressed for a few days, but then I was fine again. I guess those are the up's and down's of doing ecstasy.
