I knew I was potentially fucked, but I felt completely in control, even though the cop got out of his car so fast I didn't have time to check if my pupils were still huge. I turned off the trance, hid my vicks and glowsticks, and rolled down my window, still surprised a t how NOT terrified I was. The copper proceeded to quickly ask me detailed questions in rapid succession, such as where I had come from, what was the address, where was I headed now, and what was that address. 'Holy shit,' I thought, 'he thinks I'm drunk.'  This raised my spirits a little, as I was glancing warily at the flashlight in his hand, which he was using to take a quick glance at the inside of my car. It still looked bright as fuck to me, and I knew if he decided to shine it in my face I was finished. However, since his first assumption was that I was wasted, I figured he probably wouldn't think to check my eyes. Nevertheless, I was still scared to look him in the face for fear that he would be able to tell, even though my eyes are very dark, and I had not yet gotten my (lifesaving) colored contacts. (Get them, folks--they will save your ass plenty a time. You can blame anything on your contacts--red eyes, etc.) Anyways, after we had gone through the whole 'gimme your license and registration' thing, the cop (a guy, by the way) returned to the car and told me that he had pulled me over because I had swerved from lane to lane twice.
