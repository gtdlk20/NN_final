The duration and comedown were also surprising to me.   The lengths of each portion of the experience were not as extended as I anticipated.  The overall experience did not last much longer than when I dose far lower.  The two departures from my normal MDMA effects intensity chart (duration on the x-axis and intensity on the y-axis), were the intensity of the peak and the rapidity of the come-up.  The peak of the intensity was more concentrated than many other previous MDMA experiences (regardless of ROA).   Rather than an extended plateau at the height of intensity I seemed to have a relatively short top of the mountain moment that was followed by a marked downward trend towards baseline.   The second difference was, my departure from baseline was lightning quick during this experience.  Before the administration of my second dosage, I was well into a + level experience [T + 00:07].  Upon completion of administration of my third dosage, I was essentially at a +++ experience [T + 00:29].  These are far faster than my typical departures from baseline with this substance.  I attribute this to the combination of high dosages and the intravenous route of administration.
