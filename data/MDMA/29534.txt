Although I did not want to test or taint my visions I researched Egyptian and Hindu mythology, obscure eastern European religions and Shamanism.  The connections to some of the things in my vision and also to each other led me to believe that there is an accessible dream world that is very similar between different cultures and individuals.  I did wonder if I had imagined the visions as a strange mixture of ideology from religious education at school, but I hadnt studied any of this in such detail before.  If anyone is interested, Hera from Greece, Hathor from Egypt, Kali from Hindi, and the Neolithic Snake Goddess from Eastern Europe, and my vision loosely share the characteristics of: shape changing, horned snakes, the duality of being a lover and a mother, dog/jackal aspect, wealth, wisdom and war.
