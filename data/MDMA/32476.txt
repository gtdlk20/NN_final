I've done Ecstasy 3 times now, on my third time I took two pills at once.  My rolls were harsh on my body, grinding my jaw on straws was all I could do to keep from breaking my teeth.  My eyes wouldn't focus, and everything felt amazing.  My blankets around me felt like a euphoric cocoon.  I layed outside in the grass for hours feeling its cold against my skin.
