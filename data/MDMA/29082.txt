At this point I need to hit the bathroom and get some water. So my sister and I enter the arena which is swarming with drugged up kids. We head to the concession stand which I expected to be packed, but there were only one or two people in front of us. We get two waters. Then I go to the bathroom while my sister waits and then vice versa. While shes using the restroom and Im holding the drinks, I decide to sit against the wall, which felt pretty cozy. As Im waiting there a boy comes up to me and asks, Want a lightshow? I, still rollin' hard, get all excited like a 5 year-old on Christmas, my eyes light up, and I say yeah! like a little kid. The lights looked like nothing you can ever imagine unless youve experienced a lightshow on ecstasy yourself. You literally become in a trance. Im just sitting there looking all googly-eyed, looking like a complete retard to the hundreds of people walking by, but I didnt care. Eventually he said Alright man, Im getting tired. I immediately say Thank you like I mean it and smile, shake his hand, and he walks away not knowing (actually, Im sure he does) what a crazy state he just put me in for that minute or two.
