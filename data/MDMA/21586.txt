8:45 - Call my friend T, who agreed to act as a sitter for me. He was at a barbeque, so I told him not to hurry. Then I call my friend M, who has had previous X expierience, to ask him a couple questions, including how long it would take to hit (around an hour), whether I should have cigs handy (definitely, they're a must), and whether I should have weed (not necessary, might be nice for come-down).
