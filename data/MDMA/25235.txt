Soon enough I felt a tingling all over my body. I noticed my skin felt like a different surface, like rubber. I put my head in my hands and felt the strands of hair flow between my fingers. I went to lay down on the bed and put my jacket over my face. The lining was so soft and seemed to flow like water over my face. They asked me 'Are you okay?' I answered back, 'Mmmhmm.'  They asked me to go sit by them on the floor. As I sat down, I felt the white carpet rub against my hands. I had never felt such softness in a carpet. I noticed this and yearned to feel the carpet on my arms and body.  So I lay down on the floor and proceeded to roll around like a catÂ… rubbing my body all over the carpet. Nester got me up and put my hands on his head. It was incredible. He had a shaved head and the peach fuzz was so incredibly soft, I never felt anything like it.
