Later I was bouncing to the music, kicking it on the balcony area with a couple of girls on either side, we had come together through the music and I remember smiling at them and they looked at me, frowned and moved away.  My friends girlfriend came up to me and said that the muscles on one side of my face had collapsed so I guess I was freaking people out.
