I stood in front of the strobe light and looked at the floor, I moved the glowsticks around my eyes which made me stumble a lot. I finally grabbed my hair and moved side-to-side to the music, with my eyes rolled back in head (that's why they call it rolling), and I was like that until my friends came back 15 minutes later, and as they were practically sober, they laughed at me, but I didn't care. I still loved them. I wanted to hug them and touch them. I've heard of same-sex touching and feeling while on X, but I never once thought about touching the other dude. Even on X, I wasn't going to act gay-like or anything.
