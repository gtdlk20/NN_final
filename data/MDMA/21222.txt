At 7, we met up with our dealer, and secured 4 pills of Molly for $60. They were small, white, and somewhat glittery.  P swallowed his on the spot, but B and I hesitated. Should we try to take half? Should we really do this? There was no denying the timing was perfect, my parents were out of town until Monday night, we could chill and crash at my house after the concert. We observed P  as he began to bob his head to the music, 'feelin' pretty good', he said. Now or never.
