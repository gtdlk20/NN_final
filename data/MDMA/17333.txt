Overall this was one of the most eye-opening, and incredible, experiences I have had.  It really made me realize that everybody is connected in the idea that we all just want to feel good, be listened too, and respected.  Also in the year or so since then I have really gotten much better control of my emotions in general, and I no longer get pointless anxiety.  I basically just realized that most stuff wasn't worth worrying about and didn't matter, and I realized that if I could control myself and my emotions in the midst of an ecstasy trip (and subsequently, LSD and mushroom trips later) that I could do it any time no matter what in just normal every day sober life. in the year or so since then I have really gotten much better control of my emotions in general, and I no longer get pointless anxiety.
