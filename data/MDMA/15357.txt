I'm in suspense for the next time when I can do E. Two nites ago was the first time I have ever rolled. I can honestly say that it was one of the best experienes of my life. At first I was very scared and timid to try it because of the bad reports of people who have done it before. My best friend did it the nite before, and encouraged me. I really wanted to, but I was scared. I thought that being paranoid before you did it would increase the chance of having a bad trip, however this was not true.
