        I went to make the booster and noticed some powder I'd spilled, so I added it as well. I put in about 1ml of 70 proof vodka to help speed absorption (just a guess). I took it at 2:30, so I've got about 1/2 of a Crown in me now. Since the amount I spilled was pretty big, I probably won't feel alot until this second dose hits me. Guess I'm going to be up pretty late!
