Then my bud took off the IPod from me and I was like 'Whatchu do that for!?' and she was like 'I want you to hear this song' and it was sooooo good, so fucking mellow, I was just groovin' to the music, just kind of moving kind of like a snake, we listened to it for like hours. Then she started feeling bad again and I turned off the music and was like, 'Let's talk.' We laid on her bed and talked about life after death and the new world order, it was strange, like I usually talk in this loud, obnoxious way, but I was speaking very softly, very gently and soothingly.
