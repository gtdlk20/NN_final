I switched seats w/ my friend and sat in the front of the jeep. The lines on the road were really bright, and the jeep felt like it was floating through the sky. I gave my friend a BIG HUG and told him and her repeatedly for hours how happy I was. This incredible feeling of closeness, and love filtrated my body. Nothing could be wrong in the world. I loved everyone, and my friends in the jeep were the best people in the entire world. I talked nonstop and I couldnt shut up.
