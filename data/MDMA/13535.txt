My next memory vivid enough to recall is one of looking at myself in the mirror. In my reflection, I had ceased altogether to be myself; I was looking at myself as an impartial observer, and was able to be completely honest about my appearance and facial expressions. This golden moment, by itself, I consider to be worth the entire trip. (I was also quite enamored with my severely dialated pupils.)
