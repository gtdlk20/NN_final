03:30 - got up to go to the bathroom and washed my hands. Was feeling a little cold and the warm water was still so enticing that I had to take another very warm shower (which was heavenly). I am coming down but not disappointed. I am almost ready to leave that euphoric space, for I know that it is fleeting and very artificial. MDMA definitely has therapeutic qualities, however, and the artificial nature of the happiness should not be overlooked as just another fuck-up/party drug. It definitely could be that in larger amounts though, hence the popularity. I am interested how I will feel the next day. I am certain I will be very sad at some point but this experience was eye-opening and I do not regret it. For now.
