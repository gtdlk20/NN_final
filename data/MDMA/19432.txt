When she dumped me, I became severly depressed. I hated people again and when I was home, I never left my room but to get bread and water and I never talked to anyone besides close freinds and my imediate family (all my relationship's were going down the drain). I only made company with my two dogs. I had it set in my mind I would never be happy again. And life presumed this way for 4 months untill one day I decided to buy this pill...
