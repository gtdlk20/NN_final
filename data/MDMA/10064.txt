We split another capsule the same way, this time emptying as far back on the tongue/in the throat as possible (still pretty disgusting), so we each had consumed a total of one capsule each (but taken half a capsule at a time, spaced about 1 hr-1.5 hrs apart).  Within 20 min of taking the 2nd half, we were feeling much stronger effects Within 20 min of taking the 2nd half, we were feeling much stronger effects, but I suspect this was the first half peaking.  This is when it started to feel like MDMA as I remembered it.  I was no longer able to keep very good track of the time, but I'm pretty sure the 2nd half started peaking soon after, because things very quickly exploded into more intense effects.
