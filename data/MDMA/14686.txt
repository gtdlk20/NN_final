It was a normal Saturday night November 6, 1999, like any. My fried 'R' and I had fallen into a large sum of money. We decided to get pills like we usually do on the weekends. We got them from our normal source at out normal stop and headed to my boyfriends apartment. When we got there, the boys were drinking, and everything seemed normal. They were very surprised to see us pull out 11 pills. We were all amazed at the shape of the pills.... they were in the shape of 4 leaf clovers. We thought we were going to have the best night ever....
