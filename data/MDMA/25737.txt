Hey if you read this far , wow. I had to vent and I had to celebrate my new little life friend and change. I grew up real conservative and couldn't believe the first time I saw a drug being used , 'bad people' (and some are no doubt but what group doesn't have em). My only advice is THINK FOR YOURSELF, take the time to do the research and make an educated non-propaganda decison. I do think everybody should do exstasy at least once to truly experience life but don't if its not you and if it is don't give up if you don't hit it the first time cause of whatever. If our brains are anything alike and my bio book says they are - it will.
