Luckily we hadn't gone far and jogged back up towards the house.  Evidently my Dad found me too slow and said he would just run ahead and get the tickets.  I slowed to an ambling speed, content just to wander up the road feeling high.  I felt very relaxed and safe.  As I reached the end of my parents' street, my Dad reappeared with the tickets in hand.  Then he said, 'Oh but I don't have any change for the bus now.'  I commented that this is what happens when you take the drugs before you set off, but he didn't think that was why he'd forgotten the tickets.
