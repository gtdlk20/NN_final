I picked myself up, and layed on the still hot sand, feeling the earth, embracing it, rooting my being in it, I started to cry. All the sad emotions and experiences of my life, poured down in sobs that drowned in the sand. I felt free, for the first time in my life, free to go and do anything I want, free to live my life anyhow I want, free to express my emotions freely. I started to cry. All the sad emotions and experiences of my life, poured down in sobs that drowned in the sand. I felt free, for the first time in my life, free to go and do anything I want, free to live my life anyhow I want, free to express my emotions freely. Urge, of having my being cleansed of all those murky dark feelings was topped with submerging myself into cool ocean water. It felt like I was being baptized again, reborn to live in a new brave world. We spent that day together, watching the sunset, and talking about the most immersed emotions and feelings. Never have I felt so free and liberated as I did that one day at the beach. E helped me lose my baggage that I was carrying even though I wasn't aware of it. Opened my heart and sould to a new level of compassionate loving towards other beings. Next day, I felt like people were looking at me with a magnifiyng glass, or being just happy that I was back in my shoes again, never before so stable and grounded. Love was and is still pouring out of my heart to everyone in need. I cannot simply estimate how beneficial E has been in my life. If I hadn't tried it, I would have still been in that same dark rut from which I emerged. I cannot simply estimate how beneficial E has been in my life. If I hadn't tried it, I would have still been in that same dark rut from which I emerged. I can't say anything more or less. Love and freedom go in pairs.
