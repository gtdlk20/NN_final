As always the next day sucked. The only thing I could think is that I really wish I would have gotten more. It was strong but not quite as strong as I am used to. This was the first time I took E pills, usually in my area you can just find Molly (the crystallized MDMA powder). My whole body was sore so me and D just spent the day watching movies and smoking. It felt better that way.
