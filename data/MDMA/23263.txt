By Midnight I still hadnt started to roll so I decided to look in a mirror to see if AT LEAST I had a little pupil dialation. I noticed my pupils were randomly getting bigger and smaller, but not staying at either for more than a fraction of a second. This confused me but I came to the conclusion that nothing was going to happen, and that I was going to go to sleep. I laid in bed for almost 2 hours tossing and turning, and unable to fall asleep. This is another factor that shows me that the pills contain MDMA, but just not enough to get my desired effects.
