After a few weeks I find my thoughts returning to this day in my past regularly.  There is no specific intention or direction of these thoughts.  I just find myself recalling the afternoon randomly, almost daydreaming.  I decide to hunt through my old notebooks and eventually the search is fruitful; I locate the pages describing the experience I have been remembering.  I am proud of myself!  The notes are far more detailed than I anticipated and there are even comments and bits of information I did not remember.
