I was afraid of empathy, because I saw others repressing their empathy. It's easy to be empathetic on E, but sobriety is more complex. On E all there was was empathy. There are other aspects of my life that are important. I hope that I can embrace the empathy that E has shown me, while balancing my competive nature, my intellectual nature, my spiritual nature and my aesthetic nature. I am grateful for this experience and I would like to maximize the benefits of this knowledge.
