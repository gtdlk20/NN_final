This was so intense, I'm not ready to do it again but I look forward to doing it again after some time passes.  I wouldn't mind taking a bit less... maybe 3/4 of what I took, because it was a bit out of my control.  I would have liked to exploit the extremely pleasurable physical sensation of walking/movement without overwhelming myself to the point of hyperventilation.  I think on a slightly lower dose this would be possible.  I also would rather do it during the day next time so I can experience the full range of visual effects, and lastly I would make sure to have a variety of interesting (especially electronic) music around.
