The night in question was my friendÂ’s (same friend mentioned above) birthday party. It was a rave. We were going to be using MDMA powder, which apparently was tested as 98% pure. With great anticipation, I dumped about 50 mg into a glass of water, and poured it down the hatch. I waited. After about 35 minutes had past, I felt nothing. I told this to my friend, who was already rolling, and he suggested I take more. I agreed, so again, I did approximately another 50 mg, and again, I waited. Another 40 minutes had past, and again I was convinced that I was still sober. So this time, my friend just dumped a good pinch more of powder into a drink, and I swallowed. This was it, I thought, as I swallowed it, I felt a tingle of anxiousness flow through my body because I knew there was enough in my system to send me to Oz at this point, it was just a matter of when.
