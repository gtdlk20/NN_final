We were the first ones at the party.  The dancefloor was non-existent, but there was music.  The 4 to the floor house beat, with a dj throwing down some crazy ghetto house.  I stood there, motionless and disconnected from my setting.  Christ I even played a game of pinball. At 10:30 GOR arrived.  We met up with him and another one of his friends.   GOR was already rolling, I assumed and having noticed we were not, and have never done E, he hooked us up (one of the many times.  GOR could walk into a party with just enough money for admisssion and come walking out of the party with 100 bucks and 5 free pills that he hooked up his friends with.  He would get fronted pills and sell them till he made his way up to getting free pills.)
