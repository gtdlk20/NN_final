Well it was about 7:30 so I took both pills with a whole bottle of water. I sat and waited for about 45mins, then I started feeling the stoney roll come up, so I got up and started walking around. I felt like I was going to fall over, I started to feel worse. So I went and drank a glass of milk. The feeling went away, like nothing had happened, so I thought to myself 'I did not just waste 2 fuckin pills'. So I sat down and watched MTV, this was about 8:30. Around 8:45 I had this strange feeling crawling up my back, at 9pm like on the dot I started rolling hard, like I've never rolled before.
