The party arrived and I had five pills from the original batch for the night. I took my 1st one at home before I got on the train knowing that I would be dropping again as I reached my destination and that I would be flying after the scary cab-ride through unlit country lanes to the stable where the party was. Only, by the time I got there I wasnt having any pilling effects. I didnt feel switched on at all. I had no visuals, or grinding, just a slightly sleepy stoned. I double dropped hoping to kick the 1st two in but after a couple of hours I was just tired with a mild headache. I gave my last pill away.
