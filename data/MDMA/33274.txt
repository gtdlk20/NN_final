Marijuana - If you don't smoke it, don't start, but being an avid weed smoker, it hightend my roll, and even brought it back a little when it was dying.  Plus its something to do while waiting for the roll to kick in, you usualy want to keep your mind of it.  I wouldn't want to get TOO stoned though.
