All in all, it was a wonderful time we had on it. Both of us grew much closer to each other, talking about anything and everything. We have done it together a couple of times since and everytime has been extremely gratifying. Going to concerts is the best while on it. We have seen everyone from Flickerstick to Cold to Slipknot on MDMA and it was all great.
