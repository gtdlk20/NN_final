New Year's Eve: I was nervous about coming up based on the last experience, so I decided to take only half a pill. That was 10pm. An hour later, I felt nothing and dropped the other half. It was only when we started to drive to the rave that I felt myself rushing just a little. But that was no surprise, as it takes me 2 pills for the effects to begin. It was 11:30 or midnight when I took the second pill, these pills were considered to be a '5' on a scale on 1 to 10. An hour after taking the second, I asked S for a third, who denied my request. He told me to wait a little longer, just in case. Not long later, I realized he was right.
