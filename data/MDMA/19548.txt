I luckily did not experience nausea at any point.  During the main part of my AMT experience (the 2.5 - 9 hour mark), I felt like I was coming down off of LSD but without any negative body load.  I never felt any 'peak' persay.  I also never felt like I wasn't myself, or like my ego was affected in any real way.
