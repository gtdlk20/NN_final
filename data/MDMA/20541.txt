I sat up, but I didn't wake up, simply because I never passed out.  I was fully conscious the whole time.  As best I could tell, what had happened was that I lost all control of every single voluntary muscle in my body.  I was dissoriented and dizzy, I could not comprehend what my eyes were seeing.  I could not make sense of the world around me.  I didn't hear any voices while I was on the ground, all I heard was that beautiful, beautiful music being played on stage.  It was as if I had been detached from the physical world, all that was around me didn't matter for those 5 seconds I was on the floor.
