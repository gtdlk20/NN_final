He said he had about three assumptions he could make on that--I was either drunk, switching the radio station or eating or something, or just plain tired. Well, since it was now 4:45 a.m., I played on the tired role. Well, it was practically dawn, wasn't it?! Well, this is the great part: as he was flashing his light in my window, he saw the tattoo on my ankle, which sparked a conversation that lasted one whole hour!!! I laugh to this day about that. We talked about everything under the sun, and you know how great coversations are when you're rolling. Even my jaw was still tight, and there I was, chatting it up with this cop who couldn't tell I was FUCKED  UP!!!!! In the end, he gave me a warning and let me go.
