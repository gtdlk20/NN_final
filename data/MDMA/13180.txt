I didn't have much of a 'hangover' the next day.  I had a headache, likely due to dehydration, my lips were extremely chapped, swollen, and sore, I was dizzy every once in a while, but mostly I just felt emotionally numb, like I had used up all of my emotional energy the night before and now I wasn't capable of feeling anything.
