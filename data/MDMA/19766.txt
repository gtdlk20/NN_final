I can feel everything seem to slow down right before the drop. Gravity seems to shift. My head starts to feel thick and cloudy. My vision quickly becomes fuzzy and for a moment I can't focus on anything but catching my breath. The euphoria is overwhelming. My hairs stand on end. All I can do is gasp and smile.
