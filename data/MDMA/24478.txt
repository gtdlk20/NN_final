As we reached the end of our hike, where the trail opened up onto this awesome expanse of cold, rocky river, we all dropped together.  As we played in the water, the effects began to hit us.  First, I had this initial wave of anxiety and fear; does everyone know whats happening to me?  Can they tell I'm sweating?  After that wore off, the feeling of the cold river water and the absolute brilliance of the sun shining down through the canyon we were in took over.  I felt completely at one with the water...the sun...the rocks under my feet....and most of all, my friends.  As we stood knee-deep in the cold water splashing and playing, we would stop, and hug each other and it was such a warm feeling of oneness and love that it is hard to put into words.  I don't think I have ever felt water so cold, so refreshing, and canyon walls so red and vibrant.  I also don't think I have ever felt as close to my friends as I did at that point.  When a breeze started to pick up, I remember just sitting down in the water and letting the breeze run through my hair and thinking that it was the most refreshing, most alive feeling I have ever felt.
