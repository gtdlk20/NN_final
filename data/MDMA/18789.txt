We went outside and went and sat on the porch. I was so overwhelmed by the beauty of nature at this point, that i had smoked my whole cigarette already. It's amazing sitting and realizing that there's all this shit around you everyday, but you don't take notice of it all! You feel so confident when ur rolling, and trust me on this one--depending on who you are, you feel capable of doing anything--me--for instance, i was dancing in front of a group of people, not getting too hot tho, other wise, u don't feel that good. You feel so horny at one point, u can start touching others or ur self, or just something you love. Im known for hugging everyone when i roll. Im told im the cutest thing, and that of course sets me off when I'm rolling, cuz thats just another boost of esteem. The next day, I didn't feel in the least bit shitty, I felt good as hell. Honestly that shit is addicting, im getting ready to do some more next weekend. One thing, don't do it over a long period of time, other wise soon enough u'll be taking rolls and nothing will happen because ur body has not yet exported the roll. It is the best feeling. I try everything once, but this is one thing I'm going to do whenever I want to have a good time and just feel like the best thing in the world!
