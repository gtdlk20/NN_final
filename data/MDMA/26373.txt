I couldnt control myself as much at this point and took the last pill without thinking about it much (or in that Meh, why the hell not, I might as well! attitude) around 4:00am. I continued with what I was doing for a bit more. Anything seems to entertain me while Im rolling. But the most messed up thing happened around 4:40am or so.
