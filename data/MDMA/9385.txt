We were staying in a vacation home in the southwest.  The weather was beautiful and we went on two moderate hikes that day.  In the evening we came back to the house and were still trying to decide if we wanted to dose that night.  We had both been battling colds earlier in the week, but had been taking lots of vitamins and herbal remedies and felt much better, so we decided to go for it.  The house had two levels.  Downstairs was a cozy den with a fireplace and a small patio.  Upstairs the house was very open, and one entire wall was windows, which looked over city lights and red rocks.  There was also a large open patio upstairs, though the night was cloudy, so there was no view of stars.  It was the new moon.  We had five pills to share between us, so we cut one in half and decided to do one full pill and a half initially, and then the other pill when we started to come down.
