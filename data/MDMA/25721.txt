I had bought two tabs through a friend and taken one before out at a club and not noticed anything. When I had bought the ecstasy it was the first time I had ever heard of the drug. We were out again next week again at a club and I took the other. This time I felt a little surge. Right when I was coming down off the little boost my friend asks me if I want another. Sure I say. This one's different, a poppy imprinted little orange pill. I take. I swallow.
