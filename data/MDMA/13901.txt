I decide to sit up and see how being upright and mobile feels.  I have not had any water since prior to ingesting the MDMA and I know I should start hydrating.  I stand and walk downstairs to fill a glass of water without any discomfort or difficulty.  I step outside and take my first sip.  Wow, I am thirsty!  The coolness of the water combined with a light breeze felt across my exposed legs and upper body makes me shudder with pleasure.  The breeze across my chest makes me realize I have lost my shirt since the beginning of this adventure although I canÂ’t recall when or where.
