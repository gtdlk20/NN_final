Although the events of that night were extremely funny, all of you out there should realize I was EXTREMELY lucky. If I had gotten an asshole cop, I could have gotten busted, and I have been told that if I am arrested for any reason, I may kiss my near future career goodbye (clinical psychologist). And let me tell you, one good roll would not have been worth it. So people, when doing any drugs, do not drive yourselves! If you are in the backseat of someone's car and they get pulled over, at least you can play drunk and the cops probably won't care too much about you anyway (unless you're under age--then you're fucked). Happy rolling! Peace Out
