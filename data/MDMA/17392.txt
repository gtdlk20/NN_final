I tried Ecstasy a few days ago, on the fourth of July during a small party. I came with my friend and at first the only plan was to smoke weed through an epic bong belonging to one of the other party goers. After smoking several bowls the decision was made to buy some Ecstasy for a few of the people there. However, the availability of the ecstasy, and probably the holiday setting, encouraged everyone to take some, including myself (I had always had a mild interest in trying Ecstasy). I took a single blue tablet which my friend pronounced as pretty pure.
