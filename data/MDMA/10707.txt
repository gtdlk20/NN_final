I tried drinking a cup of tea, but it made my mouth feel very dry and shrivelled.  I felt a bit hungry but couldn't actually think of an appetizing food.  I remembered a lovely fruit salad I'd had on my previous E experiment - I'd walked around looking at it for ages before remembering it was supposed to be eaten.  Eventually my Dad and I had run out of things to say and I decided to go to bed.  It was about 3:30am by then and I had to get up at a decent time to get the train home.
