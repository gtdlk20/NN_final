Contrary to what IÂ’ve heard, my experience was pretty dull. I could compare it to drinking enough to get a pretty good buzz (not able to drive, but able to be aware of my surroundings and to control myself), and not drinking anymore and hanging out with everyone until I feel completely sober again.
