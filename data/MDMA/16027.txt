By this point it had been almost 2 hours since we dosed, and we all felt UNREAL. Some of my friends were concerned about redosing and didn't want to do it because of the risks, but me, B, T and M went to find our guy again. Sure enough, he was in the same spot. When we saw him, I ran up to him and almost hugged the dealer out of pure happiness to see him. He laughed. It probably wasn't very smart in hindsight - we're from Brazil and many dealers have a no-nonsense kind of approach) but our guy seemed to be fine with it. We bought some more and headed over to the trance stage with our other friends who had decided not to redose.
