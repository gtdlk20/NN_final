We drove to San Francisco and finally got parking and our hotel room after a bit of stressing and dealing with traffic. We unloaded everything and had a while to wait before the concert, so we just chilled and listened to music. I ordered a huge bed, but instead the hotel gave us two large beds, which still worked fine. We made one bed a fuzzy bed, and the other a rougher/ cooler bed. My girlfriend broke up most of the weed and rolled about 6 joints. We ate the rest of our burritos for fuel and then we walked to the concert.
