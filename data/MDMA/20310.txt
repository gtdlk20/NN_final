So finally we get into the main stage area (the trance section of the rave/concert).  And the music sounds really crisp and clear, and I feel good, but I don't feel like I'm truly 'rolling.'  So I take a pink playboy pill, and about 40 minutes later I experienced a feeling that I've never in my life felt... It's unexplainable.  I just feel so good.  Uninhibited. Friendly. Sympathetic to people's feelings.  Loving.  Wanting to make a connection.  It was just a great feeling. I just feel so good.  Uninhibited. Friendly. Sympathetic to people's feelings.  Loving.  Wanting to make a connection.  It was just a great feeling... I'm happy, I can feel every beat of the music pulsing through my body, and I'm just up and dancing, feeling myself (tacticle sensation is really amplified).  So my friends and I are giving each other massages, which we would never do if we weren't on this drug.  And we have people give us a personal light show.  Basically, I'm sitting in a chair and someone is standing directly in front of me with either phototon lights or color finger lights and they're making patterns and just moving the lights in crazy directions, and the lights just put me in a trance.  It sounds weird, but it's incredible.
