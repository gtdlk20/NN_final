The first time I had a nightmare I dreamed this: A green and brown crystaline tree grew out of my bedroom window and the branches started to grow through the window. At first it was beautiful and fascinating. It turned ugly when the tree branches wrapped themselves around my neck, choking me. I started screaming for help but I couldn't talk. My voice was paralyzed.
