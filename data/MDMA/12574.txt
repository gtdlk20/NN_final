For a long time I had been wanting to do ecstasy while just 'chilling' at some friends house instead of going to a rave. I think at a rave the environment can affect the empathy and flow of feelings somehow. Plenty of times I 'rushed' to friends and quickly expressed my feelings and than ran off and danced. I also think just sitting and relaxing lets your mind flow more and you can reminisce on aspects of your life...
