It was fucking awesome. The feeling that spread throughout my body (and particularly in private areas) is impossible to describe, except for the fact that five minutes later, my friend and I had to leave because I thought I would no longer be able to contain my 'YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' of pure pleasure. What did suck was that I froze my ass off the whole time. We had taken a chartered bus to the dance, and the driver wouldn't leave because we were the only two people on the bus (even though the buses were supposed to make round trips all nite). We sat in the back of the bus, and I wound up curled up in the fetal position, feeling UNBELIEVABLY INCREDIBLE. I don't remember most of the trip home (after we convinced the bus driver that no one else would be coming for a long time), but my friend said I seemed in control and was talking (probably more like chattering) the whole time. It felt simply amazing is all I can say.
