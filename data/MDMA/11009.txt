Background: My name is Kayla and I live in Canada. I've been doing softer drugs (such as smoking pot) every day for a long time now and I've been experimenting with drugs such as LSD, mushrooms, MDMA, salvia and various other drugs, for several years now and I strongly believe it is this drug use that has shaped me as a person. Without these experiences, both good and bad, there is no way I would have become the person I am today. In this, I feel it necissary to share one of my intense and shaping experiences, although there are so many more.
