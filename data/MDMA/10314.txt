The next morning I awoke to a clear mind.  No traces of negativity or an unpleasant hangover were anywhere in sight.  In fact, the hangover is almost as good as the drug itself.  I blissfully went about my morning, immediately going outside and sitting in the grass.  Drinking apple juice and contemplating trees was the simplest and most organic of lifeÂ’s pleasures.
