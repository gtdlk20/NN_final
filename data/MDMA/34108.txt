When I had my eyes closed i felt the music. I was the music. my friends were music. I loved music. With my eyes open, i loved my friends and even people around me i didn't even know. i loved the way everybody danced and how friendly everybody was. There were times when i would listen to music sitting down, and just go into a trance kinda feeling, and then when i snap out of it i would think just how much i love LIFE and X!! it's all about love. I felt like the whole place was one big love machine. it's ALL about love.
