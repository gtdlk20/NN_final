At some point we examined our pupils, and they were extremely dilated. E told me about his best friends obsession with recording trips scientifically, which I thought was a very good idea, so he grabbed a piece of paper and put a pencil in my mouth for some reason (he has since claimed its because I said I had no hands, but I dont think that really happened). I wasnt filled with energy - while I wasnt tired in the least, throughout the entire trip I felt content to remain in one spot (cuddling with E) and was incredibly placid. I didnt feel the need to move quickly or sharply. When we did walk around, our muscles felt weak and silly.
