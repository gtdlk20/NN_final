Time continues to march on without me paying much attention to it.  I feel like preparing the dosages at my desk happened ages ago, but at the same time it seems to be only moments since I embarked on this journey.  I make my way downstairs to once again refill my water.  My motor skills are normal.  No difficulties or enhancement can be definitively felt.  The air feels thick as I move through it.  My temperature is fine, and the air is cool, yet somehow I have the sensation of extreme humidity: the air molecules are more tangible than normal as I pass through them.  I drink a large mug of water and then refill the vessel to bring with me back to my room.
