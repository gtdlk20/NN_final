For those who don't know what vaginismus is: "a condition that affects a woman's ability to engage in any form of vaginal penetration, [...] the result of a reflex of the pubococcygeus muscle, which is sometimes referred to as the 'PC muscle'. The reflex causes the muscles in the vagina to tense suddenly, which makes any kind of vaginal penetrationincluding sexual intercoursepainful or impossible." Source: wikipedia
