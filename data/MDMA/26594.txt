I felt great and after 3 months I went to a drum 'n' bass night into a small club. The night starts with a couple of beers and then we took 0.2mg of MDMA. After one hour my friend start to feel it and roll, I waited 30min. more and I took another 0.1mg, finally I also started to roll. The music was great, I knew that Dj very well and I had a good peak but as the Dj changed I immediately stopped rolling and probably being bored (it can happen also on MDMA) I start to listen to what the MC was saying, it was very repetitive with a lot of whatcha rolling and so on. Then I start to look at some chicks that were there and I started to hear the MC commenting on what I was doing, like he watch her, he stop her nooo she run away.
