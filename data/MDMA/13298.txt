And my newfound brother? Each time we go to raves together on pills we would always make sure the other person knew how we felt. We called ourselves brothers. But even out of the rave scene and not on drugs we stilled called each other brothers. He looked out for me and was always looking for ways he could help. He even sent me a birthday wish 4 months after my flatmate and him had broken up.
