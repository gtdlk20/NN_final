A little about my drug history at the time of this experience:  Id taken ecstasy about 6 or 7 times over the course of a few years, with experiences usually separated by at least a couple months.  Id taken LSD and mushrooms probably around 10 or 15 times, but hadnt tripped for about 7 or 8 years.  Id done a bit of cocaine, casually (if it was around), but never really sought it out and didnt do it that much.  Cocaine and alcohol were the only drugs Id used fairly recently (I didnt smoke pot).  I hadnt taken ecstasy in probably a year or so.
