i used to only do extasy with my boyfriend until i got invited to a rolling party. my best friend and i decided to go. we bought these tablets called ferrari. we both took one pill and started smoking some weed. after about an hour i started to feel the familiar rushing feeling. my stomach was turning and i felt that every time i moved i might get sick. there were candles everywhere and the heat was jacked up to 85 degrees. someone was dancing with glowsticks and there entire body dissapeared and all i could see was these incredible lights making wild patterns in the darkness. i glanced at my friend and she seemed to take on the body of a very fat person. she had double chins and filled up the entire recliner.
