The next day back in L.A. my friend awoke in a horrible mood.  After a long day of errand-running and a night out on the town, my best friend that I have known for ten years unleashed an unholy torrent of anger at me.  She began screaming at me for absolutely no reason.  Although I have seen her temper and know that her anger can be intense, I have never seen anything so frightening in all of my life.  Back at her place I began to pack my belongings, wanting desperately to be away from her.  She would not let me leave, and insisted that I stay.  She finally left me alone, on the condition that I stay the night.  Though my friend and I had had our ups and downs over the years, I was fully convinced that night it was all coming to an end.  The anger and venom that she spewed at me left me trembling, and I sat bolt upright on the futon, fearing that if I went to sleep she would, in her unreasonable anger, come in and kill me in the night.  Though it sounds irrational, this was a genuine fear, and I can truthfully say that though I have been afraid, I have never feared for my personal safety as I did at that moment.
