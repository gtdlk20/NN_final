The effects my body feels are steady and constant.  There is no pulsation, no coming and going of intensity.  Much like my mental state, the sensations are even keeled and steady, although very strong.  Strong is perhaps the incorrect word.  Deep.  Powerful. Magnificent.  These words seem closer to correct . . . and yet none seem to capture the collaboration of delicacy and sheer mightiness of what my body is feeling.
