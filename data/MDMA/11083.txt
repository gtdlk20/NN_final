We took our tablets at about 4:20 or 4:25 in the afternoon. Instead of swallowing them, like I had done before, the guy we'd bought them from told us to bite them with our back molars and swallow them, as it would hit us faster. So we did this, and it tasted absolutely horrible--the most chemical thing I have EVER tasted, without a doubt--but we knew it'd be worth it, so, down the hatch it went. G's mom drove us to the movie theater, which was about 15 minutes away, so we thought we'd be pretty safe, and the E wouldn't kick in until we were away from her and didn't have to act normal. Strangely enough, though, the first waves began to roll over us at about 4:45 or 4:50, when we were in the car. We tried not to say much, but as I later confirmed with G, we were both definitely starting to feel it that quickly. After we got out of the car, the waves were coming on much more quickly. I was definitely surprised at how fast and hard the E hit, since it's never happened like that before for me. We walked through the shopping center and towards the theater, and I felt like I completely lost my body. I felt like I was just a head, floating in the air, and moving toward my destination.
