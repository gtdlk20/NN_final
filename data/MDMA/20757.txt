The fake X only heightened the importance of my quest to find this drug. My girlfriend has used MDMA before and wanted me to experience it with her, so she jumped at the opportunity to buy (from a friend) what she had been told were some White Euros. They were 25$ each, but she didn't get them until a couple days later, when she realized that they were actually G-spots, with the lady on the back. We researched the roll, and only read good things about it. It was the first (and real) press of this kind, and it came all the way from Europe apparently.
