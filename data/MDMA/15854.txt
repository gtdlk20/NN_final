I turned all the lights off and turned on the black lights, and some loud music. I danced by myself till 10:30, it felt like 10 mins. At about 10:45, I decided to go outside (forgeting it was raining). I went into the backyard, everytime a rain drop hit my face I just felt like I was in heaven. It was the best feeling of my life. So I took my shirt off and laid on the ground, the clod concret felt amazing, and the rain drops hitting my body were even better. I was in heaven, I thought I died and went to heaven, seriously. I laid there till 4:30am, then I went inside and dried off. Roll started to crash down hard about 5am, so I smoked some weed to ease the fall, and I fell right to sleep. I woke up at 12:50 feeling great, except for having a sore throat and stuffed nose. It didnt bother me anymore that me and my g/f had broken up, I relized that it was for the best and that I'm young and I need to have fun. Well thats my trip report, enjoy!
