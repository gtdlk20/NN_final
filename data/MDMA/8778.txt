Physiologically, my system doesnt tolerate any type of drug well, so I knew to plan accordingly. I took no prescription drug on the day of or the day after my experiences. Hypersensitivity of the nervous system is normal for me. Im planning to do one more session in about 6 weeks and that will be the last for MDMA. Even though I do not tolerate MDMA well, so far, the therapeutic results have been worth it for me.
