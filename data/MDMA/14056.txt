This one goes out to freeflyer, i have a similiar story to tell. So there i was, the last week of 2000 with 5 HQ's (damn good pills) aquired from hard earned christmas money. I was supposed to sell them to turn a profit but my weaknesses showed and i just could not help myself. I had just come off a horrible flu that floored me for 4 days and was ready to go back out into the world and have some fun. I had lost a substantial amount of weight when i was sick, about four pounds and was still rather weak physically but i paid no mind.
