I felt sad, drained, and scared the next day. Loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue, and anxiety. I thought I had seriously hurt myself by taking the dose I took. I talked to my friend after I made myself a small breakfast. I felt overwhelmed by my emotions, told my friend I would see them later, and then went to my room to cry. I felt like I needed to get away from the house.
