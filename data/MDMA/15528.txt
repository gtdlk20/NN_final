Later on I pulled my two best friends aside and asked the guys to sit down with me. We were all rolling together as usual and I felt the need to bond with them on a subconscious and philosophical level. My thoughts and feelings were that of grandeur, as though I was stately and important, yet feeling the need to act as the 'father' of the party. I took care of everyone's needs and was very passive yet confident throughout the experience.
