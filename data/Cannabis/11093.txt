The week before this happened, I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed. I had been on painkillers for a couple of days, but stopped taking them a few days before the 'main event'. My parents were going away for the weekend, so I figured I'd have a house party, just me and some friends, and it ended up lasting a few days. Apparently I have a great backyard for smoking - nobody can see into my back yard unless they are standing in it, which is a plus.
