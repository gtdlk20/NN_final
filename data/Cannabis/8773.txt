I woke up. It was Dawn. My roomie and I were on the bed with one occupant of the room. I had slept like a baby and was satisfied with my sleep after all those days of interrupted sleep. I stood up, feeling wobbly and calm. The effects had mostly faded. I went back to my room and begun the day. As I type this, I continue to feel an afterglow, a very subtle feeling of being high and disoriented, a fraction of what it was. I guess I'll be back to normal in the next couple of days.
