Long story short, I was camping on an island with my sister and some friends that I only get to see once a year.  There were five of us: me, my sister Mary, my friend Fred, Freds sister Ann, and Anns friend Kate.  (Names have been changed.  Duh.)  Fred smokes, and my sister smokes (I got her started), but Ann and Kate, being a year or two younger than the rest of us, didnt smoke.  I had brought a big fat joint along (a gift from another friend), hoping there would be a chance when Fred and I could sneak off and smoke it, possibly with my sister.  Anyways, the night was rather eventless.  We all sat around the fire and made smores.  Soon, Fred got into a fight with his sister.  They bitched back and forth, and Fred eventually just gave up and announced he was simply going to go to sleep early in his tent (it was about 8:00 pm).  I saw my opportunity.  I followed Fred into his tent, and he mumbled for me to go away.  I whipped out the joint and shined my flashlight on it.  Freds face immidiately lit up.  He simply said Lets go look at the stars!  So off we went, to the opposite end of the island, away from the two non-smokers.  My sis cought on and followed quietly.
