With many drugs, I am a lightweight  when I ingest any drugs, I tend to consume a fraction of that which my male friends do. Cannabis is no exception  I will smoke a very small bowl (one that I would complete in half a breath) and that would be sufficient. The hazy feeling I experience when I smoke Cannabis averts me to smoking heavily in the presence of friends, as I tend to become socially paranoid. However, I did realize that this is a powerful drug  an especially psychedelic one, in spite of what some may claim  and it deserved to be treated with the same respect and analysis as other drugs Ive experimented with, like LSD and mushrooms. So, with this in mind, I decided to have a high-dose Cannabis trip in a safe, comfortable environment: my home at about 8pm, with just myself and my boyfriend.
