I had a bad trip about three years ago that left me pacing my hallway in a panic for 3 hrs trying to avoid any rays of sunlight on the floor. So since then Ive practiced extreme moderation with brownies and cautioned everyone else to do the same. But most people insist that because I have a low threshold for weed and liquor, I simply have no idea what harsh really is. Or to quote something a friend said once, I dont think you understand the point of weed.
