I feel that I must submit my recent experiences of the past couple of weeks with cannabis as they are truly profound, surprisingly intense, and mindbogglingly psychedelic. As a side-note, I have been smoking weed for a little over a year and a half and it has always been good to me. I've had some trippy highs, many intense highs, but nothing at all like what I've been experiencing as of late. I must also mention that about 2 months ago I had my first and only experience with psilocybin mushrooms - this remains my only real experience with a 'real' all-out psychedelic, barring some half-failed attempts at breaking through on Salvia. I mention the mushroom experience because I'm certain it must have had some effect on my cannabis highs, a theory backed up by just how high I have been getting recently.
