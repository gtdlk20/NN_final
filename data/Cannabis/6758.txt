Downstairs, in the living section of his house, I asked him if he was burning out, and he said that he had been for about an hour. I was amazed at this, though when I'm sober I'm not, I've gotten used to being stoned way longer, and way more then most of my friends. I asked him to change the song that was playing. He asked me what I was talking about, and all of a sudden I realized that there had been a song playing over and over and over in my mind the entire walk home. More so then that, it was a single section of the song 'Don't Push' by Sublime. We watched the movie, though it was way too long with both of us burning out, so we fell asleep mid-way through it, though the parts of it I saw were incredible.
