Within 10 minutes I am in another world. I am beginning to feel the effects of this blunt hit me like a ton of bricks. Everything I feel, say, and do begins to feel like a dream, but it's real life. Everything I feel, say, and do begins to feel like a dream, but it's real life. Me and my brother start having a deep conversation about things that nobody understands but us two. Out of nowhere I ask the question 'How have I made it this far?'. I promise you that I have never asked a deeper question in my whole lifetime and I have had 5 surgeries in the past 7 years, plus a near death experience with Pneumonia so I have came close to not making it a time or two. At this time I am bawling and letting so much out I begin to make myself speechless because what I am sharing with my younger brother is some real life stuff that needed to come out. After talking for a while longer I decide to take a nap because I am emotionally drained, and far away in another place.
