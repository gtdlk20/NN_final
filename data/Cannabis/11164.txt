Place the straw in your mouth, and with the other hand pull out the red-hot knife from under the element.  Move the straw towards the end of the knife and begin inhaling slowly.  With your other hand place the blob of oil onto the knife and rub it up and down a little bit.  The oil should bubble a little bit then 'poof' the smoke out.  Make sure you're inhaling a little faster for when it starts smoking.
