Thomas started rolling it and showed us how to roll a ' mully' joint. It was so fucking funny. He was acting like it was an infomercial. We where all tripping out, he is so funny. Then we smoked another one and talked and laughed. But here is were the good part starts. Every one left the room , but I stayed in the room. The reason for this is I usually trip unusually to much. So, I stayed and tripped.
