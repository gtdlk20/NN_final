I had had a busy morning at work (it was a Saturday but I work weekends), but had been looking forward to this outdoor excursion and an afternoon/evening of fun with my lover, so I was in good spirits. I may have been a tad dehydrated, but was enjoying the breeze and the general merriment of the crowd, including the drum circles and fun costumes.
