Introduction: Tonight my roommate and I were out of bud, so we decided to try to do an cannabinoid extraction of some leftover stems using rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) as the extracting solvent.  I documented the experience for a forum I frequent, and it was suggested that I submit the report here as well.
