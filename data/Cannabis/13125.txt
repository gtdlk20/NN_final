So heres what happened. I was walking along the beach and I spotted my friend L underneath the pier smoking a blunt. Like I mentioned earlier I had gone a while without pot and figured one more time wouldnt kill me with guilt! Anyway we smoked, got stoned, and got up and left after while. I walked around for about an hour before I decided to go home and munch. By this time the high was starting to wear off, but almost as soon as I had turned on to 21st the creeper hit me. For those of you unfamiliar with the term 'creeper', it's a high that for no reason suddenly intensifies dramatically without the user boosting. What followed was the most lovely experience I have ever had on pot. I was'nt a whole lot 'higher' than before but I noticed colors were becoming extremely intense to the point of changing. The grey, dismal sky took on a purple tone, the street shone sapphire blue, and every green plant around me pulsed with an intense glow, as if I could actually see the life flowing through them. Altogether, I felt as though I was walking inside a living painting.
