Then I brought my attention back to my boyfriend's room, and everything looked different. Everything I saw was moving like it was a wave or something. Then the TV, his roommate's bed, the dresser, and the walls all got way huge and out of proportion so like it looked like there was no floor space. Everything just kind of squished together, it looked like a cartoon. Then after that the opposite happened; everything got all skinny and super stretched out so the room looked HUGE.
