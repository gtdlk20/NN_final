I was now very freaked and and sorta stumbled/sprinted forward past this area and off the bridge.  I was now only about four blocks from my apartment, but it was through a busy bar district on a Thursday night.  Thursdays were big bar hopping nights in this town.  I tried to take a wide path around the bar area but as I walked I would see people up ahead under the street lights and every single one of them looked exactly like my boss's wife.  I would wave to her and try to say something sane sounding and would realize halfway through that this was just a random stranger.  This probably looked utterly ridiculous to anyone nearby.  Somehow I managed to realize this and rushed the rest of the way home.
