About fifty feet down the road, we realized it would be ridiculous to choose a road before we smoked the cannabis, because we might not remember which way back (a night in the middle of the woods with no camping material and some parents expecting us back home that night would be a less-than-desirable experience). We went back to the crossroads, and S filled her glass pipe with the stuff. The amount of cannabis she had can be compared to the size of a half of a French fry--for four people. We saw this and paused for a second to wonder what she was thinking, then verbalized this thought in a bit of skepticism. She assured us that it was very strong, and was enough for everybody, so she lit it up and hit it. It got passed around the four of us for about 5 minutes, and so she put it away and we started talking. From this point on (actually it was more like from the first time we were at the crossroads), K would be playing guitar all night.
