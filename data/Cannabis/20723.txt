One night me and a few buddies were just driving and we decided to head on over to a buddies house to smoke some.  About an hour before we went over to his house, I smoked a bowl by myself of some pretty dank stuff.  Anyways so we go over there and I've never smoked out of a bong before so I take 4 good hits and WOW I've never ever felt like that before in my life.  So we walk to the dude's car to chill in and all of a sudden my heart starts beating so fucking fast.  This freaks me out.  At this point I didn't know weed could do that so I was like what the hell was that we smoked?  Well the dude says it was laced w/ PCP.....at this point I freak out on him and start yelling and shit but he says he was just kidding.  So at this point I could barely concentrate and my throat felt like it was trying to close(??) or something like that.  Scary.  I pretty much felt like I was going to die so I got very very scared.  So they drop me off at my house and it feels like I'm in a foreign place.  I try to eat a swiss cake and I can't even get it down because my mouth is so dry.  When I went to sleep that night I thought I was going to die.  I wake up the next day for school and I'm not high but I'm really like anxious and jumpy and all this.  My body felt realyl weird like all tense for the next week or so but then it went away.  Was it laced with PCP??? I don't know.  I don't think I want to know either.  All I know is that pot is more potent than some people think.  I've had a lot of fun with pot before but that fun was because I'd get stoned and all it would do is make me chill out and enjoy food and music a lot more but this was nothing like that.
