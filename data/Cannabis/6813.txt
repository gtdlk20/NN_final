I found my friend Warren and hung out with him the rest of the night. Everything that was happening, I didn't understand the reality of it. I would cross the street, oblivious to the chance that a car may hit me. I walked by a creepy-looking homeless man, unaware of my great fear that a homeless man will try to mug me one day. I walked along the busiest street in my city, not knowing that cars were zooming past me 50 miles per hour. I was very unattentive, but I decided to trust my body and let it do whatever it pleased.
