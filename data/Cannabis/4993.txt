Instead of turning back at this point (which probably would have been wise) I decided to push on and finish my walk.  As I continued on my walk I got more and more confused as to where I was.  I recall leaving the path and wandering through a neighborhood looking for my apartment building-which, by this time, was on the other side of a large train switch yard.  This went on for some period of time which is completely lost to me, it may have been 20 minutes, it may have been an hour.  At some point I found my way back to the main bridge over the train tracks.  I have NO idea how I did this, I was so confused at this point that I thought I was still in high school and about four years younger, I constantly was looking around for my moms car, even though she was over 800 miles away.
