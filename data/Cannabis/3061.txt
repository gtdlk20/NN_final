Two friends and I, let's call them D and E, set out the other day to find a mystical environment to smoke up.  We found a small wooded area with a large tree in the center.  Once in the wooded area, we could hardly see the fields around us.  The area was perfect, the sun was out, the birds were singing, the place had the atmosphere of being somewhere in the jungle.
