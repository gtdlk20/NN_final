After I tried to recollect and not let myself talk out of my ass I sat up and decided I did not feel 'great' at all. I was beyond 'high'. I usually never get cotton mouth to begin with but this was the worst I have ever gotten in any circumstance. The forest had turned into a jungle. I had this goofy pain running from my head moving down to where my chest was, then starting over again at my head and repeating itself. Internally I began to panick. I told my friend I had to lay down and laid on the dirt on the 'jungle' floor. He kept reminding me that I was laying on the fucking ground and that I should try standing, that took a good minute.
