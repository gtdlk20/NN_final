I walk back across the street and this guy with a blue mowhawk steps out of a cab. I go up to him and smooth his hair up between my two hands and exclaim, That is awesome, I love it! He laughs as he walks away. I continue to go up to strangers talking gibberish. I felt like I was dreaming! Really I was like, wow, when am I going to wake up.
