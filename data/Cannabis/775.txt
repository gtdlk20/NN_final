12:15 AM (not exactly, but relative to my last timing, let's say): I'm watching TV - whatever comes on before (or is that after?) the Oblongs on the Cartoon Network here in Canada. Some very raunchy and crudely-drawn animated program. The cartoon seems to have been concocted by someone as stoned as I am - perhaps even moreso - because it feels like absurdist genius. The jokes seem as cryptic as the visions to come, but still I nearly choke with hysterical laughter. It's just like the profound nonsense, the visualization of glossolalia that I'll experience later: I don't know what it means, but I know its meaning is profound. I don't know why it's funny, but it's absolutely hilarious, and thus I behave accordingly.
