After we both noticed this and decided it was possibly something of importance, we searched frantically for one of the several stations carrying the images. After we had finally arrived on the scene of the news program, we slowly learned of the shooting at LAX airport. The caption read, 'Three dead in shooting incident.' Not sure what to make of it we watched, and then, as wrong as it may have been, laughed until we were very short on breath. The comment taking blame for these fits of laughter? 'We believe it was nearly a personal problem, nothing more than that, although we have contained all those that were in the airport.' I am still not sure why this was so humorous as it was, but I believe it was due to the conversation we had about Grand Theft Auto III days before.
