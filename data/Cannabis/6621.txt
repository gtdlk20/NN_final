I arrived at the place by a couple minutes passed noon, accompanied by my Strat guitar and a tiny amplifier that packs an insane sound that can vary in seemingly a million different ways. Today there was also a groovy navy blue beanie that held itself onto my skull very warmly, something that is somewhat out of character for me. But, luckily, the mood today called for something different, daring, crazy, out-there, and ready to make the world shout, 'Wow'. This something happened to be an unadorned beanie. Ironically, also, this was what saved my very life at one point in the day. Were it not for this thick winter-protective fabric my mind would have been subjected to visions that it wasn't ready to accept. It became a place of comfort and hiding; a physically comforting escape from the fear.
