I started to feel like I was drifting, like falling, and I started thinking of everything that was lost, of everyone that died and that no one had time to say goodbye. I felt so alone and sad. I was cursing the fact that I still existed, I was so alone and afraid and thinking how much time is this going to last? Eternity? Will I join the others or is everyone alone in it one space like me forever?
