This even felt like some sort of hallucinogenic trip mixed with a crack trip or something. I was sweating, and my heart felt like it was going to explode it was beating soo fast. After about what seemed like 6 hours, ended up only being about 2-3 hours. The trip finally started to level off, and my heart rate gradually slowed down and I continued to walk around and chill out until I went back home. When I came home that night, I felt weird and really sketchy. I just laid in my bed and fell asleep eventually. (I had school the next morning). I have never smoked pot again after this, and I don't think I ever will, unless maybe I could find an anti-anxiety type strain.
