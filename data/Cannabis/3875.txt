I decieded that I was too blown to be on my computer so I laid on my bed and stared at my shelf while laying on my side.  On my shelf I have one of those globes attached to the stand that generate electricity beams and they connect to your fingers when you touch the glass.  I stared at this object for about 5 minutes until it looked as if the black outline of the object was turning a glowing yellow.  A few more minutes passed and suddenly I was able to generate an exact copy of the outline filled in with vibrant colors directly next to it.  I was confused because I am a chronic marijuana user and have never tripped off of marijuana before.
