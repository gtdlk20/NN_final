I am an 18 year old, healthy and fit individual. I exercise 5-6 times a week, I'm a straight A student in school, and I have no family history of drug addiction, or any serious health matters for that fact. I am from a upper-middle class family and I live in a stereotypical suburban neighborhood. I am not prescribed to any drugs, and I like it that way. I have had no major traumas, physically or mentally, but I am extremely clumsy and consider myself lucky that I am not dead or severely maimed from some of the stupid shit I have almost done (I.e, putting an electric razor in a sink, sticking my hand in the garbage disposal, falling off of tall buildings, etc.)
