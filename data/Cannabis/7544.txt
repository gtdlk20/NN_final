LSA: 4 trips (max. WAY TOO MUCH! 3 caps of a legal high called Druid's Fantasy, purportedly containing Morning Glory/HBWR seeds along with a couple of other things + 10 Morning Glory seeds, thinking it was an 'average' dose - never again did I take anything I wasnt 110% sure of - a leason learned early, a leason learned well)
