I wrote this account of my horrifying experience nearly one year ago. It is a fresh account of what happened, as I wrote it the next day. I had panic attacks everyday for several weeks after I had this experience, which sometimes began immediately when I woke up in the morning. I also had experiences of disassociation from my environment for nearly one month after the initial ordeal. I would simply feel as if I was not real for hours or even a whole day. This happened when I was sitting on the bus, I looked around, and up at the ceiling of the bus, and felt as though I was not really there, and that I did not exist in this environment, along side with these people. The same thing would happen in class, at my friends house, etc. My three friends who all hit off the same blunt as I did unanimously reported feeling normal highs.
