I began to see straight up hallucinations, like a multicolored wave in from of my eyes just morphing and shifting, then neon psychedelic ribbons and spirals.  I felt like I'd eaten a ten-strip of acid.  I'm not sure what happened next but I seemed to be going deeper and deeper into this altered state, and I had trouble fighting it.  Even when I put on some music I found it a little frightening, as well as when I tried to placate myself with a movie; it was as if I didn't understand what these things were anymore.  I kept getting horrible shivers as well, that wracked my entire body, as if I were cold.  I ended up just going to sleep after some struggle, and felt fine in the morning.
