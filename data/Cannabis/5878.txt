I called my friend and we picked up a couple of grams and got dropped off at a park for a couple of hours while my other friend had to take his GED test. We decided to smoke in the small wooded area next to the park. Now usually, the stuff I get, or have gotten in the past, with a few exceptions, makes me get a nice 'hazy' feeling and calms me. I do not know if the profound experience I achieved was because of the THC potency perhaps, or if it was because I just smoked too damn much for myself personally. After a good three hits I feel the normal 'high'. The woods seemed bigger, everything was nice and hazy, the feeling of some random asshole just happening to catch us from somewhere, the usual. After about five, it was cashed.
