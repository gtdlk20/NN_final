A couple times in the first week I took half an edible in the evening (5mg of indica). The effect was mild, but noticeable. I'd describe it as a lightness which is part relaxation and part tingling. I realized I have to take it much earlier than I thought, because it takes 1-2 hours to even have an effect, and then the effect lasts a super long time.  I also tried the dose pen a little. I didn't get much from it.
