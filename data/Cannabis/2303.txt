I must also add that when I say I had no peripheral vision, I mean it. My field of vision looked exactly like an old black and white movie, where the corners of the screen have a black haze on them, and the lighting focuses on one object. I noticed that while looking at my arm, I couldnÂ’t see my legs or my feet, and when I looked at my feet, everything else had disappeared from view, due to my lack of peripheral vision.
