The Human mind is actually a cluster, consisting of and giving out parallel streams of thought/energy. To the normal waking mind, which is not under the influence of any psychotopic plant/drug and is therefore  slow at grasping these multiple stream of thoughts simultaneously, they seem to appear one after the other.  Under Cannabis, the mind is conscious of these simultaneous stream of thoughts and is able to look at each of them separately. But the speed at which these thoughts arise is mind boggling !! Perhaps in case of of  schizophrenics this cluster is in a reality-shattering overdrive.
