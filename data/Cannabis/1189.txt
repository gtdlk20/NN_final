Slowly I began to accept that this was the end for me and that I might move forward in my journey. However it was perhaps sometime after this, that I started to feel that my body was taking my consciousness back into my body again and when I opened my eyes, I could not look at things the same way ever again. It must have passed around 3-4 hours after I talked to my sister and her boyfriend until I came back.
