I had never felt better in my life.  I apologized to everyone that night for all the bad things I had done in the past to them. The next day I became depressed but I understood that the world was'nt created so that we can fight and waste our time, but it was created to make peace and love.  I use to be a bitch before this experience, but now I'm a new man.....
