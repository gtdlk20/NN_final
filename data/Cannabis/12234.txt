Anyway, my 2 friends told me to close my eyes. I had heard of people seeing 'closed eye visuals' on shrooms, so I thought 'why not?' So I closed my eyes. For the first 5 seconds I saw nothing, but then I saw little rainbow zig-zags, 4 of them, then 8, then they shot out in every direction making a geometric pattern, then they filled my vision and disappeared. Next came squares made out of rainbow, and they did the same thing. I was getting sick of things made out of rainbow color patterns so I tried to make something else appear, and startlingly, I could visualize anything I wanted to like it was right in front of me, though I could still tell it wasn't real.
