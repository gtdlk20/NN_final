I proceeded to go to my bathroom were I began to make the gravity bong (or 'waterfall' as they are called over here) that would no doubt insure numerous good times. I stuck the cone piece in the lid ensuring it was sealed and set about burning a small hole in the bottom of a 1.25 litre pepsi bottle. You may or not know the workings of a gravity bong, but I'll explain anyway. A waterfall works on the principle of water draining and sucking air through the cone piece screwed onto the bottle. As you light the cone piece (filled with weed duh), the water draining from the hole in the bottle will suck the smoke down from the burning weed into the bottle were your left with a bottle filled with condensed smoke, remove lid and suck the smoke in making sure the hole in the bottom is open.
