Then I got more and more tunnel vision, and more and more disorientated about where I was, and what to do. People from my old school (that had been at the reunion too) came over and talked to me. But I didn't understand a word of what they were saying. Not that I couldn't clearly hear them, it just didn't make sense. When I tried to speak, jibberish came out of my mouth too. I was so confused, what had I just said?!
