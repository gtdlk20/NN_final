I portioned the brew into the cups and we sipped slowly as we conversed.  It tasted slightly bitter but actually it was rather good.  At first, we thought the experiment was a failure.  But, as we continued to socialize there came a point within 30-60 minutes where we realized that we were already in an altered state.  It sort of crept up on us unawares. Most pleasant.
