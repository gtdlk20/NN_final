2:00 AM- I arrive at home.  I can no longer feel my body much at all and I am starting to be bombarded with thoughts, much like a mushroom trip.  I begin making stories up about everything I look at in my bedroom.  Pointless stories of lunacy coming from nowhere and everywhere.  Really random stuff.  I attempt to play Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, but soon realize I am too incapacitated even for that.
