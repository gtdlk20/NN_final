+2:25 - I finally manage to conjure enough willpower to stand up. I maintained enough rationality to remember a few things, which I write down in a manic flurry of activity that, in retrospect, makes little sense. I slug down a cup of lukewarm ganja tea that I forgot I was making and pop in 10mg of melatonin, hoping that I can get some sleep soon.
