During the music of keller and umphrey's, I found myself dancing so blissfully.  My fore arms resting on the gate. My head waving back and forth in the air.  I couldnt stop my self.  For a while I had closed my eyes. And everything was just going on and I was just there and it was magical music flowing through my head.  I couldnt make myself stop dancing.  I noticed that even wen the songs were done I was still swaying.  It looked kind of wierd (I noticed after a wehile)
