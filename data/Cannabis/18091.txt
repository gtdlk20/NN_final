Well anyway, he busts out this shitty ass wooden bowl and we throw all that stuff in there and smoke it. We then stand up and about 5-10 minutes later we're really feeling it, my friend sayss, 'dude, just pretend we're sitting in some big ass reclining chairs watching TV' so I did it. . .it was soooo comfy and real feeling. My other friends(who were sober) said we sat in the most uncomfertable looking positions for about 20 minutes.
