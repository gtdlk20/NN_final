Anyway, I took a small piece of hash (maybe the size of a pea but probably a little larger) and swallowed it just as a bus was leaving the hotel at 7:30 AM for the drive to the slopes. I think I ate breakfast AFTER swallowing the hash 'time bomb' and thought 'What a way to start the day' as I waited for any results. This seems like a very wasteful way to indulge on hash (which I have not even heard about in years, being pretty far removed form the drug scene now) but hey, I was a college student and had money and time to do such things.
