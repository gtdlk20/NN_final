One weekend, there was some confusion as to whose turn it was to provide the grass, and all of us brought our own baggies to my dorm. Chips and Burger chipped in and brought two dimes (about one gram each) of a dry cannabis that smelled strongly of oregano. Ramen had a dub (about two grams) of a scraggly but pungent cannabis we had bought from a city dealer a few weeks earlier. I had an eighth-ounce (about 3 grams) of a moist, seedy, faintly sweet-smelling cannabis Ramen and I had just picked up from a friend of the dealer. The end result was that we had a veritable buffet of cannabis to sample, which we jokingly referred to as a pot-luck. We decided to try each variety separately to experience the entire gamut.
