I was feeling overwhelmed by all the action and so I went back to our caravan alone to get some more weed to mellow me out a bit.  I did this ok but upon returning to the party I decided not to go back in but to head opposite to the village green instead, and watch the action from a safe viewpoint all by myself.  I sat under a tree in total darkness and began to roll and smoke a few joints.  After two joints I remember babbling incoherently like a fool and I must have collapsed or something.
