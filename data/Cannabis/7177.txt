Hiding somewhere in that constant flow of young men, a fellow traveller known as Influenza A entered the center. People started falling ill in droves, and one evening I too noticed the warning signs of rapidly rising fever. The next morning I got a sick leave, but decided to stay for one day and get a good night's sleep before starting the long trek home. Since I had woken in 6:15AM, was dizzy with fever and had muscle aches, this was a good decision, or at least the best I made that day.
