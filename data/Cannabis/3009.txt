Eventually I started to feel like I was coming back to normal, but then it would keep coming back in HUGE waves that just completely incapacitated me, even worse than before.  By now, all the fidgeting, etc, was gone.  Every time I'd start to feel better, a huge wave would just hit me like a load of bricks.  Every time it happened, I'd feel and hear my heart start to slow way down.  This was really freaking me out, because although it was probably just a hallucination of some sort, it seemed VERY real to me.  After it happened the first time, I got up and staggered into the next room thinking I should get my mom to take me to the hospital, but I came right back.  As I walked, I could hardly feel my feet touching the floor.  I could just hear my footsteps.  My heartbeat got all fucked up again briefly when I walked, and I felt like I was blacking out. I could hear music from the TV in the background, and I kept thinking, 'Maybe my perception of time is messed up so it seems like my heart's beating slower than it really is', but when I'd listen to the music it was at normal speed.  I thought I would die unless I got to a hospital.  But every time, it started to slow down, it would go back to normal so I figured i'd be ok.
