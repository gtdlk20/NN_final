My trip was really intense(in terms of hash), at first I felt a pressure above my head that was causing me anxiety and only stopped whenever I didn't focus on it or when I pressed my hand against the top of my head(it really impressed me how I couldn't control the anxiety). Everything was funny, I remember brushing my teeth and listening how the water drops coming out from the tap had rythym and how I was dancing to fucking water drops. My face was really warm as well as my body, I went to sleep and my head started working really fast, thoughts were so fast I couldn't even concentrate on something, they were like bullets passing through my head. Whenever I closed my eyes I could see patterns in the dark, they were mild but still noticeable. Another interesting effect is how I felt every single vein and the blood running through them, like I could visualize it perfectly in my head, this was really unpleasant. The effects I didn't like were the muscle spasms everywhere whenever I relaxed(the spasms would happen whenever I thought of a part of my body, if I started thinking of my leg, spasms would move there) and the anxiety along with the fast heartbeat.
