We got to my friends house (this was probably about 45 min after we smoked) and went straight downstairs because his mom was home and we didn't wanna walk around the house doing what we wanted all stoned.  He put in bad boys II and lit up some insence.    When I was just sitting there watching it I experienced two more mind boggling effects.  The room was dark and the TV was the only thing on.  I got 'tunnel vision', or so it seemed, but different.  My whole outside vision around the TV turned a deeper black.  You know when you stare at something bright then look away you see bright spots where the light source was in your vision?  Well, where the deeper shade of black was around my vision of the TV those same spots showed up, but there were about 20 of them.  They danced around and turned in circles.  This kind of freaked me out so I blinked and everything turned back to normal.
