So I looked around and they are all waiting for me to do something.  'Oh, ya, ummm, lets go' I said, and slowly prepared myself for a drive.  I turn out of the construction site and am instantly lost, aware that my hand is fidgeting at a ridiculously rapid pace, I don't care, because it keeps my mind off the racing heart and the meaningless fear and paranoia.  I make it out of the streets, and go towards a parking lot for a supermarket.  Blurriness, everything molding into a ball which is turning at the center of my vision.  'Huh?  What the hell?'  That was all I could think.  HONK!!!  I was inches away from slamming into a car.  I tried to stay calm, and went into a parking space, the farthest one from the store.  'I could use a walk' I thought.  'Hey can you get me a gatorade'  my friend says to me. 'Sure', I said, 'I'll be back'.
