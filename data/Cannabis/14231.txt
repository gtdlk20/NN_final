now over here in Australia, $10 doesn't get you a great deal of weed, especially when the person who buys it smokes most of it before he gets back to the party! he only had one big nug left, but he was pretty gone so he just put it in a piece and said we could all have some. we went outside with our really dodgy grav bong (our good bong got taxed), in the dark, and proceded to have about a hit each. i always considered myself pretty tolerant to weed, but this time i took in WAY too much and i was coughing my guts up for about 10 minutes (it seemed like a long time, the effects set in after about 30 seconds), and this was really good stuff, so i got completely ripped off this one hit! i went inside where everyone else was, sat down holding my head, and basically tried to keep myself alive (or so it seemed), because i could hardly breathe. i must have looked like shit because everyone was coming up to me asking if i was ok. of course i wasn't ok for a while, but that passed, and after about 30 mins and a lot of liquids, i was feeling so completely wasted i almost fell over on several occasions. this is more wasted than i've ever felt, and i've had over 16 bongs during one session!
