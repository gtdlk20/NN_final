At this point I reached complete overload for the first time in the evening.  Thank god my mind was off the subject of giant spiders but it was spinning out of control in every direction.  By some chance, my eyes flicked sideways to the left.  It was like I had hit the reset button.  I snapped back into a fairly normal reality.  It was quite a jolt, something like slamming into a wall at a thousand miles per hour, but it was certainly better than the alternative.  I was still acutely aware that I was under the influence of a mind altering drug, but the frame rate had gone back to normal and the light streaming in through the open doorway that lead into the hall was very comforting.  The light is good.  Stay focused on the light.  My internal monologue piped up again.  Ive got to tell Jim  in case I start to lose it at least hell know what the fuck is going on.  I turn around.  Blur.  Whoa.  Definitely still under the influence.  The room settles back down.  I make my way towards my roommate  hes apparently still oblivious to my condition.  I guess I havent done anything too strange.  I put my hand on his shoulder.  He looks up and takes his headphones off.
