There were some dogs in the garden running around in an enclosed fenced area, and I was getting bored waiting for my friend still in the bathroom, so I decided to feed the dogs.  This involved me carrying armloads of canned dog food from the fridge inside out into the garden to hurl into the dog area.  And this is where it all started to get a bit surreal.
