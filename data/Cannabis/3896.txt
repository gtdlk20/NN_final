And then I started to imagine that I had lost whatever race it was that my tongue was having and that my tongue was being eaten.  I don't know what by, I got the impression of insects but at the time, it didn't matter and I was just watching my tongue being eaten. When I told john about it a while later, it seemed sickening, as it does now, but at the time, I was completely indifferent to it.  I was struck by a sense of vast importance. EVERYTHING took on a new level, I felt like I had so many things to say to people, like if I didn't something, terrible would happen. I decided to try and text someone because I needed to let them know how much I felt everything right there and then like I'd never felt anything before. I really wanted someone there and to totally immerse myself into them, actually lose the boundaries between us and be one. I was trying to use my phone and my head was heavy and I was transfixed by the trail of the green light in my phone. Then when I actually got to writing something I just couldn't find the words. I thought about trying to find a pen and paper but by then it had become unpleasant to move too much.   So I lay there, trying to remember if it used to feel like this when I got really mashed and I don't think it did.
