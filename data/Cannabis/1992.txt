After school at my school, literally every student and their dog likes to form a gigantic crowed at a spot in the center of the school called Crossroads. It's actually pretty convenient for socializing and planning shit out normally, but not when you feel like you're riding a space-horse with Jesus, like me. I knew my eyes were blood red, I probably smelled, and I could not properly formulate a sentence. I tried to look down and avoid eye contact as much as possible, but a lot of people saw me, and each person would say Haha you fuckin' idiot! You're so high! or You're eyes are so red. Safe to say, I was TWEAKING THE FUCK OUT. I kept going to my friends saying Yo, man, we gotta get out of here! We're not supposed to be here, like that made any sense, and they just laughed at me.
