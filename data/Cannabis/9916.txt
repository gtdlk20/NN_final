The human personality has three aspects - the Distracted Doer, the Tempter/Counselor and the Witness. The Distractor Doer is all the time distracted by the illusory nature of Reality or Maya. The Temptor/Counsellor guides/misguides you out of ignorance/wisdom. There is no separate Evil and Good or the Devil and Angel, two entities of voices that whisper in your ears. There is just one, like two sides of the coin who whisper to you. It is up to to the waking-discerning   Doer whether it makes this inner voice a tempter or a guide. The Witness, is just that,  a Witness. It is the unknowable super conscious part of us that only a lucky few can ever realize fully.
