Because we are spirit brother and spirit sister til we die, whatever I say I decide is fine, and Ani is totally cool with going home. I pinch some pot off of her, and when I get home I smoke a bit before even taking off my coat. Then I undress. I empty out my pocket full of molecules, my simple but dazzling array of opportunities for neurochemical enhancement. Outside, the sun is rising and orange-yellow rays are searing through my window-blinds. I feel pretty fantastic.
