Things got even more intense after this.  I was stuck to my floor and couldn't open my eyes.  I felt totally paralyzed.  Suddenly, it hit me.  I hadn't been doing what I normally do when I trip out: I lost my discipline.  I usually try to focus on my mind and ride it out, this time I was too freaked out to.
