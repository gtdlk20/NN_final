After finishing both joints we decided to leave the area and continue to a new one. Malcom said we had to find the silver left from captain gold. At this point all 5 of us were completely stoned. This was REALLY good weed. We wanted to hit up my bong but we had no water. I then saw a little puddle of water left from the rain of the previous night. All of us were too stoned to care. So I filled it up and we hit a couple bowls.
