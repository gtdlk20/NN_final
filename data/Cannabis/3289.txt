All of a sudden, this tidal wave of electricity began to run through my body, like a wheel of fortune, spinning slowly until the wave was constant, moving from head to toe. I jumped up. What the fuck was that?! I asked myself. I realized that I hadnt even let the whole wave cover me. After Id worked up a little courage, I closed my eyes again. I felt the tiny waves coming in with the tide, and washing away from me ever so slightly. It felt like marrow was being stolen from my bones- like I was the ocean, attempting to hang onto the cliffs just a little bit longer. Then, I felt the beginning of the climax of larger waves. It really was like someone was spinning a wheel and I was inside of it. They kept increasing, and I wasnt sure if Id be able to handle it.
