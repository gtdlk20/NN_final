I'm looking forward to trying marijuana again, this time not at a party but with some friends who might be able to put the experience in perspective.  Though I don't like parts of the way being stoned feels (there's not much clarity, which I don't have enough of in the best of times) I love other parts of it (the free-flowing thoughts) and I'm going to try to get those things to permeate my normal thinking processes.  I feel less like a zombie now than two days ago, and more like myself, the way I was 5 years ago, and the best thing that could happen is for that to continue.  Also, I now appreciate Radiohead's recent albums. :)
