I lay there for about thirty minutes, and the feelings of rocking back and forth and vibrations subside slightly, and I am able to go on my computer an operate it as if normal. I talked to one of my friends for a little while, and it was increasingly difficult to pay attention to the conversation, as it was to even recognize when she had said something, as she soon notified me of by asking why I wasn't talking much. At that point, I decided to sign off and simply told her I was tired; I did not want this friend to know that I was under the influence of marijuana.
