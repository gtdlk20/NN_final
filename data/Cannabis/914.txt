All in all the experience was fun and something completely different from the baseline. The most intense part lasted around 15 minutes, the core of the effects lasted for around an hour and 20 minutes, and the effects left completely after two and a half hours. I didnÂ’t have any noticeable negative side effects, like severe paranoia or panic attacks, and when I had a something close to them, it would go away in a few seconds. I could do it again in the future, and maybe in the further future I would be comfortable enough to do it with other like minded people. However, I found the effects too intense for daily use, and I cannot understand how some people use cannabis daily. Compared to alcohol, cannabis is much more benign, and I find it ridiculous that the so called rational western countries have spent so ridiculously high amounts of resources to persecute it, and have destroyed countless lives in jail time.
