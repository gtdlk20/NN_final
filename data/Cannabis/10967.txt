Music - Sound VERY FUCKING DIFFERENT. Hard Bass kicks were very sounding soft, mellow and comforting to my ears. I wanted to hear some sub-bass though cos I felt that would give me so much satifaction - but all I had was headphones. Music becomes VERY 3D! It is much more free and real. BTW this is the first time I've listened to full on dance music with thumpin bass while stoned. Usually I'm listening to more chill music - dnb or mellow shit.
