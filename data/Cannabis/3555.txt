We had now left the main road on to a large area of grass land called 'Hob Moor' which leads us back to our village.  It had rained for a minute and a rainbow appeared in the sky.  I looked at it in awe and smiled like a little child would.  My friend B noticed another rainbow next to it and we all did too.  All of a sudden about 30 of them could be seen on the skyline, all crossing each other at their endings, all the same distance apart in their colourful glory.  I had never experienced this on cannabis before and I felt awe-struck.
