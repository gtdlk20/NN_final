The onset was almost immediate as I hand back the vape and suddenly I feel the beggining of a high. My legs begin to tingle and I begin to feel like my body and mind was falling downwards. My friends notice immediately and begin to laugh at my discomfort but I held together for the few minutes before class. As we walked up towards class I realised I couldnÂ’t go in my eyes were bright red I could barely walk or talk comprehensively so I excuse myself to go to a toilet cubicle and sit down.
