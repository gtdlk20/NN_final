As I got up and walked around I felt very weird.  It wasn't like being high, but more like being very shitfaced.  With every step I took this sensation got stronger and stronger, until things were spinning pretty well.  I couldn't drink the water, for the simple fact that by the time I filled a glass I wasn't able to.  I sat there just being really high for a while, then my friends came in and started eating.
