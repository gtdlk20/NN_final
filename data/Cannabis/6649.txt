Standing up and walking wasn't too different from any other time, there was that dizziness, the feeling of overestimating my movement for every step, etc. It was when I sat down on the couch to just watch the jam that everything began to turn. And fast. A sensation of becoming detached from my body began to creep up on me as the others jammed out to some songs I couldn't even identify at this point. I just smiled and enjoyed it, after all, the feeling was mild and rather nice.
