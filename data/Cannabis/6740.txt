After smoking both joints, and the roaches we joined them at the fire. I sat by the fire, and I remember being totally boggled by the concept of different temperatures; sitting by the fire, 1 side of my body was hotter then the other, and this amazed me. I started looking at my hands, because they were the most affected by the temperature change, and I became amazed that not only could I control them, but that I had not 1, but 2!
