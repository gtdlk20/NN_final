I decided to stand up next, and what I perceived amazed me.  Actually, it wasnt exactly *what* I perceived.  Same room, same people.  It was *how* I perceived.  It felt like I had unlocked this godly third eye or other sense or something, that made everything glow and space and time seem so much deeper and thicker and richer.  Silly as it sounds, it felt like I had been living in the second dimension my whole life, then suddenly stepped out into the real third dimension.  I had gone through my entire youth thinking I was living in a 3D world when I had truly just been a cartoon!  The song Dear Prudence by The Beatles was playing and it melded with my thoughts to create a divine moment of realizations and beauty.  My surroundings looked ever so deep.
