By that time I really felt like going to the hospital especially as we get so thirsty and the mouth were that try I can't tell...I was on heat and I didn't know wether I will get an heart attack or maybe I couldn't breathe anymore - but we found a book store which were opened by night so we entered it. We have been there like some hours before but there it was just cool. I just told the woman we only want to rest and get some drink and we won't make any trouble but then I saw her using the telephone - I got the paranoia that she would call the police... 40 minutes passed by and some people were supervising us - I realized it although they must have thought I couldn't take notice of them. My friend was sitting on a chair trying to read a book what of course was impossible - we didn't talk a lot anymore... I was walking and walking and walking arround the furnitures and talking to myself that I really don't have fun anymore and I want it to be over by now...
