I am a 22 year old male weighing about 215 pounds. This experience happened after about 6 months of casual marijuana use. I have found that I seem to be a lightweight as regards marijuana (and alcohol as well). On the night in question, in order to escape from some stressful thoughts I was having, I decided to get a little messed up.
