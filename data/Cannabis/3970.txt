A year or so ago, I invited several friends over for a couple drinks. Yet, at my house, a quiet get-together quickly turns into a raging drug binge. Also, two or three friends soon becomes every teenage inhabitant in the town. Where I live, the kids get quite cliquey...but on this very night...geeks, preps, even some random people I've never seen before have all joined together at my home, chatting and bonding peacefully, all in the name of intoxication. A beatiful thing, I dare say. Yet, another pro of this situation is the more people that show up, the more drugs that seem to find themselves being spread out and broken up on various surfaces in my house. After about 45 people have invited themselves in, the place begins to look like some sort of black market headquarters. An array of substances in baggies, containers, freesprawling over tables and countertops were being consumed and smoked in rediculous amounts. Beautiful stuff...yet, enough of my ranting.
