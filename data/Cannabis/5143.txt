They helped me up once more and this time I made it to the car. I laid in the backseat, with my head on Jazzy's lap and let my coworker friend drive me home. We got to my house and I was feeling a bit better by this time, enough to get out of the car on my own. Thankfully no one was at my house, and I thought it would be best if I just took a nap in my backseat. So I did. Instead of getting out, I just passed out in the backseat. For maybe, 2 hours I just slept and hoped the feeling would fade.
