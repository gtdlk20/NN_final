Anyway, when Tom quite rightly asked if I was OK, it acted like a catalyst.  It made it not in my head. when Tom quite rightly asked if I was OK, it acted like a catalyst.  It made it not in my head.  Suddenly, my fear that something wasnt right was amplified because others noticed it.  My heart was beating too hard and too fast for me to keep it to myself now, so I decided I absolutely had to say something.  After deliberating how to do this for what I believe to be quite some time, I turned to Taya and said My hearts beating really fast, or words to that effect.  Im not sure how I said this.  I tried to sound calm, but the concern I was feeling must have come through in my voice and Taya started to panic too.  It suddenly occurred to me that I had never witnessed someone panic openly about my health.  I looked at Taya and saw the same questions in her eyes as the ones I was thinking.  Whats wrong with him?, What if we have to go to hospital?, What if its serious?  I said I was having a panic attack, and Tom suggested we go and make a cup of tea.  He was trying to sound calm so that I wouldnt panic any more, and that sort of helped, but I could see that it wasnt real calm, and my mind was telling me that if hes suggesting something new to do, then it must be because something bad is happening to me.
