We were planning on walking to the park 5 blocks away, in an unfamiliar neighborhood with many dead ends and curved streets. I decided to run ahead to find the way, I made it half a block and it seemed like I had been walking forever, my thoughts were changing in a strange way, almost like they were cut up at random points, but if I thought about them in whole, they were fluid. My friends now started to mimic my effects (They are first timers and known to overblow things, so I was suspicious, but I also didn't really care.) Distances seemed incorrect, I could wait for my friends for what seemed like a minute only to look back and see they had progressed only a few feet. Along with this came a distortion of my perception of time, which I found to be somewhat split into two tracks, one short term, which seemed very fast, short lived and choppy. The other being long term, which seemed dragged out, slow and patient, not at all choppy. I found it very hard to concentrate. My slight fear had almost completely gone away.
