I felt a very slight rush but began to doubt that anything was going to happen. A few minutes later, my attention was drawn to a colorful tortilla chip bag on the table, which somehow seemed more vibrantly colored than it had been before. Suddenly, the most strong and pleasant desire to sleep came over me. I had never felt so relaxed. I fell asleep and the dreams I had were vibrant and musical: I dreamt that an orchestra was playing very loudly on stage. Furthermore, all of the subconscious thoughts that would not have normally been released through dreams occurred in the particular dreams I had; I dreamt that the man I love was touching another woman. When he saw me he looked up in shock and fear but his expression revealed that it was no mistake and that he had been caught in an act that truly spoke of his desire. I dreamt of his mother and the unbearable nature of communicating with her--not being understood and confused by her erratic behavior. In short, my deepest fears and sentiments about people in my life were revealed to me.
