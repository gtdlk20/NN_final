I learned a lot from that trip and I hope everyone experiments with what I am about to say: RIDE THE WAVE WHEN YOU ARE HIGH.  If you are scared it is because you are resisting.  Forget about worries.  A huge oak will fall from winds, but a reed won't because it bends with it.  Do this, and every high will be an interesting and pleasurable trip!
