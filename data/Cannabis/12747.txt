At this point all I could tell my friends was that 'I'm sooo high' and I probably repeated this line 6-7 times.  As soon as we finished the bowl (I don't remember it being finished) we started watching a movie, and at this point is when I felt a sense of numbness around my upperbody.  I could control my arms, but I could not feel them moving, it is something I have never experienced before.  I had no idea how I was doing it, but it was occuring in front of me.  It felt as if I was waving my arms through the mystical ether that earlier scientists had described, and no matter how hard I tried to take away this feeling I could not.
