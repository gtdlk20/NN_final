My piss attempts involved firstly trying to push it out, then when that didn't work, relaxing it, then squeezing the pc muscles hard as though stopping the flow of urine, then relaxing again, hoping it would start. At that point my penis became very rigid, started to spasm, and about a minute later I had my first orgasm, which was pretty mind-blowing. I wasn't even stimulating my penis, just holding it so I wouldn't pee all over myself. I can still see each squirt flying up to around head height, before sailing out and down and hitting the tree trunk. It seemed to go on for a long time. At first, and for a while, I thought it was a hallucination, until it was finished, and I was able to see the stuff on the ground, and on the tree trunk, and verify that it actually existed, and definitely wasn't urine.
