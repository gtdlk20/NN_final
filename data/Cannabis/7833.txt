It's a well known fact that during cannabis experience one feels connected to music, but that's not all, on my opinion! But first from the beginning. When I got a big amount of weed (medium quality i guess) - I was hoping to use it throughout the period from western christmas till New-Years-Eve-by-old-Eastern-Orthodox-calendar (24 Dec 2001 - 14 Jan 2002) - it's just the period of time everybody celebrates straight through, in my country (east of polland, south of belorus, SW of russia ;). I intended, and I did, to use it by myself - as I feel that weed is something personal.
