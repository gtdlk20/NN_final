We went indoors and laid on his bed, but I was confused as to how we had gotten all the way from the balcony to his bed. I had lost all perception of transport, I no longer knew how I was getting from one place to the other, I just happened to be here at the moment and before I had been somewhere else with no explanation of how I got there. The whole time I was concerned with falling asleep, the feeling persisted; I kept thinking that I was waking up. I began to eat cashews, but I really had no desire to eat them, I just ate cashews because I was offered some. The sensation in my mouth that the cashews produced was out of the ordinary, I could pay close attention to the way it felt in my mouth only to be distracted by something else. We were on the bed for a while and I just have scarce memories of the thoughts I had. I was completely comatose, I felt as if I had no feelings, all the happiness had disappeared and all I wanted to do was sleep.
