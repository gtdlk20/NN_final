It was at this time that I started feeling different than I ever had before.  As my friend passed me the pipe I noticed that I had lost all sense of feeling in my mouth, and that my sense of death was very off.  As my friend passed my the pipe in my eyes I could not tell if I had ever grabbed the pipe from his hand, and most of all I could not feel the pipe in my mouth!!  All I could do was try to concentrate to make sure I was breathing in some but I could not feel a thing.  It felt as if the pipe was coming towards me and then backing away, and it repeated this pattern 7 - 8 times. All the while the pipe was really in my mouth and I had been breathing in for what was probably 30+ seconds.  I had trouble passing the pipe as well seeing as my sense of depth was shot.
