The first time I smoked Marijuanna was both an amazing and traumatic experience.  It started out great. I was laughing my head off and marvelling at the amazing effect pot has on increasing the appreciation of music.  It was like this for about 30 mins.  Then suddenly a sharp explosive pain erupted about an inch under my scalp around the right-back area of my head. Panic set in.  In this paranoid state I was positive that the weed had expanded my blood vessels so much that my brain was expanding in the right-back area of my head and soon my I would have a stroke or my head would explode.  It was like something was inside my head with a pick-axe trying to tunnel it's way out.  The extreme pain lasted for about 10 mins, but what happened after this is what really freaked me out.
