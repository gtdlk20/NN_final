At this point we once again set out to his house. By this point I was seeing things all over the place. I'm not really sure how we got there, but along the way all of the leaves looked like floating butterflies and I thought I saw little animals (rats?) running in the street. The pavement was forming crazy glowing patterns and the rain sounded like techno. In my peripheral vision there were glowing black and white dots that danced around. When we were nearing his house (I think?) I started seeing this person wearing a pink shirt and long white socks following us. I told my friend, but he said no one was there, we kept walking and I kept looking, but the person kept walking behind us. At this point I think my friend was getting kinda freaked out by what I was telling him. We started walking faster until we reached his house, thankfully no one was home. I sat down on his couch as I came down.
