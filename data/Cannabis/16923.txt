So that was probably the worst experience I've had with marijuana to date. It hasn't halted my use or fondness any; in fact in my new, happy and healthy state of mind it's probably increased it. I found it fascinating. My overanalysis of what I experienced really enlightened my fears (of injury and risk taking in general) and eventually helped me get better.
