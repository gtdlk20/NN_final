I tested the batch last month with 2.7 g of the chocolate which resulted in a light but distinct high. The flavour was delicious Â– rich and warm with coffee and hash notes. I was quite surprised and pleased to get any effect from such a small quantity (less than a twentieth of a gram of the hash). This weekend I tried slightly more: 3.6 g of the chocolate.
