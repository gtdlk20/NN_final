The depression lasted some six to eight weeks, and I was desperate to find an outlet. I had smoked weed with some friends once the year before in celebration of my late friends birthday, and it was such a great time that my turned there. So I acquired some from a friend and smoked probably four or five hits right after the other. My first experience here was with Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon, and in particular, the guitar solo midway through Time. The experience with the album was ridiculously powerful, and the solo to Time was an absolutely crushing climax that I can most accurately describe as making love to the music. Each note tore through me like the waves of an ocean, and there was only one thought in my mind the entire time: My God, this solo is about love! The climax lasted a good two hours, and when I had finished the album, I returned to Time, and another Pink Floyd song, Pigs (Three Different Ones) replaying the soloes alternately over and over, rolling on my bed and laughing, crying, quivering with euphoria.
