At about 7:00, she hadn't showed up, so we called her on her cell phone. It turns out she had made a mistake on where to meet us, and had been there longer than we had, somewhere else, waiting for us. She drove down with her two cousins in the car, and one of them wanted to drive back home because he wasn't up for the walk. He took the car, and S said that the spot she'd been waiting at was much more scenic and away from developmental areas, so we drove out there. I'm not sure where the time went here, as the rest of the night is kind of a haze as far as time goes, but I think we arrived at the spot at about 8:30, though it only took us about 10 minutes to get there.
