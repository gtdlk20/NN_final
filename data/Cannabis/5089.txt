The day after I reflected on it and realized I did not like what I experienced. However, weeks later I realized I did like it. I want to experience that again. It was so different, albeit disorienting. I will defiantly smoke again. People keep telling me though that Im hypersensitive though because all I had was two hits and it did this much. So Im hesitant to use a lot. I can only imagine what harder drugs would do to me.
