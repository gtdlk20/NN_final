We arrived at an art collector's house to hang out before we went swimming. My friend J pulled out his pipe, and a little box with a bud in it, and put it in front of me and walked away. I took it upon myself to prepare it and share it with everyone else. My first inhale was smooth, maybe because I had been around the smoke before, and my lungs were more tolerant. I held it in long, hoping to get some amazing high that is spoken of in movies and cloudy rooms. I took two more hits afterward, just to ensure some reaction from the stuff.
