The next thing I remember is me going upstairs waiting for him then greeting him asking him if he got anything for me, then realizing his brother was pissed because I was waking his parents up, so I tried to play it off by asking if we were going to go back down stairs, instead of asking him for a donut like an idiot. After that I realized I was yelling instead of talking but I only because I couldn't even hear myself think. So I get to his room and lay down and watch T.V. It was Jack Blacks mtv diary. Throughout the whole thing his face kept warping around and he was looking and acting like a fucking cartoon. The whole thing freaked me out because since it was T.V. I couldn't tell if it was really doing that or not. After turning away I was looking at a picture of a car on the wall where I saw the coolest and most creative visual yet. It just warped into somthing from Van Go (I think) or Picaso, the car just turned into a person with their mouth open and a house in their stomach. I was really tripping.
