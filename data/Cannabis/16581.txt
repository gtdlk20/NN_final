Then it turned bad. I started to get this thought in my head that I was going to 'lose my mind'. This is the first mental thought for a panic attack. In this particular instance, I was afraid I was going to go crazy and kill my brother and his friend. At first I just tried to ignore this feeling to opt instead to feel the amazing warmth and joy experienced earlier. This didn't work, and I started getting this sinking paralyzing feeling of impending doom. All the somatic effects of a panic attack started - heart racing, blood pressure increasing, my muscles got extra blood and oxygen, and this caused me to lock my arms together very tightly and I could not move them no matter how hard I tried. My jaw locked and I started shaking. My mind existed only in a state of pure terror and dread.
