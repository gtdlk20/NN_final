Whatever the case, on the final night, prior to sundown, Scott and I snuck off behind the cabin and smoked what was left of last nights bowl, which was about half, and to quote Scott, was the bomb ass shit.  I took two or three drags and I was feeling pretty good.  Scott then said itd be cool if we rolled another joint and sat on the pier since the sun was going down, which we did about 20 minutes later.  Immediately after doing this, Sara and Chris found out and asked if they could get in on the action as well, so it was back up to the cabin to pack another bowl, and then back to the pier to smoke it.  I was pretty out of it at this point.  I remember feeling lost in the woods as we trekked back to the pier, even though its only a 5 minute walk.  I joined in on this new bowl, knowing that I really didnt need anymore, but this that weekend was about getting away from it all, and boy did I do just that.  Total, I smoked about a one gaping bowl to myself that night.
