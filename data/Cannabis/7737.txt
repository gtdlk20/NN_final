This incredible occurence of mine occurred around the middle of the first year I began smoking weed.  I was still relatively new to the experience and had only gotten legitimately blazed one time before.  I decided to drop by my friend's house to get just a little high.  Of course, I brought along a little of my own weed, it's just courtesy, but I also knew he had his own little stash, I just didn't know he was growing in his closet!  Well, we rolled most of mine into blunts, and spent 1/2 an hour on them.  As I mentioned, I was relativly new to the experience and everything was new to me.  He put on some Bob Marley and dimmed the lights, I leaned my head back on the couch and closed my eyes, It felt almost as if I was on a roller coaster, but it was moving along with the speed of the song.  My feet felt as if they didn't touch the ground and I sat there for what seemed like hours.
