I remember Jim handing me his soda bottle, asking me to hold it because he didnt trust himself with it.  I was barely able to hold onto my own, but took it out of reflex, painfully aware of the icy cold.  I didnt know Farmer very well at the time and at one time a distrust of him arose in me.  It stemmed from the vulnerability factor, and not trusting myself this time, I placed my pocket knife in the car, only to retrieve it moments later in case I needed it.  None of our fears were justified.
