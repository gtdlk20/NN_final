I've never had a bad experience smoking weed in all the times I've done it. And it's pretty often - I usually smoke 2 or 3 times a week on average. Sometimes it's with friends and sometimes it's not. I buy from an ex of mine and he always gets me good stuff. For the most part, getting high is a nice experience.
