As I neared the end of the joint, we started saying little things that just had us laughing for ages. I started thinking of everything good and bad in life, and then started to feel quite sick, like I'd drunk too much alcohol. This passed shortly, and then my right leg started shaking uncontrollably. O laughed, because I was shaking the bench, and then all of a sudden my left leg started too. We laughed at this for about 5 minutes and then decided to head off to a set of tennis courts in the hope that some other people would be there. We walked in, and lay down on the tennis courts. I stared straight up at the sky and started thinking of when I was a little kid; I used to stare up at the sky during the day, the white clouds against the blue skies. Now I had grey clouds against a black sky. I kept thinking of all the ways I'd changed, how everything had gone wrong, how all my aspirations burned and all my love lost. I'd grown up and I'd hated it.
