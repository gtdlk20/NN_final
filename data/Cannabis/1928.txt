I went straight to heaven. I experienced Nirvana. Rolling on my living room carpet laughing uncontrollably, I realized the Truth. I cant really say much more about it, except that it is screamingly funny. I realized the Truth. I cant really say much more about it, except that it is screamingly funny. I have experienced this kind of laughter once before while on shrooms, and it feels really wonderful. The sensation is similar to dreams I have of breathing underwater, in that I stop breathing. Rather there is just a continuous stream of screaming laughter from deep inside my gut that comes gushing out like an unstoppable fountain, and I can keep it going for hours if I like. Its wonderful, but other people might be a bit concerned.
