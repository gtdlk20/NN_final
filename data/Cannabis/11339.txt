Sometimes, I get lazy about dancing. Which is a shame - dancing is sweet release for me, and I dance hard on drugs and have ecstatic spiritual experiences of oneness with my body. Tonight? I'm just kind of tired. I dance, or I watch. I'm horny. Many different bodies are bumping up against me here and there. We step outside and we smoke another joint. I get insanely high this time, and when we get back it is actually a bit too much. It is then that we find out the party does not end at six AM.
