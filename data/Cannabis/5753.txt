We went outside the buildin to this balcony-like place, where not many people come by, and we sat down on some metal seats. We then proceeded to light up the spliff, in which P took the first few puffs. We decided everyone would take turns, 3 puffs each person's turn. When it came for me to smoke it, I began to inhale, but T told me I was smokin it wrong. You see, I have smoked a few times before, gotten high, but it was mostly more of a relaxin and passive high, where nothin seemed to bother me. T had told me to inhale deeply into my lungs, breath in some fresh air with it to push it down, and then hold it for a sec, and exhale soon after. I did.
