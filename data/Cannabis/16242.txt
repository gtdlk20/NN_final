Eventually, around 10:30, we went out to a nearby gas station to grab some food. It was a beautiful night, and in retrospect I wish we had walked out there for longer, enjoying the weather. After coming back to his house, we ate our food, watched some more TV and eventually went to sleep. The next morning, both of us could still feel a slight buzz. Time was moving a little slowly still, and it was taking longer to process things. This wore off pretty quickly.
