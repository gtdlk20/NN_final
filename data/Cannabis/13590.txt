That night I went out and got pretty drunk.  I got home late and half drunk, grabbed a kitchen bowl, poured the gravel into it, grabbed a spoon, and went to pass out with this at my bedside.  Morning came and I woke up around 8:00am having to take a raging piss, really foggy from the night before...but time for the experiment to commence.  I 'eased nature' and kinda half awake, grabbed the spoon and dug in.  Unfortunately I can't tell you exactly how much I ate, there were 9 cookies, I had already eaten 1, and I would say I ate maybe about 1/2 of what was in the bowl...my dumb ass was just stitting there in a hung over daze, munching away thinking 'well, I want to make sure I don't suffer an underdose.'  Then I fell back to sleep.
