One Friday during school my friend 'S', who has been smoking me the weed for the last few times, asked me if I wanted to smoke again. As I was still wondering about the feeling that weed could give me, I agreed to come over and smoke with him.  Between 4 people, we smoked two joints, and about 5 big bowls. I averaged it out later that I myself probably smoked 1 gram of weed.
