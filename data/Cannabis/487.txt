Fucked up? Was I fucked up? No, I was normal. I started to forget where I was, believing that I was at my friend Dans house. I could see his room, his bed, his carpet. I quickly snapped out of it though and realized where I actually was. Then my mind returned to its previous thoughts. Fucked up? I couldnt be fucked up. I didnt understand the concept of hallucinogens, or even drugs in general. How could they alter consciousness? Why would I want to alter my consciousness? What the hell was consciousness anyway? What was going on?
