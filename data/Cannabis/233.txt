I lived in California after all.  It ought to be easy to get some pot.  Not as easy as you think. I'm now fifty something years old and I live over 3,000 miles away from any of my old connections. I tried asking my doctor if he thought it would help.  He said, It's not the standard of treatment.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Besides, it will make you gain weight.   Very disappointing answer.  Fortunately the woman who sometimes cleans my house had become a pretty good friend.  She was the usual fifteen years younger than me and had kids my daughter's age.  We talked a lot about what we were like as teenagers (so much wilder than kids today).  She mentioned that her husband still smoked pot but claimed that she didn't.  I told her how I didn't now but used to and didn't think here was anything wrong with it.  I'd keep bringing up stuff I'd found about pot on the Internet and how I thought about getting one of those medical marijuana cards and she told me that her husband had gotten one once after getting busted so he could legally smoke during the mandatory rehab period.  I was reluctant to really get one though.  I'm not a big truster in the government's benevolence.
