About an hour after eating the first sandwich, it hit me HARD. I was watching Chappelle's show, And I noticed that I had an arm like a cat's. My watch became a stripe, my hair was fur, and my fingers were claws! I had never experienced anything like this after smoking, this was amazing. My high continued escalating to the point where I could not get up out of my bed, my legs had become part of the bed, like they melted together. about six hours after ingesting my first cracker, my parents came home,and I was still high. My mother came to say goodnight, and I was barely able to utter goodnight. I slipped into deep sleep and to my amazement, when I awoke, I was still fucking high. After sixteen amazing hours I started to come down. This was an experience to remember.
