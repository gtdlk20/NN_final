I studied the way the warm sunÂ’s rays which splashed on to the semi-dried grass where I knelt. It seemed to remind me of a time in my childhood that I had long forgotten when my parents would take me to the river where we used to live. And for an instant I was once again there, filled with the same uninhibited innocent bliss that only childhood (and apparently now drugs) could evoke.
