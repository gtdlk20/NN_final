My thoughts began to change all the time, I had to work hard to keep focused, I found myself switching from 'I have to get to the street sign' to something completely different and often the thoughts were void of any thought at all. My body was very tingly and I had a strong urge to lay down right there in the street, but I would wait until the park, my only motivation to move at this point.
