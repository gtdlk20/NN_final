Anyways he immediatly asked me where the 'dope' was at and I decided my only real option was to deny everything and refuse to allow him to search at any cost. I told him we didnt have any and that we were only smoking some cigars which he obviously didnt believe. He then started asking to search my car and telling me that if I had nothing to hide then it shouldnt matter. I basically respoded the same way every time and told him that it wasnt necassary and that there was no reason for a search and it would only waste his time and ours. During all this another trooper pulled in and observed my questioning but never really did anything. After realizing that he wasnt going to get me to allow a search he took all three of IDs and went back to his car while we stood next to mine. I assume he checked for warrants etc but we were all good and he talked to the other trooper before coming back and telling us that he knew we had something in the car and tried to convince me once again to allow a search which I continued to refuse, politely of course which helped the situation. We could tell he was frustrated and he eventually returned our IDs and told us that the drug dog was busy or else he would have busted out asses and told us to leave now and never come back which sounded like a damn good idea to me so we got in my car and left.
