Cannabis is one of the most enjoyable drugs, but it is not completely harmless. One night, I was smoking a lot. I had a very happy day and thought, '**** it I'm gunna smoke my heart out...' I smoked 3 grams of bong hits in a total of 30 minutes. I just kept packing bowls, turned up the Zeppelin playing, and tried to get as blazed as I've ever been.
