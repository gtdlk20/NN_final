Then after a lil while, I had decided to get up again, and we all decided to go back to T's place. We had to walk past the security, and I tried to look normal, but instead I had my eyes wide open and a serious look on my mouth, and everyone else was tryin not to laugh. We got upstairs, and put on some music, and I have no idea how, but every beat I could feel inside my body. Music was greatly intensified, and I seemed to like everythin I heard. We were playin a lot of techno, hip-hop and rap, and the bass felt sooooo gooood. Then, they put on this color show thing on T's Xbox. So for about 10 minutes, I was starin at this crazy color and patterns show on T's 50inch tv, trippin out of my mind, and bein hypnotized by somethin so vivid and beautiful. Then we decided to play some Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and I just kept laughin whenever someone died (aren't I the mature one?). But soon enough, I had decided to let myself test out my creativity, and here I shall go in some depth.
