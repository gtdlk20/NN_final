I think it might have been half an hour, but I have no idea... they just kicked in... one second I was completely normal, the next second the music was all around me and it was GREAT! It was just like being stoned, only 10x as intense.  I felt like I was watching myself and everyone around me from a screen, but I was also part of the show and had complete control over my actions. My thoughts were going so damn fast! If someone said a sentence, I had a whole argument thought out and it all made perfect sense! I just never had the opportunity to say it (or the ability) because I was so concentrated on those thoughts. Usually when we smoke up, I am always the 'sensible, controlled' individual, if we have to talk to anyone or go anywhere, I always do all the talking. I see it as an adventure and it's always fun!
