The feeling is similar to a moderate panic attack for people who dont know what severe panic attacks feel like. For a long time I thought my three hour hallway track meet was awful until a very pot savvy friend got so convinced he was going to die he threw all his pr0n away so his family wouldnt find it posthumously. Then on another occasion a girlfriend of mine ate waaaaaay too much. After being certain she was 'going into the light' for three hours she started speaking in the most annoying accent and couldnt shake it. It was like a horrible combination of German and babytalk. That was probably MY worst experience of all time because my high died instantly.
