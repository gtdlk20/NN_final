I called Jim and we got together for a long walk and talk.  He decided never to place himself in these states again.  I felt somewhat the same on the tail end, but the more time that flowed between myself and the experience, I saw that I was more and more apt to experience and experiment again.  Did we gain anything from that experience?   I think so.  We faced our deepest fears, the ones we pack around with us on a daily basis, and we came through to the other side.  Like good travel, one always goes far from home, only to wish for our own bed again.  And once home we begin to think back and long for foreign dust on our shoes once more.
