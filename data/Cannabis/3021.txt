In the bathroom everything is normal, but not, colors are normal but they aren't there is almost like a rainbow in everything, but so minute.  I pee, but not sure Im done.  I'm losing myself, who am I, what is going on, the fear.  I'm afraid Im going to lose myself and do something stupid.  I flush walk out, still feel like I have to pee go back in, pee more and come back out Im very confused now.
