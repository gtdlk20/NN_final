One night Shaunna was staying the night at my house and since it was so nice out we decided to sleep in my tent on our pool deck. At around one AM she suggested we go over to Toms and get high because she hadn't had any sine she moved down here two months ago. I agreed and we made sure my parents were asleep and jumped my fence and climbed rock stairs to Tom's house. He answered the door and knowing what we were there for led us too his back room.
