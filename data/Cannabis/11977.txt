About 30 minutes after smoking I began to feel a really strong high. It was a fun high, nothing out of the ordinary. My buddy and I always have really awesome highs and trips and I trust him more than anyone, especially when it comes to drugs. We were talking about philosophy when I suddenly felt a rush throughout my body. It was like a wave of cold starting from my feet and becoming growingly more intense as it reached my head. Everything felt weird. I started feeling a bit dizzy and my balance started to weaken. Its odd though: the conversation continued completely normal and my speech as well as my mental processing weren't affected while this body rush was happening. The last thing I remember was this feeling overwhelming my entire body.
