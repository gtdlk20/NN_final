Provided you're unaware of the premise to the show, they take two teams of three, give them a certain challenge, then give them an expert in the field. Of course, the tiwst is that everything they use to build must come from the junkyard the provide. The challenges range from boats, to hovercrafts, to wind-powered cars, to tools of destruction. Luckily for us, the episode we were watching was the finals of the season, so they had to destroy a hundred foot concrete wall.
