Another thing is the fact that I laughed.  I have never laughed so hard in my life.  My friend, laughing at me, laughed a lot too.  I fell all over the place, laughing in a million different ways, very different than my normal way.  A few times, I laughed for long periods of time, harder and harder.  I think the longest period was almost four minutes.  I could hardly breathe by that time.  The laughter is something you must savor.  It is amazing.  You have no reason to laugh, yet you do, hysterically, like a jackal.  I must emphasize that it is very different than normal laughter.  It is phenomenal.  You should have someone video tape you, because you will want to see it again.  You will laugh for the stupidest reasons, probably falling down a lot.  Therefore, I suggest you stand up, because you want to stay excited.  By falling down, you give yourself more to laugh at.
