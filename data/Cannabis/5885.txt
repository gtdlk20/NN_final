I was still staring off, everything still looked 'Cartoony', and I was not right, however it was all funny as hell now. Soon after we left, not knowing where the hell we went, we went to my other friend's work. They had food, and I was incredibly hungry. It was beyond any 'munchies' I have ever experienced, I loved it. My friend that smoked again claimed he in fact this time 'had never been this high before' as he proceeded to lay down not really talking. I was in the normal 'high' state now as I usually would be. My short term memory was fucked though. On the ride home, my friend turned up his bass incredibly. I could almost 'see' the fucking bass. Don't ask. When I arrived home about three hours later, I had to do a PreCalc assignment. Ha... Fuck that. That was not happening. I forgot how to do any of it and one problem would take me five minutes. Three and a half hours after 'ingestion' if you will, I tried talking on the phone. My girlfriend stated that I was not talking at all and I was just sitting there staring off blankly, not making sense, and on top of that not remembering what she was saying to me. I decided to go to bed.
