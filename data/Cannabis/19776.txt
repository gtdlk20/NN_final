It was probably about 5 more minutes and the movie started, I was reaching my climax at this point. The movie we were seeing was a Sci-Fi movie, so I knew that it was probably going to be frightening and verry strange. I was right, the movie was very odd and I had trouble keeping up with it. During the first ten minutes of the movie all I could see was a small part of the screen that I was focusing on and the rest was blurry. This being a quite frequent effect that I get I enjoyed it, moving my focus to different spots on the screen trying to guess what was going to happen, etc.
