When I saw my dad (not biological) I tried to talk as normal as I could but he noticed I was acting weird and asked me what was wrong. I told him I felt car sick and the macaroni I ate was bad, then I rushed to the bathroom and threw up. My dad heard me throwing up but I tried to convince him I was just a little sick. Then my cousin and I went downstairs to sleep and I immediately went to sleep on the sofa with my contacts and shoes and everything on. I fell asleep immediately. In the morning I was fine, but I kept on thinking about the night before over and over in my head.
