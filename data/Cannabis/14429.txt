When 'The Wind Cries Mary' came on, I felt a funny feeling in my ears. You know when you have the munchies and eat something crunchy and get that really good feeling in your jaws? Well, I had that, only in my ears! It was the most amazing feeling I have had in my life so far (I'm only 16). I sat there for what seemed like hours, listening to 'The Wind Cries Mary'. I downed the last of my lemonade and grabbed a pack of gum on my way outside to see what I could see.
