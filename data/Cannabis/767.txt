11:15. I think I'm a character in a poem. It makes perfect sense. It's a perfect reduction of the universe. An artful condensing of my perception to a lyrical singularity. It's a very introspective idea. An ego trip. Not ego loss - if anything, it's ego envelopment. The 'external' world is nothing more than the scripted manifestation of my inner artist: the explication of perception and reality. I am everything and everything is Me. But who is 'I'? Some middleman in the artist process of my alien God? At times I feel I am this God, but at other times I feel I'm subservient to this God. What I know as my 'self' is just an artist's tool - an actor in a piece of performance art. My life is a one-act play. Free will is the ultimate ironic punchline. Unity in isolation and isolation in unity.
