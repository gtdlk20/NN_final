My third eye is triangular.  Its fucking blinking.  And crying.  Someone in a comic book- (lightening! In my mind) Ah forgot everything I was saying.  Wow this is an amazing state.  Fuck the law.  Fuck teachers.  Fuck parents.  Fuck fucking.  God damnit, writing everything, even melodramatic retarded things, is fun.
