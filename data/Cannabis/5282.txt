I sat there and K said something to me that just seemed sort of funny and I started to giggle, which didn't stop. It just kept going and going and going, and slowly but surely the rest of the poeple sitting around me (besides K) realized I was high, but everyone around me smoked weed themselves, so it was no need for concern about someone narcing on me. At times I would try to muster up all the strength I had to stop laughing but that just ended with me turning red in the face and breaking out into even louder laughter.
