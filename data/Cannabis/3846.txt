I'm not sure why I started, maybe because of peer pressure, sheer boredom, but most likely because of the bullshit I was supposed to 'learn' in D.A.R.E. What I'm describing to you here is not my first time I smoked weed, because it didn't really do anything for me, but rather I'm describing the first time I got really high.
