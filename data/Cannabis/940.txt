By now all of our previous plans had to be scrapped. We decided to go for a movie (Hancock) of which my mind draws a complete blank. All I remember is trying very hard to stay in my seat (the pulsations made me squirm and sink lower) at the theatre and drinking about 2 tubs of Pepsi. At one point I got a little worried about the amount of liquid I was drinking although I continuously felt very dehydrated.
