By this point I was feeling pretty good, like after smoking a sizeable amount, but more of a body-high than I feel when smoking marijuana.  The sensations were still building too; it would still be over an hour until I peaked.  I did not experience any amount of shaking and unsteadiness that I sometimes get when smoking.  I was glad about this; I dont really like that shaky feeling.  One surprise was that I did still experience cottonmouth.  Less so than after smoking, but definitely noticeable.  Did I get the munchies?  Im not sure.  The sensation of eating was very nice, but I wasnt drawn to munch face like I sometimes am after smoking.  This was probably because eating marijuana can be kind of tough on the stomach.
