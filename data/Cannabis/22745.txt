At that point, I laid back down (or should I say, fell over).  I then began to talk in every accent I can do, British, Yankee, whatever I could think of.  I remember thinking I had been speaking every language on earth, and I decided to talk to my friend in Chinese.  To me at the time, Chinese was a simple aye-aye-aye-aye.  I did this for a long time, slamming my head into the ice at the same time.
