20:30 still around. I thought things were tailing off a bit, & I do find it easier to type now. But this stuff is still around. Plenty of classical psychedelia, reminiscent & tantalisingly similar but distinctly different to it's better known molecular cousin(s). Once again, a brand new experience has outstripped the previous. I wonder what the stability of this molecule is compared to the unknowns or doomful prophecies of Al-Lad? If this compound is more or likely to be more stable it certainly provides an equilibrium of effects. Duration of a single 150ug hit is unknown to me so far, but I'd say from what's gone on so far today that LSz outstrips Al-Lad as an all round +++ psychedelic. I suspect with equalised tolerance, & going purely on this one experiment, 150ug of LSz will take you deeper, longer into the realm of psychedelic effects than you might visit compared to a single 150ug dose of Al-Lad. Once again, I am basing that conlusion after just this one experience!
