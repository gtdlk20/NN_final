TS soon gave up the controls. He needed a break. BD took over, than me. That was when it started to fade (around 35 min. must have passed). Although I still felt the cognitive effect of the material, I was not so linked to that world, the despair has evaporated. I was more like a soldier doing his job. Maybe I succeeded entering the trip of the fighter I controlled. Also, the game became very monotonous. The level design was not shining and the story became a thin broth. Action consisted of killing an infinite number of monsters every ten steps so thoughts began drifting away and soon we all snapped out completely of the game's world...
