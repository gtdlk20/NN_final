I don't get the spiritual enlightenment or emotional clarity I was looking for, but I feel better--more at ease. When I have the chance to do this again, there will be no driving. I asked them about the cop, just to make sure it was a hallucination/dream, and it turns out it was--all caused by a Sublime song, apparently.
