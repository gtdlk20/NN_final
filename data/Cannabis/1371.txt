Imagine if humans actually discovered extraterrestrial life. But it wasn't just some aliens in a UFO, though that's how everyone would think of it at first. It was extraterrestrials discovering us. It was a huge, huge, huge world of creatures all over the universe, massively connected and with already well-developed civilizations (kind of like in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). It would be for us like a native tribe on an island on the Pacific rim that had never known any other tribes, and though they theorized, had no real reasons to ever consider the possibility of other tribes or other people. So far as they knew, they were the universe. And then the rest of the world finds them, and suddenly they're part of a sphere millions of times as big in an instant.
