Finally we entered my house through the backdoor. I peered into the mirrorour eyes were stoned red. Damn. I advised everyone to NOT make eye contact with my family. We entered my living room and after a well-handled conversation with my parents (which felt like it was in a dream), we departed to my room. There I would say the peak of my high reached. I jumped onto my bed and it felt amazing, like I had just fallen ten feet or something. If I sat still for more than ten seconds my whole body would completely numb over. C and N retired to the Nintendo set. I could not playI was so paranoid and frightened and confused that I just sat on the floor, pretending to text (with my cell phone) in case my parents came in my room (this would allow me to not make eye contact with them).
