Now the munchies hit us. We went to a Quiznos store near us and ordered some sub sandwiches. I shared mine with a friend who didn't have any money, but regretted it because I was still hungry after. While in the store, You Can't Always Get What You Want came on the radio and I yelled to my friend, 'This is such a GREAT SONG!' He humored me, but soon hurried me away from all the people who were staring at the three of us. That night I ate: 1/2 of a sub sandwich, numerous Lindt Chocolates, a large bowl of soup, and two orders of french fries. My stomach would hurt after I sobered up.
