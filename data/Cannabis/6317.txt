When we got inside, I grabbed a small glass of water and drank it.  The water instantly cleared up my cottonmouth and I felt much better.  I wasn't feeling paranoid and I didn't feel like laughing.  I just felt like exploring the intensity of the experience.  After stopping at his brother's, A and I went back to the car and J started to drive back to the dorm.  We passed the pipe around more until our stash was gone.
