I wanted to go home, but I felt that if I expressed this desire out loud, it would address the fact that something was wrong again, which would start the whole attack all over again.  I felt my heart beat start to pound again, but this time I managed to ignore it.  I think I would like to call a Taxi, I said Probably the best idea, all things considered.  I had addressed the issue quite eloquently, and for this I felt a swell of pride.  It was the first time since the start of the evening that I had felt anything real or positive so I decided to go with it.
