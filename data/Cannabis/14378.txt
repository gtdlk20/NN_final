A lost tourist pulled up just then, and things got a little sticky.  Jim felt he was receiving no help from our group so he rushed up to the car window of the man and asked him to take him to the hospital.  Farmer, the Tripmaster, shooed Jim back toward the camp and got rid of the tourist, giving them directions and explaining that Jim was a newly diagnosed diabetic, and had forgotten his insulin.  We would have to ride into town to get some from a local pharmacy.  For one moment or two I thought we were going to spend the night or more in jail in Iowa!
