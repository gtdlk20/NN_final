Then I relaxed on the couch and was slightly caressing my hair to get this type of tingly feeling. It was great. Then I just lied back with eyes closed or half-closed and started having various memories, sights and sounds in my mind, even from childhood. Musical instruments, the waves, people talking and laughing, and other sounds were recalled with accuracy. These were no hallucinations like at the hypnagogic state, these were random memories from my life. I could also consciously recall a memory quite easily. Three times I thought about my x girlfriend, in particular the good times with her at the start of the relationship, which distressed me for some seconds and then it went away. When I was opening my eyes, the effects seemed to diminish. However still effects were noticeable. For example things seemed as they had some more depth to them, and seemed somewhat changed from the normal, but I cannot describe it accurately.
