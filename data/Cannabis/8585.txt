Then we decided to eat in the food court. The food tasted so great! Touch and taste were the 2 senses which were most amplified. That 'strobe/frame-by-frame' feeling I had from the dro returned. Only this time I had delayed reaction with taste instead of sight. When I would chew something, I would only taste it every few seconds. But when I did taste it, the taste was incredible.
