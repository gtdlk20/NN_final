8:00 AM (T+21:00)- I woke up, lying in the semidarkness that was created by my cream colored shades, I realized that I was still high. This had ventured into insanity. I was high, although at this point it was a managable buzz, much like the one created when a bowl of some chronic is smoked. For the next four hours or so, I read, although I realize that it was much less than that. I was basically staring at the pages, because as soon as I turned the page, I forgot what I had just read.
