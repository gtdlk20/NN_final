We walked a different way than we had come and I still cannot fully recall which way we walked because I was concentrating on what was happening to me.  I decided it was probably going to be a dud of a trip again because the effects seemed to be taking quite a while to really come on.  Then it hit me.  I cant remember any transition at all, other than, seriously, a blink of an eye.  It seemed as though I had tunnel vision except I didnt have any blind spots, almost as though my eyes were focusing binocularly.  Hearing became quite a trip: when I spoke, it almost seemed to come out of my head as a whole rather than from my mouth; other peoples voices became closer and clearer but I could only concentrate on a few things at a time.
