	I am surrounded by light and for a moment, feel the most intense fear of my life, but it quickly subsides to a feeling of absolute joy.  I feel as though I am connected, literally connected and one with a benevolent entity that makes up all of existence.  I am the universe, and feel nothing but joy in the form of light.
