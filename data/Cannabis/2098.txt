More visions ensued. I clearly remember witnessing an oddball combination of a red pepper merging into a teapot, a lavish English one painted purple and white. Another image was that of a symmetrical Tudor-style house, but somehow constructed of retro skateboarding shoes and skateboards. Again, I would analyze this, and conclude it comes from memories of my neighborhood in New York, with all the Tudor houses that looked so much like the one in my vision. Moreso, I skateboarded as an adolescent for several years, and the skate shoes reminded me clearly of ones I used to wear. It is in this way that these images were/are so striking, as they seem to be a true manifestation of my subconscious, my memories, feelings, thoughts, combined with every image or color or creation I've ever seen in my life.
