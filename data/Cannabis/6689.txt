My twin brother and I were visiting the house of my friend Nat and her roommate Jess.  We had been hanging out, talking and watching movies, singing, and generally having a good time.  When 1AM rolled around and everyone admitted that the party better wind down -- we all had work in the morning.  On a whim, Nat and Jess suggested that we smoke a little, since we hadn't earlier.  My twin and I agreed enthusiastically, and we went up to Nat's room while Jess got her weed.
