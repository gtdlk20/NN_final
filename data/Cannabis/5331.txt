I dont have a very clear memory of anything that happened after this, but I will do my best with what little I remember, and what I had written and also what others later said theyd seen. I apparently had drawn some attention, because a few people there claimed they noticed that I looked a pale green color. One of them mentioned this to my companions, who were chatting with people outside the store. So they came over to ask me if I was ok, and said I was trippin. C reassured me I wasnt and not to freak, and to get up and take a drink from the water-fountain a few feet away. So I very slowly got to my feet, and found that everything below my waist felt like it was submerged in wet cement, making it very difficult to move, almost like wading upstream in a river. With some more encouragement I eventually made it to the water-fountain, and stopped. I looked at the fountain, and the nozzle from which the water would squirt from, and realized there was absolutely no way I was going to be able to intercept air-borne water with mouth, and then swallow it! I had to think with all my might just top even imagine the process, and I certainly couldnt imagine actually successfully accomplishing such a complex task. So they led me back to couches and brought me some water in a cup, which I drank with much difficulty.
