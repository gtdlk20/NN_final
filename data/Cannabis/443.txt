I smoked from the second source in total three times. I Didnt keep any date, because I didnt consider the experiences important. The first experience came after smoking one joint. I just felt myself heavier than usual, and one I thought of a particular friend, I got momentarily frightened, because I wonder if he is well or dead. I also noticed that corners and dark places have more depth to them, and imagined that inside they had water and darkness and death and rotting things. Then I felt happy when I got outside, but I dont know if it was from the weed. Or from the fact it had finally affected me. Also I got the feeling that things are somehow alive and talk to me.
