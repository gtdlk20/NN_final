I then lay down on the floor and stared up at the light bulb.  It was amazing and it became a lovely, godly sun.  I looked up at the ceiling and saw a purple candle and suddenly I was in a birdÂ’s eye view of an intricate, wooden, homey smelling cabin.  I was quickly transported back to where I lay.  Now, I three-quarters-closed my eyes and peered at my eyelashes.  The light from the light bulb streamed through them and I felt wonderful and profound, like I was in a colorful fortress of eyelashes filled with deep glee.  So this is how the gods feel, perched atop their fluffy pedestals sniggering at the triviality of human triumph and suffering.  How beautiful, how glorious it felt to be admitted to this heaven of sorts.
