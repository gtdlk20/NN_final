It thundered that day. I kept yelling that the thunder was trying to get into my house to steal my pop tarts. I had a discussion with my friend about the difference between real soda and 'mind soda'. The whole time I had this incredibly distorted sense of touch. I was asking people if I was moving my hand because I couldn't feel it moving (though apparently it was moving). I knocked soda cans over and walked into a table and didn't even feel it. This feeling didn't wear off for days.
