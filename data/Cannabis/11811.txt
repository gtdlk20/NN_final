My current girlfriend, C, and I have smoked weed together several times before this particular experience (and after), but this is the only time I actually got really 'stoned.' At the time of this experience, I was 20 and in college. Prior to this experience, I had smoked at least 10 times in my life, with only one other time that affected me at all. C was a much more experienced smoker in high school, however since then, she barely smoked at all. I was a late bloomer, I only drank a handful of times in high school, and smoked maybe 3 or 4 times.
