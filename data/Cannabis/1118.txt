I'm back on the couch. I can feel everything now. So much that it hurts. I can sense the temperature of ever piece of air that I breathe as I inhale and exhale through my mouth, but the feeling is still not pleasant. Hughie is trying to talk to me. He has realized now that I am somewhere else. He keeps asking me who I am, and half the time I can answer, less than that I get the answer right. I haven't opened my eyes since I found myself back on the living room couch, but I know where I am. Occasionally waves hit me so quickly I feel like I'm on a roller coaster and all I can do is hold on to the couch and scream. When they stop I cry and moan.
