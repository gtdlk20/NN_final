I then tried to explain what my head was feeling like.  When sober, we view our world from our eyes, and this is where our perception of ourselves comes from-the front of the face.  I felt like my concept of 'me' was not my immediate body or eyes.  I felt like I was watching a movie of the living room, and my eyes were the camera, only I was watching this movie playing out from 3 feet behind my head.  The movie 'Being John Malkovich' is similar to what I experienced.  In 'BJM,' people's consciousnesses are thrown into John's head, and they watch through his eyes, but from behind them, with no apparent control over their new body.
