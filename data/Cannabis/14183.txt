Anyhow, my friends mainly dismissed it as i tend to have very different experiences than they do. I went out on the back patio for a smoke, and then the world let me in on a little secret.  Its mine, and im sure that the rest of you know it too, so im not going to write it down.  Once this secret hit me, the world opened up.....i watched an appartment complex take off...like a rocket ship.  Then my attention turned to nature.  Everything was praising the sky....the trees, with each and every branch reaching up to touch it. In the snow on the ground i saw faces, mountains and other earthly bits and peices.  Never once did my attention sway towards the universe, i felt centered where i was.
