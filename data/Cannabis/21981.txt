I was tested at my worksite and failed miserably. Though I never go to work under the influence of any drugs. As a regular user using everyday I initially tested with a THC level of 90 ng/ml. Almost double the allowed concentration. After eight days clean I was re-tested at a level of 48.5 ng/ml. On the quick test I was deemed negative. I hope that these test results will help.
