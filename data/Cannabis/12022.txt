After this first experience I realized the awesome power of this particular strain, it seemed to be something like white rhino. The next night I went to bed early and smoked about 1/4 of a bowl full. I put on the chillies on my headphones and examined the artwork on the green day 'insomniac' album. I then began to stare at a psychedelics poster I have on my door, this is where it started to get really strange.
