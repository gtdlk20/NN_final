We wrote down the time we dosed but decided against checking the time at all through the trip. While we waited for the onset we decided to put on some music with visualizations and cuddle up in bed.  Between kisses and cuddles the music started to take on distinct and detailed layers (as it tends to when Im high on anything) but I wasnt feeling much on the 2c-c as far as physical effects go.
