Once at the park, probably about thirty minutes later, it was no better. If you were to look at a 'Microsoft PowerPoint' slideshow (just anything that has changing slides) that's how I was viewing everything. Seriously I was watching the damn park in moving 'slides'. Even my friend complimented that to the sound of birds, which at this time seemed overwhelming, and the look of those woods about twenty feet away, it was a 'jungle'. The park slide was an elephant. We were waiting for my friend to come pick us back up and I could not wait because I needed some damn water for my mouth. Needless to say, I still thought I was going to die. When I did get some spit in my mouth I felt it come on really fast right before I spit it out. I thought my throat 'exploded' and I was about to spit blood. I almost saw it before it happened. I was reassured when I saw the white spit of nothingness.
