Still on the staircase, Rayanne came out of Catalanos room and asked me if I had any underlying mental disorders.  I stuttered a Nouh II dont t-think so; as one can imagine, this didnt really calm my nerves.  I stumbled back into Catalanos room and realized that I was in a movie like Matilda.  My head was spinning and it looked like I was on a movie set.  I kept switching in and out of different scenes and mindsets and worlds.  Every few seconds I would zero in on Catalanos face and exclaim Whoa, then whoosh off into my adventure again.  I was still coming up and was terrified on a higher level of fear than possibly ever before.  Whoa.
