At this time I had my bass amp hooked up to my computer and I was able to play songs through it with good results. I had been listening to pendulum and as I let the drum and bass beat intice and entrance me, then it dawned on me, I was in a music video! My warped vision helped perpetuate this feeling and I began to feel a bit like I was in the music video for The Prodigys 'smacked my bitch up'. I grabbed my nachos and began to eat. I had begun to feel intense rushes of energy in my body that went from my head, in particular from my right ear down to my feet. The feeling was momentary but it was quickly proceeded by another rythmic rush of energy.
