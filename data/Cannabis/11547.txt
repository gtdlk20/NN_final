We went to the store, and we had already formulated a plan for acquiring some Coricidin Cold & Cough (or Triple Cs as we called it often). We stole 2 boxes of the Triple Cs (which I don't recommend, they  should be purchased legally if possible), regardless of their Chloropheniramine Maleate content, which I wasnt worried about because we weren't taking overly large doses.  We left the store, and I immediately took 11 of the pills, and S took 9 of them, I kept the remainder of them in my pocket.
