It was as though the filter in my mind which sifts through my thoughts, tossing aside irrational ones had been completely removed, and I was allowed to see things and think thoughts that would never before have occured to me.  I was communicating these emotions and sensations to my friends, many of whom felt the same things, but I felt like talking and any sort of external physical movement would 'bring me out' of my trance-like state.
