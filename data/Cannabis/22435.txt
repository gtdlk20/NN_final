I also started to think I was doing all this stuff and then I would realize that I hadn't moved from where I was.  I felt so lost, and was really scared.  I kept thinking that something had to be wrong; I shouldn't be scared from just a little bit of weed.  I decided to lie down on my bed and attempt to fall asleep, which is what I must have done.  I also think that my heart was beating really hard sometimes throughout that night.
