11 AM (T+00:20)- Started feeling the first waves. I can't stress how different this is from smoking the plant. It doesn't come on the same way. With smoking, it hits me entirely in about fifteen minutes. When I eat it, it can take 1-2 hours to fully affect me. I had been watching some television show and the theme song had come on. All of a sudden, I felt like I was part of the music. I had gotten up and performed some sort of inane dance that seemed to just come to me. After the song ended, the wave receded a little and I sat back down and watched the rest of the show.
