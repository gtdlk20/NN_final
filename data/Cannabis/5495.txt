The effects I felt during this experience were far more elaborate and crazy than any other time that I have been high. This tops the last high that I had when I was running around my house with a baseball bat because I thought that someone was in my house. That night, I also saw the Trix bunny in the calendar hanging on my wall and I got into a yelling match with it for about fifteen minutes. But that experience is a whole different story.
