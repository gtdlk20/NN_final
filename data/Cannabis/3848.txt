I returned home and found a suitable Saturday to take them. My preferred method of ingesting shrooms is to grind them up (sometimes using scissors and a shot glass like I would with marijuana) into smaller powdery flakes. I then eat a small mouthful and wash it down with a big gulp of fruit juice, and repeat until everything is consumed. Because the pieces are already so small there is no need to chew and taste them, and they also kick in faster. I dont much like the taste when Im sober, and this is a very fast efficient way to eat them quickly without messing around with teas or honey etc. However I find when Im already tripping I love the taste and can eat the shrooms like potato chips :D
