	The entity then changes from light into a shape-shifting tree that I am inside of.  Vincent Van Gogh could not have created such a beautiful masterpiece.  I see millions of eyeballs, staring at me, occasionally blinking.  These eyeballs have veins and arteries pouring out of their backs, essentially a fleshy spider web, and as the fleshy veins/arteries move farther away from the eyeballs, they take on less of a fleshy nature and more of a wooden nature.  To put it simply, eyeballs are morphing into tree branches.  These tree branches then create a wooden 'spider web' that makes up the walls of the tree that I am inside of.  Simultaneously, I see billions upon billions of cells, giving the tree its real shape-shifting effect.  They are constantly moving around in a pattern that I cannot understand, and they make up everything that exists.  They make up what I am, they make up the eyeballs and they make up the veins and arteries that slowly morph into tree branches.   Existing in this tree seems to last an eternity.
