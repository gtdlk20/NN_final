After re-reading my account, I fear that I may have written a report akin to the ones I previously said have left me dissatisfied: a mere narrative lacking insight into the nature of the drugs subjective effects.  Ive decided to add some other things Ive written about or while high on marijuana, to reinforce my description of this heightened other dimension.
