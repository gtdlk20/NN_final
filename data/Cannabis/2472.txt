My friend had seen the whole thing. He'd been able to urinate normally (lucky bastard) and was both impressed and a little weirded out at what was happening. (So was I.) Since we were both finding everything very weird as a result of being stoned for the first time anyway, it was just another magical weirdness; sort-of par for the course: part of this brilliant adventure. He had many questions, which, mostly, I had no answers for, but we both worked out what had happened. He wanted it to happen to him, too. I had no idea what to suggest. Sounds naive. It was. We were.
