I found lots of conflicting experiences, some claiming vaping didn't get them as high as smoking, others claiming vaping was more potent. I tend to trust science, and the science says vaping can deliver higher doses, so I concluded I must be doing it wrong. I read about Mouth to Lung vs Direct Lung inhales. I tried to execute them, but I still coughed.
