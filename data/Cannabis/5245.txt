We went outside to my friends back yard and we set everything up and lit the bowl.  The water in the bottle sank as a huge amount of smoke replaced it, pouring in seamlessly from the bowl.  By the time the water was finished draining the smoke within the two liter was GREEN.  Almost a pure coat of green.  My friends, who were in amazement, cautiosly handed the bottle to me.  And I uncovered the top and took a rip.
