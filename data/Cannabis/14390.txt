This experience was had at a small, isolated farm just outside of a major city in Iowa.  Jim is still pursuing his spiritual and intellectual curiosities, as am I.  Farmer is still Farmer, and as far as Im concerned thats a good thing.  I am planning to write more of these chapters, experimenting with LSA, Stropharia Cubenis, Mescaline, and Syrian Rue.  I would encourage any potential or fledgling psychonauts out there to listen carefully to your heart, research like a scholar, and experience ecstatically.
