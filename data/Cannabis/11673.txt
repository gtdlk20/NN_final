I know that people would react to these feelings in different ways.  Honestly, I'm a fan of dark feelings and I loved it, but I also know that these feelings could cause some people to 'bug out'. Take my word that if you're a person that enjoys happy highs, you shouldn't even think of tryin wet or any other kind of PCP.  If you would enjoy this kind of stuff, I'm not trying to persuade or dissuade you to try it, but I must warn that you shouldn't do too much of it in a little amount of time.  Thats how one of my friends ended up in a mental institution.  So be careful with wet and PCP.
