I awoke and looked at my watch  it was 5am.  I headed back to the caravan where my friends were fucking around with the TV set or something and I sat down calmly.  I then burst into a full rendition of most of my favourite songs and went to bed.  The singing was especially satisfying as I was feeling like a rock star or something, and that was good.  I like singing when Im wasted anyway.
