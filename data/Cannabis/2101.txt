Yes I know, I know: there are plenty of reports already on Erowid about cannabis.  By George, Erowid needs more information about rare psychoactives or potent mixes, not a random girls account of smoking lots and lots of weed and tripping out!  However, after having culled through a few hundred experience reports, Ive not yet read many that have described a psychedelic experience the way a complete newbie would experience it.  Sure, plenty have depicted in great detail going to the neighborhood park and feeling weird and walking around and seeing things weird and feeling stoned and weird weird weird.  But few have really emphasized how alien, how inexplicably terrifying, how divine and shining, how clear and how blurry and how beyondjust beyond, is even the most minor psychedelic experience.  Perhaps I am merely aggrandizing my own experiences; however, I have a hunch that others have felt similar things regarding the sheer grandeur of psychedelia.  I understand that many people do not trip out from smoking marijuana by itself, but I myself have cracked open the door to the crazy, wonderful world of psychedelia from doing so.  I wrote the following account while coming down from the highthus, its very possible that I bartered some sophistication in diction for, I hope, a more accurate portrayal of events.
