I texted him and asked if I could show up as early as 8 and he said that was perfect, so I made plans for that time. Even though it was summer, I didnt care about waking up early if it meant that I could chill with him. The next morning I gathered my supply box, which consisted of a lighter and some bud copped from the local premium dealer. I drove over and parked my car on the other side of the road near Js house, so if I had to run, I could make a smooth transition to driving.
