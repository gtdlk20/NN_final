And I became aware that I was weeping.  Despite all the logical impossibilities, all the contradictions, all the religious crap.  Somehow . . . God.  Did.  Exist.  And then I was laughing uncontrollably at the irony of this little vision.  I was seeing the answers of life, my soul laid bare in the water of a toilet bowl.  I laughed like a madman and cried oceans at the same time.  Irony.  Good Christ.  Somehow my inner observer was still intact and making fun of this situation.
