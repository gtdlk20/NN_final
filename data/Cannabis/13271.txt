I see out of the corner of my eye that B is loading up his second hit, but I cant move. Some sort of emptiness came over my body, like my muscles werent there. I couldnt feel anything but empty space I kept saying to myself snap out of it, if I dont, I wont be able to moveit was really hard but I finally moved, and realized that I had to keep moving around or Id get stuck again. Keep in mind this was only 3 hits
