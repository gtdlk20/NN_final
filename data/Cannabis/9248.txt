I watched about the second round before dozing off and coming to at what I imagine to be the third round or so. I look at the clock in the kitchen and it's 1:00 p.m. I then fall asleep again, this time when I wake up it's 1:30 and I notice Monster sitting there in front of me. I shout out, 'Jesus Fuck! I fall asleep and wake up with fucking Monster in front of me...that's insane.' I then fall asleep for a little longer, waking up when they're leaving to get some food at a place where they can sit in a booth and smoke.
