When I smoked with B for the first time, the same initial feelings I had as a youngster started to come back. I was light-headed, and warm and music sounded great. But then, the same introspection I had such an aversion to started to manifest. I awkwardly excused myself and went back to my dorm room where I prepared to feel really uncomfortable about myself again for several hours. I lay down, and as I did thoughts came into my head and quickly desseminated into a million different seemingly random mental pathways. With my eyes closed I was traveling at lightspeed through a network of multi-colored fibers, each one representing to me, a thought. A thought that would eddy and disappear quickly in the current of my consciousness when I tried to grasp it. And somehow instead of negative emotions and egotistical walls presenting themselves as they head done previously, a connection was made. I saw in my minds eye the love and joy and peace that was pulsing beneath a sea of my ego and self delusion. It was a song of love, being called out from the depth of my hatred and anger and pain. I knew in my brain at the same time that I had to reach that space.
