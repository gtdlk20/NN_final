I ate about ¾ of the shrooms, as much as I could stomach. I usually leave a bit for later to mix with marijuana for smoking, which I find to be an incredibly potent kick when already tripping. However, if I smoke shrooms while sober, the effects are negligible. I chilled out on the carpet of the lounge, listening to music and relaxing, trying not to think about coming on. I didn't have to wait long, about 20 minutes after consumption I felt the shrooms kicking in hard. Describing a shrooms trip is a lot like describing a dream, things are disjointed and its hard to keep track. Lying on the floor I began to feel very mushy and squishy, the ambient trance music softly playing in the background. I could hear jungle sounds, like frogs and crickets, and my living room soon became a lush jungle. But it was still my living room.
