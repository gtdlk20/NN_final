Luckily I broke free from the sitting up and downbut then I really started to tweak out.  I ran halfway downstairs in swirling panic, my head buzzing with warmth, in disbelief that this other universe is what people call high.  I had the strange sensation of being *completely inside my head*, aware of my surroundings in a panoramic view; it felt too wide, too open.  This shocked me, since it was the total opposite of a blurry, drunken head buzz.  I heard Rayanne ask Catalano if I was mentally unstablethis made me freak out exponentially more, as I realized that my reaction was abnormal.  I caught the word tripping in their conversation a few times.  So I was tripping!  Now I was thrown into a confused, swirling state.  You know when youre asleep and realize that you are in a dream, and inexplicably get really bored and restless and have to pry your eyes open?  This was like that, but scary and real and I was already awake so I couldnt open my eyes any wider and my heart was beating out of my chest and I thought I was in some sort of Hell.  When was I born into this eerily clear new world?
