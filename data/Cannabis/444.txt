The second session was lighter than the first. I got the feeling that things are as if talking to me, and also some death-related thoughts, like for example my mother is dead or when I return home I will find shrouded and decomposing bodies. However I am a death-obsessed person and these thoughts arent so abnormal from time to time. A third try gave even lesser results. Just things seemed like they had spirits and were talking to me and songs had the feel of targeting me. No negative thoughts. After 10 minutes, it was gone. At that point I had mixed the materials from both sources and now I wasnt sure on which is the most potent. During those sessions, I didnt feel any increase of appetite which is considered the hallmark of cannabis intoxication. Neither my short-term memory got affected, just I had some confusion if I put the paraphernalia back in their places. Weed was a good sleeping aid though, as any time after use, which happened in the evenings, I felt sleepy and slept soundly.
