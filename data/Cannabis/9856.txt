Four hours. With the best of the high past, I curl up in bed and fall asleep easily, knowing that in the morning, it will all be over and I will return to my everyday life. I don't really worry about it, however. Still drugged and sleepy, all I can think about is how good now feels, and how wonderful making love is when you're not worried about what your body looks like. My body feels heavy, and my mind wanders. I fall asleep as if I am sinking into warm, dark water.
