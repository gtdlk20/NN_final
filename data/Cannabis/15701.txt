All in all, a new and exciting experience from pot. Never thought it would be possible. Why do I think it happened? I had a large amount of Indian food for lunch, and I think there was a synergy from the spices. Yea, it could be food poisoning, but my girlfriend wasn't sick at all. This experience reinforced my belief that MJ is definitely a visionary plant. I'll probably try to repeat the indian food + copious mj combo just to satisfy my curiosity. However, the taste of curried bile is a poignant reminder that lingers on my tongue.
