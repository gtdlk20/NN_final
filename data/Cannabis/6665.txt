Standing up was a real challenging task seeing as my body was out. But somehow I managed it and made it down the hallway to a room with a computer. The insanity of a show called 'Wondershozen' soon came on and it was alright at first, hard to follow or comprehend, yes. But then it became terrifying. The out-of-body sensation had seemed to be wearing off when it suddenly hit me again like a wrecking ball smashing into a rickity old building, but this time it came on about 10 times stronger than it had been before.
