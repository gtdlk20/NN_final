I still question whether this experience really happened or not, but it seemed as real as the weed I smoked.  Since then I have actually noticed things about people and the ways of life that I had never noticed before.  Almost as if my eyes have been opened.  I have tried numerous times using the same technique, and even more potent herb at higher amounts, as I had that night and have not begun to re-visit the place.  Whether it was a dream or not, it was definitely total bliss.  I'm sure that I am not the only one to have such an experience from just marijuana, and have started looking for others who have, yet I am still unsuccesful.
