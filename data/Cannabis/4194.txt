As I began to peak and peak, more odd things appeared in my mind's eye. Even when I opened my eyes, I could still sense them, as if my third eye was beaming them out like from a projector. One of the more prominent images and recurring themes during the experience was this repeating image of some sort of 1990s kid's toy commercial. Often times I would see a cartoonish, vivid image like the storybook creature described above, and then everything would pan out as if a camera and I would see some outtake of a 90s-looking commercial with kids, filmed against a green screen or all-white background in some studio somewhere. It was not just an empty image, but also strongly tied to my memories of sitting home as a 7 or 8 year old, watching Nickelodeon and Disney, and all the cheesy ads that came with it.
