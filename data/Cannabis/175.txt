80 minutes have now passed. The effect is still very present. Sore muscles still feel like they are about to cramp. I wonder if this feeling will persist? (but of course it won't).  When I excite a muscle, the effect however immediately disappears, the sense returns to normal, but only for a few seconds. The changed muscle feeling is in many muscles now: back, shoulders, jaw, wrists, fingers, legs. The muscles I am often a bit sore in.
