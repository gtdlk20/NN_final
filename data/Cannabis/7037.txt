We sat sipping wine, and discussing women, as per usual, while listening to the mildly cacaphonous song playing on the stereo.  The song that we were listening to is a sort of tribal chant of poetry with flourishing/discordant guitars and swirling, ultra fuzzed out Hammond Organ. It's a very repetitive song, and when you listen to it with a hard buzz on, which we both had, The Stone just sort of melts into the song and itÂ’s one of those deals where you start to really pick up on things that the artist wants you to, as the the music steers your Stone.  At this point, my Stone, which was already heavy, got really intense.
