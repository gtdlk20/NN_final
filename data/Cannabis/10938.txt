I grew up thinking drugs were bad. I had a terrible experience that I associated with cigarettes at a young age, which manifested in a fear of nicotine. I took this aversion and applied it to all illicit substances. I didnt start consuming alcohol until I was 18, and thought Id never smoke the EVIL marijuana.
