The one stoner statement I believe Ive come to find truth in is this: Between life and death lies peace. Ive been dead, and Ive been alive. In the middle is peace, which takes into account both of these symbiotic natures of life. Who is God? I have no idea. If he exists, I dont think Hes as simple as any one religion, be it Catholicism, Mormonism, Islam, etc. tries to claim he is. I do believe there is a governing force, however, as I cannot see life as being possible otherwise. For now, my life is dedicated to absorbing all truths from the great, diverse human family. Later, when Im ready, perhaps I will choose one life to dedicate myself to. But not yet.
