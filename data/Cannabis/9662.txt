AFTERMATH - It's a good thing I don't have to work, because I am nonfunctional for most of the following day. I'm sleepwalking all day, robotically going through my usual weekend routine. While I don't feel sick, this is still the longest hangover of any kind I've ever experienced and I don't like it at all.
