My dad rolled me a joint last time I saw him (a few days ago) of what he said was really good stuff, no paranoia just a great high, etc. so last night I decided to check it out. I smoked about 75% of the joint he gave me and within minutes started to feel the familiar mild head buzz coming on. Within about 5-10 minutes I was full on stoned. I was so high that my equilibrium was way off and when I walked, I kept feeling like I would stumble. Everything I did was impaired in some way. I thought 'Wow, this IS good stuff.' I decided to just put on some music and try to zone out for a while since doing anything else was pretty much out of the question for now.
