I contemplate whether or not I should save it from the metal and spring coils of death and simply eat it as it was. I then realized that it actually enjoyed being in there. The toaster was what a sauna is to us. I then smiled for him, and let a small tuft of noise pass through my lips as I nearly began to talk to it, before noticing Raz standing by the kitchen entryway, laughing at my giddyness for a Pop-Tart. Had he only known the connection we had. I was staring at him, totally oblivious to the Pop-Tart that once engrossed my every braincell, before *CHINK* the toaster exploded the toasty Pop-Tart back to it's original position, as I too exploded in a fit of fear, anger, and chaos as I did not expect the noise. My partner began to laugh at my antics, as I said, 'Fuck man...I'm going to enjoy this fucker.' I then stepped out into the garage of his home to claim a drink for myself. A Diet Lemon Coke. My meal was complete, and my blindness still intact mainly in the center of my vision.
