I've been smoking marijuana since I was 15/16, with a few-month hiatus this year. So I figured that I wouldn't experience anything like that again because my body had become accustomed to it. Maybe it's because it hasn't been that long since I wasn't smoking so my body hasn't got used to it again yet.  This day, I'd shared about 6 spliffs in total but it was the last 2 (we bonged the last one) that did it for me really.  I was lying on a bottom bunk bed. Above me was the wooden base of the higher bunk, with a large red star that I painted on there last year. I got lost in blowing a plume of smoke up to the middle of the star and watching it spread out across the surface.  There were fairy lights on at that point with a big candle so I couldn't see in extreme detail but enough to keep my attention completely.   I was smoking a small bong, staring at the cherry, which is what your eyes are drawn to as it's so close to them.  I passed the bong to john and watched him smoke it and then he started to really look like a goblin. Which freaked me out a bit. At first, cos I was worried about there being a goblin in the room and then because of the fact that I WAS worrying about the transformation of a good friend into a fictional creature. I reasoned with myself that this shouldn't happen cos I was only smoking skunk.
