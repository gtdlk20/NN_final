It made me realise that the whole experience was just one way of making sense of reality. What I hold important changes from day-to-day, what makes a difference to me is fleeting and in its own way desperate and the real important thing is just what I do with myself day-in day-out... how I act and what I say to people, who I meet and how I get my highs.
