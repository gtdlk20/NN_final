I finished off about half of the cigarette and then set it down in the ash tray everyone was using. I went and layed on my friend's bed, just staring up at the ceiling. Out of nowhere a girl named Pricsella laid on the bed right beside me, not close, but she was looking right at me, she smiled and said 'You gonna be alright?', I just smiled as my reply to her question. She got up and walked out of the room. I felt reborn. I felt as if I died in the living room and was rebirthed in the bedroom, a new person. Happier. I was smiling ALOT at this point and had found some chips to eat. I devoured nearly half of the bag, and then ate an entire bag of chex mix spicy flavored type. I felt so good. I felt like I had beaten all odds, and the world was beautiful again.
