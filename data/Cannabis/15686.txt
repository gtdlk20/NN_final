Ones condition on marijuana is always existential. One can feel the importance of each moment and how it is changing one. One feels ones being, one becomes aware of the enormous apparatus of nothingnessthe hum of a hi-fi set, the emptiness of a pointless interruption, one becomes aware of the war between each of us, how the nothingness in each of us seeks to attack the being of others, how our being in turn is attacked by the nothingness in others.
