In the mirror my pupils were massive and my eyes were bright bright red.  My roommate was coming home shortly and I realized that I probably couldn't keep it together if I had to interact with another person one-on-one.  By this point I was hearing voices from outside and believed strongly that they were inside my apartment watching me.  It was probably the freakiest experience I have ever had on pot.  When I heard his key turn in the lock I ran into my room and locked the door and blacked out on the floor.  I woke up sometime after midnight and realized that I was still high.
