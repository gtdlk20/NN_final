Day 2: 15 mg at 4.30 pm topped up two hours later with another 5mg. So total 20 mg. Again sublingual. That did something. I do have the right enzyme :-) It took a bit over an hour to get any effect. It took a bit over an hour to get any effect. The first  sign of onset was a pleasant tingling on my scalp and face. Then a fairly rapid peak which lasted about two hours followed by a three or four hour come down and back to normal by midnight. Max 3 or 4/10 on the stoned scale. I was fully able to function, walk, talk etc but still definitely albeit lightly stoned. One notable feature was some slight LSD type visuals. Nothing hallucinatory but a definite visual element.  There was also a brief but intensely joyous feeling whilst listening to music.
