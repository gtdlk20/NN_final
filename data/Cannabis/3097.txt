Everything was going peachy-keen until I showed up to officially receive the offer. My prospective employer apologetically informed me that they had forgotten to tell me that I was required to undergo a 'drug test' prior to actually starting employment, as required by the company that had recently bought them out. Having been a regular daily cannabis user for the past seven years or so, I figured I was screwed.
