+1:00 - I always handwrite trip journals, and the writing is always a bit skewed, but my handwriting looks flat-out different. Even through the THC fog, I can sense that I'm holding the pen differently, making swifter strokes that allow the letters to flow together. I guess it's so I can write faster - if I slow down, I might forget what I'm writing before I finish.
