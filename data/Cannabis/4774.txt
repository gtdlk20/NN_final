I had eaten little all day, and had drank more than enough water to be hydrated. So about 10 minutes after we were done with the blunt, we headed to the gym. Now, I am a FIRM believer that your high is directly related to your surroundings. From the minute I stepped in the gym I felt uncomfortable and out of place. On top of that,there were alot of people there I knew and felt uncomfortable being high around (old classmates, parents friends, ).
