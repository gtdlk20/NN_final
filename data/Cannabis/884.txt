After this disappointing experience, I planned to use my own stash in order to prove if there is any effect. However I didnt know even how to roll cigarettes. I tried hand rolling, but I always succeeded in spilling the material out of the joint. So I tried to use the rolling machine. I learnt how to use it from the Internet, and started experimenting with it. After a few tries, my joints were coming out perfect. Now I had two sources for material: my own stash, and my fathers stash, from which I was able to get some more material, however it was mostly leaves. I kept the sources separate in order to compare the effects.
