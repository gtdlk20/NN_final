I arrived at this place; we will call it the Commons. When I got to the Commons, I was very disoriented. I still had that feeling that my mind and body were two different entities, but that I was stuck inside my body and it had control over what I was physically doing. I felt very free though when I was around people, and I was perfectly fine with this.
