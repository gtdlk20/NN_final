It was not madness, nor the stuff of such, though madness would result from my descent I am certain.  I felt it pull at me, like flame with talons, leaching deeper with each moment that I stared it down.  The remit of Logic and Law (in its eternal opposition to Chaos) goes only so far, and circumscribing its kingdom is a hinterland that drugs will lead you through.  They are your guide, possessing an insight surpassing the capabilities of most human beings.  As such, absolute respect is not only a duty and necessity but wholly implicit in their very existence.  The new land is cold, and when you walk know your footstep fall far from the beating heart of the 'self', the Id, or the Ego.  These things are constructed as a bastille, and rightly so.  Society and its endemic impulse cannot exist without this sullen keep.  With each question we interpret our answer such that they reinforce these walls, when the very act builds in us a covert curiosity at what lies beyond any self-imposed boundary.  It would be foolish to think demolition a resolution, but I can't help but wonder; is he truly saved, who has not tasted damnation.  I also cannot help but wonder if this hand is my hand, these eyes my eyes, I need a third word between 'mine' and 'yours' that implies both possesion and dissociation.  I HATE LANGUAGE!  It's like trying to stroke your lover to orgasm with a chainsaw!  Too crude!  Hulking lumps of sylabic goo!
