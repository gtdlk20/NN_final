Suddenly, a terrible thought occurred to me: If everything from my peripherals in had whited out, why could I still see my roomie? Wouldnt it make more sense that he would have been whited out just as well as everything else had? Or if I could still see my roomie right in front of me, why couldnt I see anything else that was right in front of me? The conclusion I came to was that I wasnt actually seeing my roomie, but just imagining him, and that I was really passed out on the floor of the lounge, completely tripping! This theory appeared even more likely as suddenly everything became very quiet. The lounge is a very noisy place, but at that moment all background noise suddenly receded. I could still hear everything, but it was like someone had just stuck ear-plugs in me. This was now the most terrifying experienced Id ever had, and wondered if I was going to die. I still tried to remain calm, but I wondered if people could tell I was this fucked-up, or if they cared.
