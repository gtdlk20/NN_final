The intro was followed by an in-game cinematic showing an intervention team entering a tomb in Al-Khali, the middle of desert. A location which was fought for by many great leaders but forgotten in our days. They discovered corpses dripping of blood in that place, still fresh, although they were the first to enter there in more than a decade (if not a century). They acted very soldier-like, spreading out and investigating the perimeter like it was the most unsurprising occurrence ever. Then they were attacked from all sides and met their horrifying end. After this followed a weird dream sequence came up and you are shown getting a phone call (in the middle of the night) and going to the airport.
