The whole trip was so exilerating! I felt the cold from outside, but it didn't matter...as if there was nothing out there that could possibly hurt me in any way. All the colours were so bright! It seemed that I was very controlled and actually had a conversation with her! At the store I fetched all the food and was very helpful (which she must have found weird because I rarely help with anything) and managed to get her to buy us a lasagna, 2 bags of chips, 3 chocolate bars, ice cream, pop and macaroni and cheese....
