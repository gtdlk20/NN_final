3:00 am: I awake yet again, and this time I am even more stoned then I was before. I open my eyes and look around my dark bedroom and Im a stranger in my own house, I am disoriented and confused, my body is so relaxed but at the same time its so tense, I have the worst case of cotton mouth ever. My head feels very heavy, like it weighed a thousand pounds, when I lift it my head simple returns to the pillow. I hear people walking up and down my hallway, but everyone in the house is asleep.  I decide to roll over and try to sleep this off. This is when I had the weirdest experience Ive ever had on marijuana.
