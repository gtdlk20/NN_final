We return to the back doors of the dorm, and go inside. We entered at the basement level, and had to go up 4 flights of stairs to get to my floor (3rd). I put a mint in my mouth, and we started going up. We got to the second floor and looked at the door, thinking it should say 3. Confusion ensued, but we were alright, and continued up to the next floor. Climbing this set of stairs seemed to take FOREVER. As I neared my floor, my mouth, while sucking on the mint, felt like it was floating around inside my head, sliding up and down and side to side.
