I got online and IMed Raz with a message that went something to the effect of, 'Let's get this bitch started.' He then told me to get my computer rounded up because he'd be there shortly. I quickly got off, unhooked it all, tossed it into my bag, and prepared to wash my face and bursh my teeth. I had not time for a shower, so I merely tossed on my hat and wore exactly what I had on the day prior. As I was getting ready I noticed all sorts of items lying around that pissed me off to all extents. Crazy fold over calendars containing biblical references and passages. Pictures that had been thrown in am obscure drawer for ages, toiletries in the bathroom that I did not know we posessed.
