I did not have the patience to wait for my friend, so I went up to the person I originally wanted to smoke with and told her I had to get the hell out of here.  We wandered around for a few moments, finally arriving at her house which was not too far away.  I felt the same slow-motion feeling I felt earlier, seeing more and more incoherent blobs of color as I walked. Thankfully her parents were not home, so we were allowed to relax a little bit.
