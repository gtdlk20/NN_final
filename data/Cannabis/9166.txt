As the day progressed the high got more and more intense. At a point I started to worry that this wasn't going to quit. I was really out of it, about 4-5 hours after first experiencing the buzz it was powerfully intense, continuing to increase, and I was having difficulty controlling some motor functions, stumbling and fumbling with things as if I was drunk. I was very paranoid that I was going to get caught by someone. Or that I would end up having to call in sick to work the next day because it would not subside. I decided to lay down and see if it would go away, I also rationalized to myself that being in bed would reduce the likelihood that I would get busted by these unknown 'people that bust you if you are high'. Hours later I awoke, I had to go to the bathroom, but was still feeling the effects. I went back to sleep.
