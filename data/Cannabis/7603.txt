I went through a number of physical reactions:  My mouth tightened into a closed O shape, and my hands came up to just below my chin, tingling as if with pins and needles.  The area around my solar plexus felt like it was pulsating with energy.  The experience lasted about ten or fifteen minutes.  Debra just sat on the bed watching this the whole time.  She told me afterwards that my face actually changed and I took on an 'old man' appearance.
