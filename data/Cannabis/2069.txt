All this shit had gone down. I was now lying, staring at the sky. My mind was a complete blank, all these things that just happend to me didn't matter. I felt as if I wasn't connected to my body. I thought for sure, this must be death. But it wasn't like thinking... It was more, that knew I was. It's a very hard sensation to describe. It felt timeless. And I wanted it to be.
