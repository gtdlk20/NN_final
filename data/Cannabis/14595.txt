Everyone was rather startled at that and this was the first time I told them just how high I really was.  Which then prompted my smirking friends to inform me that the shit I had just smoked was not regular schwag or even their regular KB connection.  It was a little bit of homegrown goodness which they called India Kush.  They told me that they usually only get their hands on it every couple of months or so and that they hadn't told me so that I would be surprised.  Hell, surprised is an understatement.  I was completely messed up!
