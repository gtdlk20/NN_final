We decided to walk to her neighborhood, and by now, we were both feeling the Dex. Movement felt interesting, so I was jumping around a lot, and just enjoying myself. We walked to her neighborhood, and we saw this group of little kids we knew in the street. They started running at us, and for a moment I kinda freaked because I didnt know what was up, and they asked us what we were doing. We explained the days activities thus far, and then we left the kids alone to do whatever they were doing.
