I was never really one for weed. I'd smoked it a couple times in high school and maybe I romanticized it too much in my head, because it never quite lived up to my expectations. I was not a fan of the taste, and I didn't find the effects to be worth it, so after a handful of times I never tried it again. Until last night.
