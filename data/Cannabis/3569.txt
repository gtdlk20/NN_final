I read up on cannabis legalization and product testing. California has tough standards for mold and pesticides, but lacks the testing facilities to enforce it immediately, so they gave dispensaries a 'free pass' to sell anything they have until July 2018. I found some dispensaries that claim to only sell mold and pesticide tested products, and made a list of which oil concentrate producers that publish test results or at least make strong testing claims, and which have been found contaminated.
