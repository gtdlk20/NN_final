I had always heard to never smoke weed from an Asian. And to that point, I hadn't. Even though I'm Asian myself, I never fit into that hoochie-ghetto-wigger kind very well and out of my group of friends, I'm really the only one who isn't white. But my brother is one of those gangster kind of Asians who only hang out with other gangstery Asians. I assumed the weed they brought was probably bleached or laced but I didn't think much of it. And besides, it had been a while since I had gotten high, so why not?
