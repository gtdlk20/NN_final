Trust me Catalano, this girls gonna be really high soon, she said.  I was upset that I wasnt feeling the effects; not because I deeply desired to get high at the time, but because I wanted Rayanne to be proud of me or something (I know, I know: stupid of me).  I lay down on Catalanos bed in mild disappointment, which is the bottom of a bunk bed, and waited for the effects.  All of a sudden, the ceiling, or rather the top bunk, which was a couple feet overhead, slightly turned into a nebulous stone path and quickly turned back.  I brushed it off as placebo effect.  Then, I narrowed my eyes a bit and became enthralled with my eyelashes.  They had little rainbows from the mixture of natural moisture and the light bulb shining on me.  Of course, eyelashes always look like this.  But all of a sudden, they sparked a childlike wonder in me and I watched as they swayed in beat with the music.  Okay, I thought, so my eyelashes have become kind of cool.  So what?
