I got to her room and worked for about a half an hour on her computer, fixing various problems and showing her how to get her e-mail on Outlook, and a few other things. Afterwards we went to the Improv show, which, being chock-full of absolutely perverse and disturbing humor, was ultimately very entertaining. Yada yada yada... so Carrie and I ended up, somehow, on M Street, sitting on a step outside a small, indoor shopping center of sorts (which was closed by then), at midnight, drinking coffee and talking about a multitude of incredibly random things that wove together quite nicely into what I'd call an amazingly cool conversation. We sat shoulder to shoulder, and there was a lot of the conversational sort of touching that just makes you feel good. And we walked back, and I said good night to her, and things were good.
