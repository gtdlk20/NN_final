My father finally decided to cultivate the plant, and so he ordered seeds. I have witnessed the cultivation from start to end. The little seed, which when put on wet cotton in a few days sprouts, the little plant with its little leaves, the larger plant and the flowering, harvesting, drying and curing. The plant itself is a typical herbaceous dicotyledon, with a main trunk, orderly branches and leaves. To a person that doesnt know plants well I think it wouldnt raise any suspicion. However, now that I have seen it, I can recognize it. Its palmate leaves and odor are distinctive. I cannot describe the smell exactly, but it is fragrant and somewhat like oregano. If it were completely legal it would be surely classified as a fragrant herb, besides oregano, rosemary or thyme. Another remarkable thing about the plant is its hardness and resistance of its stem and leaf. No wonder it makes one of the most durable fibers known, hemp.
