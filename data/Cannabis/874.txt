Entheogen use is all about set and setting to me. Man that's so important... I can't say I've ever had a really bad trip... I've been spooked on drugs but I've never been emotionally discomforted to the point of what most people term a 'bad trip.' What I have done though is wasted a lot of weed especially on nothing trips, the sad thing is that if I don't get any good vibes or any bad vibes what I'll get is no vibes at all... which means I won't really trigger my feelings into any action... what a waste of tetrahydrocannibol... what a goddamn waste.
