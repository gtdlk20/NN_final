ok, time to walk again walkingits hard to keep up a steady pace; Ill walk fast then slow, then fast again, then nearly stop Finally I approach my house, but right as I get to the front yard, my mom is backing out of the garage she says she is going to the store and asks if I want to come. I somehow mumble the words no thanks and go inside. I lock my door behind me and sit down at the computer
