I started coming down and I remembered who I was and that I was a teenager and I go to high school and things like that. I went down stairs and I watched T.V. It was now about 2 and a half hours since I smoked. I could pay attention now. I was still buzzed for another hour and a half. The whole high lasted 4 hours. The whole high lasted 4 hours. It was crazy.
