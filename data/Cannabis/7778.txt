It was a cool night. I was at home hanging with my friend. I took out my cuchhi pipe (a pipe given to me when I was fourteen by my Obi high priest) loaded it up and fired away. I closed my eye only to see a old world. I was in the my past. i saw things that carved me into how i am now. I saw a man dancing to the beat of the ketta drums. His head was wrapt in a red, white, and blue cloth. As the drummer played to movements of the sprits, the man dancing moved with more passion, more vigor, more life. 'Who is this man,' I asked myself. it was then i realized this man was me.
