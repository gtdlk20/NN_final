And then it was over.  And I was staring into a lifeless toilet bowl.  And my acute hearing was back.  And I could hear the dripping showerhead two stalls over.  I sat like that for a while.  And then I puked.  Oh god did I ever puke.  And then I dry heaved.  Oh god did I ever dry heave.  At some point Mike came in and started puking in the other stall.  And then Jim came in and asked us if we needed anything.  And then Jim came in again and asked me if I thought I could make it to bed without puking.  Somehow I did.  I pushed all the junk onto the floor and curled up on my bed.  Unconsciousness was mercifully quick.
