I woke up a few minutes later to find myself in the same state. I went downstairs to get something to eat. Somehow I managed to cook eggs and wrap them up in a burrito with cheese. I sat down to eat it and kept on seeing someone in the doorway out of the corner of my eye. I just ignored it. After taking a few bites the burrito started to taste real bad. I looked at it and the eggs were all liquidy and looked like some sort of mush. I spit it out on the plate and threw it away. Than ran up stairs into the same room, locked the door, and forced myself asleep.
