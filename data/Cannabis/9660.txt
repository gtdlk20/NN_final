+2:45 - I kill the music and try to get some sleep. The psychedelic effects are gone; clearly I'm coming down, though as high as I got that might take a while. I do fall asleep, but awake a few times during the night, each time still feeling rather intoxicated. I don't fully shake off the effects until the following morning, some eleven hours after taking the first dose.
