Anyway, this has been a thoroughly unique & facinating endevour today. It's been about 5 hours I'd say, since the effects were certainly established, until now where they remain steady but waning... I supect to be clear within two hours, tired & capable of sleep. There was probably more ergot in my morning toast today than on my blotter, & probably an awful lot less on my blotter than is in the average pint of beer. Er~giggly~ergoloids are just so supremely well tolerated in man, I'd be simply gobsmacked if there was a single unhealhty aspect to what I've spent my day doing, enjoying the sun with a smile on my face, a relaxed step & a very serious gleam in my eye!
