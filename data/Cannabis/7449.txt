I cleaned up and laid flat on my bed with my eyes closed, trying to ease my mind and get some rest for the day ahead. Before I knew it I was in a dream-like state, but I was conscious.  It was like my body was asleep but my mind was awake.  I found myself in a vast void, with visible ideas circling around me.  Then I heard a voice that seemed to echo over everything (I assigned him the name Buddha, although not until after the experience).  It seemed like somebody was talking to me, and while I remember carrying on a conversation with the voice, I cannot put into words what was said.  The voice then became dormant, and other smaller voices began to whisper all around simultaneously.  I questioned where I was and what was going on and almost instantly the echoing voice returned and told me that if I lost concentration, I would be forced to leave and never return.  I then questioned all of the whispers and was told that they were spirits who reached inner peace and this was where they resided (NO FUCKIN LIE!!!).  Then everything began to get distant until it faded away.  This is when I returned to the real world and looked at the clock to see that about 3 hours had passed and my high was gone (of course).
