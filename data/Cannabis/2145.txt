Ok I know Im rambling.  One last thought: wow.  Cant remember.  Oh yeah, SHIT I forgot again.  (Im not erasing all these random thoughts because..idk why- wait that doesnt make sense) oh yeah okay so, although it is terrifying, it something vital to spiritual vitality.  Another dimension!  Words, English, feel petty to me.  Ha, to think that these mere flourishes on paper could describe an experience like this?  Words feel silly and flat.  Incompatible with life.  Incompatible.  My thoughts are full and round and by recording only one little road of thought while others swirl and dip, mostly dead ends, around it in my brain.  These side roads are in directions and dimensions that the main road, these words, cannot conceive of.  I find it interesting the tradeoffs of smoking weed.  I become less coherent but at the same time, more lucid and more in the real world.  Realer than real.  My thoughts dont flow, they dont connect.  An eraser is chasing every thought that crosses my mind.  Im beating it.  But boy, those are some delicious words.  You could fucking eat them.  So yeah, for now the tradeoff is worth it.
