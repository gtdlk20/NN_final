I stayed on the couch in my mates room and watched AUSTAR. As I sat there I thought wow he talked up this hydro a bit, I think im gonna go and get a drink. But when I tried to move I was stuck to the couch. I shut my eyes to try and focus myself and thats when the rollercoaster experience started. I felt as if I was flying along in the rollercoaster, banking up turns, flying down hills, slowing to go up slopes and I must admit I was really enjoying myself. This continued for about half an hour until I reopened my eyes. I had a cigarette after my body could move again. My mate came in from whatever he was doing  and I told him about what had just happened.
