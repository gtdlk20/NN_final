For about 10 minutes, as I layed there on the couch staring up at the ceiling, I actually grasped what 'infinite' actually meant.  An infinite number of stars and life forms all of a sudden shot through my head.  Infinite possibilities of absolutely everything.  Everything existed at once, and forever.. infinately.  If our own universe has a boundary, there must be others beyond it.  There has to be.  It was an intuitive knowing because I FELT IT.  I felt like I finally understood.  I kept repeating to myself softly 'so this is what infinite means'.
