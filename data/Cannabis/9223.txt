I felt like I had no control over any of my ligaments. My toes, fingers, arms...everything just felt like it was twitching out of control.  I thought that's how a seizure must feel. I got into a fetal position again and let the twitching run its course.  My heart was beating out of my chest.  My dry mouth was so bad I couldn't stop swallowing.  I thought I was destined to choke to death.
