For all of you who read this and think, 'cool', its was everything BUT cool. It scared the hell out of me. The whole time I had this overwhelming fear similar to the fear you get when on acid. On top of that, the stomach pains through the whole experience were terrible. And the friend who I was supposed to be sitting for, freaked out that night and went running naked through the neighborhood looking for his 'necklaces'.(it still amazes me that he could walk with no problems) But I hope this report helps those of you out there who think that there is no such thing as 'one hit shit', cuz there is, and this was by far, the most intense experience I've ever had with cannabis.
