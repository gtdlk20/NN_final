9:00 My boyfriend told me he was leaving work. I got very scared. Not for me but for him. I didn't want him to see me like this. I didn't know why but I had an overwhelming concern for him. I loved him with all my heart and I would do anything for him. Our fighting was my fault. Little things didn't matter anymore as long as we were together.
