To find the right way and walking itself were that hard that a short distance seemed to be like a long travel - the same with the time.By the time that I realized that 10 minutes really didn't pass by I got in panic and I was like: 'Does it ever stop again and all will it be okay? Maybe the drug dealer used some LSD on the grass and I will get mad...'
