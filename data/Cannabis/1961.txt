After a few attempts at ignoring the image, I began falling into it. Reality was falling. And as I did, I realized the image was made up of billions, trillions of smaller versions of that image put together in different layers of reality. (Crazy, right?) I felt like I was going to die, that I was going to snap out of this reality and transfer into another one. I was falling, for layers, and layers and it wouldn't stop. I was falling, for layers, and layers and it wouldn't stop. That was the most terrifying part of the trip. I couldn't stop the falling no matter how much I tried. Reality always ended up separating and I was falling into a black pit.
