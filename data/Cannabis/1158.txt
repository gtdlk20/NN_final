Looking back I notice that the marijuana made my brain stupid. I couldnt do anything without focusing, and I felt like a 7-year old. I seemed 3` 6`` and I distinctly remember smelling and feeling stimuli that I hadnt felt since I was quite young. Everything felt and looked much larger than it was. Im taller than both my parents, but I looked and felt much smaller.
