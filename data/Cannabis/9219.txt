I saw the brightness of the T.V and felt as though that might snap me out of my horrible consciousness.  Matt got up and followed me.  I started walking in circles. I thought I was now a ghost of my former self now floating.  I was convinced I had died.  He had a big love seat in front of this huge TV so I figured I should be able to rest better on top of it.  I lay down in my fetal position again and started stroking the love seat. I felt its softness and it helped me realize I would be back on 'normal' earth as soon as this trip was over.  The TV made me even more nauseous. The TV made me even more nauseous.
