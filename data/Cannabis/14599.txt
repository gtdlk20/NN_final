At this point, I was actually experiencing auditory hallucinations.  Peter Gabriel's voice seemed very commanding, very powerful.   The actual music would fade and warble in and out of focus, but his voice and the lyrics were locked in the forefront of my brain.  I felt like I was experiencing the music, feeling each note in my soul.  I wanted to laugh, wanted to cry, to scream and shout.  All I could do was sit with my eyes closed and listen.  About halfway through the song, I felt like I suddenly had a revelation.  It was as if God or some higher being had chosen to impart upon me a truth, and that truth was that 'In Your Eyes' is not a cheesy love song as it is often portrayed.  It is a song about god.  It is a song about religion.  Peter Gabriel wasn't singing to a woman, he was singing to GOD!
