While Suzy was talking to Debra about some traumatic experience shed just been through, I felt myself connecting with her in a way Id never experienced before.  I realised that I knew exactly what she was talking about.  It wasnt that I could read her mind, it felt more like I was her mind!  The words she was using to describe her experiences were also describing my experiences too.  Her observation of life and her attitude were somehow also me.  It took me a while to get used to this bizarre perception, but the moment I started feeling comfortable with it, it changed into something else.  I began communicating with her using only my mind; it happened completely spontaneously, but it was totally unlike any form of mental communication Id ever heard about.  As I asked her things, the words she was using to reply to Debras questions, which were of course totally different, would somehow answer my questions too!  It felt really weird, yet at the same time perfectly normal.
