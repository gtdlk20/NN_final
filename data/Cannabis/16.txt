Now, this is all well and good, but one evening, after watching aforementioned Wonderland Experience, a disturbing situation arose.  We had had a few shotties and I was feeling contentedly high.  I sort of remember the beginning and the end of the film, but have very little recollection of what went on in-between.  It is likely that I had a bit of a trip into my sub (or sub-sub) conscious during this time, and came back to reality after that.
