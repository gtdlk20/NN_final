I really dont know what happened to me on anight of Friday.  It could have been anything from an adverse reaction to a large amount of THC to a full on trip caused by a completely different substance.  In any case, it was an experience I wont soon forget.  This is the 90% unabridged account of what happened next (at least the 90% unabridged account of what I can remember).  The other 10% I doubt I will ever tell to anyone.  Those are some very personal insights that I think Ill leave for myself to ponder.
