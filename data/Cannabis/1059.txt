My panic-inducing cyclical thoughts, I decided, could only be combated by me constantly talking.  I spoke in a loud voice, but every time I began to speak, my words sounded corny, like I was in a movie and my words were going along with the music.  This scared the hell out of me.  It sounded like someone had written a rather cloying score of music to perfectly coincide with my voice.  I feared that Catalano and Rayanne would find me ridiculously corny, so I stopped talking, then realized that I had to talk to keep time going (or else Id get stuck in an infinite loop of time).  I went on and off like this until I had Catalano turn the music off.  Now, to keep the rhythm going and crawl out of the hole of eternity, I decided that Catalano and I had to communicate through typing on Microsoft word.  All the while I was shaking madly and swearing uncontrollably, all of my thoughts and sentences strung together with fucking and shit.  In the back of my mind I knew that my state was silly and that Catalano and Rayanne were probably weirded out or amused.  They, in contrast to me, were feeling lazily stoned.
