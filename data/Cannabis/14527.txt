This was the second time I tried Salvia, the first being two days earlier. I am a member of the now defunct Church of the Tree of Life, and had obtained a live specimen back in 1979, and it must have been good stuff, as my two cats scaled several bookshelves in order to attack & devoured it (they were fond of fresh cannabis also). I had also experimented with coleus several times with no noticeable results.
