At first, the usual 'screen' (kind of like a bugged TV screen with lots of colors blinking) I saw during daily life got stronger, and eventually the screen turned into an image. There was something odd about this image that I quite couldn't put my finger on. I decided to ignore it and watch some cartoons, but the image could be seen anywhere. It was blocking my vision. The image sort of looked like a circle inside a square inside another circle, and it had infinite colors and went onto infinity. The circle and the squares were wearing colorful hat-like structures.
