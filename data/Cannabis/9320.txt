6:30 I texted my boyfriend that I'd taken a couple and because he knew I wasn't a heavy user, he called to check on me. I told him I felt nothing. He said usually 2 or 3 would do it for him and if he finished a pack, he would be asleep. I figured if the worst that happened was I fell asleep, it didn't hurt to take a few more.
