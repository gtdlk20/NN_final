My experience occured about a year and a half ago, when I was 14 and heavily into drinking and smoking marijuana. . .I was in the middle of a football camp week, and that night I had a few friends over. We were basically bored, until one of my other friends called my up and asked if I wanted to go smoke some weed, and threw out there that he had some dust, so I happily agreed. We walked our asses about a mile to some bridge in the woods next to a lake.
