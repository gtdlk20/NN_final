When I first began to trip on the candy I took every opportunity to go pee and try and clear my head.  I kept wondering that if we had knowingly and willingly induced this state of mind that was euphoric and fearsome at the same time, then why did the mind seem to constantly try to reassert itself to its standard frame of awareness?  I remember thinking at the time that these could not be higher states of consciousness then, but lower, more primal states.  After a good many other trips and conversations with mushrooms later on, I changed my mind.  I think what we experienced that night on our initiation was resistance.  We go after an experience sometimes with a preconceived notion of what we will receive, when the truth is, we can only accept what we are given and transform it into what we needed all the long.
