In conclusion, this was clearly a good experience.  Although stronger than I would usually prefer, I know I probably would not have had such a deep spiritual eruption with a smaller dose.  I believe I ate close to a gram that day, if you include the batter I had beforehand.  I have made brownies since, but prefer to eat somewhat less, especially in a social situation.  If I had a free day however, I would not rule out taking a very strong dose and seeing where it takes me.
