We slept in the car toward the end of the evening.  Sleep was fitful, and when we did leave the next morning we were not entirely clear of the effects.  My attention drifted on the ride home.  Once, we came to wonder how we had arrived on the top of some grassy hill, and had to turn around and find our foggy way back.  Even after a nights sleep I was still foggy from the experience.  I worked at night and sometime around six in the morning I knew I was clear.  That would make the total run time about thirty-one hours of various states of altered consciousness, with the core intensity about six or seven hours.
