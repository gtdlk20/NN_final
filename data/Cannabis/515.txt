Once there, I glad that I would be able to just sit and enjoy the high. My girlfriend (P) works at restaurant that is never busy, and all of the employees are cool as hell so I knew I would be able to chill there until she got off work. She started some food for me, and A and I talked for a while before he had some friends come pick him up. I said farewell and went inside to eat my food. The taste was magnificent, and it felt like my whole body feeling it. When I swallowed, I could feel the warmth go down my throat and into my esophagus. With each bite, my chest felt warmer and warmer until it literally felt orgasmic. At this point I realized that I was higher than I had ever been. I began to feel very guilty about driving, because I felt that I had put myself, A, and everyone else on the road at risk. I told my girlfriend this and swore to her never to drive impaired again. We talked for a while and I smoked a cigarette (which seemed to take hours to smoke). After this, I decided to listen to my iPod until she got off, because I was still in no condition to drive.
