So I looked at my friend and asked him if I had Red Eye in the left part of my left eye.  He said he couldn't see any Red Eye or anything abnormal, I even asked him to look again, he still said there was nothing.  I probably did have slight paranoia, probably caused by my over active imagination.  I reckon that this was the first very mild 'trip' of 4 I had on that day.
