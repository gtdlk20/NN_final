After a solid five years of one personal or family tragedy after another, I suppose I had been counting on S to be my better tomorrow. I was finally pushed over the edge when that tomorrow never came, and the emotions I had held back in regards to the aforementioned tragedies came crashing down all at once. I had begun a summer semester of college, and I had entered a period of intense depression that I had never experienced. I continued trying to go to church, but it was hopeless. Every time I went, I was on the verge of exploding, so I stopped.
