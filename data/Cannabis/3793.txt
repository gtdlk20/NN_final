12:30 PM (T+01:30)- I was fucking stoned. I can't properly describe in words how high I was. I sat on the beach, watching the waves,  the sky, and the entire universe of motion before me. My world was alive. Distantly, I noticed that my cousin was playing with my dog, throwing a stick the size of my leg into the water for her. She was a large, intimidating animal. I left reality again, zoning out for ten minutes or so.
