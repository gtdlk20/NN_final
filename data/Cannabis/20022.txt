As it was now the night, dark and cold, I worried that it would stay this way. If we continue to harm the planet, it would be nothing but a dark and cold hell. Perhaps our destructive tendencies could even result in the sun itself ending prematurely. Everything seemed to connect, and that day I developed an even greater respect for the environment and nature than I already had. The following morning was perhaps the greatest part, for to my relief the sun had not been eaten.
