After I had the Neurone visuals I moved to a much more meaningful hallucination.  This hallucination seemed to be in the middle of my field of vision (but again it didn't dominate, I could still look at the other surrounding on the actual train).  The hallucination started with one 'visual thought' ... this visual thought then spread outwards in all directions into other visual thoughts which then spread out again... and again... and again... etc.  I started to realise that these individual thoughts seemed to go up in 'importance' (for instance the first thought would be 'Does this shirt look good?' and then it would finally progress into 'What am I?' and 'Whats the Meaning of life' and 'Whats the purpose of all this, is there a God?' and 'What is reality?').  There always seemed to be more and more questions sometimes all of the questions linked up into one major question like: Is there a God? But then even this question divided up into other Visual thoughts. It would sometimes expand very quickly, and sometimes these visual thoughts would make some quite pretty patterns, usually it would go in time with the music.
