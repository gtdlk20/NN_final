So settling into our cozy spots, the two of us began to light and pass the bowl around, and it was strong, flavor-filled chronic, and we were pleased to feel the warmth fill us, and it wasn't long before we started to feel the effects. However, maybe due to the atmosphere, the warm night that surrounded us, the pleasant feelings all around, we didn't just feel lacadaisical, funny, forgetful... all of that stage seemed to pass by in seconds, and suddenly we were both thrust into a dream-like world of colors, and we began to talk about it. The world around us was no longer so easily conceptualized and interpreted as a forest with a fence with trees and a sky... it was a fractal-like pattern of colors that our brain saw in front of us; it was a beautiful flowing picture we could touch that filled the entirety of our vision. Looking up at the sky, the leaves and hazy blue of the sky swayed and flowed, and suddenly you were seeing the entire world in the reflection of an enormous lake. Small ripples expanded into large ones, which you could feel and smell and taste and know. Looking back down at the ground, we were both mesmerized and made unable to move by the world around us, which danced and sang like so much art, and suddenly I saw it all.
