My direct comprehension of concepts/phenomenon was always in a visual form. However, the edges/margins of the visual were always hazy. I felt that I was getting a mere key-hole experience/revelation. As if I was peeping through a hole in a doorway, and the doorway led to a beautiful mansion with multiple rooms and stories. Christians saints and Sufis have often mentioned various stages/growth in spirituality and in order to reach the highest step of the ladder one has to be ready - purge/cleanse one's lower self. Perhaps the reason why a lot of people who take Cannabis do not get a spiritual experience could be because their intentions are not proper or strong enough, as mentioned in one of my earlier posts and secondly because their lower self has not been cleansed of ignorance. Esoteric literature from all over the world give you various ways and techniques to cleanse your lower self.
