I then had it in my mind, that I would never become this. Scurrying around, cleaning things, throwing up items that would hopefully give others a false impression of myself (be it one I hoped to obtain). This simply would never be me. I then had it set in my mind that if my dad told me to either clean up my room or possibly take the Grateful Dead sign from my door, I would begin a speech that would rival that of the Gettysburg Address. A monolouge so compelling it could be contained in a coming-of-age movie staring Colin Hanks or Josh Hartnett. I had it all planned out in my head, the entire scenario, it was so rivveting I actually began to hope he would request these things of me simply so I could give this performance. My mind was reeling: 'Dad...I'm not going to do such things. I'm not going to run around the house picking up every magazine and shoe so it appears that we live a way we do not. I'm not cleaning my room or taking the sign off my door. That's who I am. Most of your other friends know who I am...to varying degrees. I'm not going to hide myself in a lie that will hopefully please your co-worker and his wife. If they don't like that my room is dirty, tell them to close the door.
