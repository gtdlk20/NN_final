This was a very good experience over all, though I put many details in it, there were some very profound changes my consciousness underwent after and during the experience. It opened a new perspective for me. Now, without pot or drugs I access these states easily, and I meditate quite a bit. I don't smoke pot because I find, while I learn from the experience, I only do the big learning once, the rest is all details, as well, I can only focus on pot itself as the controller while on it, not myself as the guide of my existence.
