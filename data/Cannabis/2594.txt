The party was a really chill sort of event. None of the people were party smokers, they were artists. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was a lack of pipes, bongs, joints any of that stuff. I was thinking 'What are we to smoke with?'. Well, Mario had brought this heavy, electric cone which was a volcano vaporizer. I had never used a vaporizer, and thus didn't know anything about them. When he packed the first chamber and filled the bag, I thought that this was some kind of joke. When I took my first hit, all I could think about was a memory from when I was a kid, and I hung out in the grocery store getting stoned off the nitrous in easy cheese cans.
