This was unlike anything before. I began to realise that I was alone in the middle of this intense high and began to worry a little bit. After this experience I found that this particular weed comes on relatively slowly compared to others. It took a good 25 minutes for the full high to come on. I started to stress about what I had done and more importantly where I was going. My thoughts were muddled and confused. I found this experience drew parallels with the come up of MDMA of which I had used for the first time on new years eve 2 weeks previous. As the high took hold, for no apparent reason I began feeling very, very uncomfortable with my surroundings and went to my room. I got to my doorway when I started watching TV to direct my attention away from the strange things going on in my head.
