It started on a Thursday night at a friends who I had agreed to sit for while he took a pretty high dose of DXM and Dramamine tablets (somewhere around 700mg DXM and 20 tablets of Dramamine). Well about two hours after taking the combination he wanted to go across the street to a friends and chill with some people. To my surprise he could actually walk without any problems whatsoever. Anyways, when we got over to A's house, there were 5 other friends over and they were all passing around a blunt and about to pack a bowl. They asked me if I wanted to smoke a bowl, so I agreed and went to sit down with them. I was the first to hit the bong, and I didn't want to get really high so I only took 1 hit. 'Only 1 hit, what could that do?', I mistakenly thought and later found out. Close to 10 minutes after my hit, I was feeling it come on pretty fast, thought it wasn't the usual cannabis high, it had a *weird* vibe to it.
