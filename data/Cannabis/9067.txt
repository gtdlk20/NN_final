I felt somewhat unbalanced and was being pulled towards one direction. People were talking but no words were being processed, and I really couldn't say much besides 'I am really high.' I could hear my heartbeat as if it was a drum playing in my ear, my actions seemed to coincide with the rhythm of my heartbeat. I also had a mild headache.
