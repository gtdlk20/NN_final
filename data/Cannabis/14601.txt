This notion came to me in a very profound way.  It was not a hunch, or a theory.  I somehow knew that it was a truth.  And no matter how trivial that truth seems now, at the time it was earth shattering.  I felt as if I had somehow cracked open the fabric of the universe to steal this vision.  It filled me with an overwhelming joy that lasted long after the song was over.  I don't even remember what else played on the radio the rest of the way to the park.  Hell, I don't even really remember much about the rest of the car trip or the hike itself, but I clearly remember that Peter Gabriel song and the way it made me feel.  Absolutely incredible.
