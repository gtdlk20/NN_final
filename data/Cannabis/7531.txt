For approx. 4-5 weeks (I truly did lose track) I ate daily a moderate to strong dose of hash; it varied.  When the high wore off I'd smoke a little, usually one or two bong-bowls, to boost me up until I fell asleep. I'm currently on my summer holiday after working my balls off through exams.  Therefore, I'd NO commitments of any kind to worry about, and the household is a loving one fully accepting of drug experimentation.
