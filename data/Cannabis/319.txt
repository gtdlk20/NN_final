While K was off walking around and playing guitar within 20 ft. of us, me, S and J were lying on the futon, looking up at the stars. These weren't city stars like you see from downtown; this was out in the middle of the woods-type stars. When I focused on the brightest one, all the other ones would start to connect and take on the form of metal jacks, spiraling towards the center of the universe, which was the star I was looking at.
