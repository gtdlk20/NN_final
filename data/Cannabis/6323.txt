I looked at the controller on the floor and from that to the desk, then to the TV, then the clock on the TV, then to the ceiling, and when I did that my head would 'overload' and I would trip out for a second and my head would go back to the beginning. I found that if I did that multiple times in a row quickly I could get my head majorly overloaded.  It wasn't a bad thing, just weird.  Kind of like I was dizzy, but not being at a disadvantage.  I wondered if the people in the room noticed my head rolling all over the place, but no one said anything, so I assumed they didn't.  Time seemed to be going by very very slow.
