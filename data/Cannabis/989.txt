T+ 01.50  My kids come in from school  I orient my mind & begin giving standard instructions such as uniform in the wash  take the dogs out  put your bait box in the sink for washing  do any homework you have. My vision is becoming noticeably blurred as the second dose kicks in. Brief CEVs of women  very realistic - like flash frames.
