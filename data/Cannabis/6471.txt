I began to get high while the pipes were still going around. By the time the last hit was taken from Alice, the sherlock, all five of us had entered a different state of mind brought on by this beautiful green plant. Everyone had been good about passing the pipe after taking a hit, and this calmed me - I don't like people who hold the pipe while exhaling the smoke, as their purpose is usually to draw attention to themselves.
