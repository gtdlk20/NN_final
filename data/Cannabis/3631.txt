At this point it was getting dark.  I laid on the floor while everyone played music and closed my eyes.  I felt as though my body was spinning around and flying down some immense tunnel.  I had had this feeling every now and then as I lay in bed before I had ever even considered smoking pot, but it was greatly accentuated by the marijuana.  If I concentrated, I could see what I would describe as 'faint closed eye visuals.'  I was able to picture all sorts of strange things in my minds eye so vividly that I almost saw them.  Mainly psychedelic patterns that I had seen on posters, but also strange works of art and sculpture.
