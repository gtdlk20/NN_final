I think I closed my eyes, I dont remember, just everything went very dark. I panicked everything went very dark. I panicked. The whole world had faded away and I didnÂ´t know what happened. I started to think of the reasons why this happened. First I thought I died and I felt bad for my parents. Second I thought maybe I became crazy and I wasnt aware of reality but I was truly institutionalised and I felt even worse. Then I started to feel like I was floating. I was floating in the dark and I couldnt feel my body. I was sure suddenly, the world had ended. Like it had exploded with some asteroid and that it happened so quickly that anyone had time to be aware of its own death. This certainty made me angry, bexause I was still conscious, and I'm not religious. To be aware after dying wasnt something I was expecting, and I felt annoyed by it.
