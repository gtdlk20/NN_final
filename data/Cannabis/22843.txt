After a while I got up and my friend left. I went to my bedroom, and stared at a car poster with glowing headlights--this intrigued me for at least 5 minutes, and I was able to see things in the glowing headlights. Then I closed my eyes and saw shapes and colors again, except I could control them and make them do what I wanted.
