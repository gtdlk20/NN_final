13:15 this may sound strange, & I am proudly naive to opiates, but I'm feeling a vague, distant & familiar sense of codiene-like contentedness. Still not alot in the psychedelic department. Due to my extreme financial hardship & the fact that I only got three of these, I suspect I may have to call it after this latest half, for fear of not having a chance to share an adequate dose with my gf in the near future. I'd also like to give tolerance a longer opportunity to set in, as it's only been 7 days since we enjoyed a park/pizza trip on Al-Lad, Friday before last. My first session on Al came less than 7 days after a weekend on psychedelic Phenethylamines & after a 10 day break I noticed an obvious, general increase in effects from the Al.
