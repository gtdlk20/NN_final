I watched as we walked up the street gnomes appear and dance around, singing songs that would later become the ambiance for life. The strange things about these gnomes is that they were never directly visible; I could only see them in my peripheral vision, which seemed to extend to almost the dead center of the back of my head. As we continued walking, I was amazed watching the trees and bushes near by as they had the same dragons etc. that always populate them; and I enjoyed getting into conversations with them in my head.
