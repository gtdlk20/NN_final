As we walked along, the gnomes and creatures in the trees all the while keeping me company, I glanced over at my friend. All the colours on his body seemed to merge into one big puddle of colour; I can't really describe it. Everything was properly coloured, but it was also the same colours as everything else. The street, the trees, the light etc. I started to space out watching him, and then I heard the sound of a car.
