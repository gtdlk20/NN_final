After the joint was done, Jessica and Mark got into kayaks and paddled out to a floating dock in the middle of the pond. I waded into the water, but refused to swim out to the dock because I seemed to be afraid to be able to touch the bottom. For what seemed like a long time, I stood ankle-deep in the water, stepping forward then backward again, trying to decide whether to go back or to swim into the water. When I realized what I was doing, I started to laugh at myself. Somehow, I finally swam out to the dock and sat with Jessica.
