I hauled everything inside, found a note saying my parents were gone out to eat, then I noticed my hand was all inked up. I searched my pocket and found out a pen had busted. I now had ink on everything in my pocket, including my hand. I don't know what it could mean, but I thin I'm owed some fucking Karma for this fourth of July.
