I sat in my back yard, chewing gum and watching the sun set. It was incredably beautiful. All the colors and shapes seemed to dance in the sky, just for me. I felt deeply awed and honored to be able to see this sunset. I sat and thought about myself and my life, and their directions. I learned some pretty deep stuff about myself that evening. For example, I found that by unintentionally acting like an asshole for most of my youth, I had hurt some people pretty badly, and had really been a major source of bad vibes. Others did not hurt me, I only hurt myself.
