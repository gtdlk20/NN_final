I consider myself fairly educated in cannabis and so was somewhat caught off guard by this event.  Two weeks ago, I and four other close friends decided we would spend a Friday testing the limits of cannabis and its potency.  At about 9:30pm we decided we would blaze. We each had a dub.  I smoked a full dub, and after about 10 minutes began to feel my body warming up. My knees became very loose and I soon had to watch my step because controlling the amount my knees bent was becoming very difficult.  As we headed back to the car I became aware of a very intense full body feeling, my knees were now just like Jell-O, and my fingertips felt as though hundreds of tiny hands were slowly pulling them.
