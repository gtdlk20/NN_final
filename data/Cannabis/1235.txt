John asks if I'm okay, but I don't respond--there's no need to, no hurry, no care. He repeats himself, and Benny backs him up, but I lift a finger to signal that I heard them, I was just getting my bearings back. There was a dampness just below my eyes and I wiped at it, amazed that I had cried without noticing it. But when I look over my shoulder, that dread comes back full force as I realize we haven't even left the gas station yet. What felt like eternity was really only a few minutes. My brain can't take the conflicting logics and with a prominent 'Oh, fuck' I crash back down to the seat to wait out the rest of the ride to John's house--there is no way I'm going home state I'm in.
