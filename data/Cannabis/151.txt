Typing is getting a bit weird. My fingers and me have become sort of separated - separated in time more than in a physical sense. I can think of something and just see my fingers typing along without me telling them what to do. This of course also happens normally, when I am not affected by this drug, but now it is just a lot more obvious. I can easily see my fingers although my gaze is fixed at the screen. It is quite useful actually, that I am able to see all the keys and the screen at the same time. God, those fingers are moving fast and make a fun little dance on the keyboard! I can't help laughing at that.
