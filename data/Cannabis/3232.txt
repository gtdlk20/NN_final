Ok, let me begin this by stating that I consider myself to be fairly well educated and experianced in the underground world of illegal drugs and substances. I haved tried many different kinds of drugs in my late teens which include weed, shrooms, acid, crank, crystal meth, cocaine, extasy, special k, opium, dxm (triple c), and various other drugs that I cannot recall at the moment, an unwanted side effect of such drug usage one would assume. I have tried all of these drugs at LEAST twice, some more often than others. I view myself as a veteran of sorts when it comes to weed. I've smoked many different types of bud before so I can safely say that smoking weed for me is about the same as smoking a ciggarette, just with a bigger and better high or buzz if you will. Ok so anyways enough about me, on to the story.
