This is my first full experience with cannabis ever, and the first substantial experience with any psychoactive. But first I should make an intro about myself. I am 24 years old, male, just finished university and currently I havent anything to do. I havent met drugs a lot in my life. Probably it is the connections one has. My circle for example doesnt do cannabis much let alone any other drug, or so I thought until recently.
