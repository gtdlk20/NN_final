When the guy's dealer got shot, and he got busted by the police, one thing went through my mind. If these drugs weren't illegal, then the black market would have never been created, meaning that the dealer would have never been shot, nor would he even be selling drugs because it isn't profitable. Making a substance illegal only creates a black market for that substance and makes it more dangerous for people to obtain it.
