I came to realize later on that the robot was nothing merely other then the large jumble of voices eating their lunch and enjoying their life.... that made me happy to see that other people were enjoying their day also.  I was coming down from my high by the time we were leaving the mall, however that didn't stop Russ, Scott , and I from enjoying a laughing fit in the car so hard it made my chest hurt.
