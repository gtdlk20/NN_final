9:20 I feel like I've been waiting for him for an eternity. I call him and he says he decided to stay somewhere else that night. Because I was so fucked up and we'd been fighting, maybe we just needed time apart. I couldn't stand the thought. I pleaded with him to come home. I didn't even want to be near him, I just wanted to know that he was in the other room. Finally he did come home. He was upset and didn't want to believe I hadn't taken anything besides the weed. He says we had an argument after that, but for better or worse I don't remember it. I fell into a semi-sleep. I was extremely tired and sedated but I never felt truly asleep.
