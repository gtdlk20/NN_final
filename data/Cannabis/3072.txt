This experience is more or less how I came to grasp the true strength and power that weed has. Before this particular session I felt I had only really scratched the surface of the true potential of this wonderful plant, and had only really felt just above threshold feelings. This was probably one of the reasons I went above and beyond the amount I would usually smoke.
