Anyway, about 20 minutes into the class we all had to make a family tree to show our ancestry (I don't see why we did this, because we were all 14 years old and should be learning more about God than our family history, which I kept thinking while I was high) and all I managed to do was draw a line with my name on it. The class was really talkative today and the teacher was sort-of out of it, so we could all talk as we pleased.
