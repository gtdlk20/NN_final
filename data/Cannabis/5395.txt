When it comes to hallucinating, on weed, it's not that I see different colors, or different things. I just get different sensations about what I see. Like for instance. When I'm really blazed lately, it feels kind of like everything is huge. Like the distance from my head to the screen is across a football field. It just kind of feels that way, like I'm a small guy inside my eyes looking out. It's better when it's dark.
