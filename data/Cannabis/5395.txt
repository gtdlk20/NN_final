I was a little amused at his excitement but I figured it was a good thing. That night I watched eagerly as Zim showed me how to roll joints. He wasn't very good at it back then but I was sure impressed. It was a warm September night but not warm enough to go without jackets. We walked for a while before we decided to smoke, the air was crisp and clean and the streets were empty. The light pollution was at minimum that night so we walked under a rarely seen ceiling of stars. I can remember going through smoking the joint in my head over and over. I remember thinking about taking it in my hands and how I would hold it, then lifting it to my lips slowly and taking a long pull and breathing it out like an actor in a movie would if he was playing a gangster. I was nervous but I wouldn't back down, this was something I felt I needed to do. I believe in experiencing life at it's fullest and I was sick of missing out.
