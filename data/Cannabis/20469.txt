You know when you over-focus your eyes and everything gets blurry?  Well that's what happend, but it was constantly.  I just sat there and watched TV.  I didn't blink.  That's not even the beginning of the story though.  I got home at around 12midnight (my mom picked me up).  The next morning I had to get up at 6:30 to go to Hershey Park with my friend, Jamie.  Even though the high was pretty much gone, I still didn't feel 'myself'.
