I sat in my room waiting for my friends to come over with some Wendy's and I was listening to music. As I was listening to the music I began to drift off in a semi concious dream. My mind began to become very clairvoyant to the meaning of the music that I was listening to. I started to think of dreams that i had once when I was a little kid. As quickly as they came to me they would leave and I couldnt remember them. I soon became aware of the music that I was listening to and it took shape in my mind. The music was rather techno so I began to think about all the electrical instruments that were required to make it. In my mind I started flowing through these wires to the tune of the music.
