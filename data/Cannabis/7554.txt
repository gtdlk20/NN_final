These glittering interceptions of fact and prediction are building blocks of the nation of Mind, populated with a myriad known collectively as 'I'.  A myriad that will take fingers of delicate glass and make with them great Temples at which to worship and sacrifice.  These shall be called Logic, these shall be called Fact and Truth and Death.  At their alters are the Kneeling Sheep, whose knees score black with the filth we are forced to dredge up from their foundations of such monuments.  But, sheep, being as they are, will eventually cast out the darker of their lot; and my eye was on one such wayward 'I' as the minutes trampled by fast enough for that final moment to wonder what its friends were doing up round its ears.  It had left the sanctity of its flock, for no longer were they holy in its blank, starring eyes.  A tiny corner, shallower than the rest and glowing with the eerie light of uncertainty, was where it spent my moments, chip-chip chipping away gradually at the ground beneath its feet, then stomping with an impertinence I never could control.  Until, eventually, as I stood upon the last remaining fragments of a well constructed argument, I saw what lay beyond premise and predicate.  It is completely ineffable, because it constitution is not that of our Towers, our Temples, or even the Clouds and their radiant benevolence.
