Chewing food becomes a minor challenge. A snickers bar becomes a very thick goo immediately which is hard to chew. When I swallow it I can trace its way all the way down through by throat to the stomach! It makes eating a bit uncomfortable - I feel the food might stop any time on it is way to my stomach, choking me. But of course it doesn't.
