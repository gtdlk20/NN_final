Me being the noob, my C suggested half-jokingly that I should take the first hit. I agreed, wanting to be higher than I was, and also very curious. My mindset as I agreed to take this hit was a little dubious, since I had tripped before, and was just an unsuspecting noob, and hadnt liked it one bit. But I just told myself to buck-up, mind-over-matter, Im as sober as I think I am, I then took one long exhale, and sucked up all the smoke. I had only just learned this technique, and also to hold it in as long as possible, which I found surprisingly easy as this smoke was incredibly smooth and cool. I exhaled out the window, very pleased.
