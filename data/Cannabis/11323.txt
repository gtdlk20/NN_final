I returned home - I can't remember the details of how - and layed down.  I was suffering from visual impairment.  I began listening on my discman to URB vol. 1.  Strangely the only track I could listen to was Goldie's Innercity.  I attempted to listen to some of the others but was forced to return to Goldie.  The music sounded different; I could hear sounds I hadn't recoginized before.  The singer's voice had me hypnotized.  This was a euphoric feeling.  I had lost my anxiety over the strange new feeling and was now at ease enjoying the sound.  Remembering a friend's story of how opium helped him have intense sex for hours, I decided to masturbate.  When I finally ejaculated the feeling was too intense.  My body reacted as having experienced an attempted resuscitation with shock pads.  I felt my consciousness hover above where I was laying. Then I was enveloped by a black hole.  Everything darken and I felt asleep, yet fully conscious.  Throughout this experience I believed I might have been dying.  I did not fight, just passively accepted.  Suddenly I awoke and had reason to believe that only 10 minutes had passed.
