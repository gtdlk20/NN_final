At the end of the hall I sat on a bench and decided to lay on my back. A few minutes passed when an RA came by and saw me. I would normally have freaked out, but this particular RA was a notorious stoner, and I had even sold him some weed once. I was laying there looking at him, all of the bizarre cerebral things were gone. I was coming down, but still pretty stoned. I looked at him, waiting for him to speak. He then said 'Are you blazed?' to which I replied in a sarcastic tone 'Nooooo...' he asked 'Who'd you smoked with.' I told him the truth, and it couldn't have sounded more ridiculous 'Mario'. He laughed at that, he was thinking Super Mario, the iconic video game character. This threw me through a loop, I felt like a bad dog for no reason. I had actually smoked with a guy named Mario, and I could in no way express it without sounding baked. I had down right limed my own feathers to paraphrase Chaucer. I then went to bed dejected. I had no dreams, but I felt like I was in bed for forever, and that the sun had exploded or something because the night was days long.
