We made it into the mall, neither one of us could stop smiling.  We were walking around when I was hit with an instant of personal realization.  IÂ’m not talking about just getting messed up and heading to the mall for kicks.  I instantly realized how big the world actually was.  It felt as though time for me stopped but everyone else kept going at the exact same speed, I caught a glimpse of everyone past the mall doing their daily lives.  I stopped and took a minute to thank god for letting me see such things and experience such a nice life.  For about twenty minutes after that, it felt as though my mind and brain were two different things.  My brain seemed to take control of my body and move it for me while my brain laid in the back of my mind and enjoyed the ride... I was doing the same.
