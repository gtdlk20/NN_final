After a few tokes, I began to feel very odd indeed and very quickly it appeared as if time was going backwards. After that I stumbled back to the hostel, where I was staying, and began to panic. The chemical wore-off after a couple of hours and, thankfully, there was someone there who helped to allay my fears. All-in-all, an awful experience that in retrospect I was very unprepared for. That said, I am still inspired by Aldous Huxleys The Doors of Perception and look forward to experimenting further in the future. The more we understand the effects of all dopes, the better they can be applied in future.
