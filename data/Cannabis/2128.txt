	D's recreation room is quite interesting.  It originally was not part of D's house.  One day, years ago, D woke up and his father had put a hole in the wall of their laundry room.  His father then poured cement outside where he wanted the recreation room, hauled a pool table to the middle of the cement slab, and built walls and a roof around that.  The end result looks somewhat like an unfinished garage, with an incomplete ceiling (basically just nothing to separate the 'attic' part from the rest of the room besides the necessary wooden boards), a few couches, tables, ashtrays, etc.
