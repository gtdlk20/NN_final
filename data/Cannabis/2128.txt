I lay down in quiet contemplation for a few minutes.  Although I was in a small room, the world appeared to shimmer above my head in infinite, radiating layers.  Ive just entered the third dimension, I said to nobody in particular.  Even though I was aware of how stupid it sounded, I meant every word of that statement.  Catalano grinned and said playfully, From where?  The second dimension?  I said yes, thats exactly where I just came from, to which he replied, We already are in the third dimension.  Ah, did that get a rise out of me.  I started laughing and fell into a pool of laughs and was on the ground curled up from laughing.  I stopped, looked at Catalano, and proceeded to break out in giggles again.
