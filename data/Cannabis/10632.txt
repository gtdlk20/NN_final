5:42 Just got done mowing the lawn, some sniffles from the pollen, but not bad at all. Laying down and drinking some fruit juice and taking a steroid nasal spray (Fluticasone Proprianate) to relieve the sniffles. Im feeling quite happy, more creative and imaginative. I have tunnel vision, a warm fuzzy and airy body high, pain relief, and pleasant sedation.
