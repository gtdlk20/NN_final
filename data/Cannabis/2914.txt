Me, Bella and Aqualung went back to Aqualung's house and lay down in bed. I begged Aqualung to find me something to eat, but she told me I had already eaten enough so I should shut up and stop tripping. I tried to sleep, but then for some reason I starting laughing and it took me a long time to stop. Then I slept deeply.
