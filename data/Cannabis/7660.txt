I sparked it up and got it burning. We took turns until about half the joint was done. Then I noticed that I no longer felt cold (it was January). I asked my sister how she felt, she said she didn't feel anything yet. The joint fizzled out and I went to relight it, which was a bit difficult. I passed it to my sister and adjusted my coat, which felt weird. Then it happened! As I shifted the coat, I got a weird tingling sensation like when your leg falls asleep. I became aware that I had entered a different reality. I knew that everything was the same, but my perception had changed.
