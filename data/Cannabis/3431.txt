After my second hit, I coughed even more, and decided, 'Maybe I should slow down, no, wait, maybe I should just stop.  Maybe I'll turn up the music, get my mind off the slight paranoia that is beginning to settle in my brain like a worm burrowing into an apple.  Wow, what the hell am I talking about.'  I turn the music up.  My friends keep passing the bong around.  'Don't do it' I thought, 'Don't take another hit, you will not like what you'll get.'  I decided to listen to my brain for once, and instead, I tried to come up with an excuse for not smoking anymore.  I suddenly yelled, 'I'm thirsty, who's thirsty, anyone thirsty, because I am, maybe I'll just eat some snow.'  That is exactly what I did, I crawled out of my car, and ate a handful of snow.  As I walk back into the car I think 'Wait a minute, that was kind of strange, why would I ever do such a thing.  Something is different here, very different.  Maybe I'll just look around and see what my friends are thinking.'
