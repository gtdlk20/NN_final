I guess I should start with a quick psychoactive background.  I never did any drugs whatsoever until after my 21st when I got drunk the first time.  Later I decided to try weed with my best friend who had been smoking for quite a while.  Apparently with most people it's not this way, but that first time (it was decent bud at best but far from dank) I was totally ripped after about 3 puffs.  Obviously, I fell in love with it and after a 2 month dry spell began smoking twice or once a week.  We've got a regular little circle with my roommates and my best friend.
