We got to the park, which unlike the other one nearby is not filled with stoners and druggies, but children and their parents. We all sat down in the shade and ate chips, I had to go to the bathroom and my round about journey to all 3 bathrooms in the park took only 4 minutes, though it seemed much longer. I also noticed a confidence boost, I was able to flirt freely with complete strangers, and quite well too.
