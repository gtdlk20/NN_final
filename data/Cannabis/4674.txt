T-1hr, After gym class, I made the first mistake of the day. At this point, I could feel the body high, and it was incredibly powerful, a bit more intense than brownies, but my head was relatively clear. My friend asked if I wanted to go smoke a couple bowls before school ended. Now, you must understand that I smoke fairly regularly, and I've gotten pretty stoned out of my gourd, but I had never been too high, you know? Like completely bonkers. I had a feeling there was a line that once crossed brought you into the realm of the hopelessly zonked, but I was not sure where it was or what it would take to get there. After that fateful day, my definition of baked would change forever.
