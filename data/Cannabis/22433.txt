I then proceeded get online and find something to do.  I hadn't been on the computer for more than 10 minutes, when everything went wrong.  I thought that my friend was still in my house, and when I turned around, she wasn't there.  I thought she might be in the other room.  This is where I thought I got up from the computer and searched around the house.  I was either thinking, or saying out loud, 'Where is ****, where did she go?'  The next thing that happened was I was simply sitting at the computer thinking to myself, 'Oh yeah, she went home.'  I thought that she might be hurt somewhere and didn't make it home.  I finally had to call her just to make sure she was ok.
