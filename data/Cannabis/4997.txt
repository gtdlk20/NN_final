I am a very occasional cannabis smoker (maybe twice a year) but have only have tried oral cannabis once before. That was a home-baked cookie back in the last century. I remember getting the giggles. Great fun but never had the chance to repeat the experience until now when a kind friend gave me a packet of gummies to experiment with. Otherwise my only previous experiences were with psychedelics: San Pedro earlier this year and my first introduction to LSD in the summer.
