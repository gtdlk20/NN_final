So we are walking down this trail and 3 out of 4 of us are musicians. I try K's guitar, but my body's lack of ability to follow the mind in adequate time disables me in playing most of what I can normally. I tried Al Dimeola style soloing, and it came out as a clump of clumsily muted tones, similar to a 5 year old on speed trying to play the same thing. I gave the guitar back to K, and we proceeded down the ever-darkening dirt road. A minute or so later, K exclaims, 'This is the road that the devil meets you on to take your soul! Like Robert Johnson, we even have a guitar!' and he started to run backwards with J. A bit more of this kind of nonsense happened, and then we started to head back.
