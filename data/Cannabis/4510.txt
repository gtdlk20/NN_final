There were no spiritual or philosophical realizations during this trip, but it brought me closer to my friends for a night.  I am three years older then I was at the time of this account. I now only smoke cannabis 1-3 hits per session to avoid physical discomfort/ mental anxiety I now only smoke cannabis 1-3 hits per session to avoid physical discomfort/ mental anxiety that I started to experience what seemed randomly and inexplicably.  Cannabis can assist with creativity, abstract thinking, sleep, and sometimes anxiety/stress.  It seems to invariably increase sexual desire, appetite, and internal dialogue.  With me, mild closed eye visuals can usually be manifested with music and meditation. Addiction to the drug seems impossible, in fact, I have used it to nullify the negative effects of nicotine withdrawal multiple times.
