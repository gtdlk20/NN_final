I became aware of how odd this was and then all of the sudden i woke up as if from a dream. I was lying on the floor and i tried to get up but I couldn't move. I felt as if I had a big down comforter on me and I was too comfortable and weighed down to move. I started to lose these feelings in about twenty minutes when my friends came by. While I was talking to them i began to realize how little I knew about them. I would look at them and realize that everyone that knows this person has a different opinion abotu them and they're the only ones that truly know themselves. I began to wonder what other people thought of me and the type of person they thought that i was, I came to the conclusion that no one knows me the way I perceive myself but me. After these odd experiences it was just the regular laugh and have a good time high.
