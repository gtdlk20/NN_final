The second time I tried a weed brownie I made them myself. To fully explain it would be too long but my friends and I followed a recipe for weed infused butter which you add to the brownies. We used about 3 grams of Maui Wowie, but didnt verify the strain. I cautiously ate half a much smaller, ~.4 oz piece and smoked half a blunt. I felt pretty high (see above listed effects) and the high lasted a good 4 hours, peaking at about 2.5. No big deal, Ive definitely been higher.
