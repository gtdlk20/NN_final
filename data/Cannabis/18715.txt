So, I decided to stand up (usually helps when I'm feeling ill) to get rid of the nausea that had suddenly swept over me, and sure enough, it went away with no problems. I was coming up VERY fast and it was VERY intense. I wasn't really comfortable with the surroundings I was in so I asked my friends to watch B, my friend who took all the DXM and dram., while I went for a walk to clear my head. Well, I ended up walking home. The whole way home I was hallucinating all sorts of weird bugs and animals all around me. At one point on the way home, two old men standing next to a truck asked me if 'I was in the bar tonight'. I don't know if this had really happened so I just ignored it and kept walking my usual route home. About halfway home, every little spec on the road looked like a bug running around in the street, and I kept seeing bats and strange birds flying through the air above me, all making very strange noises similar to cars passing by on the highway. When I finally got home, I started fading in and out of consciousness, without knowing it until my body would 'jerk' and I would awaken.
