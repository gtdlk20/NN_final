Today was 4/20 and I had been experimenting with cannabis for the past month or two to no avail. Today, however, was different. Last night I purchased a 20 sack, and smoked about 1/4 bowl in a poorly rolled joint (my first attempt at one). I don't know if it was the THC or the atmosphere or both, but the night was very nice, I smoked the joint in a place I had been looking for in the past, and stumbled upon just that day, an abandoned warehouse/dairy factory on a cliff looking at the skyline (which was not far away, I was in downtown.)
