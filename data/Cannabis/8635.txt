Then after everything was smoked, everyone was being extremely loud in the park and i could hear every conversation which everyone was having, regardless if i was 2 feet from the person telling the story or 10 feet.  I could hear everything.  I could hear the wind, and also the city night.  I never understood this in my life, how to hear everything at once like this.  Normally my brain just concentrated on what i wanted to listen to, or everything would be bundled up.
