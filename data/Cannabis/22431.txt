The night started out ok, with nothing to worry about.  My friend showed up at my house with some brownie mix and the weed.  We made the brownies and called a couple people to see what they were doing.  Two of them couldn't do anything and the other one was pretty indecisive.  We went ahead and ate a brownie and start getting some sort of effects.  I must say that it didn't taste too terrific.  The stems and seeds tend to add a bit of crunchiness to them.  I think all we did at first was just laugh; nothing too exciting.  After awhile we ate two more, wanting better effects.  We soon started to get very confused about everything.  One of us would be talking and suddenly stop what we were saying, due to the fact that we just plain forgot what we were talking about.  This happened numerous times throughout the night.  Both our bodies were very numb, but in a pleasant way.  I almost felt like if I tried to get up I wouldn't be able to.  I guess I did, because my friend had to go home, so I let her out the door.
