I wandered around the house a bit while my sister sat stupified in front of the TV. I tried to rest but my heart was pounding and the shirt I was wearing made my skin tingle whenever I shifted position. My sister started to talk on the phone. Apparently our communtication skills were fine because no one noticed we were different in any way. We both got a bit depressed and nauseated but it passed eventually. I continued to wander around the house in a dream-like state lost in my thoughts.
