Ox was real fucking bored so we decided to watch some of NIN And All That Could Have Been. I got up a few times to go back to the computers, humoring myself with google searching such as 'kicking in a roll' 'making myself roll' 'bunk ass pills' 'I took some bunk ass pills and I'm not feeling shit right now'. I found one crazy writing from someone, highlighted a passage about dancing pink elephants, and left it there for someone to see. I then went back out to the living room, where apparently everyone was talking a turn running off the shower.
