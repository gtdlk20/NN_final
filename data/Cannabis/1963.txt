When I got home, I opened the lights, I laid down on my bed and decided to record my thoughts. I felt like I understood everything, and I could link every single dream in my past to what I was seeing right now, I felt like my dreams were explanations to why the universe is the way it is and vice versa. I could find an explanation for anything and everything. I saw the string theory, I experienced the fractal theory, I went through thousands of layers of reality. It was the happiest I'd ever been, thinking I know the answer to why we are here. I could visualize all the dimensions and the shape they took... It was amazing. The most  beautiful feeling. I had found what the meaning of life is, for me.
