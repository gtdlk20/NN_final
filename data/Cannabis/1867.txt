I was done with work for the week and I was waiting for a friend to pick me up from the office for a friday night out. It was 4:30pm and I was idly surfing the net when on an impulse I started chewing on the substantial ball of hash I was carrying in my pocket. Before I knew it I had reduced it to a pulp in my mouth and I swallowed it. It did not taste very good, but it was not unpalatable either.
