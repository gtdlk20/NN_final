We lit up the blunt and began to smoke it. My first hit was very harsh, much harsher than most Green bud I have smoked and I coughed for about 20 seconds. Not sputtering coughs but deep, forceful ones that leave your lungs and throat hurting. While I was coughing my room mate took his first hit, passed the blunt to me and then proceeded to cough a lot as well. I took another hit, held it for about 8 seconds and then blew out. I didn't cough so much this time, but my room mate still was. I passed it to him, he held it, didn't hit it then passed it back. By this time, about 2 or 3 minutes after my first hit, I was starting to feel the effects. I took my third (and last) hit, held, blew out and then sat there while my room mate took his last hit.
