I now bake hash into fairy cakes and I know to take about two-three for a good trip. It is trips I seem to get rather than feeling stoned. I do get hallucinations, visual but mostly audible. I hear things miles away like a dog barking but then I completely block out other closer sounds. Once I was lying in bed which is above my garden and I could hear the slugs and snails munching very loudly on my plants and flowers, that made me laugh. Watching Button Moon and playing Santana records is the most enjoyable ways to spend a trip.
