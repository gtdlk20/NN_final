I was pretty embarrassed but Dib and Gir only gave me grief for a second or to and I think Tak understood what had happened. It was the most intoxicated state I have ever been in. I have been smoking pot ever since but haven't been able to attain such a state again. In some ways I don't care, I have leveled out and developed a tolerance to pot in the sense that I don't become an idiot when I smoke. I am always the one just chilling, philosophizing and enjoying life. I've really learned that smoking pot doesn't have to be about secret outings and shady deals. It can be about spending time with and connecting with my fellow human beings. Just enjoy the love and peace that I get while smoking pot with my friends and that's all I will ever need to do.
