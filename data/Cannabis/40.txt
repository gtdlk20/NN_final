As soon as I had said it, I felt another wave of deja vu and of course another wave of panic.  Then Tom said, It happens sometimes when you smoke weed  I felt angry at Tom because I was sure he had said that last time I spoke about looping, and that he was just mocking me.  Another wave followed.  Shall we do something else? he asked, and we decided to play Halo 3.  Try as I might, I couldnt concentrate on the game, and kept going into autopilot.  All I could think about was that there was a single thought - the idea that positive and negative thoughts happen simultaneously all the time and that if you concentrate on them, you wont be able to think of anything without seeing its positive/negative partner, the everything starts to look/feel/sound the same and you fall back into your subconscious and cant get out - that got me half way down my Line of Wellbeing to Panic Attack, and that once I was in that frame of mind, I could control my mental health by thinking about the possibility that I could control my mental health.  A very confusing thought, but again this is likely to make sense to anyone who has had a philosophical experience with Cannabis.
