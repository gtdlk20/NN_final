At points during the gibberish that is sung at points of 'sun-king' made me feel strongly as if the Beatles were playing some sort of sick joke. The fact that they were being silly out of the blue kind of annoyed me, as up to that point I was really enjoying it. Somehow though it really prepared me to get completely sucked in for the rest of the album.
