I don't really remember driving through town but I do remember going to Sonic. There we saw his mom who came up to the window to talk to him. I didn't really want her to know I was stoned so I looked the other way. But when she said hi to me, I had to turn and say hi. I tried to do it as quickly as possible although I guess she still noticed because she asked my boyfriend if he had gotten me high and he laughed and said yeah. She scolded him for it then left. I turned to him and laughed and he said, 'Baby you are so fuckin high.'
