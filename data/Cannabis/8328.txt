One other observation is that the effect of this single piece of chocolate with an estimated THC content of 12 mg was similar to that produced by consuming 30 mg of THC in gummies (see my first time gummy report). Why the THC in my chocolate should be nearly three times as strong as the THC in gummies is a bit of a mystery.  When I previously tried a gummy with 10mg of THC it had no effect whatsoever.  I presume it may have something to do with the bioavailability of THC in butter as compared to gummies. Or perhaps slow low temperature decarboxylation retains other mildly psychoactive cannabinoids that are not present in commercial products.
