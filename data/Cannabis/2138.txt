	T+11 minutes: Everything is bouncing around with energy.  I am no longer in the breakthrough, but I am still tripping.  I close my eyes and see nothing but rainbows.  I open my eyes and everything is still bouncing up and down, in unison.  It feels like a more natural, more calm LSD buzz than anything else.  The room has an Amazonian feel to it.
