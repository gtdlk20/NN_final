I am home alone and in a good mood.  I have about 5 hours before my cousins get home and my car is snowed in. At 2:30 I take 2 hits.  I feel relaxed and energetic so I dance around and chase my dog at full speed through the house.  I feel a closer connection to my dog, like I understand her better and like she understands me.  It seemed likes she understood english.  At 3:30 I do the same.  I get another energy burst.  4:30 I take 2 more hits and I just feel the same as how I have felt since 2:30.  By 5:30 I decide I am not as sensitive to weed as I used to be so I go take two more hits, but this time I take large hits.
