I curl my body inwards and briefly wonder if that's why I was so numb. Everything is overpowering--the heavy silence, crushing atmosphere and terrifying prospect of dying. Then it all makes sense, why I can never fully envision myself with a future, how it all blurs when I think too far into the future--I had none. This was the end of the line, so to speak, and I wouldn't even be remembered as anything more than hurt. Guilt built up, about how this would affect my mother, how disappointed she would feel to know that her pride and joy had screwed up royally, and how she would blame herself for it.
