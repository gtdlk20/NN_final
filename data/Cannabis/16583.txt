My brother could sense something was wrong, and kept asking me, but I just kept shrugging it off saying nothing with a trembling stuttering voice, and imagined that I had to not talk to him at all or I would lose control of my body and it would somehow kill them both. In retrospect I often laugh about the absurdity of believing something like that could have happened. It makes a good laugh when high. I imagined somehow my staying conscious was some way to keep my mind from detaching from my body and allowing it to do crazy things. I imagined I suppose at the time this was how psychotic killers were born, on a bad trip, lost control of themselves and killed people.
