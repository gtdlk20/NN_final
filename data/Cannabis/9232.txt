We did the deed and went back to the room to watch our friend play our game, when shortly, another person showed up. Track (I just gave her the name...she runs track, no allusion to heroin, something none of us did) stopped by to hang out with us for a little while because nothing else was going on. Soon enough BMF came back while the others stayed where they were for a while. Around this time Grunge left because his girlfriend was tired and he thought her better off sleeping at home than around a collection of people she didn't know. So, now it was just Raz, Track, BMF, and myself. Again, another twist comes up. Having a few extra X's left, BMF attempts to coerce Track into rolling with us.
