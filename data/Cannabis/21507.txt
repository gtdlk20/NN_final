I had about 3/4 a gram of some herb that I used to pack a bowl with, I got into my normal position, which is just sitting on my floor next to my open window, so I could blow the smoke out of my window, cause the whole thing was very under the radar, not wanting to get caught. Anyways I smoked most the bowl, and realized I could barely even hold the bowl anymore, and that the last 2 or 3 hits I wasn't even aligning the lighter and bowl correctly. I took this as a sign that I probably had smoked enough for the night.
