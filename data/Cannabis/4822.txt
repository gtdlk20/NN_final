+0:20 - Back in my apartment, having failed to fix my phone/internet. In the second dubious choice of the evening, I opt to pour out another ~15ml of the green dragon. I should mention that while many green dragon users report that it has an herbal flavor, the pungent taste of the baijiu is so strong that it overpowers whatever earthy taste it might have absorbed.
