It started getting worse and worse, I was tripping out so bad it felt like something next level, like I just smoked crack or PCP or something. My heart beat was so fast, I thought it was going to literally beat out of my chest. I couldn't stand still at all, I had to keep walking. I told one of my buddies to go run in the store and buy me a drink and something to eat, he bought me a 7up and a chocolate bar. I took 1 bite out of the chocolate bar and I dropped it on the ground and my pop on the ground. This high wasn't going down, instead it kept going up and up.. and wouldn't level off. I have never been so fucked in my life, not even off booze. I saw my brother at the store, and my friends both ditched me because they didn't want to hang out with me or try and help me out when I was like that. They weren't really good friends anyway, and after that, I refuse to have anything to do with them. They seemed fine off that joint and I thought I was going to die any second. They just ditched me, and I ran into my brother and things started getting even worse, my brother and his friend would talk and it would seem like they were talking in slow motion but really fast, I can't explain it.
