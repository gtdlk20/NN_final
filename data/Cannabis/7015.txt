Before I even begin, let me just state that I am a 16 year old student and I have been a habitual marijuana user for over a year. I am a fairly experienced psychonaut as well. I have had experiences with DXM, LSD, salvia, nitrous, PCP and loads of other chemicals whose names I can't recall. In short, I've tried everything I've ever been offered and I have (miraculously) lived through experiences that should've landed me an obituary. With all that said, last night was the most incredible night of my life, and it took nothing but two bowls of bud, great music and the love of my life.
