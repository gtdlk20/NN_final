When I got home I put on some Bob Marley and danced for almost an hour. For some reason I thought that I was at his concert, and at certain moments, that I was in fact Bob Marley. I can confirm the powerful musical connection that weed gives. About an hour later when I was coming down, I went for dinner, and finished off the amazing trip with a good meal and a discussion with my family.
