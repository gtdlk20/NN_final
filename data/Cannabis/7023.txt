One of my favorite things about smoking cannabis is the unique musical experiences that are unlocked as a result of a really good stone.  I also like how cannabis, at least for me, is a compromising, agreeable drug, in the sense that it lets outside factors such as music, television, and human speech and movement drive The Stone, instead of The Stone driving my perception of the outside factors so that these things become unrecognizeable.
