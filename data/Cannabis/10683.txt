Then came Pink Floyd's 23 minute masterpiece, 'Echoes'. As the pulsing blips began, I felt as if my entire body was pulsing with these blips. As the organ and the guitar came in, the spinning feeling in my body continued, and I began to see some dim fractal patterns behind my closed eyes, flowing and lightly shimmering. Then the music really kicked in. With this musical perfection, I felt as though I was being drawn upward out of my physical body, my spirit spinning slowly up through the air and pulsing with the steady beat of the music of Floyd. I felt completley at peace, and there was nothing but me (or my consciousness, I guess I should say) and the music. It was musical nirvana. There were some closed eye visuals again, just of some swirls of color, but these were not too strong.
