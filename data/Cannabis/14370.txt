Farmer alerted me to Jim, now sitting some distance off staring out over the fields.  I told Farmer that Jim was practicing a Zen meditation.  Farmer found this particularly amusing.  I was unsure.  I was beginning to feel the first wave of a paranoia that gripped both Jim and I that night.  If you like the candy, beware kids, whatevers inside  is coming out!  I worked on it for a few moments and got it under control, riding the wave and paddling up to meet the next one.  We faced five or six of these waves of paranoia over something or other.  Each one seemed weaker than the previous.  Farmer was there as the voice of experience, and experience has taught this psychonaut that its always good to have a Tripmaster;  someone who has enough experience to go along with you for the journey, as well as cope with the real world if necessary.  That voice of experience was needed when Jim came rushing back into camp.
