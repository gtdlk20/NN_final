#4. I do not recommend, as have others on this site, the concentration on one's breathing if it is your breathing that is bothering you. I, personally, am never satisfied with the state of my breathing when stoned to any degree. I find that ignoring what you think is wrong with you is the best way to get rid of such feelings, especially in light of the fact that those feelings are never real.
