Urinated several times before I left for the test (don't worry, with the Horsetail you'll come up with plenty of urine), then drove thru the snow to take the test.  I was observed and they wouldn't let me wash my hands (gross!).  Came up with midstream test sample -- which was NEON yellow.  Pale, but still neon.  Lo and behold, I passed.
