Next we opted to see else became of the shooting at LAX and I continually mashed buttons on the remote, hoping to press the correct combination that would give us a news channel. I finally opted for merely typing in '4-1', '4-2', '4-3', etc... I then began to debate with myself why I did this instead of pressing the 'channel up' button. Still unsure of my actions, I continued to climb the channels in this manner. We were unable to find the correct station, although we did find some Junkyard Wars. Thankfully, we were slightly descending from out mental mindfuck of a stoning, and we were able to watch and concentrate on the show. Between laughing and watching we made many references to what a team of stoners would do had they been involved.
