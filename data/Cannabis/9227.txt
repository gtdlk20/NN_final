I woke up the next morning next to Matt feeling quite happy.  I still felt like I was going to throw up and I couldn't watch TV.  The smell of weed still makes me nauseous.  I think if I ever do smoke again, it won't be with my friend's crappy shake of death.  I have a new appreciation of being able to control my thoughts, feelings and movements.  It was a great wake-up call and definitely scared the shit out of me. As they say, be careful what you smoke.
