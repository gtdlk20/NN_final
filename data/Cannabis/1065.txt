By now he was starting to get a bit weary though, since he had essays to write.  He was trying to nudge Rayanne and me out but decided to let us stay until I was ready to leave, since I was still tripping out.  I had little perception of time though, so I dont know how long we stayed.  I turned to Catalano and asked him if he was mad at me for tripping on weed.  He smiled and said, Im furious.  We looked at each other and I was laughing like mad.  Rayanne and I decided to let him do his essays, so she dropped me off at home.  I stumbled inside and ran upstairs so as not to get caught by my mom.  Once there, I stared in awe at the little rainbows on a cd-rom.  Were those always there?
