Usually when I smoke I smoke a little of the GOOD shit and I'm so totally wasted that I don't sit and giggle like I've heard about, so I thought that whole giggling bullshit was just something that only certain people experienced...but now, after more experiences with smoking less of the GOOD stuff and laughing more (instead of smoking more and being in such a HIGH state of euphoria that I can't move or anything) I believe that it depends on the type I smoke and how much of it.
