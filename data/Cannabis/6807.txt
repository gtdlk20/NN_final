I crossed the street because I remembered that there had been a dumpster across the street where I could throw my bottle away. Suddenly, I forgot why I was approaching the dumpster. I arrived at it, threw my bottle away, then had no idea where I was at all. This was one of the instances where my body took over. I felt like my body knew what it was doing, so my mind decided to trust it and I let myself walk back to my destination: a local hangout where all my friends were.
