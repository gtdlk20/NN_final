I then decided I wanted to be close to the water, so I cruised down to the river and picked out a good place to sit on the flat stones in the middle. I sat there for an hour, basking in the gentle sun peeking through the canopy, contemplating the nature of water and the trade I had just made. I felt good to be alive. I thanked nature and made my way back up the track.
