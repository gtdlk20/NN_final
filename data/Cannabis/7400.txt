I remember that night very vividly. It was the end of April and everyone was beginning to anticipate the end of the school year. I was but 16 years young and a sophomore in high school. Unfortunately, at the time I lived in the southeastern US, where there was nothing to do but drugs. The problem was that I never got into the drug scene, until one night. Drugs never really interested me, but they sure interested my girlfriend at the time. I knew that when I got into the whole relationship and I swore to myself that she was the only one who could ever get me to try anything. At last, one night the inevitable happened.
