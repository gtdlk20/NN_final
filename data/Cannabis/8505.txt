When we got inside I sat on the carpet in my friends room and felt somewhat like a frightend child.  I was worried that I would be stuck in this new and interesting world forever. My body felt numb I knew I was cold because I was still shivering but I felt no cold air.  I looked up at the ceiling, my movement felt slower than usual,the light on the ceiling amazed me in its brightness and imbedded its shadow (if you will) in my vision.  I looked over at my friend and he looked completly differnt in the shadow of the light, like a super hero.  I was seeing colors like little dots infront of my vission, green mostly, with purple making amazing paterns that I was transfixed by. At some point I said oh my God, not really for any reason just from sure amazment. I felt stupid after I said it and I hung my head in shame.
