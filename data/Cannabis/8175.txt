Saturday night at 5:00 we got all geared up and each ate a cookie.  They were, of course, delicious.  i realized that something was clearly amiss when at only T+30 min i noticed i was already high.  Very high.  And hungry despite having eaten a large large volume of cookie with high butter content.  For now i wait and have some of Brian's salad.  He is still eating his (remember i said they were large).
