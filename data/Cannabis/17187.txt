After all of the weed was gone, (I didn't cough that much!) and we were all well baked, we started listening to music (it's clich√®.. but Phish is cool) and talking about everything. I had the most intellectual conversations while stoned. And, even though we were in serious thoughts and philosophies, we could laugh about it. We were talking about religion and its effects on today's soceities, the laws on marijuana, and why people can be so vain to look to outside beauty instead of who people are on the inside.
