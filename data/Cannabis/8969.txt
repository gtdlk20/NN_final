I started to talk to Nivette about this guy Ezra I had been dating for about a month. He had just broken up with me that day because he is Jewish and I am not. It was something that bothered me and I did not understand it. I hoped that by telling people I could get some insight. Nivette says she is attracted to Jewish men, she says she is Babylonian which she says goes way back before the Jews. Then I think it would be a good idea for Nivette to talk to Ezra. I call him, its about 11pm at this point, and Nivette immediately reprimands him, Why are you breaking up with this woman, just because she is not Jewish? She is a princess!
