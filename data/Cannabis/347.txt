I managed to remember my Station to get off at.  It was quite an experience that last trip I had... I think its changed me, I believe in a lot more cycles in nature now, and how they relate to us and the cosmos; I believe that there is Infinity: its in the form of cycles.  I've also got into a lot of New Age things, i.e. I discovered this site and also deoxy.org :)
