I just really enjoy musical experiences like that, and I think it is one of the main reasons behind my sincere enjoyment of Cannabis.  Not that I am a hard-line type of guy who thinks that everthing enjoyable can automatically be enhanced by pot, but I like the idea of lighting up a joint, and just chilling to music, because of the relaxed, opened-up headspace that good Cannabis can help to put you into.
