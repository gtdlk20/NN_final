The next day I was unsurprised but disappointed to feel no ebb in the lingering physical effects. I just wanted to FEEL again  feel normally, you know? Not this pale, half-processed feedback. I wondered if I could have permanently fucked up one of my senses. I worried that Id get used to feeling this way and come to think of it as normal (and thus forget there was ever a vivid world of touch beyond this dullened haze  a world that was painful sometimes, but one I wouldnt want to forsake forever). I felt highly energetic that day (sedation didnt seem to be lingering), happily engaging in housework and the chores of personal hygiene I dont often undergo.
