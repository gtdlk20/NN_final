I remembered things from earlier in the day except I thought they were part of a dream I had recently.  I got back to my cousins dorm and I bid him adieu and drove off with my friends.  As we approached my friends dorm, where we were staying, I said, You guys, I remember this dream I had last night.  We were driving towards this hotel or something and on top of the roof were these two huge nutcrackers and they said something like happy new year.  My friend had the decency to point out two enormous nutcrackers holding a Merry Christmas banner on top of my other friends dorm as I was saying this, upon seeing them I TOTALLY freaked out.  I thought I was in a dream for a short while.
