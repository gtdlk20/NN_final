Five minutes after that conversation (+5min since we smoked all the weed), it suddenly hit me and N like a fucking tidal wave. We had no fucking idea where the fuck we were (even though we had known this forest all our lives). I said to myself Holy shit, this is weird, I wonder if anyone else notices this. Suddenly N exclaimed how he was experiencing this same dream-like experience. It LITERALLY felt like we were walking in a dream. While walking it felt like we were hovering or something, and our legs were extremely numb. It seemed as though my legs were mechanical devices and I could just fall asleep while I kept walking.
