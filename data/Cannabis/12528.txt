I have been a light Marijuana user for a modest amount of time, but nothing even came close to this experience.  I was at home alone and I decided to smoke a little of the Marijuana I had bought from a friend earlier in the day to help me relax.  I smoked what couldnt have been more than ½ gram.  Within five minutes I knew something was off, I had intended to take a shower afterwards so I was in the bathroom and the shower was running.  After smoking I could barely clean up.  I began feeling like I was daydreaming; only whatever I dreamed up became real.
