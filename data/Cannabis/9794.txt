We wandered around the beach, a total mess, for a few hours. Then I felt safe to drive again and we went around our town, going into the village and parking near Town Pond. It is this little pond next to the cemetary near the ocean. We sat there watching cars drive by, I noticed the tail lights left behind blurs as they went.
