It was the 4th of July and I went to my good friend, Robert's house for the night.  When I got there he was packin' a bowl.  I had smoked weed before, but I NEVER thought weed could do this to me.  I smoked that bowl with him and I felt a 'normal' high (reality seen as a picture show, etc.) within a very short amount of time.
