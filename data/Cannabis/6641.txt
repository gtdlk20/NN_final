My friend and I sat in this room for a while and I remember him laughing about someone talking about us as they walked by the door. This freaked me out and made focusing very hard for some reason. Still, however, the effects were not strong at all; just the same as any common and weaker form of cannabis. This, as I remember, gave me mixed emotions that consisted of disappointment, curiosity, very slight paranoia, and a feeling of invincibility.
