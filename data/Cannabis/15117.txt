I lost track of all time, but I'm guessing this lasted for a good 2 hours. From then up until about 6 hours later, I was still high, but not at all like I was immediately after we puffed. In the time after the first 2 hours, everything felt like it was in rapid stop-go animation, and I couldn't tell if it was just me twiching like nutz or if it was just in my head. Either way, it was frickin great.
