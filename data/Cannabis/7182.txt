We took a walk around the farm just after our arrival.  Farmer handed Jim and I what appeared to be an abused fig-newton.  It was his candy, he said.  It was figs and raisins and dates and extracted THC, the psychoactive in Cannabis.  Farmers candy is made with what is still a closely guarded recipe.  He told us wed be staying the night and we nodded-  we planned on leaving late.  Little did we know that Farmer was right.  I had had some prior experience with smoking Cannabis, and the experimentation every high school student has with alcohol.  I didnt think Jim had experience with anything, but he took the candy without seeming hesitation.  They werent horrible but they wouldnt sell on taste alone either.
