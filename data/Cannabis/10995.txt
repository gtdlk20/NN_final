Then I hear L from the bathroom simply say, shiiiiit. I quickly come back to the room and tell G to go check on L in the bathroom. He gets up, walks to the door, and asks if hes ok. L responds, Im fine. Just trippin balls, but Im fine and goes back to what he was doing. I found out later that he was staring at his vomit, seeing it forming back into food within the toilet bowl.
