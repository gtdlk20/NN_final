Then things started to get crazy (remembering that this is 'only' hashish). Suddenly I realized that I was totally wasted! I heard all the voices clearly now. It was pretty funny, I could hear conversations across the lounge-room, just being able to ignore the rest of the noise. And looking at peoples' faces, time sort of slowed down, and I had the feeling that I had known that person for a long time, knew what he/she was like, knew where they grew up, etc. They were all unique characters in a movie. A funny thing.
