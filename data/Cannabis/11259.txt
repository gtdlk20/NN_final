Passing more angry/frightened tourists who volunteered nothing but sneers and timid glances, I was starting to have a bad buzz. My spinal/cranial pains were playing up, and my mood was worsening. I continued down the track and came upon a grove of strange, ancient trees. Suddenly, it was all clear - the destructive force inside me was attacking me (I had been training hard in my Taekwondo all week), and possibly it showed through and scared the tourists on some level, too. I felt I had to give some of it to the trees, so I spread my fingers and let it drain out through my arms. This felt right. I also felt the trees reward me by soothing my mood and my body. It was like a trade of my destructive potential energy for their healing.
