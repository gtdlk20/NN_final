It was here that I beheld shadows on the grass of my garden infront of me made the shape of what looked like a sort of pagan god figure... the legs seemed to form in the shape of the lower half of an 'A' letter... it was as if in perspective, the body seemed far away not small, and it was like at the end of the A figure was a body and head. It was a very simple drawing resembling a human done entirely with straight lines, manifest half in some random shadows on the grass resembling nothing, and half very vivid and meaningful and live in my brain thanks to cannabis.
