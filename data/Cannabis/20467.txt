Robert started playing guitar and it echoed in my head as I sat on the l33t0 couch watching Kris messing with the sound.  We decided to go upstairs, stairs, not a good idea, they don't look real.  When we got up there they supplied me with my own water bong to toke up on, plus Robert brought his bowl and Kris had Robert's water b-iz-ong too.  I smoked mine, and helped them smoke their's.
