We all went back into the house, and my throat felt really scratchy, and I kept coughing repeatedly. I felt fine, kind of spacey and subtly happy. Then suddenly I got this weird feeling that I was in a different place and time than the others. I looked at them with huge eyes and they looked fine, but I felt like I was tripping out. Whenever somebody spoke, their voice sounded so loud that it echoed all around me, and yet I could hardly understand what they were saying. I decided I really needed to lie down and calm myself, so I went into Kyle's bedroom and laid down on his bed. I took a few deep breaths and told myself that no one would know I was tripping out unless I told them.
