Anyways, it was the middle of winter, freezing cold (this is Canada).  My friend and I decided to smoke and go tobogganing.  We arrived at the hill, and were there alone.  We went to the bottom of the hill and I smoked all I had.  I should mention that the hill was large, and was actually a hiking path leading down the hill through a forest.  Above us was the steep path, and around that was forest.  At the bottom of the hill there was a lake (frozen) and there was at least one or two feet of snow on the ground.  As I finished off the last of the weed, I suddenly felt like something was trying to push me over.  Not hard, just like a wall of air pushing me softly.  This happened on and off, about three times, for about two minutes (I think).  I finished the weed and stood with my friend, talking about who would go for the next ride.  He had not smoked anything.  Suddenly, I found myself beginning to talk a lot, about nothing.  I was also talking quite loudly, almost shouting.  I remember that I was suddenly not cold, but in fact quite warm.
