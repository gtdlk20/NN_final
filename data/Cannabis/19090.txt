I started smoking a couple of months ago and have since become a more laid-back person who feels more at peace with her life and the world.  Marijuana is so commonplace and such a part of my life now that I hardly think of it as a drug, yet I have had a couple of experiences that were definitely mindblowing and reminded me that weed is more than food.  I had heard people speak of seeing sounds and feeling colors, etc. when they were tripping off acid, etc. but I never believed that such effects could be triggered by marijuana.
