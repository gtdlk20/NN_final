Now I'm in our living room. I'm huddled on the couch telling Hughie I'm going to puke. I feel beyond nauseous. If I move an inch or open my eyes I fear I will never stop vomiting. Hughie turns on the television. The sound and light hurt my eyes and ears. My senses have become so heightened it hurts. I must have been squinting because he asks me if he should turn it off. I don't remember nodding, but I hear the buzz of a television clicking off.
