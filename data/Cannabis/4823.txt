I came across a low priced 1/2 oz. and decided to bake brownies. I used the method of heating up the vegetable oil and adding the marijuana to that. It turned a deep brown color, smelled horrible, and sat on the heat for a few minutes until it looked fully cooked. I let it cool, proceeded with the brownie recipe, and cut the final product into 12 evenly sized squares. After de-stem/seeding (and removing some for smoking) i had about 12.5 grams in the mix... so there was a good gram baked in each brownie.
