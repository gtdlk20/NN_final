'Jesus...did I fuck up? No inhibitions left. My affidavit of responsibility chewed up and digested in pill form. What have I done to myself? Is this me? Or did I forge an alternate being in my thoughtless actions? Will I ever get the chance to figure it out? So many goddam questions....Do answers exist? If I did lay my ignorance to waste, would they be true? Is it possible that the knowledge I learn is only crafted by a cunning orator greater than myself? Impossible. There is no being greater than a mind. If truths are revealed it's simply due to my own intelligence. Fuck! My perception has been torn from its sanctuary. In its place a beast so powerful....I am unable to tame the godforsaken spawn of synthetic evil. Goddam...creatures lurk in every crevice my mind is aware of. Fucking bats and wolves --'
