At first, all was going as usual routine. I sat in my living room with several friends giggling at each others' hair. The mild snickering continued until I popped in the movie Kung Pow, a must-see for pot smokers, especially at the 'geeking out' stage. As the movie began, the quiet giggling exploded into gasping laughter, a joyful time for all of us. After the fit was calmed down, the movie was turned off and some random show on the discovery channel raided the screen. Surprisingly, most stayed and watched, seemingly entrigued by the mating cockroaches. I must admit, I was also taken. I couldn't stop staring at the TV. The way they squirmed about, the all-knowing documentary voice, it was all intensely fascinating. After the show was over, all except two who were on the couch with me dashed to the kitchen to satisfy their appetites. I expected the same to set in with me, but surprisingly sleepiness slowly took over. I found this strange, hense this didn't usually occur until after I stuffed my face with various junk foods. But anyhow, I proceeded to the floor to rest, too tired to make it all the way to my bed.
