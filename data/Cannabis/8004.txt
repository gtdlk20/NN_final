We lit that fatty up, and it burned slow because my friend had packed it so tightly.  We each had four long hits.  We watched the stars as we passed the joint around.  It was so relaxing, the air was cool and the sky was clear since we were so far away from any major ciries.  We could even see a few shooting stars.  Soon, Fred decided to go back to the fire so we wouldnt look too suspicious by staying over there so long.  I took two more hits, but my sister passed.  She was already starting to lose control.  I was feeling it too.  Man, was I feeling it.  I could tell pretty quickly that this weed was as good as my friend said it would be.  I pinched the cherry off to save the rest for later (we only smoked half a joint between the three of us!).  My sister and I began to walk back to the fire, which was probably 30 feet away.  Right about here, I got a strange sensation that I can only describe as tunnel vision.  The fire seemed to be at the end of a tunnel.  I laughed till I nearly fell over, because there was of course no such tunnel.  We stopped to regain control and decided to share a clove cigarette.  It tasted absolutely delicious.  After regaining our composure we continued, and when I was at the end of the tunnel, I started really tripping my balls off
