We both started feeling pretty high at around 9:45ish. After this point, everything seems like a dream and I really have no idea what time things happened. We were lying in bed and just hugging and whatever and we started having sex. It felt nothing like sex normally feels. It was like our bodies were melting into each other and we were just kind of floating and merging into one person. I couldn't even feel the bed beneath us. This was the moment when it really started to get very intense and I began to experience things that I have never felt while I was high. I started to feel like my soul or my consciousness was kind of outside of my body, and was traveling to all of these different places. I started to feel like my soul or my consciousness was kind of outside of my body, and was traveling to all of these different places. Each place felt different, but the feeling of 'traveling' was the same. It was very intense like I was on a roller coaster sort of. Some of the places I ended up were scary and almost familiar, like some dark section of my brain where I store all of the bad things that have happened to me. I felt like I visited that place, but only briefly. I kind of acknowledged that it was there and then discarded it. Some other places were like memories sort of, good memories from my childhood. I felt like I was inside my friend's house that I haven't been in since like, 3rd grade. I felt like I was flying through all of the rooms and I kept remembering different things we did there. I started telling my boyfriend weird stories from my childhood that I had no idea I still remembered. I honestly wasn't paying any attention to my surroundings up until this point because I was completely absorbed in myself.
