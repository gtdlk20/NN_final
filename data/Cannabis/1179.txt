First, I was in my room experiencing the come-up effects of the weed. The feeling of high came instantaneously after I inhaled the smoke. The deepening of my consciousness began to increase steadily, as well as feeling the increasing shakiness in my body. Perhaps 5 minutes into it, my sister and her boyfriend came into my room. They kept asking me if I wanted some water and how I was feeling? My response was 'Is this really Marijuana?! You must have put something else in it seriously!' Which they of course didn't because I knew it was still weed, even it it was coming on so differently. I felt as if my consciousness was being pulled inwards more and more, away from reality more so than ever before. And I remember one time when they called my name, I heard it multiple times as if it was coming closer each time they said it like from long distance away. But as minutes ticked by I was being pulled in faster and I could also experience time actually slowing down in front of my eyes. I moved my arm from right to left, leaving a trail of my arm in a wavy motion. This amazed me so much because I didn't realize how powerful marijuana could be to my perception of time.
