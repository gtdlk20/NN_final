I would be silent for a while, thinking deeply, and then I would babble nonstop again. I kept wondering if they understood what I meant to say. It was so hard to put my extremely sophisticated thoughts into words. I felt my unconscious side coming out uncontrollably as I constantly tried to suppress it by trying to bring myself back down to reality by trying to focus on other stuff besides all the other deep stuff I was trying to figure out. It made me feel vulnerable and I felt like I was talking too much but couldn't do anything to stop it. I felt a bit embarrassed. I would also go in loops, or fall deeper and deeper into some of my thoughts, and they would tell me I was repeating the same stuff over and over. Often, I would come up with satisfying 'conclusions', as if a light bulb went off in my head, but at the same time, I told myself that it wouldn't make sense to me anymore if I wasn't there. My first trip took me to another world!
