The wierdest thing was...I dont know WHY we went to my house. It was a destination, and I didn't want to pass out in a strangers house.  I was stupid for smoking in the first place, since my steroid inhaler probably hurt me more than it did good earlier that day.  As my mother is lecturing me and my friend on our stupidity, all I see is object hovering, I look over at my lamp, and then over at my mother again, but the image of my mother isn't there, its still the image of the side of the room.
