When I could open my eyes again and not feel dizzy, it felt like I was in a 3-D movie. It still felt like someone had turned up the sound, and also like everything I was looking at was sharper and more three-dimensional than usual. We walked around the park, then realized we'd been sitting for longer than we thought by the time someone checked a watch. Perhaps time felt like it was passing more slowly than it really was?
