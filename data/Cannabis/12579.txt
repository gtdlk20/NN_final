I felt that was enough for me. We got up and moved into his kitchen. We sat down on either side of this circular table. I remember sitting down, I was looking straight ahead of me, slightly towards the ceiling. All of a sudden I had this feeling of complete blankness, it felt like being on heroin, like noddin off. I forgot everything, I didnt know where I was, who I was, who my friend was. I thought that I was in another world, and I was trying to get back to my home world. I kept telling myself things like, Okay, this is home, remember this. Then I would forget and think Im in another world again.
