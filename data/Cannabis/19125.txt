At about eight oclock I met my friend, whom I'll call Kathy. She and I walked to a small wooded park, where earlier that afternoon we'd found a perfect place to smoke. We arrived at the designated area, I packed a bowl, and we lit up. We got about two hits apiece off each bowl (I packed them really small because I knew how potent it was) and after the third bowl, we decided to stop. I was feeling a little buzzed and Kathy said she wasn't really feeling it at all. So we packed up the dope, the flashlight we'd brought, and the lighters and set out for the road.
