The initial effects were odd, I wasn't really baked, but I was getting a sort of fuzzy headache. I did at least five, or six more hits before I felt baked. At this point I was questioning the credibility of the people who swore by vaporizers as the best way to smoke. I can't quite remember the total of hits I took in the end, but Mario kept filling the chamber, and I kept hitting the bag long after people dropped off. Eventually it was just Mario and me, and I noticed he looked like hell. He looked totally fried. That's when it hit me just how stoned I was. I didn't feel like I was getting high because it didn't have the usual harshness of a normal pipe, it was just like breathing air. I tried to stand up and walk to the bathroom, but I had to crawl. I was way past my comfort level, and I was far from the peak of my experience.
