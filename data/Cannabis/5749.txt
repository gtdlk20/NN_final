Anyway, I shall begin my story at about 1:40pm, yesterday. Me and 2 friends (I'll call one T, the other P) met up in school, and all of us were plannin to smoke up. You see, I have heart problems, and not long ago, I suffered a very minor heart attack (more like a heart cramp), and I am very prone to heart tension from stress/anxiety. Quite an odd ailment for someone as young as me (18). Anyway, I agreed to smokin up with them, as I needed some heavy relaxin myself, and although weed does bring your heart rate up a lil, it's better riskin a lil than riskin what may be potentially a lot and end up dyin from stress. So really, weed would be a great benifit to me.
