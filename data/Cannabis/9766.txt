I bought from this friend of mine with the intent of having a regular time, as per my usual. Listen to music, write some stories, play some videogames, and watch some movies. After having been less-than-sober for many hours, I began to watch a movie. Across the Universe, a movie I had been wanting to see for some time, having been told by many people how wonderful it was and my undying love for The Beatles. John Lennon is one of the reasons I got into philosophy, in fact.
