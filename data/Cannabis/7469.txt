The high came on very fast and we were listening to rap, something I was never a big fan of.  Soon after I decided to light a cagarette and after smoking about half of it I noticed I was swaying to the beats.  I had come to the end of the cigarette and was taking my last drag when my vision left me, I felt around quickly for something to hold onto but nothing was there and I fell forward...Thank god his bed was right in front of me.
