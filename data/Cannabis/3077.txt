I first started to notice something was up when the computer monitor was alot brighter than usual. When I say brighter than usual I mean it was almost impossible to look at. My eyes could not focus on the intense light emmited from it and after looking away to the TV to see what was on, the full realisation of what I had done began to set in. My vision had no chance of keeping up with my head movement, The trails became more and more intense until they were thick and pronounced. This was were I started to bug out a little bit.
