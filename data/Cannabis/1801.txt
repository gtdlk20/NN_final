T+0:40  V arrives, we go out for more. Hits 3-9  My world is now viewed in layers, seeming like a high graphics fluid video game. The background reaches out to me and grabs my interest, and I spend some time scanning it and watching different things grab my attention. My vision zooms into things, a strange feeling. A stone 10 feet away could take up my entire vision or be invisible at will. Very surreal feeling to everything, it feels very fluid. My thoughts come clearly and my mouth is dry. It is very difficult to stand  standing just doesnt feel important anymore there is so much to look at with a pleasant euphoria. I now am having average OEVs, zooming in to certain objects, and the CEVs become more intense, yet enjoyable. Quite awesome.
