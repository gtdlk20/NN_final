I threw in a movie (The Big Lebowski) and hung out for awhile.  By the time the movie ended I had eaten the entire box of cookies, and since it was about 11:00, everyone was asleep.  So I snuck back outside and smoked another bowl.  Now I felt on top of the world and very energetic.  I got my little brother (10 yrs old) to play tag with me in the house at 11:00 at night.  The next morning I woke in my bed, cookie crumbs and bottled water all over my room.  My brother said later to me that day that I was acting crazy last night.  I couldn't believe I got so high.
