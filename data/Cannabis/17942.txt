I hear some good rap music coming from a taqueria across the street. I jaywalk across the 5-lane road. I start moving to the beats as I walk up to the window. I determine the man making burritos is amazingly cute and I tell him he is gorgeous, he smiles. I walk up to a guy eating at a table outside, and have a strange conversation. Then I realize I am freezing and I go up to a group of people stepping into a van. I feel the warmth from inside the car and I ask where they are going. I end up telling them to all ride bikes and I slide the van door shut.
