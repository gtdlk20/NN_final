8.00 - I have returned, supplies hidden, and have been recently staggered by the discovery of a sixth plane of sense. I can, not by means of any other sense, detect the presence of non-incandescent light, specific pressure in different places, and scents upon myself, my clothes, and objects I am directly touching by skin alone. I seem to have gained a new way of thinking, but slightly written over previous objects in my mind. Hence a retarded expansion of thought. I must beg the readers pardon on any confusion caused by my part. I am quite intoxicated at the moment.
