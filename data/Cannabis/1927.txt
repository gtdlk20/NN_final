I got the feeling that I needed to go to the bathroom, which of course I didnt, it was just the shrooms. But the thought of going into my bathroom became horribly hilarious. I walked between the living room and bathroom, each time getting closer and laughing harder. In my mind I dubbed the bathroom The Bathroom of Hilarity, and all who venture in there would surely perish from laughter. I felt fantastically happy, everything was SOOOOOO funny. I eventually found myself lying back on the living room carpet, contemplating the utter ridiculousness of the entire universe, creation, life, myself, my fears, hopes dreams, other people. I cant really put it into words (as with so many things while tripping  language fails us utterly), but life seemed completely silly. And in that moment I was set free.
