It makes me think about what getting high really is. It seemed that night that all it does is, for the time being, make you incredibly stupid and lowers your IQ to the point that you can count it on your fingers, only you constantly forget how to count. I couldn't make my own decisions they had to help to get upstairs and find my way around the house which I kid normally walk through blind-folded. I had a 3 minute memory span, I couldn't control my walking or actions, and I couldn't think or process information. It was like I was mentally retarded for a few hours. I think that is all that weed does to you which in a sense is a very powerful thing. Overall I think that eating the weed will bring a much more intense and a longer trip then smoking. I would do this again only I would get my own weed to eat and take it a few hours before my friends would smoke their weed because smoking just works better for them.
