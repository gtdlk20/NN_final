The recent time is a much different, and much better story. It was the middle of the fall semester, 2004, sometime during the week. Around 9pm-ish, my girlfriend rolled up a rather large joint of what her brother (our source, at the time) said was 'high quality mids.' We went out back behind my dorm, and walked along a path around a small lake on campus. There are several benches, bushes, trees, etc all along the path; however it isn't the best of spots considering the campus police station is on the campus side of the lake. This caused a little bit of paranoia, but not enough for me to freak out.
