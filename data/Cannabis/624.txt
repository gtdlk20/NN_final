12:15 One hour since initial. Blotter chewed & swallowed. First alert may have been placebo. Little activity if any from half blotter at this point. I'll give it another half hour then the next half goes in. There may be somethng here, I can't quite put my finger on it yet, but I do feel kinda chilled, relaxed. I have no idea if this is a result of the chemical, my fully rounded personality or simply the relaxation techniques employed ;)
