I shared all of my excitement, all giddy and giggling. I would often feel like they weren't on my level and I would wish that they were on my level. I felt sad for them. I felt sympathy. I also crawled down to kiss the Guinea Pig. Finally, I was handed some butter popcorn. The way I would describe eating the popcorn would be like pouring butter all over my mouth. I could feel the intense buttery flavor drip down my chin as I ate the popcorn and the taste would stay there, just as strong, even as I switched to some plain bread. The bread was as if I was eating a block of butter. It was so amazing. It was orgasmic! Food never tasted so good. The grainy bread felt funny as I tried to pick pieces of bread caught from my upper lip. The bread would feel like it's still there from my delayed and lagging senses. It felt like I had a mouthful of bread crumbs in my mouth even though there wasn't anymore. And when I started to attack my 3 burgers, it felt like my mouth was on automatic chewing mode as if it had a mind of its own. I was eating nonstop and I didn't even have to think about chewing. I was worried I would bite my tongue off! And all this took place after I had already eaten to a full stomach! When I hit the ketchup in my Sourdough Jack, at first it was like 'What the hell is this?!' But then it was like a nuclear taste explosion of ketchup, and I was so excited thinking 'So this is what ketchup freaking tastes like!' Every bite was magical. Food never tasted so good. I could've kept eating on and on. On our way to get food, I felt like we were going warp speed at 45 mph. I was jumping up and down in my seat and clapping my hands from the excitement! Time and space was definitely distorted. I wondered what sex felt like lol.
