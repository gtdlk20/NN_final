I knew that the effect of the herb would pass, and the only way to make it through was to close my eyes and ride the roller coaster. I closed my eyes and as soon as I did I started seeing hundreds of pictures in my minds eye, all were incredibly vivid, as if I was actually seeing them. One of the things I remember seeing very clearly was a kind of two-dimensional cartoon. I saw cut-out pictures of mine and my friend Jude's faces on top of childish stick-figure crayon drawings. We danced about on our 2-D stiff, square cartoon bodies in front of a crayon-drawn field of flowers. We held hands and looked happy, our photograph faces always staying still with the same expressions. Suddenly, the background changed from a field to dark hills and a red sky. Jude let go off my hand and turned away, walking away on his stick-figure body. Suddenly his photograph face expression changed from a happy smile to an angry frown. He picked up a bloody cartoon ax and then ran towards me with it, all the while in a comical stiff stick figure way. I ran away on my stick legs and he chased after me, baring the bloody ax.
