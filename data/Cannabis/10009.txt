It was a casual party with several friends, and we had just puffed a couple drags off of a shitty apple pipe. Some were drinking, but I was satisfied with the marijuana. As they were making noise downstairs, I was zoning out on a couch in the upper level. Eventually, I began what can only be explained as 'eating the sun'.
