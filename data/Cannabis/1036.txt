My girlfriend snapped me out of this state when she tapped me on the shoulder and let me know that she was off work. As we walked to her car I felt extremely 'out of it'. We had to give our friend a ride to her boyfriend's house, and the whole trip is very vague an surreal in my memory. We got out at our friend's boyfriend's house and said hello to some very close friends. By this point I was beginning to feel a bit more normal, but still really high. I decided that I was at the peak level of most other times I had smoked. P decided she wanted to leave, so we drove to get some food (munchies didn't decide to wan), and then she dropped me off at her work to get my car (I was feeling high still, but not extremely). I headed back to her house, following her, but was distracted when I saw some friends on the side of the road. I stopped to talk to them for a while, and then got back to her house.
