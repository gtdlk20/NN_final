16.00 I just got home from work after a 10 hour shift and decided to roll up a 3 skin of orange bud CBD. I rolled it with tobacco and grinded up roughly a gram and put it all in the joint. I smoked CBD the day previous but with no negative effects so I thought I would pack the joint out heavly just for the flavour. I smoked it in roughly 5 to 10 mins as the bud was dry so the burn time wasnt that good. After the joint I felt very relaxed and had a small sense of well being. I wasnt expecting any other effects as CBD I have read is 100percent non psychoactive.
