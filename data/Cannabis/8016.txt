I finally made it home and went upstairs to my bed. It had been about an hour since I smoked. This was probably the peak. I was tired so I laid in my bed. I turned the T.V on but I couldn't pay attention. When I was laying down I felt like my soul was jumping out my body and coming back, then it would sink into the floor and come back out again. I also started to make up words and keep on saying them and this random melody would start playing in my head and it wouldn't stop. I didn't remember who I was. I wasn't thinking about school or my mom and dad or my brother I forgot all of that.
