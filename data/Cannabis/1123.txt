Marching men are walking across my head. I am clearly hallucinating, and am slightly aware of it. The men have small hammers and are walking across a straight dotted line on my forehead. I am afraid to move for fear they will fall off, and at this point I am more concerned with their safety than mine. The only other hallucinations I encountered during that time reminded me of a itunes or media player visulaizer. Just bars and spirals of color that reacted to every sound or movement.
