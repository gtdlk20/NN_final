The pizza arrived; we ate and then went back to the room. Once again I asked how we had gotten all the way to the room from the kitchen. I spent the rest of the night until 11:30ish asking him not let me sleep and also thinking that I was still waking up from different dreams all at the same intervals. I also noticed that my sex-drive decreased. Usually my sex-drive is over the roof but this time I was just paranoid.
