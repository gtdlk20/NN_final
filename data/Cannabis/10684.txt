I spent a lot of time last night trying to sort myself out, trying to come down a little and figure out if I was acting weird and what my body was doing. But only after my friend pointed it out I realized my whole entire body was shaking and my feet felt like they were in small pools of water. (Now that I think back on it I might have been cold but I remember feeling hot.) I then convinced myself that my foot was asleep and thats why I was feeling so out of it and I kept telling my friends ' I figured it out, I figured it all out.' My body felt extremely disconnected, which made me feel a little bit stupid because I couldn't really control myself.
