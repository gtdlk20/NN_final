And then the most impressive moment of the trip occurred. I got closer to the window to look outside. I could see an assembly of people, and strange patterns and characters moving on the tree. The hallucination was very real, because no matter how I looked at it, it was there, permanent. Then I saw a piece of steel with a ball on it, and the piece of steel was moving back and forth. For some reason, it was very important to me to make sure the ball wouldn't fall off. So I concentrated on it, and I noticed I could curve the steel each time the ball was about to fall, only with the power my mind.
