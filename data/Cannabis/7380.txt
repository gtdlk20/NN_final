Before I smoked I was at the mall and got in an argument with this guy and I drove off.  We decided to go back to the mall and get something to eat.  When the girls were eating something the guy came up to me and wanted to fight me.  All I did was shake his hand and say something i have never said before.  I said: 'Listen man, I'm sorry I didn't mean to mess with you.  Let's all just be friends'  Right when he heard me say that he smiled and said it's cool.
