It was in my new dorm room, probably about 7:30 pm, and I had just returned from a trip to the botanical gardens behind our gym where I had smoked a nice, fat jay. It was some quality weed, and I got nice and high. Shortly after having returned to my room, my roommates friend, who Ill call C, came into our room and offered to make us a Sobe bong. My roommate was all for it, so I watched as C skillfully turned an empty Sobe bottle into a fully-functional gravity bong (or waterfall bong, whatever).
