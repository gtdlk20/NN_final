This is the weirdest part about the high. The nonsense word umph kept running through my head in place of other words, and it was really hard to refrain from laughing about it. My internal speaker sounded like it was mumbling youmaybeumphbutmaybeumphly and it kept doing that for the ten minutes or so that I examined myself. In fact, there was more than one speaker, and they were all telling me different things in this nonsense language. I think I finally concluded that it was my red, squinty eyes that were making me look ugly.
