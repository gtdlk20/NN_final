I cannot accurately describe what I saw most of the time with my eyes shut.  I was hallucinating I suppose, what could only remotely be described as a kaleidoscope.  Then I felt like I was a roller coaster that was constantly angling down.  I felt like if I let my arms out from under my head, my head would fly down through my lap onto the road below.  I heard someone say my name and everyone laughed but I could not muster the energy to counter.  We all decided to go back to Dans house to chill.  I have been friends with Dan for a long time and I know his parents quite well.  I realized that they were there but I couldnt acknowledge them without feeling like I was making a total ass out of myself.  I was SO thirsty by this time.  Under normal conditions, I would have been parched because I hadnt drank anything in many hours but I NEEDED something to drink or I felt like I would pass out.  Dan fed me some Tostito chips and two lukewarm Pepsis.  I fell asleep sometime before 2 AM about 5 or 6 hours after I started smoking.
