Dro: Hydroponically grown marijuana. Weed that has been grown with the aid of hydroponics. What this means is that the weed is grown somewhat 'artificially', as in no soil, but with nutrient-filled water instead. Also, there is artificial lightin rather than sunlight, and even artificial humidity. Weed of this kind tends to be of better quality and far higher potency than 'sess'.
