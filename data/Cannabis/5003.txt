It was interesting, especially the part where the buildings looked as if they were models of themselves, complete with little model people walking around (but they weren't really walking, more like shuffling, it was very odd).  All in all it was probably a waste of pot, and I think there were lots of things that happened that I will never remember.  Probably the oddest part of the entire experience was that it was very un-pot-like.  Most of the time when I smoke I zone out and just enjoy being around and doing whatever.  This was much more intense.  Unlike regular smoking where I feel connected to everything and want very much to talk to people (even if I can't), with this experience I was incredibly lonely and confused the entire time.  It was too abstract to be really enjoyable or unpleasant.  The things that happened to my body did NOT happen to 'me' and vice-versa...  I don't have anything to really compare this too.  It wasn't a social experience (which is usually how I think of pot) at all, and probably being around other people would have made it much much worse.  I felt very self conscious the entire time, which is also not what I expect from pot.
