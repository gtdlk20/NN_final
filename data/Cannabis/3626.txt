I had never been high before.  I had been slightly tipsy from alcohol before, but I really had no idea what to expect.  The first thing I noticed was that my perception of reality seemed changed.  As I looked around, I saw what I could only describe as a strobe-like reality.  Reality would come into my head, and then it would rush out for a dreamlike period which could have been a million years for all I knew, and then it would pop back into my head again.  I stood there for a few minutes with my friends saying 'Are you high?  Huh, did you get high?' popping in and out of this dreamlike state.
