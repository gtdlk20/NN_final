At around four we decided to get back. This was the hard part. Like I said before we had to walk up the makeshift rock stairs and jump a fence to get back to my yard. I was behind Shaunna walking down the stairs and I tripped and we both ended up falling the rest of the way. We layed at the edge of the fence just giggling to ourselves and looking at the stars. Shaunna jumped the fence first and had no problems then it was my turn. Getting to the top wasn't bad but getting back down turned out to be a lot harder than it should have been. I ended up sitting at the top of the fence for about five minutes just laughing because it fasinated me that I could not get down.
