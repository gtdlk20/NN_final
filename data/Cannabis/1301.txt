Ever since the first inhalation, I had been intrigued by the effects of marijuana.  I am not a spiritual person, and yet I would certainly describe the marijuana high as nothing short of 'enlightening'.  Being a man whose religion consists of logic and reason, marijuana shook the foundation of my straight and narrow principles; I had been very anti-drug prior to experimenting with marijuana, and saw no value in altering my 'perfect' neurochemistry.  Little did I know that I was far from perfection, and that the first introduction of cannabinoids into my body would gradually blossom into something which until this day, fascinates me.
