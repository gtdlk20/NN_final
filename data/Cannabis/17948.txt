I leave, amazed this is happening. Now I feel like I am in a nightmare. I walk up to a homeless man and buy his newspaper, then start to cry, telling people, This man is homeless! I was so cold, the wind ripping between the buildings and this homeless man just standing out there. He responds sadly, I am just trying to make enough money to get a place to stay.
