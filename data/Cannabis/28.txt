I truly believe what followed was an episode of utter madness (though I now see madness to be another state of mind that, depending on how far down the rabbit hole one is, one may have the ability to control the outcome).  Tom asked if I was OK.  Apparently I was fidgeting.  I knew that I had felt like I didnt know how I should sit, like sitting was alien to me.  Like being in my own body was alien to me, so naturally I was trying to get comfortable, and this appeared very strange to an outsider.  I suppose it would have appeared similar to a baby in a high chair.  Uncomfortable, but unaware of how to move his body properly to get comfortable.
