I started noticing that my favourite songs sounded DAMN different - absolutely different melody (but mostly the melodies didn't make much sense - even random at times). THEN I noticed that some songs that I liked did sound DIFFERENT - but also made sense - as if absolutely different but with a nice melody in the same song I know under normal conditions. And the name of one of those songs was 'TRUE VISION'. Even stoned I realised that the composers intended it to sound different but nice when listened to stoned!!!!! I was shocked - how much effort and observations did those guys spent!!! Unbelievable.
