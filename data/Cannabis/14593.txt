Now, I should preface this next part by saying that right or wrong, I used to drive stoned.  A lot.  As in every day.  I still do it occasionally nowadays, but usually prefer to hold out on smoking until later at night when I know I won't be going out.  On this particular day however, I happened to be one of the only people with a car and was, subsequently, volunteered to drive everybody to the park where we would be hiking.  As I said before, I would usually jump behind the wheel stoned without a second thought.  But even as fucked up as I was on this weed, I still had the presence of mind to hand the keys over to the one person who hadn't smoked up and say, 'You drive.'
