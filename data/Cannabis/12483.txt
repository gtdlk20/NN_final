I want to share an interesting experience I had the other day with Cannabis.  I am a somewhat experienced drug psychonaut.  I have only tried weed, opium, acid, e, shrooms, and salvia, and a number of pharamaceuticals.  The other day I had some high quality buddha and was smoking to myself, because all my friends were either asleep or busy.  So as the night came to an end, I was lying in bed, still pretty damn fried from the smoking I had been doing all day.  I was home alone, so I sparked a bowl while still in bed.  It got me extremely stoned, because this was the last of my bud, so I packed an extra large bowl.
