I suddenly got nauseous again so I stumbled to the bathroom to vomit, but nothing came out. While I was sitting at the toilet, still fading in and out of consciousness, I thought I was standing in my friends backyard drinking malt liquor and kept saying 'I think I need to start heading home in a minute, the rice cakes will be ready soon.' Then I kinda 'popped' back into reality still feeling very nauseous. I never actually threw up, but came very close. Then next 40 minutes or so were spent sitting down at the toilet, falling in/out of reality, and falling over and hitting my head against the bathroom wall. When I finally came down enough to get up and move, I looked into the mirror and saw myself wearing a GIANT orange sombrero; very strange. When I moved into the living room, I collapsed on the couch and passed out until the next morning. And yes, I got a very good nights sleep.
