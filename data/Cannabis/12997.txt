Our friend R had rolled a significantly large joint...he passed it to me and said 'dont put your lips on it, just pull right by the end'. I ignored him and took what was one of the harshest hits ever.  I sat there blowing out smoke for what seemed like an hour.  We packed 2 bowls which went around until they were done, and then repacked.  All of a sudden I feel uneasy, I'm observing people, and it seems im the only one who is affected so strangely.
