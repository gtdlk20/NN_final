Let me start off with some background information.  At the time this experience occured, I was 14 years old (I am 17 now).  I had been raised in the typical anti drug and DARE environment, which had told me that all drugs are extremely dangerous and addictive.  This school of thought made no differentiation between herion and marijuana, and as such, it implied that any drug could kill you or ruin your life if you even tried it once.  I had pledged never to succumb to the temptation of any sort of drug.
