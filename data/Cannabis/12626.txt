Im lucky when it comes to substances. I can take benadryl and not feel sleepy, caffeine or sugar and then go right to bed. But also when I take either weed or alcohol (the only substances I've tried), I need only the slightest amount to become stoned out of my mind or drunk and I never get very paranoid or have a huge hangover. And I always seem to remember everything that happened as well, though that's not always good.
