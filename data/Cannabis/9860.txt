I bought a half ounce for a night, expecting 3 people (including myself) to turn up, O and D. I got home with my stash and rolled up a big joint with about 1/4oz in it. Only O turned up, and we walked up a hill to one of our usual haunts, a nice hilltop bench with a brilliant view of the sky. It was around 8pm this time, and already getting hard to find the floor underneath the cover of trees. We sat down, and sparked up the joint. O took a few tokes on it before curling up on the bench. I proceeded to smoke the rest of it. We started talking about other drugs and whether we would or wouldnt do them, and then started looking at shapes in the sky. O rolled up another joint, just a kingsize one, and started smoking it.
