First we all took a hit off of her bong. I didn't notice anything. I went outside to smoke my joint a couple minutes later while they waited inside for me. After finishing the joint all my myself after about 4 minutes, not inhaling too efficiently as I recall looking back, I was definitely feeling a buzz. It felt very similar to being drunk at the time as my thoughts were much slower. Time and perception of everything was slower. I had the permagrin on when I went inside to get them to smoke theirs.
