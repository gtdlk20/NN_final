Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  Im not scarred of anything but I can NOT stop shaking.  I am also becomming very clouded and everything seems loud and chaotic. Fearing that my anxiety is going to drive me mad by the time this is all over with, I put in Incubus' album 'morning view'.  Its an old CD and I have lot's of good memories involved with it.  After singing a few songs I am starting to feel a little better, and alot higher.
