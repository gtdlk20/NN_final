But now my roomie was back, and so we all headed off to the store, about a minute or so journey down the stairs and into an adjacent building. This is when things became more difficult. At this point, the flashing effect I had been feeling had steadily worsened until now it felt like I also had the spins, and I was also seeing double. Basically, I was getting the flanging effect I get from DXM, except that rather than reality just appearing to be coming in frames, each frame was also rotating slightly, so that it seemed like what would happen if I were both very drunk and also on a low-level robo-trip. As we stepped outside of the dorm building, C looked at me and said, See how your arms are all tense? Its cuz youre cold! Despite his observation, I didnt feel cold at all, which I was pretty proud of.
