I had just smoked weed with a bunch of my friends earlier. I came home pretty late and thought I should try to fall asleep. I usually masturbate before going to bed to help me relax. To me, masturbating baked is just Divine. I was going through the usual things I fantasize about and I also recently saw The Dark Knight. I started fantasizing about the Joker, imagining myself as his evil sidekick/lover. I was trying really desperately to get off but it just wasn't working. I thought to myself, 'hey, I tell everyone I'm bisexual, why don't I think about some chicks?' I started imagining myself having lesbian sex with a girl who was a cross between Harley Quinn (the Jester Girl) and Catwoman. Then somehow they both morphed into me and I was literally fucking myself like two clones. Then as I orgasmed it dawned to me. The only way you can truly know if your gay is if you get off on the opposite sex, which I did for the first time. I've fooled around with girls before and I'm very open about my sexuality but this was the first time I imagined such a scenario on my own. Any girl could just kiss another and proclaim she was bisexual, but in reality that doesn't mean shit. What I had was a profound enlightening experience. It was truly amazing and one of the best sexual/spiritual experience I've ever masturbating alone.
