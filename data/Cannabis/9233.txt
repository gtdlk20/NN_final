Her only real reason for not wanting to was having to work the next day at four and being tired, but BMF still tried. I even threw in a little taste of my own, simply because I like peer pressure. I know, it's twisted. But I laid off, because I only wanted to make one little comment. Soon enough I found myself back with the computers playing some excellent toys I had downloaded. Then, I began to get restless. We had our supple of straws and water, which I carried around with me most of the time because I like water. Of course, I made the mistake of setting them down several times and losing them for extended periods of time.
