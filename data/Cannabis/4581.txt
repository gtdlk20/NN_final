About 30 minutes after ingesting the cupcake, I was browsing the web, and came upon the erowid website, I read with interest the L.E.S.S. method article for determining potency of edible marijuana. I was mildly concerned by the article that I had just eaten the whole cupcake without being a bit more cautious about the quantity I was ingesting. I wasn't feeling anything yet, and proceeded about my day.
