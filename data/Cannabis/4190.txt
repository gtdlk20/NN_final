My head was pulsating strongly, and at the same time felt like all of it was on fire. I couldn't see my cheeks but suspected they were rosy red in color. I instinctively layed down on my bed on the opposite side with my feet by the pillow, and for some reason closed my eyes. I began to encounter a wordly array of images, feelings, scenarios, people, creatures, colors, and combinations thereof. This has happened every time I have smoked this weed since, and is beyond words because of its bizarre nature (and because much of it is later unrecovered by my best memory), but I will attempt to describe it all.
