I think the best way to sum up the feeling is to describe the body as a laggy computer. My reaction to all external stimuli seemed to lag, but only because I was so focused I think the best way to sum up the feeling is to describe the body as a laggy computer. My reaction to all external stimuli seemed to lag, but only because I was so focused and thinking so hard in my own train of thought in another reality. I felt disconnected from the world, and I would travel back to reality and back to my own world, going up and down. All of my senses seemed to follow the same numb lagging sensation including my brain. My hands felt like they were flopping around when I was driving in GT5. Everything on the screen seemed to pop out at me, the picture so bright and vivid, and the letters seemed to move around. My mind would look at something, and the movement of my eyeball would lag shortly behind. Then I would have to process what I saw, often drifting off into some other tangent thought. Sounds were magical, so thought provoking, and I could imagine so much through my new state of mind. I could create a whole new world even out of nothing, and even more so with all the sights and sounds I was trying to analyze. They say artists get there to find inspiration and I could definitely see why. It was so amazing. I was sleepy before, but I didn't want to sleep anymore. I was having too much fun exploring my new world with curiosity.
