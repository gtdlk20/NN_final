I started feeling like I could hear ever ligament and nerve and bone in my body move and click as I moved any part of my body.  I felt as if I was a robot, when I moved my head I felt like It was being moved by gears.  Eventually I had almost convinced myself that I was a robot.  I moved downstairs by my TV, a change of environment seemed to ground me for a minute or two.  Once the effects were back I realized since my head was on gears I could move it to any part of my body.  I could move my head down my sides and see all different perspectives.
