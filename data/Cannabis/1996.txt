The final thing that happened to me in the bathroom was that I obviously lost track of any sense of time, for when I peered at my phone to check the time, it was six o'fuckingclock. I had sat on this toilet for..... drumroll.... 3 fucking hours. How had I done that? It felt like 15 minutes at MOST. Jesus.
