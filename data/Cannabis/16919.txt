So at about 10pm I asked if she would roll me a joint (I was a lazy little bastard back then). I smoked it fairly quickly, barely coughed at all, and was fine for the first 20 minutes or so. Then I let my mind wander, which when I have depression and anxiety AND I happen to have taken a psychoactive/mind altering drug is not such a great idea. I've managed to dislocate both my kneecaps twice in my life, so I have a fairly thorough knowledge of what the sensation of injury feels like; that sudden SHOCK my body gives me. That's what happened to me. I started imagining various injuries on my body and my brain would seemingly trigger that shock in the corresponding place. This went on for a good 15 to 20 minutes, everywhere from my knees, to my arms breaking, shoulders popping, ankles, and worst of all my spine. I had been watching...  Something earlier which involved a spinal injury, so my mind instantly went to it.
