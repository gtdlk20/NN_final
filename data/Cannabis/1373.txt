I looked into the forest deep through towards the lights from nearby houses, and I made an slight effort to imagine as if those lights weren't scant lights in a thin forest, and thus all we were seeing, but rather parts of a lot of light obscured by a thick forest in front of us, and suddenly I was in a much denser forest, looking through seas of trees at far off traces of light that indicated a Elven or fairy festival of sort in the distance. My entire reality changed with my perspective, and I knew what total virtual reality would feel like, someday. Looking upwards, Elwin prompted me to imagine as if the sky wasn't dark and hazy because it was the middle of the night, but only because we were in a hugely dense, thick forest, and the scant light we had was due to the tall canopy of above our heads. And it became true, and it was daytime for us, and we knew the night would be even darker. Elwin actually came to believe this so sincerely he was convinced that we had passed an entire night and the following day in the forest, because he later made several references to 'tomorrow' being Monday and it being 'Sunday night.' We had no real conception of time, and I definitely felt as if it had ceased to be an important factor in this world. It just seemed dark and hazy whenever I thought about the concept, so I gave up on it and enjoyed spiritual tangibility of the present.
