-Tea: THC is not known to be water-soluble but some other cannabinoids are, so I tried mixing a tiny amount (<0.5g) of ganja in with my usual green tea, choosing a mild local strain that can withstand steeping for a long time without becoming bitter. The resulting beverage was foul but it did the trick - an hour after consuming the first cup, I was ready for bed and slept very well. Too well, in fact - I was groggy for a solid hour after waking up.
