As I descended into the forest, I felt a deep respect for the ancient moss-covered natural rock walls, and emerged into the clearing where the huge falls can be viewed. The power was immense, and I felt the huge downwards force having an effect on me, but then I noticed the spray lifting up and floating away - forces balanced, and I picked myself up again. Some (Dutch? German?) tourists looked at me and looked scared and nervous - I don't know why (I don't think it was weed paranoia) - I looked normal and was wearing normal clothing - shit, I even smiled at them, but their reactions made me feel bad, unwelcome in my homeland. I tried to ignore it and made my way further down the track.
