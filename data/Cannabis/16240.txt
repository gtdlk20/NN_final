About an hour and a half in, I was starting to come down slightly. I had the munchies hard, and searched for something to eat. What I realized at this point was how slow time felt to me. It wasnt like getting something to eat was a colossal effort to me, it just felt like it was taking forever. This was actually slightly annoying, especially when trying to set up my amp and guitar later (were both musicians). We chilled and watched TV for a long while. I wasnt paying attention to it because trying to was difficult and it was hard to comprehend what was happening.
