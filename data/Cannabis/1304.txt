These are just a few of the effects of marijuana that I find particularly interesting.  There is indeed much to be learned as to the limits of human perception.  As I have concluded from my usage of the drug, there really is no limit to be spoken of; only factors which cause limitation.  In this day and age, the media strikes me as one such factor, spreading mass amounts of unsupported claims and misinterpretation.  I do, however, see this as a waning trend; society is slowly becoming more informed.  My relationship with this profound plant still progresses, and I am continuing in my efforts to make sense of the drug's impact upon my thought and feeling.  I hope one day to be able to harness the power of marijuana, to strive ever forward in my passion to seek alternate levels of consciousness.  We have only one life to live; why not live it a variety of different ways?
