After tiring ourselves out a litte, we hopped back into the car and headed down towards the movie theatre.  At the time, I was an inexperienced driver and forgot to turn my lights on, even though it was pitch black outside.  On the way there, I think I see the turn off for the movie theatre, so I pull into the left lane.  After a few seconds of bumpy driving, my friend enlightens me to the fact that I'm off the road, which I correct as if it were an everyday occurance.  It wasn't until later that I realised how close to death we'd come.
