First of all, I noticed all the regular feelings: smiling, giggles, confusion, and as usual I couldn't remember where I put my bag of weed and my lighter. Once I found them, I went inside to use my computer, but walking around in my house seemed uncomfortable because it reminded me too much of being sober. Because of that, we decided to go for a walk outside on a bikepath. I brought along 2 cherry cigars for all of us so we could have a good time. At this point people's voices had already begun to get messed up, I was having the whole tin-can effect. Anyway, we proceeded with walking along the pathway, and about 1/2 of the way down this bike-path, everything got slightly blurry and a little harder to focus on. We stopped to rest at a large tree by the ditch, and I noticed a repeating pattern in front of my eyes, like a sheet of this pattern was layed over my field of vision. To put it simple, it was like looking at something thats 99% transparent, so I could barely make this pattern out. At this point I assumed we had some extremely good weed.
