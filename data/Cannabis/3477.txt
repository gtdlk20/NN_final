After blazing two and a half bowls I sat down on the cement outside of my residence and waited for the stuff to kick in. A glittering 'screen' of visuals suddenly covered my peripheral vision and clouded whatever was right in front of my eyes.  My body felt as if it was floating, then falling into an abyss that seemed neverending.  I didn't mind.  I stumbled into the garage and - as stealthily as I could - wandered up to my bedroom.  After laying down on the fouton, I pumped up some 'comfortably numb' by Pink Floyd, and just went along for the ride.  When I closed my eyes, a completely different world floated before me.  Alien, globular lifeforms marched in swarms about a vast desert; then a sudden shift of wind and I was in heaven, looking down upon the vastness of our Earth as everyday people worked their daily lives.  Suddenly, an explosion and I was in space; floating lifelessly towards the sun.  I had no idea simple pot could do this to me!  I had tried 'shrooms before and witnessed visions of splender, but never on weed!  I opened my eyes and the floor was covered with flowers, then a blink of the eye and they were gone.  Every light socket I looked at exploded with red bolts of lightning, electricity soaring into the space before it.  Looking at my ceiling, I realized that it wasn't the ceiling, no, it was the floor! I was floating on top of my room looking down, but up at the same time into a void that seemed to spin as the fan in its center whirled aimlessly.  I closed my eyes again and a being came to me.  It was white with bright blue eyes, fingers like ropes reaching out to me.  I reached for them as well.  When we made contact, the world froze and I was in a forest with the being.  It spoke, simply saying 'do not worry. The world as you see it will end eventually, but will begin again; with me'.
