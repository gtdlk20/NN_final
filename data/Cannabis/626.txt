13:00 gradual increase in & building of effects noted now. Still extremely subtle but I may have caught some imprinting when glancing at & away from a monochrome fractal poster on my wall. There seems to be a little more red, pink & orange in my visible spectrum that might usually be present. I continue to kick back, occassionally fielding psychedelic queries from Sister Moon, her dissertation investigating the psychedelic elemments in the music of Bauhaus. Still very comfortable, mentally & physcally, a very nice, relaxing way to spend a gorgeous summer Saturday
