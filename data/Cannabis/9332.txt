Cannabis usually makes me one of two things each time I smoke it.  I either get real excited, not nervous but my mind is clouded and has a hard time thinking.  If I donÂ’t get the above stated, I get deeply relaxed, muscle tension fades, and it feels as though a door has opened and my brain expands until there is ton of open space around my current thoughts.
