Thankfully I fall asleep and feel relatively normal when I wake up. The unreality is still residual--hugging my boyfriend, whom I love, good-bye for the day feels like I'm holding a stranger. My memory is still a little shot--two college lectures go by me with only some notes written verbatim to show for it. Hopefully, the weed will leave my system quick.
