I could tell I was getting a little too worried. I recognized the feeling from a different experience on a doctor prescribed psychotropic. It was like the gap between thinking something, and believing it, was becoming smaller. It was like the gap between thinking something, and believing it, was becoming smaller. My typical way of dealing with this in life is just to stop my internal dialog and be calm. Several seconds of failing at that was making me anxious, so I switch to a mantra meditation. That made me much happer, so lie there chanting my mantra for a minute or two. Once I was calm, I decided my symptoms didn't match seratonin syndrome, and that all this spiraling ideation was the kind of thing that people said happens when they are high.
