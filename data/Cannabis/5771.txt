So all in all, yesterday's experience with weed was amazin. I have felt like an artist in every genre durin the whole time, was relaxed beyond my mind, and was happier than an alcoholic durin a wine-festival. I wanna try out eatin weed, as well as usin bongs and vaporizers. I really wouldn't mind somethin that would be a lot easier on my throat and lungs - especially when I am passionate about dancin (breakin), hehe.
