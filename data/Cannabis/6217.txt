I casually but confusingly walk over to his kitchen and then circle back around the house and end up back at the couch. At this time I had no clue what I just did or how I got back to the couch. I had no clue it would affect me like this. I wasn't even peaking yet and I was fucking gone. I would sit on the couch for a minute or so and then just snap out of it, and try to think back at what just happened or what I was thinking as I was on the couch a minute ago, and I remember being there, but my mind was totally blank. No thoughts or anything I just sat there staring at the wall until I would snap out of it. I would do that on and off and it would kind of scare me because I wouldn't know when I would go back into it again, but I just said 'fuck it' and sat there feeling blazed.
