The similarity with a light LSD trip was so pronounced that if I had not known, I would haves sworn that I had taken half a tab of LSD. I do wonder whether somehow those first LSD trips have imprinted themselves on my mind so that now when I take edible cannabis the LSD pathways are triggered.  I dont get the same effect from smoked/vaped cannabis, which produces more of a classical cannabis high without any obvious visuals.
