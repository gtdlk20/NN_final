I realized I didn't really have to, but as I looked at the bowl I heard the sound of someone vomiting. I went back to the table and muttered 'did someone throw up,' knowing that no one did since they were still seated at the table with their cards. They looked at me and said I looked pale. I stood there a little longer. The bottoms of my jeans were folded under my heels and it felt as if my foot was giving away where they were pressing against it -- a feeling like my foot was melting around it, or it was cutting into me. Then I realized that C was functioning fine and playing cards, even though she had smoked the same as me and I panicked and thought something was wrong. I didn't want to admit it though, because I felt J and J would be justified in their disapproval. I was also extremely thirsty and my mouth tasted metallic. I remembered reading something about a metallic taste in the mouth associated with death and I panicked again. I got in bed and started to think that I was going to die. I felt I could feel my organs and see them failing. Then I remembered gagging outside and thought that something had gotten lodged in my windpipe and my brain was starving for oxygen (which makes no sense, I was still breathing fine).
