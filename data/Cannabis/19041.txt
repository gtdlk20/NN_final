I've been smoking cannabis for about three years now, so I'd say I'm pretty experienced with joints, bongs etc. Anyway, I was in college around 11am, and met up with a long time stoner friend (lets call him Harris) in the student union. I mentioned I didn't feel like going to lectures that day, and he suggested we have a waterfall each.
