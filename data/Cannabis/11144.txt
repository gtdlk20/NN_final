I was reclined and day dreaming pretty deeply, probably fading in and out, when I suddenly rose, raised my hands towards the ceiling and began chanting GOD! GOD! GOD!  I dont know where it came from or how I started doing it.  I believe I said it 6 times, and I swear I felt better after each time.  Up until this point I was not very religious.  I was unsure about my beliefs, didnt know whether to believe in God or not.  It was clear to me that organized religion was not my thing, and I still feel the same about that.  However, I truly consider this a deep religious experience and I now strongly believe in God.  In reflection, I think it makes perfect sense that the revelation occurred at this time.  My life was somewhat messy at the time, with a lot of loose ends and the like.  Since then I have done my best to clean it up and feel a better sense of direction and purpose, and feel good about being part of something greater.
