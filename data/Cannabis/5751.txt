So we wander around the neighborhood, and then we find a dealer within the vicinity. So I ask the dealer if he's got any trees, he asks how much, and T tells him we want 5 dollars' worth. So we get our weed, and head off to T's home. As soon as we get there, we open up the plastic bag and take the weed out. I tell them I have about 2.5 grams of weed in my stashbox, which I had brought along with me, but the weed we got for 5 bucks apparently seems like 10g more than 5g, and they assumed that by the smell and look, it was probably sess. Good for chillin, not for trippin, but they were wrong. The stuff I had was sess, the stuff we bought was dro. So we decided to chop up the newly bought dro, and put it in a large spliff, and the remainder in a smaller spliff, the sess that I had brought with me would be smoked in a pipe later on. Then came the smokin session.
