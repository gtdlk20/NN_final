My room-mate had just gotten home with a fresh bag of some good green buds around 10 o'clock, or maybe it was closer to 10:30, I'm not too sure. Moneys been a bit tight lately so finally getting a bag after about 4 days of smoking resin felt pretty good within itself. We wanted to get really baked, sit down, enjoy a good bag of green, so we rolled a decent size blunt out of a Royal Blunt Green Apple. I always have liked the Royal Blunts, this new package they use thats lined in what appears to be tinfoil really helps keep the paper moist, that, and they always taste rather good. The pot itself was just Green Bud. It was covered in a decent amount of crystals and was still somewhat moist. Other than the crystals I'd dare say it looked like really good mersh, it just didn't have the Green bud look to it. It was lacking that wonderful green color, instead it was replaced by more of a dull earth green.
