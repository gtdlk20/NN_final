Friday night before my parents left, two of my friends came over and smoked a little, and we ended up laughing on the basement floor for a good half hour, why I don't know. But the next day was even better. Saturday night, what a night it was. Me and three guys smoking in my backyard. Something none of us thought we would be doing - nobody thought they'd ever be stoned at my house, hell, nobody thought they'd ever see me stoned! Good girl gone bad, I guess.
