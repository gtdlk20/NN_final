My heart started fluttering, I feel a tingling throughout my body. I can't say this was immediately pleasant, I was worrying that I was having a heart attack, it wasn't painful, it just didn't feel right. My mouth became very dry. I became slower and more zoned out. Although I think that was made more prominent because I was listening to music with my headphones. (Tycho - Dive)
