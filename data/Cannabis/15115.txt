This past summer was when I started puffing, and my best friend Dan who got me into it bought alot of beasters nugs for a while, and the first time I puffed with those, oh man. About 20 minutes after we smoked, he was playin a game on PS, and I was sittin there watching. And there was something about the music that just made me relax so much, and I just closed my eyes, and it was like I was falling. Even with the littlest thought and motion I could 'change the direction' I was falling.
