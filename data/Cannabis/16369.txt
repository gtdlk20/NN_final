It was a gorgeous day in Upstate New York where my girlfriend rides her horse. The sun was so bright that the snow was rapidly melting, and I didn't even need to wear a coat (this was the first week of feb, by the way.) I waited until no one was around to light my crudely rolled joint. The smoke was very harsh from the paper, so I had to chain smoke quickly, in little puffs. I didn't think I was going to get very high. I WAS VERY WRONG.
