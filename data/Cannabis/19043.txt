If you don't know what a waterfall is, its usually a plastic soda bottle (in this case 500ml). You punch a hole in the bottom, put a gaze over the top, and put the cannabis in that. Then fill the bottle with water (cover the hole!), and burn in the cannabis as you let out the water. Then suck in that white smoke baby. Result: Some seriously good pure hash. Anyways, we had one each (I hadn't had a waterfall before), and decided to head outside on the campus lawn (gorgeous weather). After about 5 minutes, I could tell this was gonna be a strange buzz. Sounds were getting a little distorted, and everything seemed to be moving and sliding around slightly. About 10 minutes after taking the waterfall, my mind just clicked, and suddenly I was really, really trippy! I really can't describe it, but basically my mind was absolutley racing, new thoughts coming into my head every few seconds, and every ten seconds or so I just had to tap myself on the shoulder metaphorically, to remind myself where I was and who I was.
