Today is the day after, and I feel really really drained and foggy. Overall, definitely the highest I have ever ever been and probably ever will be on cannabis. It was a very spiritual experience and it really just opened my eyes to the infinite possibilities and expanse of human consciousness. I don't really want to be that high again ever, but I am very glad that it happened. Never underestimate the power of a good brownie!
