The next morning I awoke around 10 happy with a slight fuzzy feeling.  The fuzzy feeling seamed to last most of that day but I liked it.  I hoped it would stay with me but it faded shortly around 6 pm.  This was my most intense and mellow high on marijuana.  It changed my life in some little aspects, it helped me change my atitude which was bad at the time, and I appreciate life better than I ever did before that cold March day.
