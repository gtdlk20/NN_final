These are the only things I remember, until I began to feel extremely anxious because my boyfriend wanted to go to a party, which I felt too stoned to go to. After that, I threw up for a long while, it seemed like an eternity but it was only about 5 min. I felt so sick at the time that I wanted to swear off weed altogether, and looking back I think the experience might have been worse if I hadnÂ’t had someone watching over me.  I went home and showered and came down a little, felt really horny (sorry!), and spent the rest of the night in my bed watching tv. To this day I have never been so high. With the knowledge I have now, I would have eaten a quarter of what I did. With the knowledge I have now, I would have eaten a quarter of what I did.
