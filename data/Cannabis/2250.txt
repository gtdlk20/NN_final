Hughie tells me again to go to sleep. I tell him 'If I go to sleep I don't think I'll wake up again.' He laughs at me. At the time I really meant that though. I am still moaning, crying, whimpering, and screaming from time to time, but at this point I have given up, I am ready to give in. If I am to die when I close my eyes, so be it. I would rather die at this point than keep feeling what I am feeling. I open my eyes as wide as I can and look at my roommate. I try to say 'If I don't wake up tell everyone I love them and I'm sorry.' But I'm sure what actually came out of my mouth was pure gibberish.
