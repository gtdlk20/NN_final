Laughing and crying became completely interchangeableÂ…I was between sobs with tears rolling down my face and total hysterics. It was completely bizarre; when the crying would start I would feel genuine sorrow and then the laughter would send me right back into a frantic mania. The two feelings seemed so close together that I was having a difficult time separating them again.
