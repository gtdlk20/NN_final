I don't think anyone knew why they came over or how they knew we were there, but nobody cared either. So, we all sat around talking before Ox claimed he wanted to take another 'bump'. We then all went to the kitchen, because to put it frankly, you don't see someone rail some Meth everyday. Everyone took their turn, sans Raz and I, he too afraid he would like it more than he should, and I...well I don't know why. Ox then told me that I could have some if I wanted, but that would be the only time he would ask. He also filled me in that no matter what he had, if I wanted some I could ask and provided he had enough, he's share.
