Sue Bee broke out the 'Blue Box' full of her stash. there was a sandwich bag full of bammer and I got excited, but there was one more thing. Green Bud. Now I had had green bud before, but this had a very stoney smell, Sue Bee said that it was new and real good (by the way, sue bee is about sixty to seventy years old) so I opted to try some. The taste was very sweet, probly what I had smelled coming in. We began passing around the pipe, filled with a full bud (enough to fill the bowl) and we refilled after a few minutes. I tried to hold it in, but it made me cough too much, which I didn't expect because the smoke was very very smooth and light tasting. And for a while, I noticed nothing. The onset was about five or ten minutes longer than normal.
