The rest of the night went by in a strange manner. Later that night, my drunk friend started messing around with some scary punk kids, and he got his skateboard and shoes stolen. I didn't find this situation dangerous at all. I just watched the whole thing and snickered. His brother got the crap beaten out of him later that night, but the whole thing seemed so fake. It wasn't like it actually happened.
