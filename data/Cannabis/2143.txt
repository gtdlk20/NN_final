When I smoke I get the shakes, as in I weirdly twitch.  This really freaked me out as I walked upstairs.  I couldÂ’ve sworn I was a robot version of myself coming to kill the real me.  My shaking fragmented my steps and my movements were jerky and..well, robotic.  I felt like I was a robot implanted with sufficient human wit and compassion.  I was heartbroken that I had been given this empathy and yet was programmed to kill the person my thoughts were modeled on.  This stuff will sound funny when I read this sober, but it is really terrifying.
