After our walk I began to notice subtle shifts in attention span and depth of field.  I felt as though I was speaking from far away.  I remember asking Jim a question and then wondering if I had spoken at all.  He said he felt nothing.  My attention would drift without notice, and then when I became aware of it, I was unsure of how long I had been gone.  My focus seemed to lock onto isolated quadrants, i.e. the plants directly around my feet as we walked, or a tree on the far bank, a spot on the water where the light flashed, etc.  Everything else was perfectly visible, but like a camera with a shallow field of focus, one area was observed with perfect clarity.
