A few months ago, I had a bit of a freak out (to put it mildly).  I have wanted to write down exactly what happened both in my mind and in the real world, but didnt know how to put it.  Well, Im swallowing my pride and doing it.  Its probably not going to be completely coherent, but it is, at least, honest and a very accurate representation of what I perceived to be happening.  Despite my fears and perceptions, the people involved handled the situation brilliantly and I could not have got through it without them.

It started at Toms, while Taya and I were watching The Wonderland Experience with Tom in his bedroom.  At least, I would guess thats when it started.  I dont really have a sense of beginnings with these things, its more of a gradual change.  There are a lot of uncertainties with this kind of experience, but Im pretty sure the frame of mind I was in was a familiar one.  I have been smoking weed for a while now, and I know the risks.  I wont go too far into details, but suffice to say, Ive done my research.  Every experience with the drug is different - I have experienced extreme creativity, elation, philosophy and sadness.  All very different frames of mind, but all common in some way.  There is always a point in the evening when I feel a certain detachment from my universe.  This happens from day to day all the time, but when smoking weed I feel less sensitive to my surroundings, and I can analyse this experience more closely.  

The best way to describe it to someone that doesnt know is this:
When I'm reading a book and my mind trails off - not necessarily away from the story, but doesnt literally read the words on the page.  Suddenly I find myself right at the bottom of a page I dont remember reading, but I know my eyes have scanned the words.  My brain has the words in it somewhere, but I have no real recollection of them.  I visit this frame of mind quite often when stoned.  It can often mean that I dont grasp whats going on in a film were watching, or understand what someone might have said to me, but as its only an intermittent thing, and not all night, its not a big problem, and can often lead to interesting adventures around my mind.  Its sort of like I'm sitting in the back of my head, watching my life play out on a cinema screen.  Thinking about whats happening, and leaving my body to react instinctively.  

Sometimes, when Ive had particularly trippy weed and there are no real distractions around me, I feel like Ive gone up another level altogether, and Im watching my subconscious mind playing with my conscious thoughts while I sit in another cinema in my sub-subconscious.  This sub-sub conscious cinema is very interesting and exciting.  I can introduce a conscious thought, like a picnic in the park, and watch my subconscious flip through files so-to-speak - memories, ideasoften, for some reason, I will see vintage cartoons detailing aspects of the thought.  Cartoons I dont remember seeing in real life, but that my subconscious uses to analyse a thought.  If I try hard enough I can see this happening during the daytime, when not under the influence.  I have come to the conclusion that this is how my brain works.  That makes sense to me, and it seems incredible that I can see these inner workings taking place.

Now, this is all well and good, but one evening, after watching aforementioned Wonderland Experience, a disturbing situation arose.  We had had a few shotties and I was feeling contentedly high.  I sort of remember the beginning and the end of the film, but have very little recollection of what went on in-between.  It is likely that I had a bit of a trip into my sub (or sub-sub) conscious during this time, and came back to reality after that.  

Except I didnt seem to fully return to the real world.  I remember someone putting Family Guy on, and sitting while Taya and Tom laughed and chatted.  I was slowly becoming aware of an unintentional detachment from the room.  Try as I might, I couldnt grasp the storyline on Family Guy.  It wasnt that it was moving too fast, I just couldnt connect jokes to punchlines or anything.  This is not an unfamiliar experience, but it felt a little unnerving because I had a small niggling feeling of claustrophobia, and the sensation that the longer I sat there, the deeper I was falling.  Then I felt like I had been quiet for too long and that I should say something to bring me back to reality. 

Usually at this point, something would come to mind and I would say it, but all I could focus on was the question of what I would say.  I became fixated over the line between my positive and negative thoughts.  I need to say something/what if I cant think of anything? I need to watch the TV/Why cant I understand it? I need to get back to reality/what if I stay like this forever?  This fixation quickly evolved into panic, and I was becoming aware that my heart was beating quickly.  This sometimes happens when smoking weed, but due to me being already paranoid, I became extremely worried.  The fixation of positives and negatives evolved into a logical thought process: what if state of mind followed a long line, with happiness at the top, death at the bottom and whatever was happening to me, right in the middle.  I got more and more worked up about this and decided I was having a panic attack.  I couldnt help but think about the line of mental wellbeing I had conjured up:

Happy

Pondering

Philosophical

Obsession / Fear

Panic Attack

Madness (Alzheimers, Autism, Aspergers etc.)

Unconscious

Heart attack

Death

I truly believe what followed was an episode of utter madness (though I now see madness to be another state of mind that, depending on how far down the rabbit hole one is, one may have the ability to control the outcome).  Tom asked if I was OK.  Apparently I was fidgeting.  I knew that I had felt like I didnt know how I should sit, like sitting was alien to me.  Like being in my own body was alien to me, so naturally I was trying to get comfortable, and this appeared very strange to an outsider.  I suppose it would have appeared similar to a baby in a high chair.  Uncomfortable, but unaware of how to move his body properly to get comfortable.  

Anyway, when Tom quite rightly asked if I was OK, it acted like a catalyst.  It made it not in my head. when Tom quite rightly asked if I was OK, it acted like a catalyst.  It made it not in my head.  Suddenly, my fear that something wasnt right was amplified because others noticed it.  My heart was beating too hard and too fast for me to keep it to myself now, so I decided I absolutely had to say something.  After deliberating how to do this for what I believe to be quite some time, I turned to Taya and said My hearts beating really fast, or words to that effect.  Im not sure how I said this.  I tried to sound calm, but the concern I was feeling must have come through in my voice and Taya started to panic too.  It suddenly occurred to me that I had never witnessed someone panic openly about my health.  I looked at Taya and saw the same questions in her eyes as the ones I was thinking.  Whats wrong with him?, What if we have to go to hospital?, What if its serious?  I said I was having a panic attack, and Tom suggested we go and make a cup of tea.  He was trying to sound calm so that I wouldnt panic any more, and that sort of helped, but I could see that it wasnt real calm, and my mind was telling me that if hes suggesting something new to do, then it must be because something bad is happening to me.  

As I stood up, the full weight of my state of mind hit me.  Even though I was doing and saying things, it felt like I was still in my subconscious cinema.  Rather than just doing things and saying things, it was like I was ordering my body to say and do things.  I could literally feel the delay in reaction and the messages coursing through my nervous system.  Like I was controlling an organic robot from inside.  I suddenly felt another wave of panic as I thought about my heart racing.  It felt like I was controlling how fast it was going.  The more I obsessed, the faster it would beat.  Naturally I thought back to the line of wellbeing.  I was right in the middle of it.  The fact that we were downstairs making a cup of tea was because I was right in the middle of it.  

I began to think that I had the power to decide how far down the line I wanted to go, and that the panic attack was the turning point that allowed me to do this.  It was such a strong feeling that it felt like a certainty.  Like if I concentrated enough, I would make my heart beat so fast it would just stop.  This naturally made me panic, so somehow I calmed myself down again.  Every time the wave of panic came over me, I could feel my muscles tense, my blood throbbing in my ears.  I stood and watched the kettle starting to boil, as the feeling of positive/negative thoughts returned and I began to feel like I had said everything before.  Like I couldnt think of anything but the handful of phrases swimming round my head.  And every time I said one of them, the reply from Tom appeared to be the same as last time (almost as if he was mocking me, though I knew even then that he wasnt).  I paced up and down the kitchen involuntarily, while Tom made Tea.  The atmosphere seemed stale, like it wasnt mine.  The feeling I normally got when I sensed another person in the room wasnt there.  I was just watching Tom make tea in a movie.  Through waves of tears and terror at feeling nothing I managed a conversation, but I am certain now that I perceived it very differently to the actual events:

Me: Is this what mad people feel like?  What if I stay like this?
Tom: Its normal, dont worry.  Just let it wash over you.
Me: What if I stay like this?  Ive said that before.  Its like Im in a loop, every thing keeps repeating like in the movies
Tom: Ha ha, yeah.  It happens sometimes when you smoke weed; its normal dont worry.
Me: Is this what mad people feel like? What if I stay like this? Ive said that before
Tom: Just let it wash over you.
Me: Its like Groundhog day, everything keeps repeating

etc etc etc

I craved something new.  I knew in the back of my mind that I wasnt really experiencing things over and over.  But I was worried that I was perceiving it as such, and that inner turmoil between thinking I was looping, and knowing in my mind it wasnt real brought me back, over and over, to the original thought about my positive and negative thoughts happening in tandem and me not being able to see one without the other.  

I went into the living room and said, This is new! But it didnt feel new; and it didnt feel real either.  Everything still felt plastic.  I couldnt feel a connection to my environment and I kept fixating on that.  I just wanted to go to sleep, in the hopes that I would wake up and it would all be gone.  In a moment of what I thought to be clarity, I realised that I felt like I was looping the last four things I did/said/saw.  Taya came downstairs after presumably hearing me wailing, and I tried to hug her.  I cant remember what I said to her, or if I just cried but I know it was embarrassingly dramatic.  Things were still looping, and I was becoming increasingly saddened by the fact that I could feel her next to me, but only physically.  It was like the instinctive senses werent working properly.  I couldnt sense her in the room, even though I was making physical contact.  I begged her to talk to me about something new, and after some deliberation she asked me what I wanted to get for our shopping the next day.  I couldnt think about it properly.  I think I said a couple of items - peppers, crisps - but it seemed like such an ordeal to think about the real world.  It seemed much more natural to analyse why I couldnt think straight. It seemed much more natural to analyse why I couldnt think straight.  To sit in my mind-cinema and think about what was happening in the real world rather than actually address it.

Tom brought me my cup of Tea, and we all went back upstairs.  I felt like Taya and Tom had decided I was out of it.  Someone may have said something to that effect, but I dont recall.  Interestingly, this seemed to tell me to calm down and not worry, even though I was still feeling disconnected.  I sat down again, back in the bedroom and Tom started doing something on the computer.  Possibly continuing the episode of Family Guy, but I cant remember.  I was still looping every last 4 things that happened.  Tom said I seemed like I was over the worst of it now; but I insisted everything still felt strange and that things were repeating.  

As soon as I had said it, I felt another wave of deja vu and of course another wave of panic.  Then Tom said, It happens sometimes when you smoke weed  I felt angry at Tom because I was sure he had said that last time I spoke about looping, and that he was just mocking me.  Another wave followed.  Shall we do something else? he asked, and we decided to play Halo 3.  Try as I might, I couldnt concentrate on the game, and kept going into autopilot.  All I could think about was that there was a single thought - the idea that positive and negative thoughts happen simultaneously all the time and that if you concentrate on them, you wont be able to think of anything without seeing its positive/negative partner, the everything starts to look/feel/sound the same and you fall back into your subconscious and cant get out - that got me half way down my Line of Wellbeing to Panic Attack, and that once I was in that frame of mind, I could control my mental health by thinking about the possibility that I could control my mental health.  A very confusing thought, but again this is likely to make sense to anyone who has had a philosophical experience with Cannabis.

I wanted to go home, but I felt that if I expressed this desire out loud, it would address the fact that something was wrong again, which would start the whole attack all over again.  I felt my heart beat start to pound again, but this time I managed to ignore it.  I think I would like to call a Taxi, I said Probably the best idea, all things considered.  I had addressed the issue quite eloquently, and for this I felt a swell of pride.  It was the first time since the start of the evening that I had felt anything real or positive so I decided to go with it.

It went on like that for the rest of the night.  Flipping either side of the panic attack on the Line of Wellbeing.  Even waiting for the Taxi outside Toms, I couldnt smile at Taya properly.  It was like I had forgotten how to express emotion.  I was still telling my body to do stuff right up until I got into bed that night.  I was apprehensive about going to sleep now, as my mind would be free to wonder without any visual stimuli, but after two or three waves of small to moderate panic, I finally fell asleep.  It had been a very scary ordeal.  I had obviously unsettled Taya, and for that I felt terrible.  She pointed out to me the next morning that I couldnt recall my address to the Taxi driver.  It wasnt that I didnt know it, I just couldnt stop thinking about the situation.  I couldnt get out of my mind-cinema.

The next day, I felt a lot better.  I even felt vaguely normal.  But it would be a good couple of weeks before I completely recovered.  Reality kept sitting just out of reach.  I decided to call home, to hear my mums voice.  Had I been completely compos mentis I would probably left it a few days before calling her, or at least not blurted out the entire nights events to her, sounding like a hopeless heroin junkie.  It was clear to both Taya and I for the two weeks after the event, that I still wasnt making decisions properly.  

I decided to stay away from weed for at least a couple of weeks.  And even when I do take it, its only in very small doses, among people that understand my situation.  Even now, on a normal day and Im staring into space, and someone asks me if Im OK, I am taken aback for a moment and my heart rate raises slightly.

Tom explained the situation in a unique and helpful way, the next time I saw him.  He said that when I freaked out, I basically fell over a cliffs edge.  The next time I smoke, Ill probably take a tumble down the cliff face again, but Ill find a branch and climb back up - if Im afraid itll happen, it probably will - but my experience tells me it doesnt matter if it does.  Then, the next time, Ill walk along, see the cliff and run away.  A few months down the line, Ill be dancing on the edge, possibly bungee jumping off it.  And in a few years I wont even see it as an issue.  Itll be just something that happened a long time ago.  I like that metaphor.  It makes a lot of sense.  

I have tried weed since, and stopped after a couple of tokes because I could feel myself falling into the trap again.  I dont think the weed was having any effect on me at all (I hadnt had much at all), it was just the fear of it happening again that brought it back.  Once I realised that, I was OK.  I dont like going into my own world too much any more, but its important to know that it doesnt matter if I do.  Its sort of like quicksand.  If the only thing I concentrate on is getting the hell out of it, Ill sink further.  But if I just let it happen, chances are Ill be OK.  I know now that if I do have a panic attack, I have the power to pull myself out of it.  Its just something that can happen to people; weed or not.

As terrifying as it was, I am actually glad of the experience.  For one thing, it taught me a lot about my own mind (something Tom assured me would happen to anyone who takes any drug regularly), and for another, I know now that panic attacks are just something that people can go through, whether it be triggered by a particular frame of mind, or thought; or just a chemical fuck up in their brain.  The main thing is I know I can come out of it now, no matter how fatal it seems.

Cannabis





BODY WEIGHT:
83 kg




This was the fourth time for me to smoke cannabis (marijuana) and the first time for me to feel any effect. The third time I tried I had a faint notion of increased sensitivity, that disappeared completely after about 30 mins. But this time the effect was much stronger. My guess is that I smoked differently, exhaling completely before inhaling the smoke, and keeping it longer in the lungs. Since I don't smoke cigarettes I am not used to smoking at all.

I have never used any psychoactive substances except coffee.

I started around 22:15, and smoked one home made cigarette size full of marijuana.

Noticable effects started after about 5 minutes and came on very slowly but stedaily increasing. I first noticed that my senses had changed. I was suddenly aware of my socks when I walked, they felt like they had a wrong shape or maybe they were too thick. Anyway walking became something I constantly would notice. The feeling in my fingers also changed, it was as if I had band aids on the finger tips. Shortly after that I started sweating lightly in the hands and neck.

When I turned on the tap to drink the water I noticed that it took me longer time to reach it than normally. In general things took slightly longer to do, either that or I was more impatient.  In general things took slightly longer to do, either that or I was more impatient. But since things also tended to move a bit slower it was actually ok. It wasn't difficult to perform any tasks, just a bit annoying that they seemed to take longer time than usual! I started noticing that I kept forgetting what I had just done. But it was very easy to recall again, I just had to concentrate a little and call it back 'manually' so to speak. This feeling of things my body normally does automatically becoming something I had to do manually would be the most recurring notion during this experience.

I kept staring into the air or at the tv while thinking. I would focus on my thinking and forget about things around me. I hadn't eaten anything before smoking, and the slight hunger suddenly became very acute. It was like a sucking, ticklish feeling in the stomach now, but I knew that this was just my normal feeling of being hungry that had 'changed shape' into this new, buzzing, sucking feeling. It was quite annoying. Like if I had eaten some food that had gone bad and I felt I might want to vomit later. My thighs started to buzz too, maybe tickle a little in a way similar to when I have exercised a lot and is relaxing afterwards. I feel like I ought to sweat although it is not hot at all.

A sort of pushing, warm feeling, like being choked a little with a big pillow is forming in my chest. It is obvious that this effect that I am feeling is starting in my chest and is beginning to slowly spread, but with the chest as the center of the action. Breathing is still normal.

I now notice that my sense of hearing has changed too. This becomes more noticable when I step outside. Sounds far away are considered by my brain as of same importance as sounds from events close to me. A door slamming far away gives me a shock! The sound of a dog barking makes me look behind me although the dog is at least hundred meters away.

I go inside and immediately notice that breathing has become more strained. It is not that it hurts, but breathing has become a task I feel I have to do manually instead of an automatic reflex. I keep thinking that I am forgetting to breathe, and then take a couple of deep breaths. The pushing feeling in the chest is more noticable now. I feel like sitting down, relaxing. Another feeling that has changed is the soreness in my muscles from exercising yesterday, especially in the back and neck. Instead of being sore the feeling is more like the feeling I have right before I 'pop' my knuckles or my neck. That pushy feeling that is usually relieved by cracking or popping bones. But I feel very clearly that I shouldn't do that. That it would result in a cramp if I did that. So I try not to pop my knuckles or my neck.

30 minutes have passed now, and the effect is quite strong. Locking the door with the key is a bit complicated, mostly because of my sudden impatience with things. Typing on the keyboard is easy. When I stand up and bend backwards it is like my body will not automatically bend forward again. I have to manually 'step in' and do it or else, I feel, I would get stuck in that position. It is like a lot of the things I normally do unconsciously, have now become manual tasks I have to remember to do. Especially the breathing is annoying.

I drink some soda and feel like burping, but somehow I think I can predict that the burp will 'get stuck' and not come out. Of course it doesn't get stuck and I can feel the air very clearly and distinctly moving up my throat. 

Typing is getting a bit weird. My fingers and me have become sort of separated - separated in time more than in a physical sense. I can think of something and just see my fingers typing along without me telling them what to do. This of course also happens normally, when I am not affected by this drug, but now it is just a lot more obvious. I can easily see my fingers although my gaze is fixed at the screen. It is quite useful actually, that I am able to see all the keys and the screen at the same time. God, those fingers are moving fast and make a fun little dance on the keyboard! I can't help laughing at that.

Breathing is getting easier, or maybe I am getting used to this new task I have to perform. I tend to sit still in one position and not move, more than I usually do, or at least I am more aware of it now. My wrists are glued to the table, but easy to remove if I just focus on doing it. I feel like I am only using my left eye, also the muscles under my right eye are becoming slightly tired.

I go to the bathroom and a little reflection of light in the window gives me a shock. I become aware of a sound downstairs as if it were coming from somewhere close to me upstairs. I can understand if people could become a bit paranoid when smoking this stuff!

The feeling has spread to my lips now. Crumbs on the lips when I am eating potato chips become physical and annoying. 

I go outside again, but I constantly forget where I am walking. It is however very easy to find out, I just have to retrace my route, then I suddenly know exactly where I am. It just doesn't happen automatically - again I manually have to figure it out every time I want to know where I am, it is not remembered automatically.

I get this feeling that my brain constantly tries to predict what it is going to happen, and then when something else happens, I become aware of it, slightly confused, because I thought the thing my brain predicted had actually happened. This feeling of things happening that are not supposed to happen is interesting. It is just minor things, like which hand I will put in the pocket, what something would feel like when I touch it or what kind of sound I will hear when I open the door etc. The incongruence between what happens and what I thought would happen is noticable and slightly weird.

Back inside I notice that if I shift my thoughts to something concrete, something mundane, the effect, the altered state, disappears! But only for a few seconds. As soon as I start to think or let my mind drift, the effect comes back in full glory! But it is good to know I can make it go away like that, even if just for a second. It is as if I can perceive my normal state and this altered state, and can switch between them.

The changed soreness feeling is bothering me as it becomes more present and more pressing although still dull. I feel like I could get a small cramp in my muscles any time. That and the pushing feeling in my chest is what makes this experience uncomfortable.

Breathing is getting very 'manual' again, especially when I write. It is like the effect is going up and down in intensity, like waves on a beach. The feeling has now entered my extremities: ear lobes, finger tips, mouth. Threads from a spider's web that I accidently walk into feel very detailed and complex on my forehead, almost like a chord played by a big orchestra.

Chewing food becomes a minor challenge. A snickers bar becomes a very thick goo immediately which is hard to chew. When I swallow it I can trace its way all the way down through by throat to the stomach! It makes eating a bit uncomfortable - I feel the food might stop any time on it is way to my stomach, choking me. But of course it doesn't.

Sounds reaching my ears sound like they are out of phase, like if you switch the position of the loudspeakers in a sound system! The cursor on the screen, when it reaches the border of the screen looks like it is moving the opposite direction.

Moving my body, tapping my foot etc. makes the effect temporarily disappear. It is like a wild animal that will hide when you move or make some noise, but when you sit still, it comes back. I feel the effect could disappear just like that, any time. It is a thin layer lying on top of my normal senses. I feel the effect could disappear just like that, any time. It is a thin layer lying on top of my normal senses. If I suddenly got up and started to some mundane work, I might forget about the effect. But I am not getting up, I am sitting down, typing, and the effect is quite powerful.

80 minutes have now passed. The effect is still very present. Sore muscles still feel like they are about to cramp. I wonder if this feeling will persist? (but of course it won't).  When I excite a muscle, the effect however immediately disappears, the sense returns to normal, but only for a few seconds. The changed muscle feeling is in many muscles now: back, shoulders, jaw, wrists, fingers, legs. The muscles I am often a bit sore in. 

Hairs in the back of my neck are sensitive. Eyes drying out a bit makes it harder to read. By this time I have gotten used to the manualness of things and the pressure in my chest. I am getting a bit tired. Washing hands is fun, the temperature is very acute, as if I were reading it on a digital thermometer. I try not to bite my cheek or tongue as I am afraid I might bite through it.  Certain keys on the keyboard are hard to type, and I make many typos. 

I try to close my eyes, thinking it might increase the effect, like when getting drunk on alcohol, but actually it has the opposite effect. The effect diminishes when I don't have any visual stimuli. Light is definitely a factor in how intense the feeling is, as it subsides when I go outside in the dark, and is strong when I am in front of the computer monitor. 

I pick up a glass bottle standing on the floor and notice how light it is. Like it was made of thin plastic! I tap on it to make sure it is actually glass. 

Getting tired, so I lie on the couch to watch TV. When I wake up, 2 hours have passed. When I walk around I am still not walking straight, but the effect has decreased a lot. I am hungry and my sense of hearing is still more acute than normal. It is weird that the effect is mostly gone, but hearing small sounds far away, still freaks me out a little. Is this the paranoia after smoking this, that so many talk about?

All in all, an interesting effect although not exactly pleasurable. It might have been different if I had not been tired and hungry, and if I had been in a social setting.

END

The most prominent effects of this trip were:
- The feeling I receive from my senses 'changes shape'. I become aware of them, because they are different from what I am used to
- Sensual inputs become more aggressive and immediate, and the importance of events far away become as high as of events close by
- Pushing effect, like light choking, starting in the chest and spreading to whole body
- Things I do unconsciously become very manual. Afraid that I might stop breathing if I don't remember to do it.
- Brain trying to predict things that would happen, and will assume it has already happened, so that when another thing happens, I become alert because 'something is wrong'.
- Vision was not affected at all (not hallucinogenic)
- Thinking, reasoning, ability to do things etc. was not affected much (contrary to the effects of alcohol)

Cannabis





Well first of all I suppose I should explain why the 25 year gap.  It seems that in my late twenties, I became a little too fond of alcohol.  It was messing up my life.  I was not in control and I experienced several blackouts which I was very disturbed by.  So when it was suggested to me that my problem was that I had become an alcoholic, I reluctantly decided that I had to investigate.  In 1982 I stopped drinking for about 7 months and attended numerous AA meetings.  I kept looking for someone to tell me that I was not an alcoholic.  I was looking in the wrong place.  

I finally concluded that the only way to prove that I wasn't an alcoholic would be to drink again and not have trouble.  Well that worked really well for one evening.  The next night as I was celebrating my new found non-alcoholism, I realized that perhaps I was in trouble.  However, I felt the need for further experimentation and didn't return to AA until the following spring.  One unfortunate side effect of AA indoctrination was that I could no longer party innocently unaware of the knowledge that I was a hopeless alcoholic. In other words AA had ruined my drinking.  So I sobered up again and adopted an AA way of life for the next five years.  I met my husband in AA and married him after three years of sobriety.  After 5 years or so I was very bored with  AA. I had accepted that I could not drink in safety but I was really tired of talking about it.  So I gradually started withdrawing from AA.  Around this time my husband had a material awakening and we both underwent a complete AA detox.  It was a lot like deprogramming ourselves after being in a cult.  Neither of us drank.  Years went by. We had a baby. We had been moving around the country a few times due to school and jobs and landed in California, eventually settling in the foothills east of Sacramento when my daughter was three years old.  Been here ever since. 

I'd always maintained that pot was never my problem but I quit smoking it because it tended to make me forget why I shouldn't drink. I believed that my years of ingesting psychedelics probably forestalled my alcoholism for ten to fifteen years. I also firmly believed that pot should be legalized.  Just because I didn't smoke it didn't mean I wanted to kill anybody else's buzz. Meanwhile time had been seriously  passing. I was well into middle age when my daughter was in middle school. In fact I was usually about ten-fifteen years older than most of the other Moms due to my lost years ( I wasn't really lost, I'd just been traveling a lesser known road) and I was sitting in when they had the guest lecturer on drugs come in to tell the kiddies about the evils of drugs and alcohol.  I used to joke with people that I'd tried every drug that had been invented before I sobered up.  But there were a few I knew nothing about like Ecstasy because it just wasn't well known back then.  Imagine my surprise when I learned that Ecstasy was in fact MDMA which I'd really enjoyed once upon a time.  I was really tickled by that little piece of trivia.  Another interesting surprise was when I heard that Cannabis was supposedly a lot stronger than it used to be.  Now this was intriguing to me.  I was admittedly curious.  But I didn't do anything about it. At least not for another 5 years.  

I'm not exactly sure when I determined that I wanted to smoke pot again.  Maybe it was when the aches and pains of arthritis began to seriously impair my ability to enjoy life.  I kept hurting myself in my efforts to get some healthy exercise.  I had to have knee surgery.  I needed physical therapy for a shoulder injury.  I fell down walking my dog and limped for six months after.  Maybe it was the number of medical marijuana sites I stumbled upon on the Internet.  I started wondering if I should try pot to see if it helped.  

I lived in California after all.  It ought to be easy to get some pot.  Not as easy as you think. I'm now fifty something years old and I live over 3,000 miles away from any of my old connections. I tried asking my doctor if he thought it would help.  He said, It's not the standard of treatment.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Besides, it will make you gain weight.   Very disappointing answer.  Fortunately the woman who sometimes cleans my house had become a pretty good friend.  She was the usual fifteen years younger than me and had kids my daughter's age.  We talked a lot about what we were like as teenagers (so much wilder than kids today).  She mentioned that her husband still smoked pot but claimed that she didn't.  I told her how I didn't now but used to and didn't think here was anything wrong with it.  I'd keep bringing up stuff I'd found about pot on the Internet and how I thought about getting one of those medical marijuana cards and she told me that her husband had gotten one once after getting busted so he could legally smoke during the mandatory rehab period.  I was reluctant to really get one though.  I'm not a big truster in the government's benevolence.  

Finally she admitted to me that she sometimes indulged on weekends and agreed to turn me on. So at last I am able to report on what it's like to get stoned after 25 years of abstinence.  At first I choked.  I'm not accustomed to inhaling hot smoke any more and the first toke was a bit of a shock to my lungs. It didn't taste quite the way I recalled. Of course now that I think about it, there was a lot of variety in the taste of pot back then too and I guess I just had this rosy memory of the very best flavor.  I didn't feel stoned immediately and I wanted to keep smoking even though my friend only took a couple of hits and said she'd had enough.  Silly me.  I smoked approximately 1/3 of a joint of a homegrown sinsimilla that was yellowish green color, sticky with resin.

That Don't take Drugs lecturer at Helen's school was right about it being stronger than it used to be.  The high hasn't changed that much.  You just get there on fewer hits.  I wonder if it's because of the Sinsimilla revolution?  Back in the old days most good pot had tons of seeds.  The more loaded with seeds the greater the concentration of bud.  Yes, we smoked the leaves too.  We weren't a bunch of pot farming connoisseurs back then, we were mostly middle class suburban white kids.  The Internet hadn't been invented yet.  When we talked about different kinds of pot, we identified it by what country it came from, not which plant family.  And we sneered at most home grown.  Good pot was mostly believed to have come from Acapulco, Jamaica or Colombia (of course the little plastic sandwich baggies came from the grocery store so we didn't really know where it came from).  Wheww!  It seems Like I just had a Grampa Simpson moment  just now.  OK, I'm not trying to speak for a generation, I'm just relating my impressions of suburban drug culture in New England in the 70s.  I think I turned on for the first time in 1969 just like most folks on the east coast.  It didn't seem to matter how old you were in 1969 (I was fourteen). That was just the year when the counter culture tidal wave reached the east coast.  

Back to my first experience stoned after 25 years.  I felt the familiar buzz and fuzziness and a smile landed on my face that just wouldn't quit.  Kelly and I became really chatty and almost but not quite tripped over into uncontrolled laughter over nothing in particular.  Time seemed to slow down.  I remember the television was on and wished we had music instead.  

Then I had to get home and make supper.  I took the back way home and used my cruise control so I wouldn't go to fast or slow. [Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]    In a lot of ways I felt like a kid again and felt just a tad sneaky for not telling my husband about it.  We've been married for twenty two years and we've had our ups and downs but we've been in a real good space for the last 3-4 years and I don't want to rock the boat.   I don't want to mess with the marital dynamic just yet. I'm not sure whether I'm making a permanent shift in life style or just experimenting.  My next plan is to try smoking before exercising to see if it prevents pain.  Anyway, nobody noticed anything different at home.  We have a pretty laid back household so it wasn't difficult at all.

The following report is written to provide a speculative look at an unusually psychedelic experience with cannabis. I've provided information about myself here, and things that may have affected the experience. I also wrote the experience out with much detail, so the title of this report may seem out of place for a bit. If this is the only interest of the reader, skip the first 6-7 paragraphs of the experience.

A little about me:
I'm not by any means a regular cannabis user. I've used it about 12-13 times in my life. I usually tell people that it's 'not my plant.' I say this for several reasons. For one, from the first time I used it (however enjoyable it was) it didn't feel like it was part of me. I know people who smoke cannabis on a daily basis--some use it as a recreational ally, some as a detrimental escape from nothing in particular. Suffice to say, I've never been an avid user of recreational drugs. However, I have spent the last year or so of my life in a deep fascination with entheogenic plants/experiences. I do feel the connection with that subject, more so than I'll bother to write here. If I ever get around to it (more so, *when* I get around to it), I'll post my experiences with other plant-teachers, along with some more personal insight and such, under the same nickname. 

If there were one thing I think I should state here, that would have heavy influence on my (or anyone elses) experiences with any drug, is that I have an immense respect for all psychoactive substances. I'm not the most experienced tripper out there by any means, but I take comfort in the sense of wonder I get when I think about the things I've already learned, and have yet to learn down the road-I've found that more times than not, that light of wonder and love of life can take one farther than simply using the drugs.

I try to meditate before I use any of them, and get to a calm and serene state of being so that I am entering the experiment with the most light inside me as possible. As I stated before, I have a deep respect for plant-teachers--However, I am slightly biased towards cannabis, which I feel obliged to include in this report. Up until this experience, it has had little spiritual impact on me (that I have made note of anyway), though it has had a lot of aesthetic value-and sometimes the line between the two is minimal or nonexistent. This could be because I haven't fully allowed myself a full experience of cannabis, but rather have used it as either an experiment in the field, or to enjoy life with friends. I don't feel that either of these are negative, but it's not the road I feel is mine to walk down more than once a blue moon.

Past Drug Experience:

Cannabis, Psilocybin Mushrooms, Salvia Divinorum (standard potency leaf) are the most entheogenic, or most noteworthy in the field of spiritual experiences. I've also experimented with a variety of herbs, including skullcap, kava, white lotus, passionflower, valerian, etc.

The Experience:

Set: serene and social, but slightly anxious
Setting: mountain range

It was a late summer day, and the sun was still in the sky. We (Me [male], S [female] and K [male]) had planned on going on a walk through the woods. We live in northwestern Nevada, so the woods were probably more like a treesy mountain range, rather than a dense and wet Oregon-style forest. I love trees and the outdoors. K grew up there, and S was going to move out there soon, so a walk through the woods sounded great. Me and K drove up there at about 6:30 PM, and S was supposed to meet us there within 10 minutes.

At about 7:00, she hadn't showed up, so we called her on her cell phone. It turns out she had made a mistake on where to meet us, and had been there longer than we had, somewhere else, waiting for us. She drove down with her two cousins in the car, and one of them wanted to drive back home because he wasn't up for the walk. He took the car, and S said that the spot she'd been waiting at was much more scenic and away from developmental areas, so we drove out there. I'm not sure where the time went here, as the rest of the night is kind of a haze as far as time goes, but I think we arrived at the spot at about 8:30, though it only took us about 10 minutes to get there. 

Now as stated before, I'm not one to use cannabis much, and I probably turn it down more than I join in, because it always ends up very recreational with little spiritual value, and I feel like I've done something wrong (medical paranoia-side affect from cannabis, or is it really just not my thing?). However, we were in the woods, which I loved, and I was feeling like it was going to be a good experience, so I figured this would be the ideal time/place to use it.

We all intended on smoking, so we parked the car in the new spot, and headed up a trail for about 100 ft. We came to a 3-way (4-way if u count the way we came from) crossroads, and couldn't decide which way to go, plus it was getting dark. K and I had brought our guitars, but I left mine in the car, as it had no strap to carry it around on, but K brought his with him. Anyway, here we were at the crossroads, me, S, K and J (S's cousin)-and after a short blues riff from K to make a song out of which road to take, we chose one.

About fifty feet down the road, we realized it would be ridiculous to choose a road before we smoked the cannabis, because we might not remember which way back (a night in the middle of the woods with no camping material and some parents expecting us back home that night would be a less-than-desirable experience). We went back to the crossroads, and S filled her glass pipe with the stuff. The amount of cannabis she had can be compared to the size of a half of a French fry--for four people. We saw this and paused for a second to wonder what she was thinking, then verbalized this thought in a bit of skepticism. She assured us that it was very strong, and was enough for everybody, so she lit it up and hit it. It got passed around the four of us for about 5 minutes, and so she put it away and we started talking. From this point on (actually it was more like from the first time we were at the crossroads), K would be playing guitar all night. 

I usually have a 2-minute onset to cannabis, and every time it's the same story. I keep telling myself it won't work this time and that it's not going to affect me, and then it hits me like a sack of bricks and I eat those thoughts at surprise for its potency. 10 minutes later, I was thinking, 'You know, I hate to sound typical, but it really should have kicked in by now.' And as usual, just when I have given up on waiting for it to kick in, it kicked in. 

Some of the things I was experiencing I would consider 'typical cannabis effects,'. First, the strange and foreign feeling that most psychoactives bring with them. Like something is different but it's hard to tell what. This was followed shortly after by the screeching halt of 'normal perception of space and time.' For a second, my body carried on its usual functions, like walking, while the way I perceived it slowed down to the point that it is relatable to being underwater. My mind, however, was still working at full speed. This creates the effect that I think most people laugh and smile about when they are on cannabis. My mind works at full speed, but my body can't process its commands quick enough, and it's kind of a new and funny sensation.

Then comes what I would call the most distinctive effect cannabis has had on me, which is what I call 'the paper doll effect.' This is when the entire world takes on an animated quality and appears as though everything is a 2-dimensional object (like paper) in a 3-dimensional world. Basically, everything looks like paper dolls in a pop-up book.

So all of the aforementioned effects are taking place in the middle of a mountain range trail, when it is getting pretty dark out, so we decide to go for a walk down one of the paths. I ask J if he is feeling the paper doll effect, and he says no. S says that J doesn't usually get very high when he uses it, and K said that he wasn't as up as I was either. S usually feels higher when she uses cannabis with me, most likely because I am a really goofy guy when I am under the influence of it, and it rubs off on her and makes her feel a little more loosened up.

So we are walking down this trail and 3 out of 4 of us are musicians. I try K's guitar, but my body's lack of ability to follow the mind in adequate time disables me in playing most of what I can normally. I tried Al Dimeola style soloing, and it came out as a clump of clumsily muted tones, similar to a 5 year old on speed trying to play the same thing. I gave the guitar back to K, and we proceeded down the ever-darkening dirt road. A minute or so later, K exclaims, 'This is the road that the devil meets you on to take your soul! Like Robert Johnson, we even have a guitar!' and he started to run backwards with J. A bit more of this kind of nonsense happened, and then we started to head back.

The walk back to the car was kind of frightening, as the road seemed much longer and I was getting paranoid. I had just seen the movie The Village, and so had S who was making eerie comments about how those creature could be in these woods. We got back to the car, and pulled a futon out of the back of K's car/van/truck/whatever. We laid it out on the open field of dead pine needles and weeds. This is where it started to get weird for cannabis.

While K was off walking around and playing guitar within 20 ft. of us, me, S and J were lying on the futon, looking up at the stars. These weren't city stars like you see from downtown; this was out in the middle of the woods-type stars. When I focused on the brightest one, all the other ones would start to connect and take on the form of metal jacks, spiraling towards the center of the universe, which was the star I was looking at.

K said, 'If you look at the sky, and hold really still, can you see it move over us?' So we held really still, and sure enough, we saw the sky move over us. It wasn't like something was flying up there, it was like we were being so still, we could witness the cycle of day/night, watching the sky spin on its axis. Then, I would look at one spot in the sky, and I would all of a sudden be looking at an eye, staring right down at me. Then, a spider-web style fractal started spinning towards the eye. I told J and he focused for a second and saw it too. Then S heard us and saw it too.

The fractal changed constantly, from spider webs, to video-game style 3D cubes, to puzzle pieces, to eyes. When it changed to eyes, that's when it really hit me, like 'cannabis has never had this psychedelic of an effect on me before.' The 'eye in the sky' (as Alan Parsons would say) took on a whole tunnel that led up to the heavens. It was exactly like the DMT art I've seen (ex. Alex Gray).

The eye was like there was a tear in the fabric of the heavens, and an eye was peeping through. It was female, and very pretty (I have a thing for eyes anyway). I sat up and looked at K's car, and the fractal persisted. I could see the 3D-block fractal pouring into the tire-area of his car, because that was the darkest part of his car to look at, where I could see it best. The cubes were pink/red/blue/green, but very light in color. Very similar in color to 'blips,' as people call them-a common effect of Psilocybin mushrooms. 

After about another hour of this sky-wonder, we decided to drive back into town. 
This was at about 10 PM. After we got back, we had Del Taco. After about a half hour of talking and eating, we drove S and J home and then K dropped me off and he went home. That night (last night) I slept really well. This all happened yesterday, so I have a fairly clear concept of what happened.

Conclusion:

This is by far the most psychedelic experience I've had with cannabis. I highly doubt that it was laced with anything, as you cannot lace cannabis with any drug (that I am aware of) of that effect. I have never used PCP, but I imagine PCP laced cannabis would be much more disorienting and delirious. Now, I haven't completely ruled out the idea that J and S saw the visions I did because I told them to look for them, and that it was a placebo effect, and maybe that's half of it (or more).

I believe, however, that psychedelic drugs open up doors in the mind, and we experience and perceive things that we are usually shut off to. This would explain why DMT visions are so alike. It is possible, depending on what you personally believe, that all of us walked through the open doors in our minds that night, and experienced something of another dimension, as our minds and spirits caught a glimpse of that reality. I've never known this to be particularly true with cannabis, but this experience shook that ground.

In any event, I feel that what we (or at least I) experienced was real, and am grateful for it, even though I still woke up this morning feeling as though I'd done something wrong (the medical anxiety, or some psychological block, I don't know). That was always the missing link with cannabis- I usually feel like I've misused it, or like I used it selfishly, but this is probably an effect of my own self-analysis and constant strive to do 'the right thing' and be the purist person I can, even though, ironically- I believe that right and wrong is a fallacy, and all things in existence are really just one. Earth being one big ball of matter and complexly-designed life, each grain of sand on the beach taking their own route to the same place. 

Just remember the man, Timothy Leary's words: 'Just relax and float downstream.' Good luck and Best regards.

I really dont know what happened to me on anight of Friday.  It could have been anything from an adverse reaction to a large amount of THC to a full on trip caused by a completely different substance.  In any case, it was an experience I wont soon forget.  This is the 90% unabridged account of what happened next (at least the 90% unabridged account of what I can remember).  The other 10% I doubt I will ever tell to anyone.  Those are some very personal insights that I think Ill leave for myself to ponder.

I should preface this tale with a bit of background about my drug experience.  Though Id smoked a reasonable amount of weed in my life and experimented with E and meth, at the time of this experience I had ZERO experience with hallucinogens and was caught completely off guard by what happened.  That undeniably had a profound impact on what ensued.

The whole thing started as I walked into a dorm room where five or six people were already good and stoned.  One guy, Rick, had just finished rolling a very big joint of what I assumed was the same weed that the rest of the people in the room had just smoked.  Im normally not a big smoker but I was a little irritated at being the only sober person in the immediate vicinity so when Rick asked if anyone wanted to share the joint I said I would take a hit or two.  Rick, one other guy, Mike, and I walked outside into a little courtyard that was surrounded on three sides by the walls of the dorm.  They lit up the joint and we started passing it around.  I wound up taking three hits, the third one really against my better judgment, as I tend to have a very low tolerance for weed.  

My mood for the evening was irritated boredom.  It was a Friday night and I was not at a party (the consensus of the boys in our hall was that a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night spent in the dorms was a wasted night  such is life at a University where the students are ashamed of being *demoted* to the rank of #5 party school in the nation).  I was planning to trek over to another dorm in an hour or two but I decided to smoke a little to pass the time.

The first thing I noticed besides the usual light-headedness was that the scene in the distance, which was a few other buildings and a streetlight or two, seemed to have the qualities of a Thomas Kincaid painting  sparkles of light that just melt perfectly into the surrounding area  mixed with the qualities of a Maxfield Parish painting  smooth textures on everything, broad brushstrokes  especially the sky.  Everything looked painted.  Now I wasnt really worried at this point.  Ive had minor hallucinations like this before while smoking weed  especially at night.  This one would probably qualify as the most pronounced of those minor hallucinations but it was still nothing that really set off alarms in my head.  Mike went inside sometime during all this in order to get us some water  as everybody knows joints are a little hard on the throat (I would later learn that he was already experiencing some pretty intense hallucinations).  When he didnt return after a while, Rick and I decided we would go back inside.  I was feeling the weed very strongly as we reentered the building and I muttered something about how I was going to go up to the drinking fountain.  I weaved my way down the hall, my vision swimming, but thankfully not spinning.  

When I reached the end of the hall, I realized for the first time that I would have to climb stairs to make it to the water fountain.  That was a strange feeling  especially at the point where the stairs reached a landing and doubled back  but I managed to get to the top.  I got my drink of water and decided to go back to my room and go to sleep.  This weed had really knocked me on my ass  or so I thought.  I got back to my room and it was dark except for two computer screens.  My roommate was watching a DVD on his computer and mine had a paused computer game (Baulders Gate 2, for the curious).  I sat down to turn off the computer and thats when things started to get really weird.

In retrospect I could have just used the power button and turned the computer off in a matter of seconds.  But by this point I was starting to get very interested in the way the light from the monitor was highlighting the tops of my fingers and my knuckles  as well as hundreds of folds and wrinkles in my shirt.  It was then that my vision started playing tricks on me.  If you can picture the normal frame rate at which you view life and then imagine having that frame rate cut to two frames per second youll get an idea of what I was seeing.  I was still in the process of shutting down the game and the computer  but that task was somehow relegated to my subconscious as much more interesting things began to happen.  Suddenly I wasnt really in my room.  The surroundings were the same but the scenario in my mind had changed.  I got the sense that I was in a very early 80s music video with very stark lighting and what I could only describe as . . . trippy visuals.  My next thought was that I had been transplanted into the animated movie Heavy Metal, a very . . . trippy . . . movie.  I could see my arms and hands in front of me, but they were not really my own.  Somehow my vision had moved back behind my eyes and I was viewing the scene from inside my head.  After sitting in this state for several moments it finally dawned on me.  I WAS tripping.  

It was a gigantic shock.  I could hardly believe it.  This was NOT what I had signed on for.  I immediately became extremely angry with Rick.  How DARE he.  What the FUCK was he thinking  not telling me what the fuck I was smoking.  I was going to tell him off the next time I saw him  no  punch the bastard out  kill him?  That was when the first onslaught of free associational thinking occurred.  I experienced a cascade of images.  5,000 . . . 10,000 different ways to kill someone.  StabShootRendTearCrushStabStabStabLiverHeartSpineShoot . . . Not pleasant.  This was NOT a good experience.  This is what the anti-drug crazies said would happen.  This is a bad trip.  This is a nightmare.  This is painful.  PAIN.  This is awful.  This is the worst I have ever felt.  This must be what torture feels like.  This is torture . . . THIS.  IS.  HELL.  That realization hit me harder than anything had so far.  I was in hell.

All of this was in a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions that flashed by frighteningly quickly.  I stared paralyzed and wide-eyed at the computer screen, which was displaying the exit graphic for the game.  There was a constant klaxon blaring in my ears.  This sound may have been the single worst part of the entire experience.  The only word I can think of to describe it is oppressive.  It was oppressively loud, oppressively low, oppressively bone/mind rattling.  My consciousness fractured into several different pieces.  One still feebly trying to shut down the computer  one, almost completely detached from the rest, keeping a running monologue and record of the events (at the moment it was repeating the less than helpful mantra This is hell.  This is hell.)  one taking in the incredibly terrifying scene.  Most of the aforementioned pain was focused in a burning sensation that enveloped my whole body.  The game screen was made up most of shades of orange and yellow  which whether or not it caused the burning sensation  did not help.  After several terrifying moments, I somehow managed to turn the computer off.

I experienced my first moment of calm.  As the night wore on I would notice that my sense of hearing was, or at least seemed to be, extremely acute during these respites from the most vivid hallucinations.  I could clearly hear my heightened breathing through my nose.  But I was safe for now.  Bed.  If I could just crawl into bed and close my eyes I would be ok.  I looked to my right at my bed.  It was covered in a mound of clutter that normally would have taken me half a minute to clear, but in my present state it seemed like an insurmountable task.  I grabbed the first couple of things I could get my hands on  a pair of jeans and a shirt.  As I began to carry them towards my closet I remembered a conversation that I had had with a friend of mine about one of his acid trips  I had no idea what I was actually on but I certainly had my suspicions.  I remembered his story about playing the game Diablo before taking acid and then walking into his basement to the sight of people impaled on spikes throughout the room.  

Instead of jumping to that particular hallucination, my mind ran off on a different but related tangent.  Focusing on the game Baulders Gate 2 and all of the little horrors that I had seen while playing it.  My mind positively flew through every detail of the game and came to a stopping point on the giant spiders I had been fighting the day before.  I sputtered there for a second on the edge of a precipice that I knew I had no power to avoid  wondering just how bad this might get.  Was that movement in the shadows of the closet?  Just at that moment, some bit of insight came shooting out of the back of my mind and completely enveloped my brain.  THIS IS NOT A GOOD LINE OF THOUGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think that was the only time during the experience that I was able to bend its direction consciously. 

At this point I reached complete overload for the first time in the evening.  Thank god my mind was off the subject of giant spiders but it was spinning out of control in every direction.  By some chance, my eyes flicked sideways to the left.  It was like I had hit the reset button.  I snapped back into a fairly normal reality.  It was quite a jolt, something like slamming into a wall at a thousand miles per hour, but it was certainly better than the alternative.  I was still acutely aware that I was under the influence of a mind altering drug, but the frame rate had gone back to normal and the light streaming in through the open doorway that lead into the hall was very comforting.  The light is good.  Stay focused on the light.  My internal monologue piped up again.  Ive got to tell Jim  in case I start to lose it at least hell know what the fuck is going on.  I turn around.  Blur.  Whoa.  Definitely still under the influence.  The room settles back down.  I make my way towards my roommate  hes apparently still oblivious to my condition.  I guess I havent done anything too strange.  I put my hand on his shoulder.  He looks up and takes his headphones off.  

I can barely speak but manage to get across the main point that Ive taken something psychedelic.  I tried to express that I hadnt known what it was that I was smoking but Im not sure if that got across.  I started listing outloud every hallucinogenic substance that I thought might have an outside chance of being smokable.  LSD, PCP, K, Opium, Shrooms, Mescaline.  What had I taken into my lungs and bloodstream?

Thank god for two things: 1) Jim is a very calm, levelheaded guy 2) He is a bit of a psychonaut.  He started talking to me in his normal, calm voice, which was immensely comforting to me because it sounded nothing like what I had been hearing inside my head.  I realized that even my own internal monologue had been at screaming intensity in order to be heard over the klaxon sound.  Jims voice was mercifully quiet.  I told him I thought that I was through the most intense part of it.  He laughed a little bit.  Im not so sure about that one.  He continued to talk for a while relating part of his most recent acid trip.  Then he got up and said he was going to go ask exactly what it was I had smoked.  I nodded, not really realizing that I was letting my link with reality walk out the door.  The inside of the room was still dark so I turned around again to stare at the light of the hallway through the open door.  The contrast between light and dark was just too much.  As I watched, the shape of the door began to warp from a rectangle into a parallelogram.  My eyes looked to the left again and the scene snapped back to normal.  This time it was even more jarring and really not worth it.  As I watched the door began to warp again.  The hallucination would not be denied.  This was all just too much for my equilibrium.  I became aware of a strong sense of nausea.  Time to make for the bathroom.  I had resisted the urge until now.  I didnt know what my mind would make of the toilets mini-whirlpool.  Rational thoughts like that would occasionally interject themselves during calm moments of the experience.  I dont think they really helped me do anything other than anticipate the next descent away from rational thought.

The trip to the bathroom was surprisingly normal from what I remember.  Luckily its only two doors down from my room.  I stumbled through the hallway with a slight sense of a rainbow effect from the lights.  I made it to one of the stalls and realized that, along with the nausea, I had what felt like a full bladder.  I might have ignored it except for a vague fear that I might lose all control of bodily functions during another hallucination.  So I stood over the toilet trying my very best to pee.  I dont know how long I stood there, nauseous, trying to piss.  But when I finally did it was in slow motion . . . and musical.  My urine was creating a song as it hit the water in the toilet bowl as if by playing little bells.  Yes, even at the time it seemed weird.  Well I flushed the toilet and switched stalls.  Who wants to stick his head in the bowl of a toilet that hes just pissed in?  I felt as if I would puke any second, but as I knelt, my head in the bowl, breathing hard, I started to notice the way the light was playing off the ripples that my breathing was causing in the water.  My eyes were drawn into the prism, or at least the perceived prism, that was created by the water and the white porcelain beneath it.  Vision seemed to be drawn downward into what, for lack of a better description, I will call a tunnel of light.  If youve ever seen the end of 2001: A space Odyssey, you know what Im talking about.  The only differences were that the apparent speed was much faster and the scene was much brighter.

Again I was conscious of a very loud sound that seemed to envelop me completely.  However, this wasnt the horribly oppressive klaxon of before.  Maybe it was inspired by the musical peeing.  But it seemed to me that I was surrounded by an absolutely massive choir made up entirely of sopranos (given the nature of the hallucination to come I can only speculate that they were angels).  What they sang was wordless and shrill but it did have harmony.  I cant remember most of what I saw in the water of that toilet bowl but most of it was patterns and flashes of light that I think my optic nerve is still recovering from.  Depending on the intensity of what I was seeing, the pitch of the singing would vary.  From relatively low (something that a human soprano might actually have a prayer of hitting) to almost ultrasonic.  The images got perpetually more complex and intense as the hallucination went on.  And then, for just a moment, I saw . . . God.  Not an old man on a throne, but a pattern of colors and light that was simply perfect.  I knew that nothing more complex or beautiful could possibly exist.  Ever.  I just KNEW it was God.  The image flashed away so quickly that I could almost deny that I had seen it.  But then it was BACK.  The choir was screeching such an impossibly high note in my head that I thought I would pass out.  

And I became aware that I was weeping.  Despite all the logical impossibilities, all the contradictions, all the religious crap.  Somehow . . . God.  Did.  Exist.  And then I was laughing uncontrollably at the irony of this little vision.  I was seeing the answers of life, my soul laid bare in the water of a toilet bowl.  I laughed like a madman and cried oceans at the same time.  Irony.  Good Christ.  Somehow my inner observer was still intact and making fun of this situation.

And then it was over.  And I was staring into a lifeless toilet bowl.  And my acute hearing was back.  And I could hear the dripping showerhead two stalls over.  I sat like that for a while.  And then I puked.  Oh god did I ever puke.  And then I dry heaved.  Oh god did I ever dry heave.  At some point Mike came in and started puking in the other stall.  And then Jim came in and asked us if we needed anything.  And then Jim came in again and asked me if I thought I could make it to bed without puking.  Somehow I did.  I pushed all the junk onto the floor and curled up on my bed.  Unconsciousness was mercifully quick.

And so that was it.  From the depths of hell to the rapture of heaven  my first extended hallucination was nothing if not far-ranging.  I never did find out for sure what it was that caused the hallucinations.  Rick swears to this day that it wasnt laced with anything and that he didnt experience anything other than being really stoned.  However, Mike had an experience that was similar in intensity to mine.  I dont really have much choice but to believe Rick and assume that it was just exceptionally potent cannabis - in which case I have just gained a HUGE amount of respect for what I used to consider just weed.  

In retrospect the shape of the experience is not all that surprising.  I can see where and how my most personal fears and curiosities were played out as I watched  mostly powerless  to stop or alter their effects.  It was therapeutic in a way.  Extraordinarily frightening in another.  I wasnt quite myself again for several days.  The bad parts were very bad.  But the good parts were good enough that Im curious to explore this altered state of consciousness again - with a prepared mind and a friendly environment in which to experience it.

I actually wrote this about 4 years ago, and was reading through it randomly tonight and decided to post it.

-----
I ate the quarter of disgusting mushrooms over a 5-minute time span, starting at exactly 7:00 PM. I was at my friend Adams house, hanging out in his basement with a bunch of other friends. Two people had taken rolls, and everyone else was smoking weed. I was really excited about the intense trip that I would experience.

About 8 minutes after consumption, I noticed that the mushrooms were already beginning to kick in. Everything around began to look different. The room became started to seem more noticeable and more real. The colors in the room were gradually becoming brighter. What I was experiencing was nothing very intense, but I was feeling some nervousness. It hadn't even been 10 minutes and I was already feeling the mushrooms. In my entire shrooming career, mushrooms had NEVER kicked in that fast. It occurred to me that I probably shouldnt have eaten so many shrooms on an empty stomach. I decided not to tell anybody that the shrooms were already kicking in. I figured everyone would think that I was just exaggerating anyway.

To relieve the tension I sat down in the chair, but I continued to feel very uncomfortable. I just couldn't relax. This feeling of tension in my body was building up. One of my friends was smoking a joint, and I figured that some pot would relax me and soothe the physical unease that I was experiencing.

'Hey man can I have a hit?' I asked

He gave me the last of the joint and I managed to get a couple of hits off of it. I then went to sit back down but somebody had taken my seat. I wasnt feeling too bad, but I just wanted to sit down and relax. Things were pretty good for the most part, and I was in a good mood. I looked up at the lights and realized how bright they were. I could tell that my pupils were already dilated.

I gazed down at the grey concrete floor and observed the dark shadows cast upon it. Then to my amazement I noticed that the shadows were swirling together and forming strange patterns. It started to look like the dark shades of shadow on the ground were forming images on the floor. Two-dimensional cartoon cars and houses appeared to form on the ground, as well as other various shapes and images. But oddly, I was having trouble telling if the shadows were really forming those strange shapes and patterns or if the mushrooms were kicking in harder than I thought.

'Hey,' I said to somebody. 'Do you see those patterns?' I pointed to the images that were clearly visible on the hard concrete floor, but he just looked at me strangely and didn't answer. I was starting to realize that these vivid pictures decorating the floor werent even there. I was amazed at how real and detailed they looked though, but also slightly nervous by the fact that I couldnt distinguish them from reality. As I continued to observe them they morphed and changed shape.

I was tripping already. It hadnt even been half an hour since I had eaten the mushrooms and I was tripping pretty decently. I knew that I was in for a very intense night, but I was still completely unaware of the experience that I was about to embark upon.

The seeds of nervousness that were already planted in my mind began to grow when my friend turned to me and said 'You know this isn't going to be a good experience. These kids we are with are all lightweights.'

I nodded, but tried to forget what he said. He didnt mean I was going to have a bad trip. He just meant I would feel separated because only two people that we were with had ever tripped before. So I tried to ignore the comment, and push it out of my mind. However nervousness about everything was growing deep inside me. I began to convince myself that I was going to have a bad time. I had a tense feeling in my chest that was steadily building up. I knew not to think this way during a mushroom trip, so I forced my mind onto other thoughts.

I looked back at the lights on the ceiling and they were even brighter now. They were glowing bright white. 'Are my pupils big?' I asked out loud.

My friend looked up at me and said 'Yea they look really big to me and Im all the way across the room.'

I relaxed and began to forget about my physical and mental unease. Everybody sat in a circle, getting ready to smoke some weed, so I took a seat on the couch. Weed was just what I needed. I wanted to relax a little, and I was sure the weed would calm my stomach. Plus smoking weed is awesome on shrooms. Somebody pulled out a bong and started passing it around. When it came to me I took a massive hit. I just kept inhaling more and more smoke because I couldn't feel any smoke in my lungs. I held the hit in for a while and then finally exhaled a huge cloud of smoke. After that, I sat back, and waited for the weed to relax me some more.

I looked over at one of my friends, and he started to climb a pole in Adam's basement. He had taken a hit of ecstasy earlier, and it was starting to kick in. I turned away and leaned back on the couch. My body was beginning to feel heavy. The shrooms were really grabbing a hold of my brain. When I looked back I saw that two of my friends (both were rolling) were hanging from a pole on the ceiling. What the fuck? This was too weird for my altered state to make sense of, so I just ignored it.

I started talking to somebody else to distract myself from the crazy kids on ecstasy hanging from the ceiling. He was saying something about me having a crazy grin on my face. As I listened to my friend talk, he started to sound further and further away. I could barely hear him at all. It was like trying to listen to him from underwater. His voice sounded muffled and distorted. Everything around me looked and sounded so distant. Then I heard two people talking to each other, although I didn't know who was saying what. Their voices sounded very distant.

'This is so weird, normally we are the people who are always fucked up'

'Yeah but this time everybody else is fucked up and we are sober'

Fucked up? Was I fucked up? No, I was normal. I started to forget where I was, believing that I was at my friend Dans house. I could see his room, his bed, his carpet. I quickly snapped out of it though and realized where I actually was. Then my mind returned to its previous thoughts. Fucked up? I couldnt be fucked up. I didnt understand the concept of hallucinogens, or even drugs in general. How could they alter consciousness? Why would I want to alter my consciousness? What the hell was consciousness anyway? What was going on? 

I was feeling very uncomfortable now. My stomach was very tense, and my body felt weird and unfamiliar. My sense of gravity was severely altered. It felt like I was sinking deeper and deeper into the couch. I sat up straight because I didn't like that feeling. But sitting up didn't feel right either. I needed to stay as relaxed as possible, and when I sat up my body felt like it was being pulled from different directions. So I laid back against the couch and once again felt like something was pushing me into it. The feeling was very similar to the pulling sensation I experienced on salvia. I looked at my hands and legs and they didn't seem like they were mine. Just like when I was on salvia.

Salvia. Am I on salvia??? I wasnt sure. Everything started to seem exactly like salvia, and I had a feeling mushrooms and salvia were related somehow. This was making me very nervous, because I didn't want to be this fucked up. The Salvia universe was the last place that I wanted to go. Suddenly I just wanted it all to end. I wanted to know how much longer I would be tripping for, how much more of this uncomfortable madness I would have to endure.

'What time is it?' I asked my friend.

'Its 7:30' he said.

'Okay,' I said. But the numbers had no real meaning to me. It had been half an hour since I had eaten the shrooms and I was already tripping much harder than I ever had before. I sat back and felt the pulling sensation return, but it was even stronger now. The couch was trying to pull me into it!!! I quickly sat back up again but gravity felt so weird. I couldn't get comfortable. It was getting very scary. My sense of time was completely destroyed by now. After enduring what seemed to be a couple hours of this sinking feeling, I asked my friend what time it was again.

'It's midnight' he said jokingly. Even though it felt like hours had passed I guess only a minute had. However, I believed him when he told me that it was midnight.

'IT'S MIDNIGHT??? I exclaimed. I gotta go home!!! Will somebody drive me home?'

'Ha ha its not actually midnight' he said laughingly. Im just joking. Its only been like a minute since you asked me.

'Oh,' I said. I tried to forget it but I couldnt get the thought of it being midnight out of the back of my mind. I sat on the couch, enduring my mushroom trip. I waited a few hours, struggling to keep my sanity. 'What time is it?' I asked him again a long time later.

'It's midnight now, he said again.

Oh no! It really was midnight this time! I knew because I could tell a long time had passed since I last asked him. I was still tripping too! I didnt want to get home too late or my parents might get really mad. 'I have to go home!!!' I told him

'Relax, Im just joking' He said and once again laughed. You keep asking that every 30 seconds.

My sense of time was so distorted that I seriously thought four hours had passed in those 30 seconds. Time was becoming extremely dilated. Every second was being stretched out so that each moment felt like an hour.

'Messing with his mind like that is the worst thing you can to do somebody who is tripping' I heard somebody say.

Tripping? Was I tripping?? What the hell? I wasn't tripping. I was getting really freaked out now. Slowly my friends were beginning to look more and more unfamiliar to me. I didn't know what was going on. I heard Adam shouting loudly. That made me even more uncomfortable. I suddenly realized that this was a bad place to eat shrooms. I didnt like being here normally, let alone shrooming. I didn't know or care what time it was anymore, all I knew is that I wanted to go home. I hadnt been careful enough about setting. I was having such a bad time because I was at a place I didnt like. But how would I get home? It was too far to walk, and I hadnt driven there. Somebody would be nice enough to drive me home. These people were all my friends. They would understand that I didnt want to be here, and they would be more than willing to drive me.

'Will somebody drive me home???' I asked.

Everybody seemed confused that I wanted to leave since it wasn't even 8 PM on a Friday evening. And nobody wanted to leave to drive me home.

I remember somebody saying 'Why do you want to go home? Don't you want to stay with your friends?' His voice sounded distorted and unfamiliar.

Friends? I was confused. By this point I didnt even recognize anybody anymore. 'Uh no I just want to go home. Why won't anybody drive me home?'

'Nobody has a car to drive you home right now.' He said. This was totally ridiculous since everybody had their cars there, but at the time I believed him.

'Oh I understand,' I said. It seemed to make perfect sense to me at the time. So I began walking around. The room was looking unbelievably bizarre now. Every color was more intense than any color I had ever seen. It was almost like everything was glowing. I walked over and stared at the unplugged pinball machine in the corner, trying to keep myself entertained. I could feel the spiritual energy coming. I knew something BIG was on its way.

But soon the idea of wanting to go home crept back into my head. I asked for people to drive me home again, but nobody would. Everybody was looking at me like I was completely insane, and I couldnt understand why. I felt really scared. Was I insane? I never thought that I was insane. But what if I was? What if I had been for a long time and had never realized it. Everybody who met me would be nice to me, but they were really just being nice to the retarded kid. I had become one of the prime examples of how drugs could completely destroy somebodys mind. And I had never even realized it. I could see myself walking through the halls at school, talking to people, feeling completely normal. But then everybody would look at me sadly as I was walking away and think Its so sad what drugs can do to somebody. Was I one of those kids who were mentally challenged and I just didn't realize it? Were drugs the reason why? Everybody was treating me strangely, looking at me strangely. Something was wrong but I couldnt figure out what. They were all staring at me with concerned looks on their faces. They all looked so unfamiliar. I felt like a little kid on a hospital table, being stared at by a bunch of strange adult doctors while a bright spotlight blinded me. Their faces looked warped and distorted.

'Are you starting to feel scared?' somebody asked me.

Im just really confused. I said. My voice sounded so unfamiliar. I wasnt really feeling terror or panic. But the distortion, the confusion, it was overwhelming.

Are you thinking that you want it to stop?

'YeahmaybeI dunno what's going on, I just want to go home.' I said, filled with paranoia. Everybody was staring at me. There was something wrong with me. But what?

'That's what had happened to me too' he said to somebody else. Then he turned to me and said 'Nobody can drive you home right now. Here, just lay down on the couch for a while.'

I laid down on the couch and tried to go to sleep. By this point, all I wanted was for this to end. I tried to sleep it off, but when I closed my eyes all I could see were colors and colors and colors. There were hundreds of intense bright colors, moving around and changing and flowing. This was insane. I was so shaky, I looked at my hands and they were drenched in sweat. It felt like I was tripping on acid. Only it was crazier.

'Don't go to sleep,' Somebody said to me. 'You're going to waste the trip.'

'Haha, he's not going to fall asleep' Someone else replied.

They sounded millions of miles away. I laid there on the couch with my eyes closed, confused, staring at the bright colors which danced behind my eyes. I couldnt sleep it off. I sat up. I didnt feel good. I felt sick. Very very sick.

'Here, take you shoes, off, get comfortable' A kid who was rolling said to me. I must have mentioned that I was feeling sick. 'If you have to throw up, try to do it in this bucket. If you don't make it in the bucket though thats okay, we will clean it up.' I didn't want to throw up. I don't know why but I was suddenly determined not to vomit. The nausea in my stomach was steadily increasing but I fought it.

'I'm so cold!' I said. My body was freezing; I had never felt so cold in my life. I felt icy, but the feeling wasnt just covering my body. The cold was deep inside me as well. It was so uncomfortable that I was shaking. He gave me his green plaid shirt to wear, but I was too confused to put the shirt on.

'Here, put one arm in one sleeve, and the other arm in the other.' He told me. I tried but I couldn't manage to do it. It was like seeing a shirt for the first time. I couldnt filter my vision to figure out what I was seeing. There was just a mass of random colors and shapes. No dont just put it around you, put your arms in the sleeves. He said. I still wasnt doing it right and so eventually he just put the shirt on me. Then he got somebody elses sweatshirts and put that on me as well.

I returned to the couch, laying on my stomach and trying to sleep my trip off. I should have known by now that there was no way to sleep off a trip, but it was the only thing I wanted to do. I looked down at the shirt I was wearing but realized that I had never seen it before. I had already forgotten that I was wearing somebody elses shirt. This added to my sense of total confusion.

As I continued to lie on the couch, gravity suddenly stopped existing. The couch was sideways. Then it was spinning. Then it was upside down so that it was on top of me, crushing me. My face was being smothered in the pillows. I couldn't breath. I was drowning in it. The couch was a red liquid ocean and I was drowning in it. I wanted to get up, to tell somebody that I was dying but I couldn't move. I felt like I was suffocating in the couch. Nobody seemed to notice that I was dying either. Something was going very wrong in my body. Why wasnt anyone paying attention to me?

Suddenly I realized the severity of what was happening. I had always known that I was going to die, that my life on this earth would have to come to an end eventually. But now it was ACTUALLY happening. I felt filled with fear at what was going to happen. It was all ending. Soon my body, the body that had been mine for so many years, would just be lifeless laying in this basement. My life, my memories, my self, would all be gone. I thought about my parents. They would be so upset about it. But by this point it was too late, there was nothing I could do. I couldnt hold on any longer. And I felt myself die. It was scary. My heart wasnt beating in my body anymore, I wasnt breathing, everything was going wrong in my brain. 

And then it was over. The frantic panic dissolved into serene calm. Suddenly it wasn't scary anymore. I became one with the trees, the grass, the world. I felt my soul stretch towards infinity. Feeling myself becoming part of the millions of galaxies existing throughout the universe. I was seeing visions of the stars and heavens glowing brilliantly. Swirls of universes, the amazing heavens, it was more amazing than any picture of outer space that you could ever see. And I was part of it all again. It had always been like this. This was all so familiar. Something that you forget when you are alive, but once its over you become a part of everything again and remember. And it was amazing.

Forever later, a friend was talking to me. Somehow I was processing earth again. I was processing life again. But the mushroom trip was only getting stronger. I was completely unaware of what was going on. He was saying something like, Relax, just remember that itll be over in a few hours.

It would be over??? I momentarily started to realize that I was shrooming. I was still very confused, but hearing that made me feel a lot less frightened. It would all be over eventually. I remembered that it was Friday, and I hoped that I would stop tripping before school started on Monday, but I was pretty sure I wouldnt. Time was completely distorted and I started going through what seemed to be hours in a matter of seconds. I was fast forwarding through Friday, and then Saturday, and then Sunday. The time for me to have to go to school was coming closer and closer and I was still tripping. In reality only a couple seconds had passed but I didnt realize this. As far as I was concerned, I was living hours and hours in moments. It was Monday morning.

I started walking around. I remember somebody put a bunch of pillows on the floor and said 'Hey , do you want to jump on these pillows?' I was confused, why would I want to do that?

No I said.

He kept giving me suggestions on things to do and I kept doing them. Soon he said These are all just suggestions you know. You can do whatever you want.

This was amazing. I suddenly felt free. Like I had been trapped in a negative state of thought, and now I was free. I didnt have to do anything I didnt want to. I didnt have to follow him, or anybody else. I was embarking on an amazing journey, and I could choose where I wanted it to go. I had complete freedom to do anything I wanted. To go anywhere I wanted. To live anyway that I wanted. Life felt incredible. I started walking, not sure where I was going but knowing that it would be beyond amazing. I was on an adventure. I walked out the door and stood in Adams backyard, looking around. I wanted to keep walking outside but it was so cold and rainy, so I decided to go back inside.

I kept walking around on the journey of my soul, traveling miles in the small basement. I realized that I was completely amazed at the power of the mushroom. I was tapping into vast amounts of universal information. I saw a library of information stretching out in front of me. Endless shelves, filled with row after row of books on every subject matter, stretching out in every direction towards infinity. This feeling was beyond amazing. I was in contact with the mushroom spirit now and it was guiding me along. This mushroom spirit was ancient, yet so familiar. It had been around for so long, it had seen the earth when it was a totally different place. This ancient spirit had been around for thousands of years, and would be around for thousands more to see the future worlds.

I was walking by somebody, barely aware of any concept of reality, and he said Hey look at these rugs, what trippy things are you seeing in it?

I realized I was walking by two rectangular rugs with intricate designs weaved into them. I looked at one and it shifted from two dimensional to three-dimensional. It kept gaining a sense of depth and slowly became a portal to another world. I gave some nonsensical answer to my friend about what I was seeing and he didnt understand it. Then I walked right through the portal!

I remembered watching Gumby as a little kid. There was an episode when they walked through some Chinese painting and ended up in China. I saw all of this happening in my mind and realized that was exactly what was happening to me. I was going through this rug and into the same world that Gumby had went into. I was seeing strange claymation figures of Gumby characters and wandering through a fantasy claymation world

At some point a friend was talking to me. I didnt really hear most of what he was saying, but I remember him saying, Yeah, youve tripped plenty of times before.

TRIPPED.

The word got stuck in my head. It was something magical to explain the magic that was being cast upon me. Everything was magical. I was in a magical new world now. Tripped. Tripped. Tripped.

FLASH.

When I thought of the word tripped, there was a flash and I traveled somewhere new. I became waves of energy which were rippling across time and space, transporting me somewhere else. Suddenly I found myself sitting in my first period English class. Every color was so vivid and intense. The bright red floor seemed to be glowing. My English teacher had a crazy grin on her face, like she was intoxicated on the magic in the air that I was feeling.

FLASH.

I thought of the word TRIP again and in a flash I once again I traveled somewhere new. I once again became rippeling waves of energy and was transported. There were these strange adults standing around talking about me. They had that same strange grin that my English teacher had. There was magic in the air. I could see it, I could touch it. They understood the magic of these mushrooms. You eat them and permanently enter this new world. I was going to be in this state forever. In this magical world for the rest of my life.

In the background of this traveling I heard the distant voice of somebody ( I think it was Dave) say to somebody else, Cops dont even care. Did you hear about the guy that was caught tripping by channel 2 news?

Cops dont even care? In a second I was transported to another place. I was seeing places that I would be in the future. People standing around me, grinning that same crazy grin. The mushroom kept transporting me from one spot to another to another with these flashes. I was soaring across time and space.

And that is when I got stuck in the time loop. In my head I once again heard Daves words Did you hear the guy that was caught tripping by channel 2 news? And then the spirit of the mushroom showed me something that completely blew my mind. The person who had gotten caught by channel 2 news was ME! Although it hadnt happened to me yet, I knew that I was the person they were talking about. It hadnt happened yet but it would by the end of the night. I was probably going to wander outside and get lost. Somehow I was going to be caught by the channel 2 news. I was seeing what would happen. People would be filming me, laughing while I wandered around completely disoriented. But they werent mad that I was on drugs; they just found it humorous that I was tripping so hard. All those people had the same crazy grin on their face too. I knew that it was bad to be caught tripping, but it I knew I wouldnt get in trouble because Cops dont even care. Then the mushroom showed me the news clip that would be showed on the news of me. In the clip I was wandering around completely disoriented, but the news wasnt making a big deal over how a horrible drug epidemic is taking over the town. Instead they just laughed happily. They didnt even give out my identity or show my face. Thats because I was in this new, magical world now, where everybody seemed to be intoxicated by the magic in the air. Then the mushrooms showed me Dave sitting in his house watching this story on TV, except he didnt know that it was me who had been caught tripping because the news hadnt released my identity. He then came to Adams later that day. I ended up taking Shrooms at Adams and while I was Shrooming Dave said Did you hear about the guy who was caught tripping by channel 2 news?. And so I was stuck in some strange sort of time loop. It all came back to itself in some sort of strange circle, but even though it hadnt happened yet, I knew that I was the one who was going to be caught by channel 2 news. 

Soon I was walking on those rugs again, staring at the patterns. But time was going backwards now. I was getting younger and younger. I felt like a 6 year old, wandering around. I kept getting younger and younger, and soon I was a 3 year old. I looked at my friends green plaid shirt, which I was still wearing, and thought back to when it had been put on me. I had completely forgotten that he had put it on me. Instead I was seeing my parents putting it on me, and then I was at some day care. I thought I was at the day care I used to go to when I was little. But I kept getting younger and younger as time rewound faster. Soon I was a baby again. It was amazing; I was getting closer and closer to the creation of my existence. I would soon know what happened before I was born. I kept getting younger and younger until I reached the point before I was born. And WOW.

Suddenly a million memories started flooding back to me. But they werent memories from my life. They were memories of the ultimate truth. The answer to every question. This is definitely the hardest part of the trip to explain. It was like an incredible never ending déjà vu. The feeling kept getting stronger and stronger as I was soaring through this new spiritual dimension, I didnt have a body to hold me down. Nor did I have a self to hold me together. When you are on the earth existence, its like you have blinders on, making you forget about the truth. But once you leave the earth world, the spiritual understanding comes back to you.

Thinking back to earth life, and remembering how I was always trying to understand what life really was. But I couldnt understand it because I had those blinders on. But now I was back to the place where my soul had initially came from. My soul was continuously moving faster and faster through this new world, uniting with it. Realizing that it had never been separate from this world. The seperateness was just an illusion. This was my true home. As I thought back to that earth existence, I realized that eventually I would have to go back there. Once again, Id have to live another life confused about existence with my blinders on. But it didnt matter, because no matter how long it seemed that I would be in that world, it was really only a tiny amount of time compared to how long Id stay in the ultimate truth once I died again. And then I would come back to my souls true home and reunite with the ultimate. And then I would have to go back to the earth world again. I would be eternally switching back and forth between these two places. I then realized that I always had been switching back and forth between these two worlds since the creation of the universe. I had lived a million lives and would live a million more.

Basically existence is in the shape of an enormous circle. There is our lifespan on earth, which is about one hundreth of the circle. And the rest of the circle is the ultimate truth. Our soul travels along the circle. We travel along the 1/10th that is existence on earth, and then we die and travel along the rest of the circle. Eventually we come back to the beginning of earth existence and are forced to separate and live another life. Once I entered the ultimate truth I remembered all of this. Every time anybody dies they start to remember this as they travel along the circle. I was following the ultimate path, and everything made sense. I didnt understand it, but I knew the universe was guiding me along this ultimate path, this journey of my soul. And the path was paved with colors: reds, yellows, and greens, and a million colors I had never known existed. It was beyond words.

Im not sure how long I was in that state. I slowly began to become aware of what was going on around me. I vaguely remember sitting on a chair while somebody was spinning it around. And I also vaguely remember that later I picked up the chair and threw it across the room. I didnt realize I had thrown it. I didnt know gravity existed anymore, and so from my perspective I just pushed it up into the air. It slowly rose into the air and seemed to float. Since gravity didnt exist, I thought it would just stay up in the air. But then it suddenly clattered to the ground and waves of sound echoed through the universe. My friends just laughed at me. I was still aware that I was in this ultimate truth, even though consciousness was returning to my body again. I was still walking around, still on this incredible journey. I remember hearing somebody said something about cigarettes. I wondered if I wanted a cigarette, but then I realized I didnt smoke. I thought about how they were all smoking weed, and for the first time in my life it seemed stupid to me. There was no reason for me to smoke weed anymore. Or do any drugs anymore. I thought about the mushrooms I was growing. I was going to stop growing them. I was going to throw them out when I got home.. I saw myself at home taking the cakes and throwing them all out. Good thing I wasnt home or I probably would have.

After a few million eternities the ultimate truth faded from my mind. Then came probably the most shocking part of the experience. I started to come back to reality, to realize where I was. I saw all my friends around me and suddenly remembered who they were. I realized that I was in Adam's basement. I wasnt at school, I wasnt in Gumby Land, I wasnt in some ultimate universal state of existence. I hadnt figured out the answer to life and death at all. Then I remembered that I had eaten mushrooms. This freaked me out more than anything else that happened during the trip. I had been completely delusional for the last few hours. I had intended to have a fun exciting trip, but then ended becoming totally insane. I had been so happy to finally understand the universe, but now realized none of it had been real. For the majority of the trip I hadnt even realized that I was under the influence of a drug, I had been convinced that it was all real.

I was still tripping for a while after this realization. I was giddy and excited, wandering around looking at things. The grain on the table would start patterning itself and moving and changing. I looked at the lights and saw rainbows around them. Some other things happened to but I was just amazed at what the mushrooms had done to me.

I remember my friend saying to me 'Arent you glad that we didnt drive you home???'

I suddenly remembered how at the beginning I had wanted to go home so badly. I was so glad I didnt go home, I would have gotten caught by my parents for sure. I was totally delusional for hours.

Finally it was time to leave. We were outside, and it was raining. I was amazed at how beautiful it was outside. The raindrops on the car windows were crystal-like and shimmering. The air smelled amazing and everything looked fresh and new. If I focused on things I could still make them move and change. I got home and kept tripping lightly for a little while.

Although it was a very intense and at times unpleasant experience, I still feel that I learned a lot from it. I had an adventure through space and time that I never knew was possible. I came face to face with my own mortality and feel that I am a little more prepared. And above all, I realized that even though the trip was all a big hallucination, that reality and life and death is still much crazier than it seems, and there is something incredible going on. I was amazed at how totally out of touch with reality those mushrooms had gotten me. I hadnt known where I was, who I was, or what was going on. It was like having an incredible dream, a dream in which you get what you had always wanted. And then waking up and realizing it wasn't true, it was all a dream. That is how I felt as I was coming down from this experience. It actually disturbed me a little to realize anything could put me in such a distorted state. And that is why I will never eat a quarter of mushrooms again. Well... at least not anytime soon.

The End :-]

NOTE: The main reason I have decided to post this relatively mild cannabis 'trip' (I will use the term trip very loosely in this report, in the first two trips they are more feelings and sensations than actual visuals, but in the 3rd and 4th I would classify them as mild tripping, as there is some distortion and vague formations) and not my Acid experiences is that my Acid experiences are not as meaningful; all I seemed to get was interlocking geometric patterns in time with the enhanced music, with a large euphoric feeling (basic standard stuff really).  However from my Cannabis 'trip' I felt something really deeply, and I can remember what I was thinking, not just what I was seeing, unlike Acid.

Past drugs taken and When the Experience Happened: Acid, taken twice, last new years eve and the one before that (I have never experienced flash backs or HPPD). I've been smoking pot for about half a year now, on average 2 or 3 tokes on a Jay (tobacco with hash) every week, more rarely I have a big smoking session with Skunk in either bongs, blunts and pipes about every month or so.  I drink alcohol for social purposes only, and I don't smoke pure tobacco (unless its in a hash mix).  Before this experience I had last smoked cannabis about a week from then.  This experience happened on a Wednesday, about a couple of months ago from now.

Where I was, Whom I was with, What my Mood was: I was in Stoke Park, Guildford, England.  The Weather was nice, although I remember the wind got a little cold and harsh, although the skies were clear with the sun out to play.  I had just finished my last major college exam, so I was obviously relieved and extremely happy when it was all finished.  I was with one of my friends, Dave, who I know only through college, and I have known him for about a year.  He's the heaviest and most experienced Cannabis user I know, so he's the one who usually has some Skunk or Hash on him.  On that day he said he had some rather strong Skunk to celebrate with... 

The Experience: We walked from the college to Stoke Park and sat down in a fairly remote place in some nice lush green grass (there were a few people visible, but they were too far away to see what we were doing, or smell the pot).  After we sat down and got comfortable, I asked if the Skunk was Sensimilla or Super Skunk which he replied: 'No, just some really strong stuff I got from a good mate.'  I trusted him - he was going to smoking it too, and he's very experienced.  I looked at the skunk later on when he was crumbling it into his pipe: it didn't appear to have any strange crystals on it, and it didn't appear to be soggy.  However it did crumble really finely I seem to remember my friend saying.  Before we started doing the pipes we did have two Jays prepared by Dave, each of which we shared.  

At first I didn't get much of a stoned sensation from these, just the first stage where you suddenly feel that everything's changed but looks the same, like you've popped into a parallel universe, with the only difference of brighter colours.  I managed to get this sudden feeling on my last puff of the last Jay - just in time.  After the Jays we relaxed a little, and I suddenly remembered my CD player which I had brought along in my college bag, the music I had was some Funk/Tech House. I put it on full blast over my headphones, so all we could really hear was some big distorted beats and no melodies.  Dave (who is normally into Death Metal) thought it sounded really Phat and I grinned and nodded in appreciation (I usually find that almost any music sounds fantastic when stoned).  It had taken about 15 minutes for us to smoke the Jays, and also listen to the music for a while.

Next came the pipe, which was Daves (I imagine the largest amount of Skunk it can hold is about 1 cm cubed). This is when things can become a little more hardcore than the Jay smoking.  The wind had suddenly picked up, so we sat up-right and used the inside of our bags as cover to stop the lighter being blown out (this meant that I had to bend forwards to get my head inside the bag, whether this affected my lungs in a strange way I do not know, Im open to suggestions).  We both took some medium to large hits (I didn't use the rush hole) and I became gradually really REALLY stoned.  It was around the 5th hit (which was a very big hit, which I held in for about 10 seconds I think) that things started to go a tiny bit trippy (ish).  

It started off with just strange thinking, lots of my own thoughts rushing around in my head which is the normal feeling I get when Im really stoned.  Now I started to think biologically, relating to my body, which I sometimes also do when stoned, I had began to develop dry mouth at the 4th hit and now I was thinking of this, and what caused dry mouth, this later developed into WHERE my dry was going (?).  I began to imagine and/or feel a warm creeping sensation of drying out mucus/saliva travelling its way into my left tear duct... but the thing is looking back on it now, I imagined the tear duct on the WRONG side of my eye.  Ironically the cold, harsh and DRY wind was blowing into the furthest part of my left eye, and I began to feel as if the wind was blowing the dry feeling into the rest of my eye: basically I began to feel as if my entire eye was drying up.  This obviously got me rather worried, perhaps slightly paranoid.  I tried to think logically about the situation and I thought that the pot might be just super-enhancing the 'feeling' of Red Eye.  

So I looked at my friend and asked him if I had Red Eye in the left part of my left eye.  He said he couldn't see any Red Eye or anything abnormal, I even asked him to look again, he still said there was nothing.  I probably did have slight paranoia, probably caused by my over active imagination.  I reckon that this was the first very mild 'trip' of 4 I had on that day.

The second 'trip' was much, much nicer, although a little distressing at first.  After the first trip I calmed down a little although I still had this concentrated 'heatedness' in a small area on my left temple, just to the left of the affected eye.  My friend said if was all right and I replied 'I don't know'.  My friend had offered me the pipe after the first trip and I refused, as I wanted to get focused.  However after a few minutes I took the pipe.  This was a mega hit, my friend piled it quite high and he said if it was too much, I thought it was fine, and he gave me the lighter.  Just a few microseconds after I exhaled the smoke, I gently lay myself in the grass, closed my eyes... and just smiled.  After a minute or so of this euphoria I sat upright again, the pain was still there but slightly dulled... it was softer.  My friend was now really stoned, and he was sitting down, the top half of his bodies swaying around in circles under the sun, saying how beautiful the sunrays were.  

His swaying action in circles was what interested me, suddenly the softened pain went for a little trip of its own: the pain started to pulse and it left that area of my head and entered my brain.  It felt as if the pain or 'heat' as I would like to call it now was travelling either along my arteries or neurones... At first I thought that the heat actually might have been the THC eating its way through my cells, and that now it was attacking my neurones in my brain.  And then suddenly I just thought: So its the THC now?  Not the Dry Mouth or Red Eye?? Yeah right, its just your imagination... just enjoy the sensation and go with flow.  This changed my whole perspective... so what if its the THC, how can I stop it?  It was mainly this, and also my friend calming me down (apparently while that was all happening I was actually mumbling to myself and looking really worried) that made me start to enjoy the 'trippy' feeling going on inside my brain, it was like swirling and swaying around the inside of my head in a very slow motion, very pleasant and surprisingly relaxing.  

The heated sensation seemed to last forever... after a few more minutes it felt as if the heat was going all over my body, it was a slow process, it didn't move fast.  That was my second 'trip'.

It was around about 5 minutes after my second trip that we got up and walked back into the college.  The heated sensation was slowly disappearing as I had other things to concentrate on, i.e. like desperately getting something to drink, and eat (we didn't have munchies as such, we just hadn't had lunch yet).  The college canteen is not a nice place to be when youre stoned, I have experienced large feelings of paranoia from there, because there's so many people, and also youre on college ground.  We ate there anyway, and my friend offered for us to go up into the Internet rooms, which I declined.  I was not expecting to 'trip' today, so I thought that going home would be my safest bet, so that if I did anything foolish it wouldn't be done in public.  So I walked down to the train station, where nothing major happened.  However when I got near the station I heard my train arriving, so I ran for it and got on it just in time.  I was not expecting this next trip... I think it was triggered by me running for the train: a large increase in heart activity, more oxygen in the blood stream etc.  It would be interesting to try that out again.

My 4th trip was on the train.  If you have ever been on an electric train you will notice the whirl of the motor's starting up, and the general whirling noises that these types of trains can make.  Now I primarily listen to Psychedelic Trance (which is a type of rapid dance music with very strange trippy noises). These motor noises seemed to kind of, form music in my head... and I started to think up loads of original Psy-trance songs in my head.  It was really weird! It would be fantastic if I had a thought-recorder there and then, it was the best Psy-Trance I had ever listened to - there were just so many rapid sounds noises and melodies and it was coming from me, and i didn't even have to concentrate!  I noticed that the speed and intensity of the music seemed to alter with the speed of the train, and with the different whirling noises of the train motors.

Then there were the visuals... they were like on the tip of becoming visible, as if my thought were becoming visible.  I was thinking of travelling down my motor neurone pathways at a rapid speed... the neurones themselves were like these intertwined, twirly-weaving tubes that were mutli-coloured but transparent at the same time, and at some points flying along these tubes (I was never actually inside these tubes, unless i was viewing another tube from inside of another tube) I came across multiple T junctions or smaller tubes twisting off at various points in time with the music, there where millions of other tubes like this one in the background.  The most interesting point is that this whole hallucination was coming from my LEFT field of vision, this trip didn't dominate my whole vision (could this be related to my first trip?).  The quality of the 'vision' was like something out of those computer-animated visuals you sometimes get at parties, or if a computer company was showing off its computer capabilities.  Whenever I stopped at a station the music would end, but when the train would start again the music would start.  

After I had the Neurone visuals I moved to a much more meaningful hallucination.  This hallucination seemed to be in the middle of my field of vision (but again it didn't dominate, I could still look at the other surrounding on the actual train).  The hallucination started with one 'visual thought' ... this visual thought then spread outwards in all directions into other visual thoughts which then spread out again... and again... and again... etc.  I started to realise that these individual thoughts seemed to go up in 'importance' (for instance the first thought would be 'Does this shirt look good?' and then it would finally progress into 'What am I?' and 'Whats the Meaning of life' and 'Whats the purpose of all this, is there a God?' and 'What is reality?').  There always seemed to be more and more questions sometimes all of the questions linked up into one major question like: Is there a God? But then even this question divided up into other Visual thoughts. It would sometimes expand very quickly, and sometimes these visual thoughts would make some quite pretty patterns, usually it would go in time with the music.  

I managed to remember my Station to get off at.  It was quite an experience that last trip I had... I think its changed me, I believe in a lot more cycles in nature now, and how they relate to us and the cosmos; I believe that there is Infinity: its in the form of cycles.  I've also got into a lot of New Age things, i.e. I discovered this site and also deoxy.org :)

This is the last and final trip I had on that day.  I walked from the station through some woods to get to my house.  I've always wanted to trip in a forest, and I think I got my chance.  This time round I was actually SEEING things, not feeling them or them on the edge of my vision.  The nasty wind had gone, and now it was really quite a beautiful day.  The sun was shining through the leaves and hitting the ground and I could see where the light was making rays.  I glanced at the ground and I couldn't believe what I saw.  Where the light was hitting the ground I would see an image of a gorilla.  This made me think why am I seeing gorilla's on the ground?  I started to believe that perhaps the trees and plants were trying to communicate with us (and no I didn't start talking to the trees) in the only way which they could.  The trees would arrange their leaves in such a way so that they would create a template for the image of a gorilla to be transmitted onto the woodland, or forest floor.  Perhaps they're trying to tell us something about our evolution - because not only were there gorilla shapes that I saw... I saw various strange creatures I had never seen before.  I started to wonder why no one had ever seen this phenomenon before... perhaps pot is the key to seeing these silhouette figures on the ground, after all pot's a plant as well....

Its here that my trips stopped, immediately when I got out of the forest the visuals stopped, I had none since.  I was stoned for much of that day, I think I arrived back at home around 3.30 p.m., with the Exam finished at around 11.00 am.  I think the fact that I have had a better experience using a more natural drug to get these trips, rather than a manufactured drug says a lot to me: nature is better than manufactured.  I'm now far more opened up to look at nature in more detail and how it relates to us, and how we relate to it.  I congratulate you on reading all of this :)

I've been experimenting with drugs for about two months now. I've had several experiences with pot and one trip on DXM. This week, I've had two trips in which I've managed to hit a new plateau. I feel I've really gotten something out of them and I'd like to try and translate that inscrutable something here, if possible. My translation will take the form of a kaleidoscopic metaphor - it always does. In the interest of synthesizing the ultimate meaning from the memory, I'm going to try a novel approach to this report. I'm going to write about both parallel experiences in a chronological yet nonlinear format, alternating between each one at roughly the same stage in the trip. I think it's best to group particular sensations and insights together rather than splitting them into separate reports. Timings are approximate (or my best guess).

Stage 1: Silliness and social lubrication

First trip: It begins at 9:30 PM, at the house of J, my friend and supplier. The sun has just gone down. I eat two cannabis-laced cookies, then smoke a joint with J right after. I've never gotten high off smoking on the previous two occasions I've tried it, so I'm not surprised to feel no immediate effects. Ten or twenty minutes after smoking, we're talking outside in her garden and I notice a nervous tension in my body, a symptom I identify with the onset of inebriation in my highly successful experiments with cookies. Once I realize that it's just the joint taking effect, I begin to relax and roll with it. Physical jitteriness persists but I'm not worried. I notice a mild mindfuck. There's no buzz (just slight dizziness) but there is a change in speech patterns, a giddiness, removed inhibitions, happiness, and talkativeness.

Half an hour after dosing we move out of the garden, me stumbling along the inclined path behind her. We circumnavigate the house, ending up on the deck. J, an experienced user of many substances, provides me with a preview of what tracers look like on acid (way beyond the mild blurring of motion I perceive at the moment) with a slow wave of her hand. I become aware of a constant pulsing thud. I conclude that somehow I'm hearing my heart beat as if it's an external presence. I find this fascinating, however J soon figures out that what I'm actually hearing is the beat of the loud music being played across the street, and informs me thus. This is a pre-visionary stage, but everything I see and hear feels like a hallucination. I'm mistaking objective natural stimuli for mental fabrications.

Second trip (four days later): It begins at 6:30 PM. Me and J are hanging around a waterfront park. It's a bright, gray evening. First course is a joint. I feel the onset faster this time, a telescoping of effect. The jitteriness comes on quick, a physical shaking that lasts ten minutes. Soon I become introspective and philosophical (not abnormal for me, but let's say, hyper-philosophical). My friend, a chronic user, reports visual enhancement (brighter colors, more interest in texture and vegetation), but I don't get this to any great extent until taking the cookie later this night. J tells me about hallucinating on MDA: seeing the cells in her bloodstream pulsing along their predetermined path in each heartbeat - seeing them slow down in the dilation of the moment - fearing her heart was going to stop and snapping out of it - watching people's heads melt off their bodies on heroin and methamphetamine. I see faces in the bark of trees and in the bolts on a park bench. I can't not see them. Everything looks like something else. It's a prelude to the patterns that will dominate later.

Stage 2 - Delirium and recognition of euphoria

Back to first trip: 10:30 PM. We leave the deck. J tells me to watch out for a 'weird step'. This confuses me. I can't figure out what's weird about it. I mull over this long after following her inside. It seems vital that I figure out what the weird nature of the step is. We talk some more on the porch. Judging by our bizarre conversation, I presume that J is as fucked up as I am - a disturbing thought. I agree to go for a ride around town with her that night but as we start driving around I think: 'If she's as high as I am, we're fucked!' But she handles the vehicle without difficulty. The destination is a 7-11. I'm relieved that she doesn't expect me to go in there as well. There's no way I can come close to faking sobriety. I watch the people moving around in the bright interior through the windshield and cast odd looks at them from my seat.

We're driving back when the cookies kick in all of a sudden. There is an intense rush. Tingly numbness and a crawling skin sensation creep over me. A heavy buzz. It feels too intense for me. It'll never ease up that night. My mouth is absolutely parched but my throat doesn't want any fluid to go down, it feels uncomfortable swallowing. I don't always get this unpleasant body load, but this time I do. As we head back, delirium and unreality set in. I'm sure that I'm in a dream. Nothing matters, and anything is possible. I feel exactly as I do in lucid dreams (and it's the first time I become consciously aware of how I feel in lucid dreams - I so rarely remember them). It's an amused apathy in REM relaxation - leisurely surfing the theta waves and being led to meaning by some guiding force.

Its about 11:00 when we get back to J's house. Everything seems to be getting stranger and stranger. Conversation begins to feel like telepathy. J seems to be finishing my sentences, or otherwise possessing of an eerie insight into my thoughts. We're not on perpendicular trips but not quite parallel either - thus, it's not quite telepathy. I'm tripping on an oblique angle to her mind, so I figure it's about 92% telepathy. I become convinced that what I hear her say is really my mind reconstructing her words into a language I can only understand at a peripheral level. I feel if I could fully understand this language, I could read her mind perfectly. I could gain ultimate insight into the meaning of her speech.

11:15. I think I'm a character in a poem. It makes perfect sense. It's a perfect reduction of the universe. An artful condensing of my perception to a lyrical singularity. It's a very introspective idea. An ego trip. Not ego loss - if anything, it's ego envelopment. The 'external' world is nothing more than the scripted manifestation of my inner artist: the explication of perception and reality. I am everything and everything is Me. But who is 'I'? Some middleman in the artist process of my alien God? At times I feel I am this God, but at other times I feel I'm subservient to this God. What I know as my 'self' is just an artist's tool - an actor in a piece of performance art. My life is a one-act play. Free will is the ultimate ironic punchline. Unity in isolation and isolation in unity.

11:30. I suddenly get the idea that I'm actually an old man in a sanitarium, and I've been hallucinating the twenty years of perception I know as 'my life' in a senility-induced coma which I'm just now waking from. J's house is about to dissolve into some sterile futuristic hospital interior, and I will have to face the sad and horrible truth that I'm an old man with seventy or eighty years of experience that I DON'T REMEMBER. I don't exactly believe this, but I don't quite disbelieve it either (much like my views on the existence of God). It seems a plausibly absurd tragedy. When I get into these unreality states, my superstitions are amplified.

11:45. Back on the deck. I come to that 'weird step', which J once again points out. This fucks with my head. Didn't this happen already? Is this deja-vu? Did I slip back in time? Or did I just hallucinate the last hour, and there was only one weird-step incident? What is real? Reality, memory, and imagination are blurred together. 'That IS a weird step,' I remark. It seems to be some twisted temporal landmark.

When I get back inside, I come to my first recognition of euphoria. Everything is fine and I feel great. I'm at peace with the world. I'm in the midst of the fix. My mind works now. Life makes sense. I'm free of so many burdens. I think: 'This is the answer to the equation of life - the inversion of emotional entropy. This is what I live for. It's the reward of perception. It's the cashing in of my perceptual savings.' I'm sitting on the living room couch. The only illumination is the orange porch lights from behind a sliding door and the glow from the adjoining kitchen. A small cat with a smooth tan-colored coat jumps into my lap. It's a wonderful sensation petting this cat. I feel connected to the animal. We're on the same wavelength.

12:15 AM (not exactly, but relative to my last timing, let's say): I'm watching TV - whatever comes on before (or is that after?) the Oblongs on the Cartoon Network here in Canada. Some very raunchy and crudely-drawn animated program. The cartoon seems to have been concocted by someone as stoned as I am - perhaps even moreso - because it feels like absurdist genius. The jokes seem as cryptic as the visions to come, but still I nearly choke with hysterical laughter. It's just like the profound nonsense, the visualization of glossolalia that I'll experience later: I don't know what it means, but I know its meaning is profound. I don't know why it's funny, but it's absolutely hilarious, and thus I behave accordingly.

Back to the second trip: When last we left the mildly stoned me, I was at the park with J. I get home around 10:00 PM. At this point I decide to take one of J's cookies to intensify the experience (the joint has pretty much worn off). This is where the real trip begins. at about 11:00, analgesia creeps up (and will still be with me four days later). The buzz begins. The perma-grin spreads across my face. I look for visions when I close my eyes, but it's too early, I see nothing but phosphenes and shadows. I get that feeling of well-being again. Nice mellowness (between outbursts of jitteriness). As I'm writing a rambling letter to J, I rocket up toward a peak of euphoria where I love everything and everyone. During this time, I write some hilariously sappy prose. I realize that I'm insane and that is how it should be. Insanity is the right state, the natural state. Sanity is corrupt. Insanity is clear and pure, the divinely indulgent inversion of alien logic (the only kind there is). I feel like I'm having a mental metaphysical orgasm.

Stage 3 - The visions, synesthesia, and the trance

First trip: 12:30 AM. I'm out on the porch when I realize I can see the visions I've gotten on previous trips if I shut my eyes. They're just like before, with similar motifs, but expanded into new realms. The textures, designs, and patterns are all familiar but there's so much more now. Last time it was rhombuses and a kinetic motif resembling a backwards 4. This time it's a W of detail, a letter that is the matrix for the intricate visuals that flash by in a rapidly-morphing cycle. One second it's a giant ski hill with trees outlining the lines of the W and a snowy path forming the alphabetic motif in negative space - now it's a row of bent urinals still conforming to the W shape, a colorful psychedelic alien plumbing system with flowing florescent waste fluids - now it's a neon escalator, Egyptian hieroglyphics with a desert backdrop, stone sculptures amid a city skyline, flowers, plants, forests, and on and on. The weirdest sights I've ever seen are flashing by in a never-ending stream. 

There is no traditional iconography, which is fine by me. I would probably have been disappointed with something so hackneyed as shamanistic symbols or totemic imagery or what have you - but I honestly can't figure out where the hell this stuff comes from. It seems entirely external. (No not entirely actually, some of it strikes a sense of deja-vu, as if I've dreamed it before.) I wonder when I'll start seeing newspaper taxis. I could be writing new verses to Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.

The visual motion makes me dizzy. I feel like I'm spinning in a psychic whirlpool - always clockwise. I keep jerking myself out of the trance because I'm afraid of getting lost in it. I can't work up the courage to pursue the ride along the gigantic loop-o-plane of its trajectory. I open my eyes and try to reorient myself to the room. Now I'm enthralled with patterns: floral patterns on a rug. Wood grain textures. City lights. The foliage of a tree. Now everything I see IS a pattern. Everything joins the kinetic motific kaleidoscope, the clockwise spinning synesthesia of interior and exterior stimuli. It's interesting how I can separate my experience into external stimuli and internal creativity. A happy medium is reached. An artistic balance.

12:45. I go back outside with J. Leaves of deciduous trees lit by spotlights seem to flow into the kinetic algorithm. They swirl around me. I can just barely force OEVs from the stimuli if I concentrate hard enough. J's getting tired, so it's time for me to go home. I'm not sure if I'm capable of finding my way back (it's a long way and it's past midnight) but I'm going to try and make the expedition. She sends me off with a bottle of water for my ridiculously dry mouth and some more cookies to take home. I ended up spilling much of the water on the book I was going to return to her which I'd totally forgotten about. (Water and me don't mix well when I'm stoned. I always end up spilling it.)

The walk home feels like an eternity - an unguided tour of heaven and hell. I see everything turning into the flowing kinetic pattern that is a visualization of my consciousness.  This is ultimate cerebral synesthesia, a combination of all mental media. It is generated both internally and externally. It incorporates natural stimuli, but the stimuli merges with my mind's eye in a flowing wash of dynamic unity. Life becomes the motif, the subject of the visual representation of the linear perceptual sonata. There is a soundtrack. It's comprised of effects, speech, and music. 

There are lyrics as well - a lyrical language - a localized lyrical language whose entire dictionary comprises only the semantic notes and phrases needed for the song. I can't quite understand the language but I feel it means something, just like that strange cartoon. I can SEE the meaning but I can't comprehend it. I can't interpret the visualization of it, nor the audio representation. It's a film. A song. A poem. A novel with 'me', my character, my fictional avatar, as protagonist. It's a language. A formula. A diagram. Emotion. Most of all, it's ART - an artwork painted synesthetically by my inner artist God, the one I'd briefly come into awareness of during my 'character in a poem' revelation. This is personalized art, the truest form of art. Language is in this synesthetic fusion - hence, glossolalia. I'm hearing gibberish in my head and watching the words unfold in fractal patterns that merge with the black asphalt and symphony of city lights. 

I hum the soundtrack and repeat the words I hear in my head. I'll even write one phrase down when I get home: 'DOZNUT GUZERT BERGLERS' (spelling is NOT arbitrary). What this phrase means can only be explained by the W-motif based visions that I see. I'm SEEING sentences. I'm SEEING meaning. It's a telepathic communion with the universe which is merely a painting by my inner artist God. I finally know what perception is. I'm a rational being in an irrational universe and this is the result of that comprehension.

There are times when I desperately want to be home so I can crawl into bed and sleep off this madness. I feel like I'm lost in a timeless cryptic hell. The nonsense language won't stop, I can't see anything BUT the visions and I just want it to end. Other times, I feel content to wander forever. I feel divinely connected to the insanity. I'm reminded of a line I heard in Waking Life, something about time, and how the secret to transcendence is learning how to live in the moment.

1:30 AM. I arrive home with relief and go to bed immediately.

Second trip: 12:00 AM. Stage 3 begins with music appreciation. I'm sitting in front of my computer, typing my thoughts and listening to MP3s. I'm noticing background sound effects in music that I never did before. I recognize new layers. I can hear all the counterpoint autonomously. I enjoy amplified appreciation of the detail, but I have a diminished understanding of the music as a whole. My architectural view is impaired. 'Bike' by Pink Floyd comes on. The crazy sound effects montage at the end is the most insane thing I've ever heard. Pure sonic lunacy. It's exhilarating and terrifying.

The visual component starts with things in my room looking like other things. Dunes on my computer screen (Egyptian themed wallpaper - a great 3D rendering) become faces, then diamond beings in spacechips (an unintentional pun I leave in, and proof that my subconscious engineering artist is a step ahead of my cognitive mind - they do look like space-chips. Anthropomorphic triangular cornchip spacecraft.) Then come the visions. They definitely contain the flavor of the cannabis quasi-CEVs I've come to know and love.

These 'visions' are probably not what one would term 'hallucinations', either open-eye or closed-eye. What they boil down to is a hyperactivity of the mind's eye, a sort of waking dream-vision. For example: If I ask you to picture a pink elephant, you can sort of 'see' it in your head. Not as if it was really there, but it might be thought of as a legitimate form of vision. What I'm seeing is all kinds of crazy imagery unfolding and changing before me without my intent. There are two things that make it interesting: First, the automation. I don't have to will myself to see it, all I have to do is focus my mind at the right level - the peripheral level - and it comes flooding in, first as simple floating objects, then as tunnels of motific patterns moving in intricate trajectories, then entire scenes. The second reason I find this display riveting is the coherency and the alienness of it. This is not pink elephants, this is not random recapitulation of the cerebral garbage floating around in my head - it's a consistent, motific visual trip which seemed part of some grand scheme. There is, however, endless variation within this consistency. It seems to have been worked out by a higher intelligence: the inner alien artist.

When I open my eyes I can still see the visuals, as if the patterns are bleeding through - seeping into reality. Everything becomes a blur, but a clear blur. I think this is a beautiful oxymoron. The icons of my windows desktop form swirling kinetic algorithms. It makes no difference if my eyes are open or closed - it's simply a layer of unfolding self-generated visual perception over or under my normal sight, like a superimposition. With eyes closed, I see things clearer and am drawn deeper into it due to the lack of interference from regular sight - but if I keep my eyes open, the omniperipheral kinetic patterns blend into my normal vision which is a very interesting and humorous phenomenon - a trance inducing effect.

Throughout this experience, I write a letter to J. It's full of typos, dyslexia, unintentional puns, and scrambled words. It's almost a new language - it resembles the distortion I heard when she was speaking to me during the first trip. My writing is a bit less articulate but a lot more creative. Every random thought that pops into my head becomes an immense insight, an explication of existence. I proceed to make up myths that explain the universe. Who or what is God? I thought I was God but now I think I'm Moses. I spin endless verses of image-rich poetry, one metaphorical idea flowing into another. My words shape the visual patterns around me. I'm painting my life with words. I'm in control. I was right the first time, I'm God, and I'm creating the universe with My words - profound nonsense, semantic sight, visual sentences. Artful gibberish.

Pink Floyd plays on. I hear a strange phrase sung, no doubt distorted by my stoned state. 'Trimatized to the groun'. I write down the phrase and suddenly, I SEE it - as a COASTLINE. The synesthesia is revealing a depth to the phrase and infusing each word with a new dimension. The coastline is the nuanced visual result (or painting) of each word blending into the others - a synesthesia of meaning. If I was more capable of articulating my revelations, I'd describe it as the 'essence of information'. Maybe even the 'essence of understanding'. A new visual language, one I'd call: Indiskri babble.

1:00 AM. The SETTING of my mind's eye (if such a thing can be imagined) has transformed. The mental fireworks appear to be taking place in Gyro Park, a sacred locale in my hometown. The designs, patterns, and objects are forming the very matrix in which they exist. Now even tactile hallucinations make their presence felt - I feel raindrops on my skin, a recap of the early part of the trip when I was outside. This fusion of real and imagined stimuli creates the ultimate synesthetic sensation. I feel like I'm awash in a tide of cryptic meaning - a lowly human allowed a ride in the channel of alien wisdom. Of course, I can't even begin to comprehend this form of hyper-semantic information, but I know that it means something, that it's an intelligence far above my feeble grasp. I also feel it's a work of art which springs from the inner alien artist (not alien as in 'extra-terrestrial', but as in a foreign intelligence, a mind that is a part of me but so far removed from my consciousness that I can't understand it).

2:00 AM. The climax of my visions. Everything is recapitulated. Motifs are all brought together for a grand finale, the final number to this synesthetic musical. Backwards 4s take on a visual presence. They are aides, guards and messengers for the Rhomboid Prince, the ruler of this realm. He's letting me into his palace. 'What will I find there?' I wonder. I'm not sure I'm prepared to find out. I see him sitting on some sort of throne. He is a RHOMBUS. He is obviously the true prince because he is weirder than anything I've yet seen. His texture contains this entire universe of hyper-bizarre sight. He is wearing the fabric of unreality. I pledge my allegiance to him. He wants to enlighten me, to allow me comprehension of this alien language, but I respectfully bow out of the initiation. I'm not ready yet. 'Sorry,' I say. 'Maybe next trip.' I feel as if I've let down some deities, but I'm just learning to reinterpret emotional signals in this detuned cartoon. I promised them I'll accept the initiation next trip - assuming I can get this high again.

Throughout all this, the euphoria is sustained, perhaps even brought to a new peak. The only downside (and most would agree this is hardly anything to complain about) is that sometimes it feels like too MUCH euphoria - like the warm emotional flood is just overwhelming my psyche and about to cause a mental meltdown. If I can only be so lucky to experience this 'downside' again! Well to be honest there are some more legitimate downsides. There are times when I feel in danger of spiraling into a certain mental loop - a negative thought pattern I can't get myself out of, like 'what if I'm dead and this is the eternal afterlife? Is that good or bad?' (I've recently seen the film 'Waking Life', and I think this is a large influence on my thoughts right now.) I stumble into disturbing soliloquies and am prone to an uncontrollable half-assed self hypnosis of which I'm only semi-aware. 'Nano hell and the gravity well' is an example. I think it's such an important idea, I erase my carefully drawn depiction of the Rhombus Palace and write it on my whiteboard. 

The concept is simple: Nano hell is an infinite singularity of terror, like the ultimate density at the center of a black hole, and I'm spiraling down towards it on this trip - but the initial descent into this black hole, the gravitational pull, is a misleading euphoria - deep pain masked in shallow pleasure. The real truth is negative. An inversion of joy is the natural state of the universe. A rather perverse philosophy to be sure, but none of these episodes develop into anything serious. A new benevolent wash of imagery attracts my attention away from the mental quagmires and I enjoy the kaleidoscopic shift in perception (subtle, but oh so emotionally tangible).

2:30. I turn off the lamp, turn my computer screen toward my bed, switch on the Winamp visualizer, and lie in bed to watch and listen. I'm using Jet, but later I switch to G-force. Both seem to be very popular eye-candy for stoners. The patterns look awesome. The textures seem richer. The colored seem purer - more vivid - delicious - almost edible! I feel like I'm David Bowman at the end of 2001 - Jupiter and beyond. A very cosmic motif. I should've put on some Ligeti. Also, the artificial synesthetic properties seem to be enhanced - I notice the relationship of the patterns to the music much more than I used to. I spend the next half hour in an open-eyed trance as a floating consciousness in a small dark room, listening to my shuffling Winamp playlist on a good pair of headphones and watching the visualizer with renewed appreciation. I seem to possess a profound insight into the lyrics of every song I hear. I feel I've gained a deep understanding of Terence McKenna's timewave theory. I write: 'Novelty must be conserved and accelerated or existence would be a logical fallacy.'

3:00. 'Holy fucking freak-flying flags!', I write. 'I've courted the universe for many years but now I've truly fallen in love with her.' I'm more content than I've ever been in my life. Now I feel it was a folly to yearn for stronger substances like LSD and DMT. If cannabis can do this, what the Christ else do I need? To pursue euphoria beyond this divine plateau would simply be hubristic gluttony. I keep a glass of water by my bed to stave off dry mouth, but I keep knocking it over and spilling it on my papers, my bedside table, and my bed sheets. It doesn't really matter. I get to sleep at around 3:30.

Stage 4 - The afterglow

Both trips: I'm mildly stoned all next day. Everything people say to me sounds strange and garbled and I have to concentrate very hard to understand. I often feel in danger of bursting into hysterical laughter. I worry a bit about how future interaction with humanity is going to go down, but I'm also wonderfully apathetic. I can't care too much. Movies and TV are hard to follow - everything sound like profound gibberish. I feel like a child in a pre-verbal stage. I notice a slight visual enhancement. I'm much more aware of details, much more interested in patterns, texture, and colors, especially when walking around outside. I stare at an ant colony for about twenty minutes. The next few days leave me prone to violent mood swings and emotional instability. I get peaks of profound insight and troughs of futility and disillusionment.

In conclusion:

I wish I could have torn myself away from my keyboard long enough to sit and concentrate and actually EXPERIENCE the visions. I felt fiercely compelled to type everything I was seeing and the thoughts this sight created. Even when I managed to stop typing, shut off the monitor, turn off the lamp, and crawl into bed with headphones still on, I relapsed after a few minutes: I would periodically sit up, switch on the lamp again and start writing on a notepad I keep on my bedside table, because there was some phrase I just had to get down, it felt so motherfucking profound!

If I could only force myself to stop reporting everything and intellectualizing everything and just watch and pay attention and perhaps be an active participant (interactive hallucinogenic lucidity is the next level) I might be able to get even deeper into this realm and find out where those peripheral visions lead. That being said, I feel a sense of triumph, as if I've solved a riddle. I've synthesized the meaning of the experience so far. Of course, it's only the first riddle. Stranger and more difficult riddles lie ahead for me, and their solutions maybe require more than a poem or a trip report. They may require action, whether physical or mental, I don't know.

This is my first full experience with cannabis ever, and the first substantial experience with any psychoactive. But first I should make an intro about myself. I am 24 years old, male, just finished university and currently I havent anything to do. I havent met drugs a lot in my life. Probably it is the connections one has. My circle for example doesnt do cannabis much let alone any other drug, or so I thought until recently. 

In the past I thought only deviants and outcasts do those things. Back in high school for example, cannabis smokers were those who had some delinquent behavior as well. Or at least those were the ones I could easily recognize. However I have read much about psychoactive substances from then, and I realized that they arent the universal evil we are told it is. There are plenty of user types and reasons for use. I read something about datura and its effects in the past, and from then onwards I was searching and reading about psychedelics and other psychoactives and became more open to the idea of psychoactive use and stopped regarding all drugs as evil. I have also cultivated a lot of psychedelic plants, but I have never used them.

As for personal experiences, well, until now the only psychoactive that has affected me substantially is alcohol, which I rarely drink. I have never become heavily drunk for example, to the point of throwing up. I have reached the point of being dizzy, having incoordination and telling slightly inappropriate things, but not more. Also I rarely drink coffee, so when I drink it has a strong effect to me. Kola drinks also stimulate me easily, and so I cannot drink them in the evening because I will have trouble sleeping. I have never tried tobacco in any form.

I have been acquainted with cannabis approximately two years ago by my father, who planned to use it for medical reasons like anxiety, trouble sleeping etc, and so he was seeking information on it. We were reading about it together. Here I must say that for a long time until my experience I really didnt believe that this herb has any real effects. Because it is neither classified as a stimulant, depressant or hallucinogen, and because a lot of the reports I have read or heard gave conflicting or vague information, I was convinced that it is nearly ineffectual, or that at least relaxes someone a bit and makes them sleep.

My father finally decided to cultivate the plant, and so he ordered seeds. I have witnessed the cultivation from start to end. The little seed, which when put on wet cotton in a few days sprouts, the little plant with its little leaves, the larger plant and the flowering, harvesting, drying and curing. The plant itself is a typical herbaceous dicotyledon, with a main trunk, orderly branches and leaves. To a person that doesnt know plants well I think it wouldnt raise any suspicion. However, now that I have seen it, I can recognize it. Its palmate leaves and odor are distinctive. I cannot describe the smell exactly, but it is fragrant and somewhat like oregano. If it were completely legal it would be surely classified as a fragrant herb, besides oregano, rosemary or thyme. Another remarkable thing about the plant is its hardness and resistance of its stem and leaf. No wonder it makes one of the most durable fibers known, hemp.

So my father experimented both with indoor and outdoor cultivation, and settled to do it outdoors in some concealed spots. The plants were of the White Widow variety. The first one grew well, but as they say, a weed is difficult to kill, but also difficult to make perfect, and so production on the first try wasnt so good. The next plants were more productive. The plants need a lot of light, water and fertilizer to be really healthy and productive. So I find the term weed not to describe them accurately.

The previous year I had the chance to take some weed for myself. I cut some well-formed buds from my fathers drying crop. I technically stole them, as I didnt tell anyone, but I wouldnt have faced any major consequence if I was found out. My father doesnt give any to me, but he has given to some of his friends, and I was shocked to know that so many normal older people do weed too. He has encouraged me to grow as well and invest in a good vaporizer, but I still cannot find a good concealing place to do it. I wrapped the plant material carefully in kitchen paper, and put it in a small plastic bag. I had the chance to gather some new material this year as well, which I combined with the older stuff.

The minor experiences

My first experience with cannabis was summer of this year, when I was at a trip abroad with some of my friends. We purchased just one blunt and smoked all from it. Until then, I hadnt smoked any tobacco even. I took two hits and honestly didnt feel any effect. Neither anyone else. I was shocked however when I learnt that a lot of my friends had done weed, because they didnt fit the weed user stereotypes. So probably there are a lot of weed smokers, however they dont talk about it with non-users for obvious reasons.

After this disappointing experience, I planned to use my own stash in order to prove if there is any effect. However I didnt know even how to roll cigarettes. I tried hand rolling, but I always succeeded in spilling the material out of the joint. So I tried to use the rolling machine. I learnt how to use it from the Internet, and started experimenting with it. After a few tries, my joints were coming out perfect. Now I had two sources for material: my own stash, and my fathers stash, from which I was able to get some more material, however it was mostly leaves. I kept the sources separate in order to compare the effects.

I smoked from the second source in total three times. I Didnt keep any date, because I didnt consider the experiences important. The first experience came after smoking one joint. I just felt myself heavier than usual, and one I thought of a particular friend, I got momentarily frightened, because I wonder if he is well or dead. I also noticed that corners and dark places have more depth to them, and imagined that inside they had water and darkness and death and rotting things. Then I felt happy when I got outside, but I dont know if it was from the weed. Or from the fact it had finally affected me. Also I got the feeling that things are somehow alive and talk to me. 

The second session was lighter than the first. I got the feeling that things are as if talking to me, and also some death-related thoughts, like for example my mother is dead or when I return home I will find shrouded and decomposing bodies. However I am a death-obsessed person and these thoughts arent so abnormal from time to time. A third try gave even lesser results. Just things seemed like they had spirits and were talking to me and songs had the feel of targeting me. No negative thoughts. After 10 minutes, it was gone. At that point I had mixed the materials from both sources and now I wasnt sure on which is the most potent. During those sessions, I didnt feel any increase of appetite which is considered the hallmark of cannabis intoxication. Neither my short-term memory got affected, just I had some confusion if I put the paraphernalia back in their places. Weed was a good sleeping aid though, as any time after use, which happened in the evenings, I felt sleepy and slept soundly.

The experience

So, an evening in November, I smoked weed another time. First I took a thin joint and smoked it at 11:00pm. Here I must say that the smoke has no resemblance to the sweet smell of the plant. It is quite harsh. I could endure it though. 

After a while I again got a slight feeling that things are alive, have more depth and try to communicate with me, and also random words came to my mind. After 10 minutes, any effect had gone away. So I got quite disappointed and lit another joint at 11:12. The end of the joint disintegrated, but I still was able to take four good hits. This probably was from the potent ones with the bud material, because I started feeling more of the effects soon. At 11:17 words started again popping randomly in my mind, and also synonyms and similar-sounding words were coming up easily. For example I was thinking trunk and immediately after thought punk. Immediately after that I ran to the couch to relax and feel the effects. I forgot to say that the smoking took place at a room over my home, which is a part of it and stands atop the apartment complex. The room was dark at the time. The couch started feeling quite warm and inviting, and the blue cover over the couch was like a warm, purple blanket. I was curled like a ball on my right side and I started feeling my legs heavy. 

When I realized that these were the effects of weed, I started laughing. I laughed also when I unsuccessfully tried to get up many times and was falling back again, and laughed just because I was laughing about these things. I was happy. I was elated. I hadnt any negative thought or emotion. I slowly got up, and I was somewhat dizzy. I turned on the light, and thought that the effects were gone, but when I got outside towards the door that lead to my home, I realized how high I was. It felt like the whole world was substituted with an exact duplicate, in which things werent so normal. It felt like the whole world was substituted with an exact duplicate, in which things werent so normal. Returning back to the room, I stumbled on some abnormalities on the floor and thought I was falling. I knelt down and waited, believing I would faint and injure myself. I was also thinking that I would die or that the effects would remain forever, but thinking about how so many people have used it without problems and that no one died from weed, I burst out laughing for my silly fear. I was laughing with everything and so I wanted to hear similar things, namely, that high-pitched cartoon voices that talk and laugh super-fast. I took my smartphone and typed little happy voices in Youtube, and found voices of children. Of course I meant cartoons, but the algorithm of course couldnt read my mind. I again realized how high I was and started laughing.

At 11:28 I turned on the small desk light. I was so fascinated with the bright, white light, that I jump towards it repeatedly and stared at it, so much that it dazzled me and created an afterimage, which I was afraid that would stay forever. I generally like if a place is well-lit at night, but now my reaction was 5x the normal or more. As for company, I was alone, and wished to remain so, as I felt too vulnerable for other people. If there were other friendly users I might feel good with them, but for now the human world was my enemy. I had the company of my animals though. Some of my animals were housed there. Some of them, at least those that could eat leaves, had already eaten fresh weed leaves. Both my rabbit and my bearded dragon have eaten weed leaves. I took out the snake with me. He was the male rosy boa I have, a calm, stout, approx 60 cm snake. I put it on my lap and put my fingertips on it as it was crawling away. The minute impressions of his scales created tingling feelings to the whole of my arms, as when someone caresses you lightly and you like it. It was wonderful. I also gently caressed my clothes and my hair for the same effect. It was very relaxing. The snake was warm from its cage, so when it was on me I felt a warm sensation spreading from it. Then I put it on the desk, under the light, and observed it from below. It seemed huge, and its shining head with its constantly flicking tongue by which it checks the place for smells seemed like those Komodo dragons we see in documentaries. It took a zig zag shape, and reminded me of the roads that climb on mountains, and the curves of it that shined due to the light as the back lights of the cars, and I was wondering what brand the cars where. Then it started moving away, like some type of liquid. A loop of its body started shrinking away and it was quite surreal. Then I put it back in its cage to not stress it further. I was high, but that didnt mean I stopped caring about the animals.

Then I relaxed on the couch and was slightly caressing my hair to get this type of tingly feeling. It was great. Then I just lied back with eyes closed or half-closed and started having various memories, sights and sounds in my mind, even from childhood. Musical instruments, the waves, people talking and laughing, and other sounds were recalled with accuracy. These were no hallucinations like at the hypnagogic state, these were random memories from my life. I could also consciously recall a memory quite easily. Three times I thought about my x girlfriend, in particular the good times with her at the start of the relationship, which distressed me for some seconds and then it went away. When I was opening my eyes, the effects seemed to diminish. However still effects were noticeable. For example things seemed as they had some more depth to them, and seemed somewhat changed from the normal, but I cannot describe it accurately.

After that I started to become hungry. I dont know if it was purely due to the effects, or because it was the time I was supposed to eat, but because before not long ago I ate two small hot dogs, I thought I was so much hungry due to the effects. So I needed to go out and purchase something to eat. I started counting the coins. I didnt have any problem at the larger denominations, but I had trouble counting all the smaller ones, so I quit and did it again for three times. Finally I got just more money than I needed to be sure and went down to buy something. In the elevator, I was constantly checking if indeed the keys I got were the right ones.

When I got outside, everything seemed good and happy. However I started feeling odd about other people on the street. I would like to be just alone, myself. I was walking the sidewalk and started laughing again. A small distance in front of me was a kiosk, where they knew me and I was fearful they would find out, and again I laughed with this silly thought. I also had fleeting negative thoughts about stumbling and falling, injuring myself and going to the hospital or even dying, where they would test me and they would find out what I had consumed and everyone would know and be shocked and angry with me. I have a moderate level of paranoia in my normal life as well, and I imagine making such thoughts about other things while sober, so I dont think it was purely the effect of the herb. 

I finally reached my destination and went in the store to purchase a big good full sandwich. I made the order, but because in the middle of my utterance another man spoke, I got confused and the lady asked me again for what I wanted. Thankfully I got it correctly, and quickly left for a while, until the food was ready, because I thought they would know that I am high and call the cops. I travelled on a narrow dark street, but because there were some people talking at a distance, I returned back to the main way. This was probably fear due to the effects. I was then following a recently reconstructed part of the sidewalk and finding delight in the row of bright white lights there, at which I was staring. One light in particular was mounted lower than the others, approx near my height, and I felt as if it was greeting me. Then I returned back to get the food, paid and quickly went home. As I was running quickly, I noticed that I was a bit lightheaded and was bouncing, and I feared that onlookers would find out.

At 12:27am (until then I didnt think to keep any track of time), I was safe again in my home and I was eating the sandwich. I gulped it down too quickly to enjoy it properly. Everything was safe and good, but when a sudden noise came from the neighboring houses, I was fearful that there were people that could threaten me and also find out. Then I lied again on the couch and put some Bob Marley to relax. However, the effects now werent so strong. For example I wasnt laughing constantly now. Then I got up and tossed away some trash things I didnt need, which I had lying there for an unjustifiably long time. A wooden wine barrel was like it had a face and was staring at me. I didnt hallucinate anything, just I had the mental feeling that it has a face and sees, watches and can talk. I soon felt the effects diminish even more. I was again hungry though, so I got out again. Now I was able to count the money accurately. I went to another store lest I raise suspicion and ordered a hot dog. Thankfully I was coherent. I ate it and then went elsewhere to eat again. I took another road, which was as I like it. Nearly empty of cars or people and calm. I like such conditions at night even when sober, so my happiness wasnt purely due to the effects of the herb. I wondered at the little puddles of water near the sidewalk that shined under the bright white lights. I ordered a small burger, which I quickly ate. 

Now the only major effects were that things seemed more substantial than usual and had a depth to them, and also open doors that showed to somewhere dark and dark corners were somewhat frightening. I was also feeling somewhat lightheaded. When I returned home at 01:30, I was nearly completely normal. My mother was there, and I was able to communicate with her, but I went to a couch and lied down.

The experience left without any hangover or any other unpleasant symptom. However, I had trouble sleeping. I dont know if it was due to the effects themselves, or due to my excitement about the whole experience. After some time though I slept. Although I remember dreaming, I didnt recall any dream in detail, which I read is a side effect of cannabis use. I am noticing it because I have trained myself to recall dreams quite well, as I am writing dream journals. I tried training to lucid-dream, but it proved quite unsuccessful and I quit. Also worth noting is that although I ate a lot that night, I didnt feel any stomach discomfort.

All in all the experience was fun and something completely different from the baseline. The most intense part lasted around 15 minutes, the core of the effects lasted for around an hour and 20 minutes, and the effects left completely after two and a half hours. I didnt have any noticeable negative side effects, like severe paranoia or panic attacks, and when I had a something close to them, it would go away in a few seconds. I could do it again in the future, and maybe in the further future I would be comfortable enough to do it with other like minded people. However, I found the effects too intense for daily use, and I cannot understand how some people use cannabis daily. Compared to alcohol, cannabis is much more benign, and I find it ridiculous that the so called rational western countries have spent so ridiculously high amounts of resources to persecute it, and have destroyed countless lives in jail time.

Cannabis (1) : General (1), Alone (16)




 




DOSE:
10 mg
oral
Loratadine
 


 
  repeated
oral
Cannabis
(tincture)





BODY WEIGHT:
115 lb





Substance:  home made cannabis alcohol tincture.  Dosage level uncertain 

Setting:  small music festival, camping
Subject:  30-something female, very experienced user of smoked and oral cannabis
Other drugs consumed:  Loratidine for allergies- 10mg
empty stomach: no

Cannabis is legal where I live, and I was spending the weekend at an outdoor camping music festival with some friends.  In attendance was a person who gifted me a sample of home made cannabis tincture which I happily consumed.  I believe there may have been a mis-communication about how much I was supposed to consume, or the tincture was much stronger than was realized because it turns out, I took way too much.  And I later found out that this particular batch of tincture had been made 2 years ago, and apparently gets stronger the longer it sits.  

Experience with Cannabis:  I have taken cannabis in the form of smoked buds, wax/dabs, hash, cannabis oil, store-bought edibles, homemade edibles, and store-bought tincture from a dispensary.  I have never had a negative or difficult experience with cannabis in the 15+ years of my relationship with this plant.  The closest to a difficult experience I can remember is combining it with alcohol and passing out, waking up to a nasty hangover.  Even with oral cannabis, in the past I had taken a little too much and just gotten couch-locked and fallen asleep early.  However, I have also never used home made tincture until this day.  My previous tincture experience was pleasant, and the recommended dosage had been fairly high- about 30-40 drops.  I had taken this amount frequently and had good experiences; I remember that tincture being not very strong.  

Ok back to the story:  About 7pm Saturday evening I was gifted the tincture and took a small sip.  A few minutes later I noticed a pleasant feeling and waited about 20 minutes.  Again I took a sip and felt a buzz.  I asked my friend who made the tincture, how much to take?  I was told that I was given a dose, plus a little extra to share.  The mg dosage was not known (WARNING!) (Because of legalization, I know my oral cannabis dose limit which is about 2 standard-dose dispensary edibles, or 30 mg.  That dose will put me to sleep so I assumed half would be just right.  In hindsight I should not have consumed this unknown dosage. In hindsight I should not have consumed this unknown dosage.) I decided I would take half of it just to be safe.  It tasted like weed, had a strong smell, and a burn of alcohol, kind of like Fernet Branca.  For the next 3 hours, I enjoyed the music, walked around the festival, and chatted with people.  I felt pleasant and was experiencing insights, lots of big picture thoughts and realizations about life.  This is nice!  I'm buzzed and outside and my mind is clear and I'm having a good time.  About 2 hours in I felt a drop like I sunk down into the earth.  It felt good.  Maybe it is kicking in?  It didn't last long.  I took another sip.  I thought- ok, this is mild and I just take a small sip, get a little buzz for about 30 minutes, then I take a sip to keep it going.  I can handle this.  I still have ¾ of my dose left so I think I am safe.  

11pm:  I feel high and happy.  I think I may have taken another sip here but I don't exactly recall.  I crawl in my tent and snuggle down into my sleeping bag.  My partner is outside and a few minutes later he crawls into the tent with me.  I'm in a spaceship.  I giggle, welcome to my spaceship! We laugh a bit and he lays down with me.  Then the spins start.  I am really in a spaceship hurtling through space, spinning out of the gravitational pull of the earth.  I focus on the round zipper tent door and the glow of the red lantern hanging from the ceiling.  I'm falling backwards, spinning, starting to get dizzy.  I try to breathe through it.  Now I'm shaking- full body convulsions starting with my legs and radiating throughout my body.  Do I need to go dance?  Does my body need to move?  No, I'm so tired and tripping pretty hard now.  This happens to me sometimes when I take mushrooms so I didn't immediately panic.  But it was actually pretty frightening.  I kept breathing, counting my in-breath/out-breath, telling my muscles to relax.  My partner noticed I was shaking and helped me focus on my breath and hugged me.   

I tell myself, you can't overdose on weed.  You won't stop breathing.  Just don't fight it.  The shaking is really freaking me out and I say this out loud.  Eventually I figure out how to relax the large muscle groups (thank you, regular yoga practice!) and the shaking slows down and then becomes less noticeable.  I try to sleep but am in this half-tripping/ dizzy, paralyzed state and I have no idea if I actually slept or not.  

It is now getting light inside the tent.  I try to sit up but am so dizzy that this is literally impossible.  I feel very sick and nauseated.  I'm going to throw up but I can't move.  I have to pee but I can't move.  It's at least 6am because the sun's coming up.  I am tripping and sick and delirious and semi-paralyzed.  Passing thoughts of brain damage and seizures float around in my head, but I'm too sick to care.  I tell my partner I feel very sick.  He finds a first-aid person from the festival who helps me out of the tent so I can crawl into the bushes to pee.  I tell her I had some cannabis tincture last night and she does not seem concerned.  She helps me pee and get back to my tent.  Reminds me to drink water.  Gives me some Benadryl which I don't take.  I am too sick to feel embarrassed.  I throw up into the grass.  I feel a little better and crawl back into the tent to try and sleep.    

12pm:  The sun is fully up and it's getting hot inside the tent.  I am able to crawl outside on my own to pee, and then I throw up again.  A friend texts me and returning the text is like trying to program a rocket ship.  I am exhausted and go back to sleep.  

When I wake up again, it's maybe 2 or 3pm and I feel super- stoned.  No longer sick but completely non-functional.  I use the solar shower at camp, eat a power bar (it tastes disgusting and it's hard to swallow, but I know my body needs food), and feel like I am coming back to normal.  The nausea and dizziness are gone but for the next 24 hours I feel like I have an ecstasy hangover.  

Once I am safely back at home I find the cup of leftover tincture and it is enough to fill 2 small tincture bottles.  I don't think I will be taking any more of this any time soon.

Cannabis

I am very intrigued by psychoactives. Although my experience list is limited, I have a great desire to experience a number of them. I will not provide a comprehensive list, but I will say that alcohol is the only substance I regularly use. I indulge in cannabis and opiates from time to time as well, but not habitually. 

My first experience with cannabis was not entirely interesting, and for a while I viewed it very negatively, choosing to smoke only once in a great while and regretting it each time. I was of the opinion that it only made me irrational and dull. Once I got over this feeling I began smoking more often, but until this point I had never enjoyed the high as much as I did tonight. This may be a lengthy report.

Saturday evenings are typically uneventful for me, as I am always off work and most my friends aren't. I spent the day with my girlfriend, and after she left for her job I became bored as hell. I tried calling a few people but no one was able to hang out, so I contacted A, a friend that I had not spent significant time with for a couple years, but with whom I still maintained some contact. He told me he was going to eat dinner with his girlfriend's family, and then he'd come over. He also said that he had some really good weed and that we could smoke it if I wanted to do so. I said that I would love that, and I went home to play some music and clear my mind. At about 8:30 A arrived. We talked a bit for a while, and then got down to the deed. As he was loading the bowl, he explained that he shared one bowl with four people and got extremely high. I was impressed, as A was a frequent smoker, and a bit nervous to be truthful. We went outside, and I took the first hit. The smoke was so strong that it had barely hit my lungs before I coughed it out. From then on I took much smaller hits until we cashed the bowl. It didn't take long for the effects to kick in, and by the time we walked inside, I felt much higher than I ever had. 

Inside we got some water and caught up on things. I found it extremely difficult to remember what we were discussing, and I could tell my senses were extremely dulled. I have mild synesthesia when sober, and marijuana tends to increase that. It was easy to become lost in my sensory reactions to my environment. I have mild synesthesia when sober, and marijuana tends to increase that. It was easy to become lost in my sensory reactions to my environment. I was shocked when I had a few mild but very realistic hallucinations (mainly auditory and always very short and sudden). Before long I had the strong desire to leave, so A and I decided to go to my girlfriend's place of work and get some food.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

When we got in my car, I contemplated how driving high was way safer than driving drunk, as one's coordination is generally not effected as much by THC as by alcohol. Was I about to be proven wrong! Once I pulled on to the main road, I realized that I was entirely too impaired to drive. My senses were delayed, so that when I made any movement, like turning the steering wheel, I couldn't feel it, only see it, until a couple seconds after. Everything seemed much closer to me than it was, and sounds seemed extremely loud and reverberate. Realizing this, I pulled over into an empty parking lot, but A didn't feel comfortable because he had marijuana on him, so I reluctantly (and irresponsibly) decided to go ahead and drive the rest of the way. I took back roads so as to avoid traffic, and after what seemed like hours, made it to my girlfriend's restaurant in one piece. 

Once there, I glad that I would be able to just sit and enjoy the high. My girlfriend (P) works at restaurant that is never busy, and all of the employees are cool as hell so I knew I would be able to chill there until she got off work. She started some food for me, and A and I talked for a while before he had some friends come pick him up. I said farewell and went inside to eat my food. The taste was magnificent, and it felt like my whole body feeling it. When I swallowed, I could feel the warmth go down my throat and into my esophagus. With each bite, my chest felt warmer and warmer until it literally felt orgasmic. At this point I realized that I was higher than I had ever been. I began to feel very guilty about driving, because I felt that I had put myself, A, and everyone else on the road at risk. I told my girlfriend this and swore to her never to drive impaired again. We talked for a while and I smoked a cigarette (which seemed to take hours to smoke). After this, I decided to listen to my iPod until she got off, because I was still in no condition to drive. 

Now this is where the experience truly gets interesting. Now, for clarification, I have considered myself a full fledged atheist for quite some time. I have never viewed spirituality as particularly important and I've never had any belief in the supernatural or a higher power. 

I sat down at a table and put my earphones in. I turned on an Explosions in the Sky song, 'The Only Moment We Were Alone', and delved in. Before longer I had become truly immersed. My eyes were closed, and I could clearly see each note and beat in the song in a pattern that ran across my vision. My body high was so intense, and I began to feel so 'fuzzy' that I truly lost touch with all sense of touch. I had the overwhelming feeling of being lifted, and the visual song I was seeing began to take the form of a staircase behind my eyelids. Now, keep in mind, the patterns I was seeing were not detailed, realistic patterns, but only vague close d-eye images that I more knew the identity of than actually saw. As the song built up to the climax, the stairway moved faster and faster until at the climactic end, I felt an overwhelming sense of being thrust upward, and my visual conscience was blinding image of white. As the song ended and went to the next track, a very mellow, reverberating tune, I felt as if I was floating in a gravity-less void. Suddenly, I knew I was having what some may call an 'out of body' experience. Even more surprising, I felt a deeply spiritual connection with myself and my surroundings. I started hearing and seeing words in my head. They said 'Everyone and everything needs God.' 'God must come from you.' 'God is you.' 'God is all.' etc, etc. I was overcome with euphoria, and in my trance-like introspective environment, I felt like shouting and crying.

My girlfriend snapped me out of this state when she tapped me on the shoulder and let me know that she was off work. As we walked to her car I felt extremely 'out of it'. We had to give our friend a ride to her boyfriend's house, and the whole trip is very vague an surreal in my memory. We got out at our friend's boyfriend's house and said hello to some very close friends. By this point I was beginning to feel a bit more normal, but still really high. I decided that I was at the peak level of most other times I had smoked. P decided she wanted to leave, so we drove to get some food (munchies didn't decide to wan), and then she dropped me off at her work to get my car (I was feeling high still, but not extremely). I headed back to her house, following her, but was distracted when I saw some friends on the side of the road. I stopped to talk to them for a while, and then got back to her house.

There I seriously began my comedown. I looked at the clock and saw that it was half past eleven. Time felt impossible to consider. The time between when I had smoked and then seemed like much more than four hours, but much less as well. We watched a little TV, and I left at around 12:30.

I'm now sitting at my computer typing this, dealing with my 'high over' (the very despondent and surreal feeling I get after I have been high for a while) and considering my evening. My religious views still remain the same, but I definitely understand the need for spirituality. I don't view it as a supernatural concept or a submission to any higher power, but an inner understanding of the importance and awesomeness of reality and existence. I now have an idea of 'God'. It is truly everything. I don't mean this in the animistic sense, I only mean that as opposed to worshiping an unknowable entity as a higher power, I feel a sense of 'worship' toward reality as the only power.

My evening gave me a whole new respect for marijuana. I still don't plan on using it regularly; I just can't fathom the idea of constantly being high. However, I think I now understand the powerful ability of the drug, and I definitely have experienced the difference between good weed and ditch weed.

I was so excited when I felt it. 'Yes, this is it, this is it! I'm finally there! So this is what it feels like!' The things they said seemed hollow and almost meaningless and I would try so hard to rationalize everything they said. Trying to make sense of the words was like trying to learn a whole new language, or even a new method of communication. In the process, I would come up with all these conclusions to what they might have meant. It made me feel like a philosophical genius making sense of my new world! Other times, I was just simply confused, or didn't give a crap lol.

I think the best way to sum up the feeling is to describe the body as a laggy computer. My reaction to all external stimuli seemed to lag, but only because I was so focused I think the best way to sum up the feeling is to describe the body as a laggy computer. My reaction to all external stimuli seemed to lag, but only because I was so focused and thinking so hard in my own train of thought in another reality. I felt disconnected from the world, and I would travel back to reality and back to my own world, going up and down. All of my senses seemed to follow the same numb lagging sensation including my brain. My hands felt like they were flopping around when I was driving in GT5. Everything on the screen seemed to pop out at me, the picture so bright and vivid, and the letters seemed to move around. My mind would look at something, and the movement of my eyeball would lag shortly behind. Then I would have to process what I saw, often drifting off into some other tangent thought. Sounds were magical, so thought provoking, and I could imagine so much through my new state of mind. I could create a whole new world even out of nothing, and even more so with all the sights and sounds I was trying to analyze. They say artists get there to find inspiration and I could definitely see why. It was so amazing. I was sleepy before, but I didn't want to sleep anymore. I was having too much fun exploring my new world with curiosity.

An intense craving for food hit me and I got so excited. I was thinking 'Oh my God! This is it! This is the munchies!' I could feel my mouth salivating on its own as I imagined drool dripping the ground despite feeling very dry-mouthed, and it felt like I was slobbering all over the place! I tried wiping my mouth with my hand only to realize it's dry. I drank some water and I was so excited because water had never tasted so good! 

I shared all of my excitement, all giddy and giggling. I would often feel like they weren't on my level and I would wish that they were on my level. I felt sad for them. I felt sympathy. I also crawled down to kiss the Guinea Pig. Finally, I was handed some butter popcorn. The way I would describe eating the popcorn would be like pouring butter all over my mouth. I could feel the intense buttery flavor drip down my chin as I ate the popcorn and the taste would stay there, just as strong, even as I switched to some plain bread. The bread was as if I was eating a block of butter. It was so amazing. It was orgasmic! Food never tasted so good. The grainy bread felt funny as I tried to pick pieces of bread caught from my upper lip. The bread would feel like it's still there from my delayed and lagging senses. It felt like I had a mouthful of bread crumbs in my mouth even though there wasn't anymore. And when I started to attack my 3 burgers, it felt like my mouth was on automatic chewing mode as if it had a mind of its own. I was eating nonstop and I didn't even have to think about chewing. I was worried I would bite my tongue off! And all this took place after I had already eaten to a full stomach! When I hit the ketchup in my Sourdough Jack, at first it was like 'What the hell is this?!' But then it was like a nuclear taste explosion of ketchup, and I was so excited thinking 'So this is what ketchup freaking tastes like!' Every bite was magical. Food never tasted so good. I could've kept eating on and on. On our way to get food, I felt like we were going warp speed at 45 mph. I was jumping up and down in my seat and clapping my hands from the excitement! Time and space was definitely distorted. I wondered what sex felt like lol.

I would be silent for a while, thinking deeply, and then I would babble nonstop again. I kept wondering if they understood what I meant to say. It was so hard to put my extremely sophisticated thoughts into words. I felt my unconscious side coming out uncontrollably as I constantly tried to suppress it by trying to bring myself back down to reality by trying to focus on other stuff besides all the other deep stuff I was trying to figure out. It made me feel vulnerable and I felt like I was talking too much but couldn't do anything to stop it. I felt a bit embarrassed. I would also go in loops, or fall deeper and deeper into some of my thoughts, and they would tell me I was repeating the same stuff over and over. Often, I would come up with satisfying 'conclusions', as if a light bulb went off in my head, but at the same time, I told myself that it wouldn't make sense to me anymore if I wasn't there. My first trip took me to another world!

All senses were enhanced; everything tasted better, sounded better, looked better (TV was more vivid), felt better, and smelled better. I slept better too.

I am a 30 year old white male who has graduated high school, and studied a couple years at University but does not have a degree. I have always had an interest in altered states of consciousness. As a child I was fascinated with magic mushrooms after hearing about them from some older kids at the church I went to. Church, at that time, also interested me for very similar reasons. I enjoyed the the altered states of consciousness I could achieve by being still. I studied the bible with a small group of friends. We met at a youth pastor's house at least once a week outside of our normal Wednesday and Sunday Church Bible studies. At that time I also spent time experimenting with drugs vicariously by reading about their effects in library books. I had always been exceedingly cautious about actually taking psychedelic drugs though. In fact, chicken is what most people would call it. Young people never say exceedingly cautious. So I was a chicken, up until 7th grade when I smoked Cannabis for the first time.

My best friend's older brother invited us to sneak out and smoke out of a small south park (it had kenny on it) glass pipe filled with what smelled to me like; fresh shit mixed with skunk spray. I kinda liked it. We smoked until he got a good laugh about how silly we were acting and sent me on my way. After walking into one of the house walls I managed to make my way down the side-street between our houses. As I climbed into bed my mind was racing. I stayed up for I don't know how long thinking about how the music in my earphones sounded incredible, and how my whole body seemed to be floating and buzzing. And then I began to think about myself; the things I did to my brother that hurt our relationship, the things I'd done by lying to myself and others. It started to spiral into what most people would probably consider a bad trip. And to most people, including me at the time, it probably was. 

I woke up the next day and did not try another psychedelic for 5 years. I hadn't liked the WORK it had started in me. I felt poisoned spiritually, I felt worthless and broken. I didn't realize at the time that it was only the negative in me, my ego used to being fed compliments, that was feeling that emotion. It was so powerful at that time that I did not know that elation and joy lay underneath, pulsing from the initial experience smoking Cannabis. As those 5 years rolled by I saw more and more the selfishness and hatred and judgement in myself. I couldn't control it. I was headed towards rock bottom and I wasn't even using a single substance. I continued to hurt people emotionally and to keep my own emotions properly guarded.
Maybe at the last minute, maybe miles from bottom. I can't be sure. But thankfully, I never hit that bottom, I was saved. Though, I know when, who and what saved me. 

It was my first semester of college. My first time away from home for a length longer than a month. I still maintained a healthy lust for inquiry about all manner of psychedelics. I had begun to read internet articles from various websites and had in my head at the time what I thought was a solid foundation in how psychedelics 'worked'. HA! So it was after a couple weeks feeling my dorm mates out for who would be 'cool' about trying some weed I struck up an awkward conversation with who I considered the most likely candidate for coolness (we lived in a particularly restrictive area in the dorms that promised extra punishment for illicit activities). Turns out I had an eye for the right person. An, AVID weed smoker we'll call B. I mean, his motto was 'smoke weed everyday, daily.' His parents thought that the substance-free dormitory area would be good for him and keep him out of trouble... parents can be kinda ignorant, amirite? Ok, back to me. And Salvation. As you can probably infer, Cannabis is my salvation.

When I smoked with B for the first time, the same initial feelings I had as a youngster started to come back. I was light-headed, and warm and music sounded great. But then, the same introspection I had such an aversion to started to manifest. I awkwardly excused myself and went back to my dorm room where I prepared to feel really uncomfortable about myself again for several hours. I lay down, and as I did thoughts came into my head and quickly desseminated into a million different seemingly random mental pathways. With my eyes closed I was traveling at lightspeed through a network of multi-colored fibers, each one representing to me, a thought. A thought that would eddy and disappear quickly in the current of my consciousness when I tried to grasp it. And somehow instead of negative emotions and egotistical walls presenting themselves as they head done previously, a connection was made. I saw in my minds eye the love and joy and peace that was pulsing beneath a sea of my ego and self delusion. It was a song of love, being called out from the depth of my hatred and anger and pain. I knew in my brain at the same time that I had to reach that space. 

I set into my head at that moment that I would do whatever I could to know that song and know that love. Then Cannabis spoke. She spoke to me with words, and pictures and ideas. She showed me how I was poisoning my relationships and how I was poisoning myself. She began the good work in me I had never experienced in all of my years of rigorous biblical study. And right then and there I took up that work. And I has been a very, very long  hard road. One I have not seen the end of. But; through daily cannabis use, and through focused attention to my path and my personal work, and the use of other psychoactive compounds and plant allies, I have come to know that song a little better. I have honesty on my side, I have love on my side. And every day I do the work, the melody gets sweeter.

Cannabis (1) : General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)




 




DOSE:
0.25 g
smoked
Cannabis





BODY WEIGHT:
65 kg





Setting: Relaxed and feeling at ease with myself at home at evening time.

Dosage: Around 0,25gram, smoked through a bong. 

I was at the time 20 years old and had only previously experimented with Hashish and Marijuana.

What I'm about to describe, happened to me earlier this year while smoking very potent Marijuana. Up until that time, I had used Cannabis a handful of times, including eating hash-brownie, which by the way was the first time I ever tried Cannabis. The brownie experience is a story in itself because it was very powerful way to enter a non-ordinary state of consciousness. But the experience I had this time, was beyond my wildest imagination and the brownie-session is like comparing an apple with the earth.

First, I was in my room experiencing the come-up effects of the weed. The feeling of high came instantaneously after I inhaled the smoke. The deepening of my consciousness began to increase steadily, as well as feeling the increasing shakiness in my body. Perhaps 5 minutes into it, my sister and her boyfriend came into my room. They kept asking me if I wanted some water and how I was feeling? My response was 'Is this really Marijuana?! You must have put something else in it seriously!' Which they of course didn't because I knew it was still weed, even it it was coming on so differently. I felt as if my consciousness was being pulled inwards more and more, away from reality more so than ever before. And I remember one time when they called my name, I heard it multiple times as if it was coming closer each time they said it like from long distance away. But as minutes ticked by I was being pulled in faster and I could also experience time actually slowing down in front of my eyes. I moved my arm from right to left, leaving a trail of my arm in a wavy motion. This amazed me so much because I didn't realize how powerful marijuana could be to my perception of time.

By now I would say that time had passed about 15 minutes from the initial inhaling. It was at this time that things were beginning to become weird.

After lying down on my bed, I must have fallen asleep or something because I don't remember falling into it but suddenly my consciousness was being taken beyond the dreaming state into another dimension. I realized so clearly why all human beings enter into dreaming and deep dream-less sleep every night. The realization was that our consciousness merges with the Source and draws vital energy from it to sustain our wakeful state of consciousness. But we don't do this consciously and this is why it is such a mystery to what happens with us during non-dreaming sleep. But as I went passed this insight and into the other dimension, I was so confused at first because I did not have any contact with my body anymore. It felt like I was flowing and becoming one with the energies behind the Universe. In this state, I was fully aware that there was no separation between anything, all is really one. The weird thing though, is that it felt more real than anything I have ever felt in my life. It was beyond life. I remember that my conscious-self realized that I must have died and that I might never return to my body again. A peculiar sense of non-completeness struck me as a sign that I hadn't finished what I came to do in my life.

Everything had happened so fluidly and time had completely ceased to exist as if I had escaped out of the time-space dimension completely.

I still could not connect with my body, but I remember that I had the realization that everything I thought was real to me in my life was really just a wakeful dream. This was something I had thought about a lot before, that we are just going through life believing everything to be real just because our perception and thinking tells us so. However, it is a complete different thing experiencing it with your own consciousness, seeing the illusion that this material reality is.

Slowly I began to accept that this was the end for me and that I might move forward in my journey. However it was perhaps sometime after this, that I started to feel that my body was taking my consciousness back into my body again and when I opened my eyes, I could not look at things the same way ever again. It must have passed around 3-4 hours after I talked to my sister and her boyfriend until I came back.

It was such a powerful experience that it took me months to even grasp what had happened to me and an attempt to explain it in words seems so weak in comparison to what had actually happened. I hope you enjoyed though!

I would like to take this opportunity to dedicate this report to the memory of Sepher, Research In Peace to Sepher, & blessings to all those who came before us & all those to come! 

11:15am half blotter, 75ug, gummed

11:40 possible alerts, light head, vague feeling of pull at back of neck, very common first alert for me. Jumped up after a half hour of deep breathing & meditative thought, rinsed out some clothes & hung 'em up in the sunshine. Looking forward to a solo walk in the park later, Sister Moon has dissertation work to do today, & gets trapped indoors with hayfever anyway, this time of year. Besides, I am the one who tests completely novel RC's before I let her have a look. I now return to my previous horizontal state to continue to await further effects & to contemplate.

12:15 One hour since initial. Blotter chewed & swallowed. First alert may have been placebo. Little activity if any from half blotter at this point. I'll give it another half hour then the next half goes in. There may be somethng here, I can't quite put my finger on it yet, but I do feel kinda chilled, relaxed. I have no idea if this is a result of the chemical, my fully rounded personality or simply the relaxation techniques employed ;)

12:45 still uncertain of the nature of the effects, but still think there's something there... Ate a ripe peach, a bread roll & a bag of Cheese & Onion... as well as another half tab. Well I gummed it again, to be entirely accurate, & now back to meditation & breathing. Drying hoodie is making amusingly entertaining drip splat drip sounds nearby. See, definitely something there...

13:00 gradual increase in & building of effects noted now. Still extremely subtle but I may have caught some imprinting when glancing at & away from a monochrome fractal poster on my wall. There seems to be a little more red, pink & orange in my visible spectrum that might usually be present. I continue to kick back, occassionally fielding psychedelic queries from Sister Moon, her dissertation investigating the psychedelic elemments in the music of Bauhaus. Still very comfortable, mentally & physcally, a very nice, relaxing way to spend a gorgeous summer Saturday

13:15 this may sound strange, & I am proudly naive to opiates, but I'm feeling a vague, distant & familiar sense of codiene-like contentedness. Still not alot in the psychedelic department. Due to my extreme financial hardship & the fact that I only got three of these, I suspect I may have to call it after this latest half, for fear of not having a chance to share an adequate dose with my gf in the near future. I'd also like to give tolerance a longer opportunity to set in, as it's only been 7 days since we enjoyed a park/pizza trip on Al-Lad, Friday before last. My first session on Al came less than 7 days after a weekend on psychedelic Phenethylamines & after a 10 day break I noticed an obvious, general increase in effects from the Al.

13:30 visuals are picking up a little & my mind is less clear now, foggier, heavier. Hand eye coordination has also been affected slightly, typing is slightly trickier than it was 15 minutes ago. The appearance of tracers & other common visual activity has increased.

14:00 Effects have increased now, so time to chew up the blotter. Also, I feel like a challenge, so I'm gong to cex to buy a couple Sci Fi DVD's

15:00 Wow, fully immersed now. This shit is a slow-burner, & it's reminding me a little bit of a Doxx type experience. Took a walk through my busy town centre in search of cez & some Sci Fi DVD's. Met incredulous stare with 'hayfever'. How else can I explain DVD purchases on the hottest, sunniest day of the year? Came home to find Captain Pickard elbows deep in a borg corpse, which was interesting...

15:45 Might still be building! Quite facinating so far. Relaxing but powerful psychedelia, deeper & stronger than Al-Lad, so far. Much slower aproach from LSZ than from Al-Lad is noted. This is without question quantifiably different to Al-Lad, as unique as all these remarkable compounds tend to be! I am certain that with little more than one or two more goes on this stuff I would be able to tell it apart from damn near any other psychedelic drug I've ever tried. I've had scorn poured quite recently on my ascertion that even after decades (my last dose of LSD was summer 1996! & yes, I remember EXACTLY what LSD is like, you don't trip 30 or 40 times & f*cking forget what LSD is like, ever!) I can tell the difference between Al-Lad & LSD itself. I stand by that!

16:30 still pretty busy here. Heading back outdoors for a spliff in the sunshine with Sister Moon! It is FUCKING hot out there today. I LOVE it like this, it's not even that humid. Kinda reminds me of Ibiza today, except Ibiza is humid! I think the effects peaked about half hour ago, I feel as though I might be on the downslope now. Not certain or anything, if this is anything like the orginal L, it's bound to ease off in waves, much like it started of course...

20:30 still around. I thought things were tailing off a bit, & I do find it easier to type now. But this stuff is still around. Plenty of classical psychedelia, reminiscent & tantalisingly similar but distinctly different to it's better known molecular cousin(s). Once again, a brand new experience has outstripped the previous. I wonder what the stability of this molecule is compared to the unknowns or doomful prophecies of Al-Lad? If this compound is more or likely to be more stable it certainly provides an equilibrium of effects. Duration of a single 150ug hit is unknown to me so far, but I'd say from what's gone on so far today that LSz outstrips Al-Lad as an all round +++ psychedelic. I suspect with equalised tolerance, & going purely on this one experiment, 150ug of LSz will take you deeper, longer into the realm of psychedelic effects than you might visit compared to a single 150ug dose of Al-Lad. Once again, I am basing that conlusion after just this one experience!

While I had a shower my gf tried to distract me & caused some uncontrollable hilarity by pointing out that Ned Flanders would probably call these things er~giggly~ergoloids or something...

Anyway, this has been a thoroughly unique & facinating endevour today. It's been about 5 hours I'd say, since the effects were certainly established, until now where they remain steady but waning... I supect to be clear within two hours, tired & capable of sleep. There was probably more ergot in my morning toast today than on my blotter, & probably an awful lot less on my blotter than is in the average pint of beer. Er~giggly~ergoloids are just so supremely well tolerated in man, I'd be simply gobsmacked if there was a single unhealhty aspect to what I've spent my day doing, enjoying the sun with a smile on my face, a relaxed step & a very serious gleam in my eye!

21:30 Definitely easing off now I expect to be completely baseline by 22:30 I expect easy sleep before midnight.

Another very interesting molecule!

I am a 22 year old male weighing about 215 pounds. This experience happened after about 6 months of casual marijuana use. I have found that I seem to be a lightweight as regards marijuana (and alcohol as well). On the night in question, in order to escape from some stressful thoughts I was having, I decided to get a little messed up.

THE BACKGROUND: I am a late bloomer as far as substance use. I have consumed the legal psychoactive caffeine since childhood. I began smoking nicotine (cigars and pipes, never cigarettes) at age 19. I drank my first alcohol at age 21 and later that same year I had my first experience with cannabis. As part of my ongoing exploration of substances, I have decided to try LSD, although I have not yet done so. However, the reader should be aware that I was researching it heavily at the time of this experience, and so my mind was filled with info on LSD trips and psychedelics in general going into this experience. I was surprised in reading psychedelia literature, particularly that of the 50s, to find that cannabis was considered among the psychedelics. I have never thought of weed as a hallucinogen and certainly among the casual stoners in my social circle, none have discussed marijuana as being in any way trippy. Since having the experience detailed here, I no longer question the inclusion of Cannabis among the psychedelics.

SET: My overall mindset was somewhat tumultuous (I was in the midst of a painful breakup), however my mindset toward the drug itself was positive.

SETTING: When I dosed, I was sitting on my back porch and watching a movie on my laptop.

T-1:00 Remember I was intentionally getting slightly messed up this night to put the brakes on some destructive thought patterns. Prior to dosing on the Cannabis I consumed a Red Bull (approx 76 mg of caffeine), smoked a heavy San Cristobal Maduro cigar containing probably 200 mg of nicotine (I absorbed a large portion of this because I was retrohaling), and drank a large snifter of brandy (about 90 mL of alcohol).

T+0:00 I took about six large hits of cannabis. This is far more than I have ever smoked (my previous max being 3-4 hits). The hits were likely larger than usual as well, because I was smoking from a tobacco pipe, which has a larger hole and a larger bowl than a weed pipe (I think). An unfortunate incident occurred right after I took my last hit: my roommate/landlord, C, came out on the deck and asked what I was doing. I rent a bedroom from a family, so I share their house with two adults and a toddler. I had not asked if it was OK to smoke weed (this was my first time smoking weed at the house), and only when C saw me smoking did it even occur to me that I might have transgressed a boundary of their household. Although C did not recriminate me and did not get mad, I became inwardly panicked and felt guilty. However, I was quickly becoming so stoned that this was no longer relevant. C went back inside, and as I watched the movie I became aware that I was getting too stoned to move.

I decided that if I didnt move inside and go to my room, I would soon be too stoned to do anything and would end up freezing on the porch all night (weed has a tendency to make me shiver and feel cold). So I moved my computer and speakers inside (this task seemed to take forever), mumbled a word of apology to C, who was in the kitchen, and set off downstairs toward my bedroom.

This is when the trippy aspects of this weed high began to hit me. When the idea crossed my mind to go downstairs to my room, I had the distorted perception that my room was a very faraway place and that it didnt exist in my present reality. Reaching it seemed like a laughable impossibility. This struck me as very odd and the thought passed through my brain Im tripping.

My feet went on autopilot and I floated down to my room. I was experiencing visual/spatial effects. For instance, a sort of tunnel vision, as well as a reduced frame-rate that made my perceptions seem like a slideshow.

It took all my concentration to get undressed, put a CD on my stereo (of all things, Haydns Stabat Mater), turn off the lights and crawl into bed. Then things got way trippy.

According to the Wikipedia article for 'Psychedelic experience', what I experienced over the next 2.5 hours was representative of a Level 2 or Level 3 psychedelic experience. I did not have open-eye visuals (except for a warping/curvature when looking at objects that were immediately in front of my face), but I did experience 3-dimensional closed-eye/minds-eye visuals, I experienced a mixing of the senses, with the music I was hearing often manifesting in visual form, extreme time dilation and a continuous perception of eternity. Body movement was difficult and disorienting because minute muscle motions caused intense euphoria to sweep over my body (the closest comparison I can make is to an orgasm). For this reason, I spent a large portion of the trip simply laying in the bed undulating my limbs.

The most striking aspect to me at the time was the extremely vivid ongoing minds-eye/closed eye hallucinations. I pictured all kinds of scenarios and apparitions, most of them cartoonish and inscrutable. The most nagging one was a continuously morphing object which always moved from left-to-right across my visual field, usually against a background of stars. It was a cartoonish object which I felt sure represented a motif from my childhood (probably a show I used to watch) however I felt that it never took its true form and instead was morphing through related/reminiscent shapes: a tennis shoe, a shark, a rollerblade, a car, a space shuttle, a lightning bolt, an electric guitar, a pizza slice. I had the very uncomfortable feeling that none of these were really what the object was. The cartoonish visions sometimes became very present and 3D. One recurring 3D image/sensation was of an enormous fungal venus flytrap which filled the space around me and closed around my body.

At one point I began to masturbate and have vivid sexual fantasies, which, while I knew they were not real, had an extremely vivid and lifelike quality, and were certainly rendered in a very present, in-the-room, 3D. After reaching orgasm I worried because I was not sure if the loud screaming in my fantasy had been merely imagined or had come out of my mouth and I share a relatively thin wall with my roommates bedroom.

My bedside lamp is an LCD lamp which means that after it is switched off, it gives a dull afterglow for several minutes. The lamplight was far too bright to have on, but I found if I closed my eyes then switched the light on and off, the glow was enough to see by (there was also a glow from the face of my digital alarm clock). This allowed me to do basic tasks in the dark such as drinking water from a glass on my nightstand. Mostly, though, I just held my hands up in the light and noticed that they appeared warped. They elongated and curved. Also, by holding them in certain configurations I could convince myself they were faces or other objects.

I had very vivid imaginary experiences that had a similar present, lifelike quality. For instance, at one point I imagined sticking my head into my own fingertip and getting sucked up my own arm. I also imagined that I had floated off my mattress and turned over 360 degrees and floated back down.

My mental state became very present-oriented and I lost track of time in a big way. The situations and issues of my life became totally forgotten, in fact I couldnt really remember who anyone that I knew was. The only people I could really bring to mind in that semi-delirious state were my roommates infant son and my mother, both of whom seemed to me to be saintly beings of total goodness. Even my girlfriend, who had been the cause of my terrible mood earlier in the night, didnt seem real or memorable at all. I had a persisting sensation of ego-loss or partial ego-death, disconnecting from my life and from my identity, although this was not accompanied by any sensations of cosmic oneness as I have read about in LSD or Psilocybin trips.

Throughout this experience I kept thinking 3 main recurring thoughts: holy shit, I only smoked weed!, wow Im fucking tripping, and wow this is lasting forever, when will it stop?

I often feared that I was forgetting to breathe. I would feel a heavy sensation on my face, and realize I had not breathed for some time, so I would take a big breath. Vivid and detailed 3D visuals accompanied my breathing. At one point I envisaged the inside of my lungs as being a large hollow area like the inside of a ship, with my lungs, ribs, etc made out of wood and run by intricate clockwork. I could perceive this whole cavern expanding and contracting in three dimensions.

T+2:00 At this point I began to come down from the height of the high. I realized that I had plugged my clock in when I came into the room (when it is unplugged it resets to midnight), so the time showing on the face was the precise time since I had laid down, about two hours (it had felt like 5-6 hours). I found I was still very stoned, but I tried to turn on the TV to get back to reality. 

T+2:30 I saw my friend A had texted me, so I texted him back and he came and picked me up. I was still very high and as I got dressed and walked out to his car, I was still experiencing the tunnel vision and slow frame-rate I had experienced earlier in the evening. I still experienced occasional vivid minds-eye visuals and had some stereotypical high experiences, such as eating a fuck-ton of donuts and being overwhelmed by the number of batteries on a grocery stores display rack.

T+4:00 By the time we got back to my house, I was down off my high, although symptoms of dissociation from my life and general disorientation persisted through the next day.

The whole experience was far beyond what I believed was possible with weed (remembering, of course, that it was supplemented by significant doses of caffeine, nicotine and alcohol), and it made me excited to someday use LSD and experience a real trip.

Ill begin my account of the cannabis induced  experience I had last night after a brief introduction and a slab of background information about myself. Im an 18 year old college student majoring in liberal arts. Im a very analytical person by nature and I am very interested in philosophy (even when I'm not stoned). Ive been smoking marijuana daily for about six months  (2-3 dime bags daily). Typically after smoking cannabis I become intensely philosophical. Ive come to many realizations, both good and bad about reality and existence itself. 

I met up with three of my close friends after class and bought a dime off of a friends neighbor. Wed smoked their weed before and generally agreed that this dealer had decent marijuana. The last time I smoked the marijuana we scored from this dealer I felt relaxed and experienced a normal high. Last night I went on an unexpected, horrifying trip to the base of reality and the core of truth.

About 9pm: L rolls the blunt and we go into his backyard to smoke. I take about five hits.

9:05 pm: Shortly after we smoke I feel my body tingle and my hands and feet go numb. My train of thought becomes disorganized. Im unsure exactly what is wrong with my thought process yet.

9:08 pm: I feel like my upper body (my face, shoulders, and torso) is swaying back and forth, left and right. I ask my friends if Im moving and they tell me Im not. 

9:10pm: Im starting to freak out because the feeling of swaying back and forth hasnt stopped. My friends seem completely serious when they insist that Im standing still. It seems that Im thinking way too fast.  My thoughts are out of pace with time. Theyre moving at lightning speed, and Im processing thousands of complex thoughts in just a couple of seconds. This has the effect of making everything around me, that is, everything around my thoughts, seem incredibly slow. Time is dragging, the sound of a car driving by lingers and is still audible even when the car is out of sight.

9:20pm: I begin to have memory lapses. I begin moving my head, neck, and arms over and over again in the same motions until I catch myself and realize what Im doing. Im zoning out into a deep, bottomless train of thought. I want to stop thinking and I do manage to clear my head for a couple seconds at a time. However, the thoughts race back again at lightning speed. I was thinking in a cycle about going crazy, reassuring myself that nobody goes crazy from smoking weed, completely forgetting what was going on, and then remembering what was going on and preparing myself for this thought loop over and over again like a cycle. Only each time I got to the next part of the cycle it felt like the first time.  I begin to fear permanent brain damage. I remember that during the first part of this cycle or thought loop my mind was stuck in, I did not realize what was wrong with my thoughts (which caused me to panic). During the middle of the thought loop I would realize that I was either thinking too fast or too slow, (which caused me to panic further), I wasnt able to figure out which was true (if my thoughts were moving too FAST? or too SLOW?) and this frightened me even more.I would then realize that the solution to this problem would be to stop worrying about the fact that I was thinking either to fast or too slow, only to zone off into my thoughts inexplicably and uncontrollably, and enter this thought loop all over again. My friends and I leave the backyard and begin walking around the streets.

9:22pm: Im getting the social signals, like body language, that my friends are sending me wrong. I think Im misinterpreting their messages. When they laugh and shake their head at my confused state I mistake this for malicious, underhanded mocking. In retrospect, they were not laughing maliciously, but were probably trying to calm me down by not freaking out. I react to what I perceive as this malicious attack by sending out my own social signals like giving dirty looks and sighing heavily. I then try to interpret the reactions of my friends, and it seems to me that they are responding with more negative and malicious social signals. In reality, Im sure none of them were even thinking about me or their body language, as they were all enjoying their own highs. I continued to try and send them what I perceived to be sly malicious social signals in some imaginative retaliation for their perceived mockery. I get very caught up in their every movement and assume that it has some deep social signal attached to it. This continues throughout the ordeal. 

9:25pm: As my friends and I are walking, I zone off into thought which seems to be part of the thought loop cycle I mentioned earlier. I suddenly wonder where social signals come from. Where do thoughts come from? Where do the things that make thoughts come from? What is the base of reality? What was the first prototype of a thought, or an atom, a loaf of bread, or a human being? Why are things in reality the way they are? I determine that I cannot prove my own existence because if one takes reality as a whole, everything it consists of, people, time, places, feelings, objects, etc, and puts it on a silver plate, there is nothing to compare reality and everything it consists of to. For example, we do not know of another reality to compare time to, so if I held up a watch that claims that it is 9:25pm, and beckoned the other reality to confirm that the time on my watch was accurate, and it was indeed 9:25pm, I would get no response. Im worried because I believe that Ive entered another dimension of thought,  and once you cross the line into this dimension there is no denying what youve discovered.

9:27pm: Im terrified by my new revelation about not being able to prove reality really exists. I decide to head home. I believe Im walking the right way and then suddenly realize that Ive walked two blocks in the wrong direction. At this point I felt exhausted so I called a friend from my cell phone and asked her to come and pick me up. I babbled something to her about smoking weed and walking home the wrong way. I asked her to pick me up outside of a store I was near.

9:45pm: My friend arrives and must have been pretty freaked out because she asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital. I was still swaying and shaking, and talking about my new revelation about reality. I asked her to take me to the hospital. However, she was afraid to take me there because of the consequences she thought I could face including loosing my college scholarship. For some reason, because of the social signals I felt she was sending me, I didnt trust her. I thought she was lying to me and was in fact planning to take me to the hospital and that Id probably live there for the rest of my life. She was asking me questions like what day is it and who is the president, surprisingly, all of which I could answer. When she asked these questions I suspected that she was assessing my mental state and or the urgency of taking me to the hospital. Then I looked out the car window and saw that we were circling around the hospital, driving around the block over and over again, (which we werent). Suddenly we arrived at her house, on the other side of town. I now conclude that I was experiencing some kind of paranoid delusion when I thought we were driving around the hospital.

9:55pm: We get to my friends house and I tell her if Im not better in the morning to please not let me continue to live that way. She was terrified, but she was trying not to show it because she didnt want me to freak out completely. At this point I sat up in her bed for hours and just experienced the thought loop because I knew I was unable to control it. I realized after a while that it might help to count from one to ten to try and keep track of time, because I was thinking too quickly. This seemed to help, but then I would realize that I zoned off again not long after reaching the number ten. When my thoughts did begin to slow down, I felt an overwhelming sense of normalcy.  My thoughts were in sync with time for brief periods and I could feel this.

I finally fell asleep around 2:am. 


I wrote this account of my horrifying experience nearly one year ago. It is a fresh account of what happened, as I wrote it the next day. I had panic attacks everyday for several weeks after I had this experience, which sometimes began immediately when I woke up in the morning. I also had experiences of disassociation from my environment for nearly one month after the initial ordeal. I would simply feel as if I was not real for hours or even a whole day. This happened when I was sitting on the bus, I looked around, and up at the ceiling of the bus, and felt as though I was not really there, and that I did not exist in this environment, along side with these people. The same thing would happen in class, at my friends house, etc. My three friends who all hit off the same blunt as I did unanimously reported feeling normal highs.

from http://www.nerve.com/love-sex/i-did-it-for-science/i-did-it-for-science-drugs

by Grant Stoddard

In honor of Burning Man, an event where sex, drugs, and sex on drugs are all pretty commonplace things, we're taking a look at an old favorite: how a few of the more popular intoxicants on the market affect the oldest drug in the book.

Hypothesis 

I've never really had sex on drugs, but they've always been linked in my mind. Maybe that's because the guys who did drugs in high school were also getting sucked off by girls. Even today, I'm convinced that a boring, homely acquaintance of mine can truthfully claim an Elle cover model is his girlfriend only because he has an endless supply of Bolivian marching powder on hand.

But this experiment is about sex on drugs, not sex for drugs. Therefore, I plan to conduct the sexual act in its purest, most apolitical form  while being totally off my head. My goal is to find a dependable accessory to sex.

In other words, I want to find My Drug. It's like when you're sixteen, and you rummage around in your parents' liquor cabinet trying to determine which drink will be Your Drink. (Embarrassingly, mine's still Malibu and Coke.) The question I intend to answer: is sex on drugs even better than the real thing, or, like the inclusion of 'Hotter Than Hell (Demo Version)' on the reissue of Motley Crue's Shout at the Devil, just an unnecessary augmentation of the sublime?

Materials 

Viagra (1, 50 mg)
Ecstasy (1, type: 'Ninja Star')
Mushrooms
Cocaine ($40 worth)
Marijuana (1 nugget, strain: 'Juicy Fruit')
Girlfriend (1)
Method

I was an impressionable kid, and I was made leery of drugs at a young age. My fourth-grade teacher was an unkempt hippie who wore shirts with yellow pit stains and stored bits of lunch in his formidable beard. Once he told our class how two of his friends tried some magic mushrooms and keeled over right there, in some English meadow. Now, imagine your teacher telling you that when you're nine years old. It was some cold shit, I assure you. I was scared straight before my time. (Note of context: I saw Dark Crystal that same year and soiled my pants right in the theater.)

Adolescence brought me neither sex nor drugs. Since then, I've taken full advantage of everything I missed out on during a little period I like to call 'the 1990s,' but a move to New York only compounded my drug-based anxiety. Namely, I started to equate an old girlfriend's casual cocaine use with infidelity. I resented the way she'd disappear into a tiny scuzz-bar bathroom with her shady hook-up guy, then return to my side with a sly grin and sparkly eyes. Who knows what they were doing in there? Why was some other dude being drafted to make her feel good?

My current girlfriend went through what she calls her 'drug phase' a long time ago. Let me put it this way: if drugs were crayons, Erica started with the sixty-four pack. By the age of twenty-one, she'd done ketamine, meth, opium, whip-its  a maelstrom of substances that'd render her dangerous to cremate. When I requested her assistance with this experiment, she launched into an excruciating monologue about the finer details of being in a K-hole. It left us both slightly nauseated. Reluctantly, she agreed to participate, but only if she could stay clean and serve as a witness.

My editor decreed that the study would involve five substances. Crank, crack, inhalants, and the big H were ruled out at an early stage. We settled on ecstasy, cocaine, marijuana, mushrooms, and Viagra. Each would be evaluated by six criteria: immediate physical effect, tactile response, duration of sex, mental images produced, lab assistant's reaction, and comparison to usage outside the sexual realm.

Getting the drugs wasn't a problem. I had a pretty good idea which friends and co-workers could hook me up with what. I put out the call, and during the next week, nondescript envelopes appeared in discreet areas of my desk like four visits from the drug fairy. Only Bob Dole's little blue friend proved elusive. Online Viagra vendors were too expensive, and borrowing from someone's prescription wasn't an option: because my co-workers are women in the twenty-five to thirty age bracket, they aren't exactly in the prime demographic for erectile dysfunction. I finally turned to Craigslist, an infamous online bulletin board where one can obtain 'a slippery hand job, no questions asked,' from a bored stay-at-home mom as easily as one can acquire a used Thighmaster.

Sure enough, some guy had posted a 'Viagra Available' ad. He had a few pills left at $30 a pop. After a quick email volley, I met 'Mac,' a buff Latino dude, outside his gym in an upscale Brooklyn neighborhood. He invited me to 'take a little walk' with him. As we strolled down a tree-lined residential avenue, every apple-cheeked, stroller-toting family looked like a team of undercover narcs. 'You've done this shit before, right?' Mac asked. I nervously replied that I had not. He assured me that I was going to have 'a real good time.' It was then that I became acutely embarrassed: here I was, talking to a stranger  a drug dealer of sorts  about the award-winning, four-hour erection he was going to help me achieve. 'Half of one of these will be plenty,' Mac said, handing over a little envelope containing the goods. 'You've got four great nights there!' We shook hands, and he asked if I needed anything else. I wasn't sure what he meant. Some Preparation-H, some tough-actin' Tinactin, perchance? The man was like a walking Rite-Aid.

Back in Manhattan, Erica and I were determined to get right down to business. We wanted to keep the experiment pure, minding two very important guidelines:

1. Have sex while as high as possible.
2. Cleanse the palate between drugs. It would be scientifically irresponsible to hoof a baggie of blow while in the throes of a 'moody Tuesday' brought on by Sunday's ecstasy.

Of course, everything went pear-shaped. Typically, Erica and I will get it on wherever, whenever, but for the next several weeks, whenever we were together and horny with a couple of hours to spare, the gear would be sitting in the other person's apartment across town. I started carrying everything with me at all times. For a week, I walked the streets of New York like a living sampler plate of narcotic treats. Still, we couldn't get our shit together: whenever I was free, Erica had to work, and vice versa.

All told, I had two months to plan, execute and deliver the assignment.

I ended up doing all five drugs within seventy-two hours. 


Viagra 

As instructed by my dealer-cum-pharmacist, I cut the dime-sized 100mg tablet in half and knocked one back with a glass of water. I knew that Viagra takes twenty-five to forty-five minutes to kick in, so Erica and I sat down to watch American Idol.

Immediate physical reaction 

After twenty minutes, I began to feel queasy and flushed, but I attributed this as much to syrupy renditions of '70s ballads as anything else. Glancing in the mirror, I saw that my ears and cheeks were rosy. According to the 'literature' I'd downloaded from Pfizer's website, Viagra's intended effects are noticeable only once you get an erection. Because I live in a state of perma-arousal, within a minute or two I had a woody so hard that a cat couldn't scratch it.

A little background info: a man experiences different types of erections, from 'The Barfly' to 'The Thumper.' Viagra had given me a pulsing, monster Thumper. To say it plain, my dick felt like it was going to explode. Instantly, I was in that sublime zone between being ridiculously aroused and having to think about Al 'Grandpa Munster' Lewis on the crapper to keep from shooting my bolt.

Tactile effect 

Other than the, uh, physical changes, the main difference was mental. The inherent disconnect between my genitalia and brain widened exponentially. Penises are often referred to as tools, and that's exactly what mine felt like: a woodlike, dildonic prosthesis that was being ridden with little emotional or physical input from me. The experience was strangely feminizing: for the first time, I was a passive partner during sex, able to fuck without necessarily being turned on or even having my head in the game.

Duration of sex 

As expected, intercourse went on for ages. I could have lasted all night, but at just over two-and-a-quarter hours, a chafed, tired and slightly dazed Erica called time. I pulled out and she jerked me off over her boobs. The orgasm was amazing and powerful. I came a lot. A whole lot. Like, something reminiscent of Peter 'Two Quarts' North. Erica and I looked at each other, aghast as a bovine volume of come showered the general vicinity. We started cracking up before I was done. I stopped laughing when the usual refractory period didn't follow  my erection simply wouldn't go away. After twenty minutes, I became concerned. I needed to pee. Badly. Ten minutes later, my erection deflated just enough to allow a painful, wildly imprecise squirt. After that, I returned to a semi-dormant state.

Sensory/mental images 

For ten minutes while we were screwing, every time I blinked I'd see large blue dots, about the size of a dinner plate as viewed from three feet away. I would've been alarmed, but I had read about this side effect on the Pfizer website earlier. Apparently, some men have blue-tinted vision for the better part of their experience. On one hand, that's alarming. The upside, I guess, is that you can pretend you're banging Smurfette.

Assistant's reaction 

Erica didn't note major differences in my technique or presentation, other than a red complexion and a slight emotional distance.

Mushrooms 

I'd never actually seen 'shrooms before a small baggie of them appeared on my desk. Everyone told me that they were 'fun' but 'tasted like ass.' Around two o' clock on a Wednesday afternoon, Erica sliced several into a peanut-butter-and-pickle sandwich, which I tried to eat without chewing and almost choked to death. At her behest, we went outside to wait for things to kick in. I was told that's how 'shrooms are best enjoyed  other than at a Dave Matthews gig, of course.

Immediate physical reaction 

We walked down Avenue A and looked in some stores. I began to feel queasy and in need of air, so we sat down on a bench in Tompkins Square Park. The nausea subsided, and I began to feel super-chilled-out. Whenever Erica said something, I thought about it hard, mulled my response carefully and delivered it several seconds afterward.

Sensory/mental images 

Aside from a couple of trees in the foreground, the park looked like a piece of stage scenery. People looked like moving Colorforms that had been stuck on. It was like somebody turned up the color-and-silly-grin dial on the TV set in my mind. I watched a bunch of kids run over to a big, jolly man with a shaved head and an entirely tattooed face. They tried to climb him as if he were a stout oak tree. His laughter and general charisma were Santa-esque. He sat down, and his magnetic effect seemed to work on squirrels and birds. Over his shoulder, a toothless old Latina woman let forth a bloodcurdling, wheezy laugh. She straddled a much younger man on a bench, and they started making out and dry humping. A slow-moving police car would idle past, and the woman would temper her movements accordingly. Shortly thereafter, a pigeon flew into my head and flapped its wings on the side of my face. I began to understand that weird shit happens in Tompkins Square Park on a Wednesday afternoon, whether you're on psychedelic drugs or not. Erica and I retrenched to my apartment.

Tactile effect 
We undressed and got into bed, and Erica invited me to watch the room breathe. I stared at the walls but couldn't see it, and wondered aloud why the fuck you would want to do that anyway. Erica and I began to kiss and writhe around, but strangely enough, sex was the furthest thing from my mind. The mushrooms I had taken were supposed to be magic, but my penis was looking decidedly shiitake-like.

Duration of sex 
Erica and I kissed and held each other for fifteen minutes, but I simply had no hydraulic action. Bah! Spooning followed.

Assistant's reaction 
In a phrase: shock and awe. For the first time Erica, witnessed my completely disinterested member. It didn't bother her too much; she found it kind of novel to be spooned without getting the 'hot dog in the bun.'

Marijuana 

First, know this: I can't smoke anything. A mere drag on a cigarette makes me gag. The only time I really got stoned was when I was eighteen and ingested an insane amount of Moroccan hashish via a cup of 'special hot chocolate.' After I drank one cup and noticed no difference, the chef cooked me up a more potent brew. I spent the next four hours alone, vomiting, shivering and firmly under the assumption that I was a piece of black paper cut into a silhouette of a person with red and yellow LEDs running around the perimeter.

Immediate physical reaction 

Because of my general ineptitude with pot, I made this a big production number. Weed: check. Bowl: check. Lighter: check. Condoms: check. I guess if smoking were more natural to me, things would have gone more smoothly, but Erica even had to coach me in how to toke. It was embarrassing. As she prepped the bowl and fired up a lighter, I prepared to inhale. I tried to tell myself that I was just being a pussy all those years ago, that I could handle it now. But even the tang of the residue on the glass pipe caused my mouth to water and my lower lip to droop in that special, just-about-to-barf way. I closed my eyes and took a huge drag. Then I started coughing and couldn't stop. Two minutes later, the hacking subsided and I took another hit. I did this four times over an eight-minute period. Erica rolled her eyes and said that with all the huffing and puffing she'd just witnessed, she'd guesstimate I was a six or seven on the Harrelson scale of highness. I relaxed, and a tingly feeling swept over me. I started screaming, 'I feel high, I feel high! Quick, get undressed!' and shoved her into the bedroom.

Tactile effect 

Bear in mind that this is only the second time I've been stoned. Ever. I felt heavy, like somebody had turned up Earth's gravitational pull a few notches. Erica's skin felt like a soft, warm down comforter, the coziest thing you could imagine. I wanted to wrap her around myself completely. She held me as if I were a small child, and we started making out. The next part is kind of hazy. From what I can remember, as soon as I entered her and we hit a rhythm, my penis felt like a metal rod, pointed north like a compass. Previously, whenever I'd heard the phrase 'time lost its meaning,' I'd laughed at the cliché. But that's exactly how I'd describe the sex we had. Luckily, Erica prompted me to change positions whenever she got bored and/or sore; otherwise I would have kept banging away, blissed-out and stiff as a board, until the break of dawn.

Sensory/mental images 

About two minutes after taking a hit, I experienced visions similar to the ones I had in Morocco, i.e. images of mid-'70s children's furniture with Muppets' heads stuck on them. These appeared like a slide show in my mind, each item scrolling from right to left. Between the images was infinite darkness. Occasionally, I'd see British TV personalities from my early childhood, decked out in mid-to-late-'70s fashions and hairdos. Strangely, the size of the hair didn't seem to match the size of the wearer, as if he or she were quivering under the weight of it all. Maybe that's what the '70s were like. I can't really remember.

Duration of sex 

I'll say it again: time lost its meaning. Erica told me she called time after ninety minutes. My orgasm took a lot of concentration and arrived with a firework finale of obscure memories I'd been unwittingly harboring since I was a toddler. At one point I said to Erica, 'My mind is massive.'

Assistant's reaction 

Erica was already sleepy when we started. We had crammed a lot of drugs and sex into the previous twenty-four hours. If I hadn't known better, I'd have guessed she was stoned too. Instead, she was taking a rare opportunity to relax  without me pulling her around, trying to induce dirty talk or folding her in half at the waist, she just chilled out while I embarked on my bizarro sex trip to the Carter Administration. Afterward, she told me that I had seemed 'somewhere else' during the whole thing, my eyes screwed tight, a bemused expression on my face. Although she initially found this amusing, she said that after a while it was like being schtupped by a zombie or Tom Ridge.

Comparison to drug use without sex 

Even though it was much milder, the experience was similar to the last time I got stoned some seven-and-a-half years earlier. The same mental imagery and heavy feeling were accompanied by  get this!  a different way of understanding time. I guess I'm just really susceptible to pot. I enjoyed the intensity of the experience, though. If I could take a hit without coughing up my pelvis, I'd do it a whole lot more often. 

Ecstasy 

I've never felt horny when taking E. Like everyone else, I just want to hug, talk utter shit to complete strangers, tell them that I love them and then suck their faces. This time was going to be different: I had an agenda, I wasn't at a party, and I was getting paid to do it. Around three in the afternoon, I popped a pill. Erica and I drew a bath, climbed into the tub facing each other, and waited for me to get all touchy-feely.

Immediate physical reaction 

About twenty minutes into our soak, I started rolling really hard. I took a huge sigh, and it felt like my first breath. I've never started tripping in the tub before, and part of me ardently believes that, from a health-and-safety perspective, it's a wholly inadvisable thing to do. (Ecstasy tends to make your body temperature fluctuate wildly, and, well, there's the whole drowning thing to consider.) In truth, however, it felt great. So great, in fact, that I forgot about that whole time thing again. I spent the next two hours being more chatty and grindy than I ever have. The batch of E I bought must have had truth serum and a good amount of speed in it, because I spent much time spewing inner feelings Erica had not been a party to. Unfortunately, we had tickets for a play in Midtown and had to leave for the theater by seven. When I stopped yakking for a second and looked at the clock, I was horrified to see that we only had fifty minutes to complete the experiment.

Sensory/mental images 
As expected, I didn't really feel much like having sex and just wanted to hug. But being the consummate professional that I am, we dived on the bed and, with Erica watching the clock, started going at it. Or tried to. Even though the idea of sex on E was appealing, the simple act of putting skin on skin was more so.

Tactile effect 
I was having so much fun kissing Erica, I figured I'd smooch her down below too. While going down on her, I maneuvered her legs so they were propped over my shoulders and I could feel them running down the length of my back. My little soldier was somewhat out of the game although a little happier than when I was on the mushrooms. Forty minutes later, my wang was being wholly uncooperative. Even a helping hand wasn't actually . . . helping.

Assistant's reaction 
'Hurry up; we're going to be late. By the way, did I tell you it's actually a three-person musical and not really a play?' If you're going to take ecstasy, please have the werewithal not to come down in an overly air-conditioned repertory theatre watching three drama kids sing songs about popcorn at cranium-splitting pitches. It really sucks. That said, it's an effective antidote to feeling lovey-dovey. I came out of there feeling as mean as cat shit.

Cocaine 

I'd heard conflicting reports about sex on coke. Some of my friends who tried it ended up with wieners as stiff as a sock full of porridge. That said, I once read about this German guy who would snort coke to maintain an erection for long periods of time. He then decided to inject his penis with a cocaine solution that would give him an all-day erection. Three days later, his member turned purple, then black, then had to be amputated along with his testicles and all of his fingers and toes.

Other than that, I'd never really thought about what sex on cocaine could entail. I mean, I know what I'm like when I'm on coke: chatty and teeth grind-y. I guess I'd always thought that, in theory at least, doing a line off a girl's ass might be hot.

Immediate physical reaction 
Feeling a bit James Spaderesque, I chopped out a big line on Erica's tanned, flat stomach, rolled up a dollar bill and snorted away. I was immediately familiar with the drug's bitter taste and subsequent tingle. I did another line and was pleased not to notice the wilting effect that my friends had experienced.

Tactile effect 

I'd never really done anything remotely physical while on coke, aside from some light dancing and animated chatting with anyone who'd listen. (Incidentally, an ex once told me that she found a line or two handy while motivating herself to go to the gym.) After a little while, I became acutely aware that my heart was pounding fiercely. I did another line off the small of Erica's back and got behind her. I was stiffer than a roll of quarters, and I wanted to fuck hard. My heart pounded faster. I imagined news of my 'pulling an Entwhistle' being delivered to my editor, and his face ... oh, the horror! Hyper-awareness turned to fear. After a few minutes of imagining my heart exploding, I decided to let Erica get on top.

Sensory/mental images 
My eyes were as wide open as they would go. A mild tremor ran through my body. I felt the need to anchor myself to Erica. I gripped her waist as tightly as I could and dug my fingertips so far into her ass cheeks I'm surprised I didn't leave permanent indents. I felt kind of nasty, like some awful Wall Street archetype. I tried to push the image of Gordon Gekko out of my mind, to no avail. I barked orders, ground my teeth and spoke with my jaw clamped tight, sounding like Miss Hathaway from Beverly Hillbillies.

Assistant's reaction 
Envy and contempt. This was the drug Erica had the most reservations about. Of the potpourri of substances she'd done in the past, coke was her favorite. In fact, she had a little habit. Doing blow in front of her was like handcuffing Betty Ford to a case of Crown Royal.

Duration of sex 
About twenty minutes. With cardiac arrest imminent and Erica licking her lips ravenously, I decided to quit while I was ahead.

Comparison to drug use without sex 
When there are no strangers around to tell you how wonderful your shitty little life is, half of cocaine's appeal goes right out the window. Coke jibes well with me in a social setting, but shagging on it was alarming. I felt disgusted with myself and sorry for putting Erica through it. 

Conclusion 

On a purely visceral level, many of the sensations I experienced on these substances were amazing  some of them even made me oblivious to the presence of my girl. Sex on weed was really quite mind-expanding. By far, it was the best experience and the one I'd most like to try again. It was infinitely more intense than anything else, which came as a surprise, because it seems less demonized by the media and therefore more benign than coke or ecstasy. The only problem is that doing any drug has the potential to make sex a staged experience. (This is where Erica's ex-boyfriend had the advantage over me. He was a career stoner, so when they got down, chances were he was already baked.)

This experiment made me wonder just what the fuck I was doing all those years, while the other kids were smoking everything but their socks and popping E like Tylenol. At the grand age of twenty-six, I can't help feeling a bit suburban and long-in-the-tooth. My peers are either still using drugs occasionally, or else they got over junk the same summer they got over leather jackets with an eight-ball on the back.

Point being, drugs are something almost all of us have dabbled with, used or abused at some time. In the past, I've done drugs just for the sake of being on something, and that's been enough. But using five different substances to enhance a single activity produced the same result: a heightened sense of self-awareness. When you strip away your preconceptions of a drug is 'for' (i.e. weed for sex, Ecstasy for dancing), you realize that they way they affect our minds and bodies is, to a large extent, contextual. Ultimately, this experiment made me think of drugs not as a 'thrill,' a 'habit' or an 'addiction,' but as a condiment. Like applesauce with pork or, say, the Captain with Tennille, sex and drugs can be ideal companions, or simply a nightmare compounded.

I had the whole morning and afternoon to relax. I'm 18, going through my last year of school, and live with my parents... I'm writing today on saturday 3rd of November... these events took place yesterday, a Friday (no school this week). I live near London, UK.

In the morning I did a wake and bake sorta thing and knew that today I would try and push for more of a spiritual experience with cannabis and I thought that the best way to do that would be to dose higher. I had two packed bowls of nice skunk... let's just say I was pretty damn baked.

I went out into my garden, taking along with me my iPod and my bong as well as my stash and a lighter, finding a nice little tree stump near the back of my garden where I would not be seen from the house (the garden stretches back a good distance and curves round slightly) back here at this time of the year its mushroom kingdom. I'm not well versed enough in mycology yet to pick shroomies... even though there are many mushrooms I suspect to be cyanescens and semilanceata I'd rather not risk it.

Anyway back of the garden its mushroom kingdom, as I was getting more and more baked the mushrooms themselves started agitating me, I didn't want to be too close to any because I got very worried about toxic content and/or crushing them underfoot. About 15 minutes into my smoke I had retreated away from my tree stump to the edge of the garden and sat down under some pine trees, a few metres away from the stump.

It was a truly beautiful little place, and the lowering angle of the sun made it a truly picturesque landscape. The huge amount of shadow and light made for an interesting pictoral even without the inclusion of colour, and the colours added so much more. Damn it was vivid and beautiful thanks to the weed and I decided to continue where I had recently left off... listening to the Beatles.

I had listened to the first few tracks of 'Abbey Road' the other day, an album I had not fully explored yet, and decided to continue where I left off, having just finished 'Oh! Darling'. The opening guitar riff gave me great pleasure and I proceeded to sit there quite content listening to my music and smoking my cannabis. The lyrics bore a great resemblance to my current situation, a state of bliss and comfort in the shade being described... yup I'm there.

The drug certainly helped my enjoyment of the music so I pressed on. I remember once I got to 'Here comes the sun' I was really feeling pretty beautiful. Really good song to listen to while stoned, man it was perfect peace and love. 'Because' caused my understanding of the world to shake up a bit, and it placed me on a different place in the world. Things were slightly softer, quieter, duller and shinier in different aspects... moreover though I felt as though my current position was meaningless and my true reality was drifting through the world... the drug actually helped me feel as though I was floating.

I remember during the part where it's sung '1,2,3,4,5,6,7 all good children go to heaven' over and over again at the end of 'You never give me your money' I felt a thousand tiny spiders and bugs descend on me, as if to shoo me away, and I almost ran away from my place... suddenly though when the smooth tones of 'sun-king' came on I was reminded that I have nothing to fear from nature... nothing at all and I basked in that golden glow I felt from being there.

At points during the gibberish that is sung at points of 'sun-king' made me feel strongly as if the Beatles were playing some sort of sick joke. The fact that they were being silly out of the blue kind of annoyed me, as up to that point I was really enjoying it. Somehow though it really prepared me to get completely sucked in for the rest of the album.

Right until the drum solo of 'end' the music was no longer some external thing. It was my reality... I no longer felt connected with the real that we experience around us, I was simply swimming in a sea of pictures that my mind made with relation to the songs I was listening to. But the important thing is that it's not just limited to what I saw, it affected what I heard as well (as hard as it is to express) but more than how it affected my senses it affected my knowing... as if it wasn't really sensual stimulation at all... I was just being told by some cosmic force (the music) how things were.

I had a very important discovery while listening to 'Carry that weight' that I've now forgotten. I can laugh at an implication that silly now... but I know at the time the discovery felt very important to me... like the most important thing in the world. I'm optimistic I'll find my way there again.

Then as the Ringo Starr drum solo (as I found out later the first and only drum solo of Ringo's affiliation with the Beatles) near the start of 'End' played. It felt as if some mystical figure was actually hitting the sides of my brain to produce to the sound, and not a drum set... and I was being awoken from my trance back to reality... for there was something to be shown me in the real world. The chanting that goes with the guitar 'love you' over and over again in the first half of the song really shook me... there was something that loved me in nature.

It was here that I beheld shadows on the grass of my garden infront of me made the shape of what looked like a sort of pagan god figure... the legs seemed to form in the shape of the lower half of an 'A' letter... it was as if in perspective, the body seemed far away not small, and it was like at the end of the A figure was a body and head. It was a very simple drawing resembling a human done entirely with straight lines, manifest half in some random shadows on the grass resembling nothing, and half very vivid and meaningful and live in my brain thanks to cannabis.

The 'love you' chant made me suddenly connect with the beauty of nature, and I felt as if mother nature was looking over me, loving me, caring for me on this strange rock. This feeling was quite similar to what I had felt before. This feeling of love from mother nature... the whole surface of the planet earth being perfectly suited to looking after me thanks to evolution (and just the fact that where I'm standing, is like an incredibly rare spot of very low entropy in the universe, and that itself is remarkable in the massive void) and this was the warmth I felt. The fact that despite being pulled along unwillingly through the void by a massive rocky body... at least on the surface of that rocky thing was a world... a whole goddamn world just for me and my kind.

'In the end, the love you take, is equal to the love, you make' (what a line, I'll carry it with me forever)

Well anyway, after the end of 'End' came the long utter silence before the 20 second finale 'her majesty'. During the silence I looked back at the shadow, it was gone, I didn't see anything remarkable about it, in fact right next to me was where the shadow ended, the sun was in front of me not behind... the shadow was coming in from ahead, not coming out of where I was sitting (bear with me). Just as I made the connection to look towards the sun, and the breathtaking skyline... the hidden track 'her majesty' came on.

It made me realise that the whole experience was just one way of making sense of reality. What I hold important changes from day-to-day, what makes a difference to me is fleeting and in its own way desperate and the real important thing is just what I do with myself day-in day-out... how I act and what I say to people, who I meet and how I get my highs.

The whole experience lasted about 30 minutes.

Entheogen use is all about set and setting to me. Man that's so important... I can't say I've ever had a really bad trip... I've been spooked on drugs but I've never been emotionally discomforted to the point of what most people term a 'bad trip.' What I have done though is wasted a lot of weed especially on nothing trips, the sad thing is that if I don't get any good vibes or any bad vibes what I'll get is no vibes at all... which means I won't really trigger my feelings into any action... what a waste of tetrahydrocannibol... what a goddamn waste.

Music is my favourite art form while affected by cannabis. It's not hard to follow while high like cinema is... and its conveniant, and I suppose most importantly being high is like another option on the equaliser. In that listening to something while being high is completely different while sober (it can be better or worse), if there was a setting on the old EQ for emotional impact well you're just turning that right up to 11 and opening the flood gates. Ideas pour in and the music hits harder, we all know that already though right? If it's an album as remarkably well constructed as say 'Abbey Road' is then I think there will be a more pronounced sense of meaning to your trip.

If I listen to an album that's worth is greater than just the sum of its parts... or a symphony... or something a little longer than 3 minutes... for me it can increase the power that music has exponentially...

When I do drugs, I make the world around me meaningful, and my experience will be meaningful. If I was working towards a central message, and I wasn't, then that's it. I apologise for my crappy writing style, goodnight.

Peace and love

This was my first step into curiosity into bigger and better psychedelics. I had been invited to a guy named Ws house for a session, with a friend of mine N, and a few other guys, one of them being V. This report was scribbled on a paper the night of my experience when I was coming down ready for bed. Hopefully it explains well enough. Times are best estimate.

T+0:00  First hit  I started to laugh at almost anything, and felt comfortable around the older guys. I was very relaxed with everyone and almost unaware of the cold coming in the garage side door.

T+0:20  Second hit  My ears started to buzz and I felt incredibly relaxed, I had no worries. A bright purple grid work of dots spread across my vision, pulsating weirdly. I found it interesting and found my sense much more enhanced.

T+0:30  We went inside to the basement. I had some trouble walking in and my vision was swaying. The ringing in my ears continued along with the purple grid, I almost fell down the stairs on the way. We sat on the couch just laughing together and feeling good, waiting for V to arrive. At this point I would close my eyes and the colors in the dark would form simple geometric shapes and patterns.

T+0:40  V arrives, we go out for more. Hits 3-9  My world is now viewed in layers, seeming like a high graphics fluid video game. The background reaches out to me and grabs my interest, and I spend some time scanning it and watching different things grab my attention. My vision zooms into things, a strange feeling. A stone 10 feet away could take up my entire vision or be invisible at will. Very surreal feeling to everything, it feels very fluid. My thoughts come clearly and my mouth is dry. It is very difficult to stand  standing just doesnt feel important anymore there is so much to look at with a pleasant euphoria. I now am having average OEVs, zooming in to certain objects, and the CEVs become more intense, yet enjoyable. Quite awesome.

T+0:50  Went back inside. Walking is very surreal, as if it is not me walking. I can watch myself walk from above in the sky, floating a few feet above our heads when we are outdoors. I can barely speak anymore, my mouth is too amazingly dry and water doesnt hydrate it, too many amazing thoughts to give voice to. I sat down next to the couch in the basement, and started to just look around Every individual object was just that, an individual jumping out for attention. People lost importance. Average OEVs and High level CEVs. 

T+1:00  I started to close my eyes, to see colors speeding through every possible shape and complex pattern imaginable, and if I closed my eyes closed long enough I would feel such an extreme euphoria and an ecstatic feeling, both physical and emotional, would start to build so strongly until my vocal chords started buzzing and I wanted to scream in ecstasy, which would have weirded out the guys there, so I would open my eyes and see everything clearly, see what I truly felt about each object see its essence. I would look at someone or something and decide if it was Right, which was represented by a dazzling green arrow pointing upwards filling my visions, and Wrong, the opposite happening. At this point time loses all meaning. I am eternity. The guys realize Im tripping and start freaking out, telling me to stop it or they will tell C. This thought terrifies me and I huddle in a ball, but manage to force myself back to reality, fearing the consequences of disobeying. Reality is far away still but I manage to pretend. One guy is more experienced, but still a novice tripper, and tells them all to chill out and let me rest alone with N. N is there with me and the rest of them go out to smoke some more. They are all on their 4th or so hit, and all have a high tolerance. I go lie down on the couch and close my eyes, letting myself float away on the joy. I have lost the pure ecstasy of the colors but I feel so warm and comfortable, as if Im wrapped in a heated, vibrating wool blanket. There is no pain, which is rare for me I decide to think of heaven and am taken there White light and a golden kingdom in the clouds. I decided that I truly wanted a God to exist but couldnt believe it. I got up and decided standing was good, so I looked around when an antique model pirate ship jumped out at me I walked over to it and stood staring at it for some time, then closed my eyes. I was on the ship, on a dark stormy sea calling out orders. I could feel the rain, smell the sea, hear the howl of the wind, living lifetimes in a moment. I opened my eyes in shock and fear, so I turned around and sat in the center of the floor. N started waggling his fingers at me, which frightened me and made me look away. When I looked back up he faked throwing a football at me. I was terrified and went into a little huddle and nearly cried and would have screamed if I could. I got up and he threw the ball at me. I didnt even flinch, I just let it hit me in the arm and picked it back up, going through a radical change in thought. I stared at him, hating his very essence, baring my teeth and growling. I heard footsteps coming from the stairs and rushed back to my original seat trying very hard to act normal. They asked if I was alright and told me I had to go soon, and that it was.

4:40pm. I resisted the strong temptation to close my eyes and fly away.

T+1:20  Everyone was back in the room. I tried to talk and laugh and be normal but I couldnt. Too many thoughts to voice. I drifted in & out of reality, trying to stay, begging to leave. I forget all that happened for 20 minutes.

T+1:40  I had to leave. I decided to walk to Ns house, then back to mine, expecting the trip to come down enough so I could function around parents. 10 steps out the door and I am completely lost. Trees are scary yet interesting at night. My mental map seemed to be spinning, could not tell north from south. I feel an urge to chase cars but I hang onto N and start talking about how each object, living or non-living, deserves to be noticed and respected. I am still getting High level CEVs and OEVs, the world is swaying. Time loses meaning again. At some point N tells me just walk straight on the sidewalk and points me in the right direction (next to very busy street). I say OK and shuffle along. The lights from cars flare in my eyes and I try to hold a straight course walking. It is quite hard. I will glance in a direction and my feet follow 5 steps before I know what Im doing. This makes looking at the road dangerous so I keep my vision fixed forwards. Closing my eyes is fun & I just want to stop and sit on some ones lawn and let myself go. But I dont, and continue walking. I reach my old school and decide to go and sit down in the yard. I am enjoying myself now. I am at peace. My phone starts to buzz and I open it and my mother and best mate S have texted me. I decide to go to Ss house and text my mum to be ready to leave when I get home.

T+2:40  Still sitting in my old school, looking around in the dark (Normal OEVs and High level CEVs). I take off my coat and sweater and throw my sweater in the snow, walk away and take a piss, come back and shake off my sweater and put it in my backpack. Its freezing out, but I feel so warm and fuzzy. I put my coat back on and stand in a basketball court for a while, looking around at stuff. No memory of my thoughts at the time, but I decided to rehearse a phone call to my mum and finally phone her. I managed to stay quiet and eat a PB&J; sandwich on the way to Ss.

T+3:10   I have an average high feeling and am babbling when I talk

T+4:40  Its Dinner time. Taste was incredible, yet the pain in my arm from a magnified sense of touch without pain is starting to hurt incredibly. Pain is fully back now, and I was carrying a 60lbs bag in my hand for the better part of 2 hours with heightened feeling.

T+8:40  Went to bed, told S of my experience and wrote this report. Turned off the light and got some visuals. I watched rainbows flash until a comforting sleep took me.
Next day, felt amazing.

I guess I have a hyper-sensitivity to THC

Cannabis - Hash

I have been a regular reader of Erowid for a few years now and I think this is one of the most interesting/important websites on the net. There is some great material here under cannabis/hash , but I feel that hash should have a separate listing.

To start with let me say that I have smoked (a lot of!) weed on/off for three years now as well as having used most of the other substances available at a college campus. This summer though I came home to India for an internship and as the quality of weed on the streets here is pretty bad, I started buying hash regularly for the past three months. Not only is the quality very good, it is also ridiculously cheap (<$25 for 10 grams).

Everyone knows about smoking weed/hash obviously, as well as cooking with them, however not much has been said about simply eating hash.

The reason I am writing this experience is because I was completely taken aback by the effects of ingesting hash which I tried for the first time two months ago.

I was done with work for the week and I was waiting for a friend to pick me up from the office for a friday night out. It was 4:30pm and I was idly surfing the net when on an impulse I started chewing on the substantial ball of hash I was carrying in my pocket. Before I knew it I had reduced it to a pulp in my mouth and I swallowed it. It did not taste very good, but it was not unpalatable either.

For the next two hours I was fine and feeling a mild giddy high like from eating hash brownies. I was going around talking to my fellow workers normally and having a grand time making plans for the weekend.

At about 6:30pm it was time for me to meet my friend so I came back to my desk and started clearing up. All of a sudden it hit me! And I mean hit me hard! I have a good amount of experience with psychadelics and this was very much like tripping! If it were not for the crazy physical sensations I started having, I would have thought someone slipped me some shrooms or the like.

It seemed to me that people in the cubicles around me had started shouting, the  lighting was bright as hell and straight lines started warping a little. Along with it I started having some really weird muscular sensations (a little like muscle spasms). I sank back into my chair to clear my head, but found it quite hard to maintain a straight posture. My first thought was that the hash was contaminated with some other stuff as I never expected such a reaction from it. I also felt a mild trepidation which I get while first coming up on a psychedelic. However I figured it was just due to the large amount of hash I had eaten (3g - a little less than an eighth). I decided to go with this unexpected trip and make the most of it. I went to the restroom to be alone and sure enough my face bore the unmistakeable sign of someone who has left reality behind. My face seemed demonic (a usual for me when tripping), my eyes were red slits and I had a crazy grin on my face. And then I started laughing... uncontrollably! 

Gathering whatever wits I had left about me, I stumbled into my cublicle grabbing my stuff and hobbled out (normal physical movement was impossible at this point). I met up with my friend outside and immediately he knew something was up (although I was trying my hardest to appear normal on the streets). I got into his car and blurted out something about tripping. He did not believe me at first as he had been doing the hash with me for the last month or so and like me thought it incapable of producing such an effect. He took me to a coffeehouse where I felt I could relax for a while. However, that was a bad idea! All I remember was a huge chandelier and mirrors and this feeling that I was in a movie set. And then I stared at his face and started that manic laughter. It was then he knew that I was not lying. It was the job of a few minutes to convince him to join me (!) and we soon left that place.

The next few hours are a blur. It was an intense power high for me where things seemed to be happening at a breakneck speed. I have sketchy memories watching my friend eat the hash, me trying to listen to some music, sinking into his couch like there was an elephant on my chest, trying to make conversation with some other guys who showed up but finding it very hard to express what I felt. In short, it was very like a trip and nothing like a normal high. All the while I was wondering whether this was the THC in the hash or some other stuff I did not know about. The thing that stood out most was the physical sensations pulsating up and down my torso, which I find hard to explain.
A good 4 hours since the onset, my friend was also at my level by then and we were like two giddy schoolchildren alternately gigling for minutes and then confused and mystified by something that took our fancy.

By now all of our previous plans had to be scrapped. We decided to go for a movie (Hancock) of which my mind draws a complete blank. All I remember is trying very hard to stay in my seat (the pulsations made me squirm and sink lower) at the theatre and drinking about 2 tubs of Pepsi. At one point I got a little worried about the amount of liquid I was drinking although I continuously felt very dehydrated. 

Most of the evening is a haze, but I remember after the movie as I was slowly coming down, my friend who was still 'tripping' kept remarking over and over how 'industrial' the parking lot looked and wandering around like he was lost (infact we did get lost in the parking lot looking for the car!).

Now I have been VERY high of weed before, as well as tripped quite hard. The best way I can explain this is being inbetween the two. Another thing I want to add is that I got a lot of weird sensations in my  arms and legs and coordinated movements looked very clumsy. By around 1am I was no longer in that crazy state and felt okay enough to head home. By then I was exhausted like after a long workout. My muscles felt weak and I passed out immediately on lying down (Going to sleep earlier was quite impossible as every time I lay down and closed my eyes I got some really weird laser like visions and a sensation of accelaration).

All next day I was very spaced out and my limbs felt like they did not belong to me. Talking about the night before with my friend we realized how unexpected and crazy it had been for both of us (he too is no novice when it comes to psychedelics).
I have eaten it a few times since (although I take less than the first time - about 2-2.5g). I always get the high trippy feeling with a sense of great excitement every time I start coming up (it takes around two hours). And then its about 4-5 hours of a mindbending fun, whether you are alone or with somebody.

Few things to note:

Do not expect any great revelations about the world/space/time on hash. It does not tap into those outworldy sensations like LSD or shrooms. Its just a fun trip where you can feel speeded high for a good few hours with your reality getting a rough jolt.

Expect constipation the next day. I guess this stuff is not meant to be eaten raw and bowel movements are definitely constricted for a while! Always though, my body/mind is back to normal within 24 hours.

Do not drive on this stuff. Its nothing like a normal hash high and we have always had sober friends driving us. Infact the weird muscular sensations make controlling the limbs quite a hard task.

Set  Not perfect but Ive had worse. An hours sleep the night before makes me feel sleepy

Setting  My House, kids due in from school  busy household  Im used to it

T+0.00  Drink 3mgs of dissolved drug

T+ 0.10 Faint perceptual changes, continue reading my book.

T+ 0.20 Give up on reading as I cant follow the narrative, watch my dogs play fighting, grab a quilt & lie underneath it on the settee, start to feel warm yet shivery, this is a fairly standard physical effect I get from a 2Cxx.

T+0.50 Feels warm & relaxed, introspective  then again Im alone with two dogs for company so intellectual discourse is out of the question.

T+ 0.55 My wife rings to see if Im dead or ill from ingesting the drug. I toy with the idea of not answering the phone  however I do my duty and confirm that Im alive.

T+01.10 I make a ham, mayo & pease pudding sandwich then eat it  delicious  so much so I make another. I have a noticeable tingling up my spine & the nape of my neck. This is feeling quite luxurious now. No visual effect to speak of it just feels good. I consider redosing; I consider for about 5 seconds then decide.

T+01.25 - Take another dose of 3.5 mgs in orange juice.

T+ 01.50  My kids come in from school  I orient my mind & begin giving standard instructions such as uniform in the wash  take the dogs out  put your bait box in the sink for washing  do any homework you have. My vision is becoming noticeably blurred as the second dose kicks in. Brief CEVs of women  very realistic - like flash frames.

Im still perfectly able to carry on conversations so long as I feign tiredness when a I feel theres a slight lag in mental processing before I respond.

I find myself in a dreamlike state & retire upstairs to have a bath  the timekeeping breaks down from this point as I got into what I was doing which was more interesting than writing stuff down..

Theres a definite aphrodisiac quality to the drug  not in the same league as 2CE but definitely present. I coax my wife upstairs & we spend a while in bed. Orgasms achieved x2  who knows if there wasnt other activities going on (kids in & out of the house dogs barking etc) how that might play out.

My wife tells me there is marked pupil dilation.

At one point I get a feeling of anxiety  it lasts seconds & is dispelled by a unique sense of wellbeing that seems to emanate from the ether  like a superpowers pick me up.

I begin to drift, my mind wanders, there are inferences of mind movie type visuals which dont quite materialise, hopefully some of you will understand this interim state.

I find myself a little more clumsy than usual, dropping a couple of things getting entangled in my clothes as I get dressed to go out.

We set off into the foggy night  my wife driving  myself sitting with my eyes closed  just concentrating on feeling calm  which works rather well.

I think Ive probably overshot the mark for going out maybe 4mgs would have been better suited as my concentration on external things is difficult to maintain.
Anyway we watch the band.

T+ 7.45 I suddenly come to life the internalising seems to vanish quite quickly & I find Im up dancing & having a great time & the show ends too soon for my liking.
I find Im fired up in a low key way (I have a tendency to get very fired up & overly positive at times) & I talk most of the way home & chat with three of my kids when we get in, I find myself play fighting with my youngest son.

T+8.45 Eat donner kebabs  they taste foul but so moreish  I imagine that cannibalism has a similar effect  you take a bite & think yeuch yet are compelled by some strange force ( AKA greed) to eat more.

T+ 9.45  The children are despatched to bed, my older son leaves & goes to his house & we eat a couple of diazepam, some codeine & smoke some dope  which puts my on my back in short order.

T+ God knows when  I fell asleep

Overall a very positive feeling from the drug, at some points I felt lovely/ laid back blissful, there was some mild confusion at times, though this could have been due to sleepiness & the fact I tend to get confused anyway. I enjoyed it. I shall sample it again in a single higher dose next time and hopefully in a better mindset.

There were numerous reasons I decided to start when I did. Halfway through university, living with one other person, I had been exposed to a perspective of cannabis use that was thoughtful and conscientious. I knew it had influenced musicians, comedians, authors, and philosophers who I admired, and knew that the evils attempted to be pinned on it were bunk. I was interested in the potentials of consciousness, and eager to see how cannabis altered it. I was curious as to whether I would find it useful on my quest for personal growth. So, I acquired a small personal stash and waited for the right time. 

Before the experience, I was in a relaxed and prepared state of mind. I had spent a lot of time before reading other experiences, so I was not anxious about using. I had been browsing through psychedelic literature for months before I decided to start experimenting myself, with cannabis as a first step. I also had several hours alone that evening to get my thoughts together.

It was a warm September night when I rolled a clumsy joint and stepped out onto my balcony, which was in a quiet part of the city, overlooking a grassy, brush-strewn hill. Overhead the moon was bright and full among the stars. My flame leapt from my lighter and over the couple minutes, I drew several hefty hauls off my joint. I put the remainder away inside, and while moving through the house, felt the first of the effects. I started to become more aware of my movements and environment, but just as noticeably, time began to skew. I began to feel as though every few moments, I was in a new frame of time, and what happened before what I was immediately doing, had happened long ago. This was a little confounding, even while subtle at first, and I began to feel as though I wanted to stop moving around so much and settle into an environment. I grabbed my mp3 player, a drink, and returned to the balcony.

I sat on the wooden slats and just listened to the sounds of night, feeling an intensity of focus, but further dilation of time. I noticed my thoughts becoming louder, more linear, and following causal links that might have been too subtle for me to notice sober. I began to feel as though whenever I moved my head, or eyes, and took in a new visual field to accompany my thoughts, I was completely reorienting myself. At this point I decided to lie down and turn on some music, satisfied that I had smoked enough, and it was about to come over me. The music was powerful, but faded into the background, coloring my mood but not taking up the foreground of my experience. What struck me was the sky, and specifically, the silver moon bright overhead. I watched it, and my thoughts started racing. Staring up at the moon with rhythmic drums in my ears, my mind began to navigate metaphors, analogies, and various truths about nature that seemed all the more visceral.

However, I began to get frustrated, as every several seconds, I would move into a new frame of time, and my previous thoughts would drift away from my fingertips. I knew that I was experiencing a vivid stream of concepts, but couldnt grasp onto them, and it was irritating. I felt as though my mind was moving over the rungs of a ladder, or moving up steps, and every couple seconds, I would move to a different step, and the contents of the previous would fade away. This was when I noticed another effect of cannabis: it thrust me closer to the foundry of my imagination. Visuals I imagined were more real  more immediately experienced  than the distance placed between them and a straight mind. They werent hallucinated, but rather, they felt more easily envisioned in my mind. Staring at the sky, with music flowing through me, I envisioned a stepped structure of thought, and every time I felt my thoughts shift, I envisioned the steps rotating to bring a fresh surface to the tablet of my mind. The longer I observed this structure, and felt thoughts rotate through my head without being able to grasp them afterwards, I recognized the similarities between them and the other evanescent qualities of nature, of human life, and the raw miracle of pure experience. 

I suddenly felt relaxed, and content to just watch my thoughts pass by like a stream. This went on for around an hour, though it is difficult to say, while moments could seem like they lasted forever, I would easily lose track of how much time had passed beyond my immediate focus. I started to wonder about the purpose of all this experience. Staring up at the moon, I started to think about how the flow of ideas  the flow of everyones ideas  every conscious thought and experience  calls us upwards, and tugs at something abstract and incorporeal from the physical body. It is the engine that propels our concepts, culture, and constant drive towards liberalization: to unleash the consciousness and imagination into an ecstatic realm of play. At the time, this was mostly just feeling that I would tease apart later. I had a beautiful image of every sleeping creature on earth, and all human remains buried beneath it, blooming a phosphorescent, indigo worm, which crept up from their bodies and towards the sky  towards the moon -- in rhythm with the music surging between my ears. I felt as though alone, watching quietly over the silhouetted trees and houses, I had caught the cosmos in the midst of its secret rite. Shortly after, I felt myself coming down, as there was more continuity between frames of time. I moved inside and in front of my computer, where I listened to more music and watched some stunning visualizations, until felt my thoughts were hushed enough to sleep.

The next day, I felt very relaxed, and had slept in well. I recalled what I could of the previous night, and was a little astounded. I hadnt expected such a glowing experience from half a joint of cannabis. It didn't seem like the experience was something forced by the cannabis, but rather, something it facilitated. Experiences afterwards would vary as they became more numerous, but for a first real experience, I was more than content. Deciding the image of the phosphorescent worms was the gem Id bring back from the experience, I penned a two line poem describing it, which has turned out to be one of my favorite verses in my notebook.

About Me: 
I am fifteen years old and am enrolled in lots of overachiever high school classes and so on and so on.  Nevertheless, I am decidedly lazy and inconsistent, maybe pulling an A plus in one unit and perhaps failing the next.  Last year I went through a minor depression during which I was slightly paranoid about others motives.  I have been on a low dose of floexetine (Prozac) for about a half year, and have since have returned back to normal.  I have no other known afflictions and am on no other medications.

Experience: 
Over the course of the past few months, I have become increasingly interested in psychoactives.  However, I would describe myself as very inexperienced in this field.  Prior to the following experience, I had only experimented with smoking marijuana and consuming alcohol.

About this report: 
Yes I know, I know: there are plenty of reports already on Erowid about cannabis.  By George, Erowid needs more information about rare psychoactives or potent mixes, not a random girls account of smoking lots and lots of weed and tripping out!  However, after having culled through a few hundred experience reports, Ive not yet read many that have described a psychedelic experience the way a complete newbie would experience it.  Sure, plenty have depicted in great detail going to the neighborhood park and feeling weird and walking around and seeing things weird and feeling stoned and weird weird weird.  But few have really emphasized how alien, how inexplicably terrifying, how divine and shining, how clear and how blurry and how beyondjust beyond, is even the most minor psychedelic experience.  Perhaps I am merely aggrandizing my own experiences; however, I have a hunch that others have felt similar things regarding the sheer grandeur of psychedelia.  I understand that many people do not trip out from smoking marijuana by itself, but I myself have cracked open the door to the crazy, wonderful world of psychedelia from doing so.  I wrote the following account while coming down from the highthus, its very possible that I bartered some sophistication in diction for, I hope, a more accurate portrayal of events.


The Meat of the Report:
A few hours ago, my friend (whom, for the sake of anonymity, Ill call Catalano) asked me if I wanted to come over and smoke with him a girl named Rayanne (yep, another pseudonym).  I decided to go, since I was bored.  She was excited to teach her methods of efficient smoking to me, the newbie, and she told me that I could be a part of their circle of friends.  I politely mumbled that I couldnt be a full time druggie, and she assured me that in no time Id be snorting coke.  So I decided to leave it at that.  
After a few bowls, she was convinced that I wasnt inhaling enough smoke.  So she told me to smoke another bowl.  

Trust me Catalano, this girls gonna be really high soon, she said.  I was upset that I wasnt feeling the effects; not because I deeply desired to get high at the time, but because I wanted Rayanne to be proud of me or something (I know, I know: stupid of me).  I lay down on Catalanos bed in mild disappointment, which is the bottom of a bunk bed, and waited for the effects.  All of a sudden, the ceiling, or rather the top bunk, which was a couple feet overhead, slightly turned into a nebulous stone path and quickly turned back.  I brushed it off as placebo effect.  Then, I narrowed my eyes a bit and became enthralled with my eyelashes.  They had little rainbows from the mixture of natural moisture and the light bulb shining on me.  Of course, eyelashes always look like this.  But all of a sudden, they sparked a childlike wonder in me and I watched as they swayed in beat with the music.  Okay, I thought, so my eyelashes have become kind of cool.  So what?

Then I sat up and opened my eyes fully.  I dont know whether I sat up and down multiple times or if it was just in my mind, but whatever it was freaked me out.  Before I knew it, I had entered a vast, dusty other universe in which I was being woken up by a sort of mother aura from downstairs in a motion picture over and over and over.  My thoughts were becoming cyclical and I thought I was stuck in this moment in eternity.  The effects of the drug hit me far faster than I could realize what was even happening.  

Luckily I broke free from the sitting up and downbut then I really started to tweak out.  I ran halfway downstairs in swirling panic, my head buzzing with warmth, in disbelief that this other universe is what people call high.  I had the strange sensation of being *completely inside my head*, aware of my surroundings in a panoramic view; it felt too wide, too open.  This shocked me, since it was the total opposite of a blurry, drunken head buzz.  I heard Rayanne ask Catalano if I was mentally unstablethis made me freak out exponentially more, as I realized that my reaction was abnormal.  I caught the word tripping in their conversation a few times.  So I was tripping!  Now I was thrown into a confused, swirling state.  You know when youre asleep and realize that you are in a dream, and inexplicably get really bored and restless and have to pry your eyes open?  This was like that, but scary and real and I was already awake so I couldnt open my eyes any wider and my heart was beating out of my chest and I thought I was in some sort of Hell.  When was I born into this eerily clear new world?  

Still on the staircase, Rayanne came out of Catalanos room and asked me if I had any underlying mental disorders.  I stuttered a Nouh II dont t-think so; as one can imagine, this didnt really calm my nerves.  I stumbled back into Catalanos room and realized that I was in a movie like Matilda.  My head was spinning and it looked like I was on a movie set.  I kept switching in and out of different scenes and mindsets and worlds.  Every few seconds I would zero in on Catalanos face and exclaim Whoa, then whoosh off into my adventure again.  I was still coming up and was terrified on a higher level of fear than possibly ever before.  Whoa. 

This state was so different from any I had been in before that I wondered how (or even if) I could return back to everyday living and perception.  I was wholly overwhelmed by my sudden transformation into this other-dimensional being in a heightened, other-dimensional world.  I decided that I was definitely not living in the same world/life that I had been for as long as I could remember.  My foundation had been shaken; everything that had been constant throughout my life was suddenly adrift except for my steady, subtle unconscious.

My panic-inducing cyclical thoughts, I decided, could only be combated by me constantly talking.  I spoke in a loud voice, but every time I began to speak, my words sounded corny, like I was in a movie and my words were going along with the music.  This scared the hell out of me.  It sounded like someone had written a rather cloying score of music to perfectly coincide with my voice.  I feared that Catalano and Rayanne would find me ridiculously corny, so I stopped talking, then realized that I had to talk to keep time going (or else Id get stuck in an infinite loop of time).  I went on and off like this until I had Catalano turn the music off.  Now, to keep the rhythm going and crawl out of the hole of eternity, I decided that Catalano and I had to communicate through typing on Microsoft word.  All the while I was shaking madly and swearing uncontrollably, all of my thoughts and sentences strung together with fucking and shit.  In the back of my mind I knew that my state was silly and that Catalano and Rayanne were probably weirded out or amused.  They, in contrast to me, were feeling lazily stoned.  

My thoughts were still scary and circular, and I was still tweaking out, but heres where I started to have some fun.  Taking a cue from his red bedroom walls and contemporary music, I realized that I was in a Target commercial.  Everything was sterile and overly bright for a minute, just like in Target stores only amplified (and in another dimension).  I imagined that the objects in his room were random products being creatively stacked up to an upbeat soundtrack like in the advertisements.  Still very frightened, I sat back down on his bed and talked to Rayanne and him.  I think Im in a dream, but then I know I cant be because my memories are more tangible than in dreams, I pondered aloud to them, my thoughts coming out in shaky, fragmented speech.  There was a pause and Rayanne filled it with Are you really smart or something when you arent fucked up?  I couldnt really think of an answer so I just mumbled.  I laughed at myself-- why do I even care what they think if Im in a dream?  Then I realized that I wasnt in a dream.  But how do I know?  When Im dreaming, I am totally convinced of my scenario until I wake up and realize how absurd it was.  So what made me so cocky and sure that this wasnt another of those circumstances?  I mulled over that for a while and closed my eyes.  Unfortunately, I had no closed eye visuals.

I decided to stand up next, and what I perceived amazed me.  Actually, it wasnt exactly *what* I perceived.  Same room, same people.  It was *how* I perceived.  It felt like I had unlocked this godly third eye or other sense or something, that made everything glow and space and time seem so much deeper and thicker and richer.  Silly as it sounds, it felt like I had been living in the second dimension my whole life, then suddenly stepped out into the real third dimension.  I had gone through my entire youth thinking I was living in a 3D world when I had truly just been a cartoon!  The song Dear Prudence by The Beatles was playing and it melded with my thoughts to create a divine moment of realizations and beauty.  My surroundings looked ever so deep.  

I then lay down on the floor and stared up at the light bulb.  It was amazing and it became a lovely, godly sun.  I looked up at the ceiling and saw a purple candle and suddenly I was in a birds eye view of an intricate, wooden, homey smelling cabin.  I was quickly transported back to where I lay.  Now, I three-quarters-closed my eyes and peered at my eyelashes.  The light from the light bulb streamed through them and I felt wonderful and profound, like I was in a colorful fortress of eyelashes filled with deep glee.  So this is how the gods feel, perched atop their fluffy pedestals sniggering at the triviality of human triumph and suffering.  How beautiful, how glorious it felt to be admitted to this heaven of sorts.  

As I lay there on the ground, I looked up at Rayanne and Catalano, who were sitting across from each other.  They were suddenly in a diner in one of those predictable, beige romantic comedies starring Kate Hudson or someone, except the camera angle was rather avant-garde, since I was lying on the ground peering upwards (yet, strangely, I also felt like I had sort of an aerial view).  Catalano was the long-haired dude and Rayanne was the edgy chick that works in the library, and they were on a date.  I realized that I had been saying all this out loud when Rayanne said, Uh I dont work in a library..wow this girl must be really high.  But I didnt care.  So here they were in this diner with ketchup and mustard and shit and chatting away.  I got a little frustrated at one point and asked, If Im God, then why is this such a low budget film, huh?  Then I became someone viewing the movie, and Catalano and Rayanne looked through the screen at me.  That was peculiar; since when do people in movies look at the viewer?

I lay down in quiet contemplation for a few minutes.  Although I was in a small room, the world appeared to shimmer above my head in infinite, radiating layers.  Ive just entered the third dimension, I said to nobody in particular.  Even though I was aware of how stupid it sounded, I meant every word of that statement.  Catalano grinned and said playfully, From where?  The second dimension?  I said yes, thats exactly where I just came from, to which he replied, We already are in the third dimension.  Ah, did that get a rise out of me.  I started laughing and fell into a pool of laughs and was on the ground curled up from laughing.  I stopped, looked at Catalano, and proceeded to break out in giggles again.  

By now he was starting to get a bit weary though, since he had essays to write.  He was trying to nudge Rayanne and me out but decided to let us stay until I was ready to leave, since I was still tripping out.  I had little perception of time though, so I dont know how long we stayed.  I turned to Catalano and asked him if he was mad at me for tripping on weed.  He smiled and said, Im furious.  We looked at each other and I was laughing like mad.  Rayanne and I decided to let him do his essays, so she dropped me off at home.  I stumbled inside and ran upstairs so as not to get caught by my mom.  Once there, I stared in awe at the little rainbows on a cd-rom.  Were those always there?

All in all, this trip was extremely worthwhile.  Thats a complete understatement: its the first time Ive felt truly, fully alive, although I sometimes have a bad inkling in the back of my head that I just use marijuana to *trick* my mind and I wonder does that matter?  What is tricking; and is that sort of subjective experience any less real than generally accepted reality?  Alas, I am getting a bit ahead of myself.  At first, I was caught up in panic, but I attribute that to my confusion.  I plan on continuing recreational drug use and branching out to other psychedelic substances that will unlock other barriers to the dusty corners of my mind.    

Further: 
After re-reading my account, I fear that I may have written a report akin to the ones I previously said have left me dissatisfied: a mere narrative lacking insight into the nature of the drugs subjective effects.  Ive decided to add some other things Ive written about or while high on marijuana, to reinforce my description of this heightened other dimension.

Heres another small report I wrote on this subject while **very high** a month later.  I resisted glossing it over with my smug, sober editing to perhaps give more insight into the way marijuana acts on my brain:

They say marijuana reduces concentration.  This makes me smirk in contempt because even though, yes, it can cause one to not be able to focus on the two-dimensional shit of our everyday lives?  Sure weed makes me lose focus on that shit, but only because Ive moved on to another world in which all things that seemed important now are trivial in the context of this vast other universe (universe isnt even big enough a word.  Dimension, if that werent so overused..ahh) So Im in another dimension.  Thats why I cant focus on stuff from the lower place.  Because Ive been temporarily raised to the view of god.  This makes me very vulnerable. I feel vulnerable (fearing fear itself a lot) when I smoke weed.  But thats just because Ive stripped away myself and zipped into, it seems, a large tent in another dimension.  This is rather unfamiliar and scary each time it happens.  But wow, these words are really two-dimensional.  Or, in my state, one-dimensional.  Its difficult to describe normal life in words.  This is in another dimensional shit.

I sound like such an idiot right now.  I think, in this temporary moment, Im trading my (hopefully) eloquent style of writing for a ticket into another place.  No, not Switzerland or Canada or Wyoming.  Those are flat trips.  This time Im vacationing in a 3d world.  I was a circle, but I was rotated around in directions I didnt know existed I became a sphere.  A circle cannot conceive of a sphere while it is a circle still.  But alas!  I can conceive of this being that Ive become, this world.  Ive been a piece of paper and suddenly lifted up into the air.  What is this air?  Except this feelingits familiar in a way.  Its like, the way things are supposed to be.  This is another spiritual level (god do I sound corny but I must go on).  Not different levels like in a staircase or building.  

When I smoke I get the shakes, as in I weirdly twitch.  This really freaked me out as I walked upstairs.  I couldve sworn I was a robot version of myself coming to kill the real me.  My shaking fragmented my steps and my movements were jerky and..well, robotic.  I felt like I was a robot implanted with sufficient human wit and compassion.  I was heartbroken that I had been given this empathy and yet was programmed to kill the person my thoughts were modeled on.  This stuff will sound funny when I read this sober, but it is really terrifying.

Ok I know Im rambling.  One last thought: wow.  Cant remember.  Oh yeah, SHIT I forgot again.  (Im not erasing all these random thoughts because..idk why- wait that doesnt make sense) oh yeah okay so, although it is terrifying, it something vital to spiritual vitality.  Another dimension!  Words, English, feel petty to me.  Ha, to think that these mere flourishes on paper could describe an experience like this?  Words feel silly and flat.  Incompatible with life.  Incompatible.  My thoughts are full and round and by recording only one little road of thought while others swirl and dip, mostly dead ends, around it in my brain.  These side roads are in directions and dimensions that the main road, these words, cannot conceive of.  I find it interesting the tradeoffs of smoking weed.  I become less coherent but at the same time, more lucid and more in the real world.  Realer than real.  My thoughts dont flow, they dont connect.  An eraser is chasing every thought that crosses my mind.  Im beating it.  But boy, those are some delicious words.  You could fucking eat them.  So yeah, for now the tradeoff is worth it.

Everyone knows you only live a day, but its brilliant anyway. Elliott Smith.
Just heard that lyric, and felt it so deep.  Some days you can sharpen the dull lead of your daily life with some good ol drugs.   

Version of this written while sober:
Many opponents of recreational marijuana use are quick to point out that it reduces concentration and coherence.  What those opponents do not acknowledge, however, is *why* marijuana appears to reduce concentration.  It is not because users become stupid, intoxicated, or lazy.  Rather, users are lifted out of ordinary life and transported into a much more meaningful world.  It resembles everyday reality but is much more malleable, frightening, and euphoric.  Everything is amplified and nothing is certain.  In everyday life, time goes by at more or less a constant rate.  Events and speech are linear and you are where you physically are and will not leave until you physically leave.  On marijuana (although Ive been told that many people need stronger psychedelics to experience such trippy things), seconds can seem to last for hours or milliseconds.  The same moment can happen hundreds of times in a seemingly infinite circuit.  Speech can be circular or spiraled instead of linear.  One can be transported elsewhere while physically in the same spot.

In this fantastic other world, it seems (and perhaps is) pointless and laughable to try and focus ones attention on the inferior, one-sided everyday shit.  It doesnt feel real enough.  Its like being placed on another planet filled with aliens and wonder, and being expected to focus ones attention on an episode of Star Trek playing on a small portable T.V. screen.  Right now I am fully engrossed in that dull screen we call reality.  But come the weekend, I may buy myself a ticket into the magical, terrifying world that Ive come to love, fear, and revere.

And, lastly, I have typed up some interesting (albeit perhaps useless) scrawlings I have written while **very high** another time.

Being tumbled around in waves, they roll, warm around me.  In beginning I get caught up in the wave, spin around in vertigo.  Then if I hold back the vertigo, waves will come back and knock my body back and forth jerkily.  Im shaking.  

I just became Beethoven writing with a feather in a foreign, artsy film with saturated colors.

I cant think straight but words splurt from my mind in florid, goopy, pretentious shit.  I am a pitcher in a  Vermeer painting, pouring out words instead of water.  But the words are like water in that they can flow and splash thirstily.  Can water be thirsty?

My third eye is triangular.  Its fucking blinking.  And crying.  Someone in a comic book- (lightening! In my mind) Ah forgot everything I was saying.  Wow this is an amazing state.  Fuck the law.  Fuck teachers.  Fuck parents.  Fuck fucking.  God damnit, writing everything, even melodramatic retarded things, is fun.


Conclusion: 
To tie this messy conglomeration of psychedelic ramblings up, I hope this was helpful to anyone searching for a decent description of how ones first psychedelic ordeal may feel.  Although I cannot claim to have fully illustrated a psychedelic experience in any way, I hope to at least have provided a vague outline.  Those reading this may argue that marijuana does just make users lazy and stoned, that I am exaggerating its psychedelic effects.  All I can say to those people is that they may be right; I claim not to have written of the average encounter with marijuana but solely of my own, personal experiences.

I have smoked marijuana many times since, although the effects are becoming far less trippy. I plan on trying Psilocibine mushrooms sometime in the near future (maybe in a few weeks).  I am open to the *use* of most psychoactives; however, I do not advocate the *abuse* of any substance, only the responsible use.  The abuse of drugs, I believe, leads to the condemnation of the drugs themselves, rather than what should be the condemnation of a specific inappropriate person-substance relationship.  I am well aware that I have plenty to explore, and that I have merely opened the door to psychedelic journey, not quite embarked yet.  I am only a sophomore in high school; no doubt I have a large amount of wisdom and humility to gain.  If all goes as planned, I will continue to chronicle my journeys with substances and submit them.  Perhaps I will create a blog.  And with this, I must be off; so end these first scribblings of this infant phsychonaut.

Cannabis (1) : Retrospective / Summary (11), General (1), Small Group (2-9) (17)




 




DOSE:
1 bowl
smoked
Cannabis
(plant material)





BODY WEIGHT:
180 lb





It was an idle Tuesday night sometime in September and a few friends and I decided to celebrate our friend Sean's birthday. Nothing too extreme, we spent a few hours at a local hooka club just smoking flavored tobacco and getting a light buzz then moved the party to my roommate and I's apartment where we drank a minimal amount of alcohol. We packed a glass bowl of weed and between about 5 people passed it while playing video games. I was lightly buzzed by the time the place started to clear out. The plan at this point was to get our friend Sean extremely wasted as our gift to him, but he dipped out on us leaving only my roommate, Hughie, and I with a lot of weed to smoke.

A few weeks prior to this night, Hughie had made a 'gravity' bong out of a large glass bottle which he was anxious to show off to Sean. Excuse me for the quotations on 'gravity', but I've been smoking pot since I was 12 years old (I'm 20 now) and until Hughie moved in I had never experienced a homemade smoking apparatus. 

I had smoked a few times at this point out of his creation and had found it to be superior to a bowl, joint, blunt or any other way of smoking because it got one high extremely quick. The downfall is that even though one is taking less hits one was ultimately smoking more weed in one pack and would therefore stay higher longer. I had remained lightly stoned for up to 2 days when smoking from the gravity bong with Hughie previous to this night, but nothing would compare to what I was about to encounter.

As Hughie went to pack the small glass bowl a second time I shook my head at him. 'I want to forget who I am tonight.' I said jokingly. I pointed towards his room where I knew the gravity bong was located. Without hesitation he opened his door and began to prepare the bong. His warning didn't come until he had begun to take his lighter from his pocket, but it was stern. 'I'm telling you... you've never been this high, and you will never be this high again.' he said. I laughed as I began to hunch over the top of the glass bottle. 'I've been smoking pot for a long time, and I've smoked from this thing before, I'm sure I can handle it.' I retorted. He shook his head at me, but lit the pack and smiled. 'I warned you.' he said.

Seconds later I was coughing so hard I was convinced my lungs were going to fall from my mouth any second. I could hardly catch my breath. I was desperate for anything to drink. Hughie handed me what I think was the bottom of a soap dispenser he wasn't using filled with tap water which I eagerly accepted. As I hacked Hughie spoke. 'This isn't the same weed we've been smoking all night. I'm just letting you know. I haven't tried this yet myself, but he said it was good quality.'

That was the last thing I heard coherently. Everything got instantly cut off after that statement. I was now sitting on Hughie's bed. I'm sure I was smiling for a little while. I found myself grabbing a nearby pillow. I smashed my face against it and felt as if my entire head went through it. In my head I thought it was a marshmallow, or at least the texture of one. I balled up involuntarily on the bed and right away I knew, I was about to go to a place I had never been before.

Hughie is a DJ. He automatically went to his turn tables and begun spinning. The music volumes went up and down and I could see the music in my head as the beats and melodies changed, but I wanted to tell him to shut it off, it was far too intense for my mind to process. At this point I realized something was wrong. I had never been this far gone before. I had never in my life been THIS stoned. I had to tell Hughie something was wrong, but I couldn't find the strength to move. 

It seemed like hours passed. My head was flying to places I didn't know existed. The pillow slid off my face. The room was now dark and purple. Hughie had turned his backlight on. The effects of the ultraviolet light and the music being constantly changed made me feel ill, but I still could not form the words or find the volume within myself to tell my roommate how awful was feeling. This is when he noticed. He asked if I was okay with a smile on his face. I must have looked somewhere beyond dazed. I could hardly keep my eyes open at this point. All I could do is look in his direction and say 'No.'

'No?' he asked surprised. 'What's wrong?' I wanted to tell him exactly what I was feeling, but I couldn't maintain a thought in my head and the ability to speak seemed so far off, something I would have to use all my energy to summon from within myself. I breathed in deeply.

'I'm going to try to form a sentence... so listen.' I said firmly. He laughed. I was not trying to be funny, but looking back I'm sure that sounded hilarious. 'I have been getting high a long time... and I know... this is just not right.' Then there's a flash. I mean it's like I'm trying to explain a movie I saw, but it's as if I viewed it with sections of the film missing because I know there was a time lapse, but I have no idea what happened during that time.

Flash. 

Now I'm in our living room. I'm huddled on the couch telling Hughie I'm going to puke. I feel beyond nauseous. If I move an inch or open my eyes I fear I will never stop vomiting. Hughie turns on the television. The sound and light hurt my eyes and ears. My senses have become so heightened it hurts. I must have been squinting because he asks me if he should turn it off. I don't remember nodding, but I hear the buzz of a television clicking off.

Another flash. Time lapse. I'm now in the kitchen hunched over our metal sink. Hughie has apparently brought me here because I know I didn't walk. I can't even tell if I'm standing. I can feel every muscle and vein in my body, but cannot feel my the weight of my body on top of my legs. My only assumption at the time is that I am floating at this sink, but truly, I am standing. 

My hair is falling into my face and Hughie is asking me if I still need to puke. I moan and begin to cry. I cannot stop myself. I am thinking horrible things now. I am going to die. I cannot form any sort of words to tell him what I am feeling so I cry and moan like an infant. I am breathing heavily at this point and can feel my heart beating through my chest faster than I have ever felt my own or anyone else's heart beat. My breath pushes against the interior of the metal sink and reflects back on my face. I can feel it as if my own hot breath has become ice cold against the metal instantly, but it's not refreshing. I still cannot vomit.

Flash. Another time lapse.

I'm back on the couch. I can feel everything now. So much that it hurts. I can sense the temperature of ever piece of air that I breathe as I inhale and exhale through my mouth, but the feeling is still not pleasant. Hughie is trying to talk to me. He has realized now that I am somewhere else. He keeps asking me who I am, and half the time I can answer, less than that I get the answer right. I haven't opened my eyes since I found myself back on the living room couch, but I know where I am. Occasionally waves hit me so quickly I feel like I'm on a roller coaster and all I can do is hold on to the couch and scream. When they stop I cry and moan.

Hughie has grabbed my hand. I wonder if he's as afraid as I am that I am going to die. He stroking it and telling me to stay with him. He's telling me that I am fine. That everything is going to be okay, and even though I am off in some far away place in my head I know he is lying to make me calm down. I'm tapping my heartbeat out with my finger tips on Hughie's hand. This makes him laugh. He recites a story about his brother and how he does the same thing when he's really stoned. I can't control the action, it's involuntary. I can feel myself starting to come back to reality as Hughie continues to talk. He is still holding my hand and as I begin to giggle at his story my heartbeat gets faster and I continue to tap it out on his hand.

Flash. Time lapse.

Hughie tell me to go to sleep. He says I'm going to be just fine. I'm still riding that roller coaster, but my nausea has begun to subside and I am now aware of where I am, who I am, and almost exactly what is happening. But I continue to slip in and out. From time to time I moan and scream and can't breathe. Sweat is dripping down my forehead and down my spine. I start to become concerned when I realize I cannot control the fact that I have to urinate and nearly pee my pants several times. I continuously have to contract my muscles in order to not urinate or lose control of my bowels on the couch. I want to muster up the energy to walk to the bathroom, but I even though I am having delusions about making it there I know I will never gain the strength or will, so I continue to contract my muscles and lay balled on the couch like a stone.

Time lapse.

Marching men are walking across my head. I am clearly hallucinating, and am slightly aware of it. The men have small hammers and are walking across a straight dotted line on my forehead. I am afraid to move for fear they will fall off, and at this point I am more concerned with their safety than mine. The only other hallucinations I encountered during that time reminded me of a itunes or media player visulaizer. Just bars and spirals of color that reacted to every sound or movement. 

The last time lapse.

Hughie tells me again to go to sleep. I tell him 'If I go to sleep I don't think I'll wake up again.' He laughs at me. At the time I really meant that though. I am still moaning, crying, whimpering, and screaming from time to time, but at this point I have given up, I am ready to give in. If I am to die when I close my eyes, so be it. I would rather die at this point than keep feeling what I am feeling. I open my eyes as wide as I can and look at my roommate. I try to say 'If I don't wake up tell everyone I love them and I'm sorry.' But I'm sure what actually came out of my mouth was pure gibberish. 

My heart is still beating quickly. I am sweating. I am still rather nauseous, but I fall asleep, and if you can believe it I woke up 12 hours later in my bed (no idea how I got there) feeling like a brand new penny. I mean the birds were chirping and I was singing. I did yoga. Life was amazing that morning. Maybe it was my new found appreciation for it. I'm really not sure. I'm trying not to read that far into it.

Hughie and I contemplate the idea for several days that the cannabis might have been laced with something. When he saw how weird I was getting that night he had decided not to smoke it. However, after consulting his dealer and finding out there was no way it was laced with anything Hughie smoked the same weed and smoked about the same amount I did that night as a test. He said he felt nothing out of the ordinary. I have since smoked the same weed, just not out of a gravity bong, and have not had the same reaction nor anything close to it. It's ironic to me that the devise to cause such a reaction in me is known as a 'gravity' bong because I have truly never felt so far from gravity in my life and hope I never will again.

DOSE:
1 cig.

Cannabis
(plant material)





BODY WEIGHT:
150 lb





At the time that I write this and the time that I smoked up, Im 2 weeks from my 18th birthday. I weigh 150 pounds, and this is the 4th time Ive been stoned. First, an introduction. I was raised in a typical suburban environment; I hear many unspoken messages implying that drugs are bad. The word bad is vague and weak, which captures the strength and severity of the anti-drug campaign Ive felt. From time to time I see advertisements in magazines implying that smoking marijuana leads to destitution. On tv I see Whats your anti-drug? commercials, which are spaced weeks apart and are shown rarely. Stoners are looked down upon, but mainly for their inaction and general lack of intelligence and motivation, not expressly because they smoke pot. 

Being raised in such an ambiguous atmosphere gave me the opportunity to decide, without pressure in any direction, whether I wanted to experience psychoactives first-hand. I was overly cautious, so I began sifting the internet for reliable information. I read and read until I keeled over from exhaustion. I lost my fear of marijuana, and found myself a source. A few weeks later, Im writing this experience report.

The Experience Itself

Sunday night, I had just returned from a flight to D.C., and due to a slight hunger and lack of sleep, I had a minor but persistent headache. I had rolled two cigarette-sized joints a week before, but Id used one, and I only had one left. Rather recklessly, I decided to smoke up despite the fact that both all my siblings and my parents were home. I planned my trip pretty meticulously, I would empty my bag from D.C., then strip down, smoke the joint in the bathroom with the window open and the fan on, then take a shower after I finished the joint. Hopefully the telltale smells would have wafted out the window and I would be clean, literally and figuratively. 

Everything went as planned, but my trip was much stronger than any previous trip Id experienced. Normally I can hold ganja smoke in for 3-4 hits, but this time I could only hold in the first one. I was persistent in trying to hold my breath, but I just kept coughing. Once the joint was done I assumed that I hadnt smoked well enough and that I would feel no high, but in about 30 seconds I felt just the opposite.

I realized I had lost all conscious control of my limbs, and my eyes had no peripheral vision. I only knew what was happening if I concentrated on it, and this applied to my limbs as well. Natural, repetitive motions such as walking, or in my case showering were possible, but only because theyd been ingrained into my subconscious. Every time I tried to do something slightly abnormal, for example, stand on one foot, Id find it extremely hard.

I must also add that when I say I had no peripheral vision, I mean it. My field of vision looked exactly like an old black and white movie, where the corners of the screen have a black haze on them, and the lighting focuses on one object. I noticed that while looking at my arm, I couldnt see my legs or my feet, and when I looked at my feet, everything else had disappeared from view, due to my lack of peripheral vision.

I noticed that I was blinking often, and my eyes seemed to run like a projector that only showed every third frame of a movie, while running at a 40x minute speed. I would look at moving objects, like the water of the shower, and then wonder what theyd look like when my eyes caught them again in the next visible frame. Even weirder, my actions didnt look normal. Every time I did anything, for instance, raised my arm, Id see an old medical diagram in my mind of a mans arm moving, complete with a small script letter at the bottom that said Fig. 1. But it wasnt just one picture. As I moved my arm the picture switched to a different diagram of the arm in a different position, my current position. And the pictured would stack on top of each other, and remain numbered, increasing, I think through Fig. 40.

Having turned off the shower and dried myself off, I left the bathroom, but left the window open and the fan on. I walked to my room, got dressed, and contemplated what to do next. Id planned on watching a dvd on my laptop, but I was consumed by an inexplicable hunger that was 20 times stronger than any of my previous hungers while high. I had a fruit-by-the-foot and a square of chocolate at hand, and I ate them so fast I had to stop myself in the middle from spitting flecks of food all over. 

Obviously I needed to take drastic measures, so I trudged down the stairs and poured myself a glass of orange juice. My mother was downstairs, and I began to ask her a series of random, pandering, incomplete questions relating to how much food we had. She didnt catch on, thankfully, and I cut myself a small piece of cake. That didnt satisfy me, so I cut a piece twice as large and poured another glass of orange juice. I ended up eating 4 large pieces of cake and drinking 4 glasses of orange juice before I felt full enough to stop. It goes without saying that my headache had disappeared. 

My parents began talking to each other, and I couldnt make anything out of what they were saying. Every word they said seemed random, and weird plotlines relating to their words appeared in my head. I realized that the weed had made their conversation incomprehensible, so I ignored it and walked carefully back up the stairs. Having reached my room I turned on my laptop and watched a dvd. It was hard to follow what was happening, and harder to piece different scenes together until they were understandable, but I understood the movie and remembered it pretty well.
After finishing the movie I began to pack for school the next day, which went surprisingly smoothly, though I was still stoned. I went to sleep extremely relaxed, and feeling no ill effects, save some minor paranoia, which was to be expected.

Effects

Looking back I notice that the marijuana made my brain stupid. I couldnt do anything without focusing, and I felt like a 7-year old. I seemed 3` 6`` and I distinctly remember smelling and feeling stimuli that I hadnt felt since I was quite young. Everything felt and looked much larger than it was. Im taller than both my parents, but I looked and felt much smaller.

Everything I saw/felt/ate was separated into its disparate pieces in my mind -- the pulp from the orange juice had a distinct texture Id never felt, separate from its fruity taste, which was separate from its smell. Every stimulus was separate from every other stimulus, even if they came from the same source. Colors I concentrated on that stayed still fell apart into their sectional colors, a purply color on my computer screen had distinct tinges of blue, green and purple when stared at. I could only compute one stimulus at a time, which may explain my loss of peripheral vision. I was able to discern the intricate pieces of everything, but only one at a time. 

Ive read that the brain ignores many sounds/colors/sights if theyre repeated or known, that is to say that smells blend together instead of staying disparate, as do colors and physical feelings. But under the effects of ganja, everything separated, and I felt young again, feeling every stimulus for one of its first times. 

Conclusion

This experience with Cannabis was exhilarating. I felt relaxed and hungry, I lost my headache, and everything I saw or did was new, significant, and strong. I slept well and was happy the next morning. I intend to smoke weed again, but not to make a habit or routine of it. Something this good shouldnt be dulled by frequent use.

I have been smoking marijuana for about one and a half years now, a relatively short amount of time. Ive smoked, good high quality bud, made blunts, joints, and smoked out of bongs, pipes, and about anything else you could name. But for some reason Ive never really thought of eating marijuana as an effective way of getting high, and although I often had weed on me I never want to eat it because I thought it would be a waste so I would smoke it instead.

One particular day I was looking to buy an eight of a ounce of off the local dealer, but I ran into a friend of mine that was also selling weed, he pulled out a bag of low grade marijuana, over a quarter of an ounce and he asked me how much I wanted. I didnt actually want to buy this weed because I had smoked a joint of it before and had not cared for it that much, for one it tasted awful. And when I smoked a lot of it at one time, I was high for about half an hour then I burnt out hard for about an hour after. When he said that he would give me the whole bag for forty buck is was shocked, even if it was shitty weed at least I could just smoke on it till I got high because I had a good deal of weed I thought to myself. Well after about a week of smoking this weed I was tired of it, I wanted some good quality bud, and I was going to sell the shitty stuff for cheap, but I thought hey why not try and get high by eating it? So one night I planed to eat a decent amount of the weed and try to get high.

9:45 pm: I didnt have anytime to make anything special with the weed, like brownies or weed butter or shit like that, I just grabbed a sandwich and piled the weed on top, actually it tasted not bad, the sauce really cover up the taste of the weed and I was satisfied with the amount I had eaten, so I sat back and waited for the effects to kick in.

10:10 pm: Slight buzz noticed and audio perception begins to change, but I write some of these effects of as just my imagination.

10:30 pm: I notice a slight change in my senses, I am in my bedroom listening to music and that music becomes a lot deeper and I fell like I understand the way it was written and I was hearing it the way it was suppose to be heard. It amazed and astounded me. I am defiantly feeling the weed.

11:00 pm: I am slightly disappointed because the effects mentioned above do not increase what so ever, I know that when cannabis is eaten it can take a much longer time to actually take effect, but I thought it would be at least less then an hour. So I decided to turn of the light and go to sleep, I still retain the effects mentioned above, also my bed feels like its the softest thing in the world, like Im sleeping on a cloud. But this does not make it easier to get to sleep, I find myself constantly turning on and off the light but when the light is on I become tired so I try to go to sleep only to turn the light on again after ten minutes of sitting in the dark, I feel a surge of energy. I feel like I have no time for sleep and that I could do anything, but eventually I fall asleep.

1:00 am: I awake with a start; I barely even know were I am and then it occurs to me that Im in my bedroom. I check my clock, but when I hit the light its like the light was as bright as the sun on a summer day. My eyes feel dry and they burn, my mouth is so dry it feels like I can hardly breath. I get up and head to the kitchen and grab a glass of water, I drink four glasses of water and my thirst it still not quenched, but I feel a little bloated so I stop, and thats when I notice how high I really am. 

I could feel the cold soothing water in my stomach and this cold feeling spreads through out my entire body, it felt so refreshing, like going to the pool on a really hot day. Then I noticed that my vision was really impaired. I havent really hallucinated on marijuana before, but this is as close to hallucinating on marijuana that I have ever been; I have a sort of kaleidoscope vision when Im in the dark, almost similar to a mild mushroom trip. I had this to an extreme, when I focused on an object I would see these little designs and patterns circling around the object I look at.

This is also when I noticed I had a very intense body stone I could feel everything, the floor under my feet, the soft sheets of my bed, and the cool breeze blowing through my bedroom window, all of it was magical and frightening at the same time. I started to have fun with this body stone, when I moved my toes that sensation would travel throughout my whole body. I returned to my bedroom and decided that I would try to catch some sleep.

1:30 am: Now Im scared. Sitting in the dark has a weird effect on my high, the above effects described were at least doubled, I try to remember when I ate the weed and it scares me more to realize that I might have a long way to go before I start to come down. Then I notice that my heart seems to be beating very fast, this cause me to breath more through my mouth, which in turn dries out my entire throat which scares me even more. I almost start to panic; I breathe so heavy it feels like I will pass out. What will happen if Mom and Dad see me freak out? Will the kick me out of the house? Can you OD on weed? No. No one ever has, thats a dumb thought.

These thoughts and more race threw my head, then I have a realization that almost made me swear off marijuana forever. What if I stay this way forever? I can only think of my family standing around me, watching me freak out. I start to think Im a waste of skin, useless, a disgrace. But suddenly something in my head snaps me back to reality; I realize that its just the weed. I think back to all the time before this, when I felt too stoned and I always got through it and in a couple days at the most I would be back to normal. These thoughts comforted me enough that I was able to get to sleep yet again.

3:00 am: I awake yet again, and this time I am even more stoned then I was before. I open my eyes and look around my dark bedroom and Im a stranger in my own house, I am disoriented and confused, my body is so relaxed but at the same time its so tense, I have the worst case of cotton mouth ever. My head feels very heavy, like it weighed a thousand pounds, when I lift it my head simple returns to the pillow. I hear people walking up and down my hallway, but everyone in the house is asleep.  I decide to roll over and try to sleep this off. This is when I had the weirdest experience Ive ever had on marijuana.

My kaleidoscope vision I spoke of earlier was back in full force, but this time these bright dots and patterns form shapes and all sorts of things, I saw people (from a side view) walking towards each other then they would step through each as if nothing was there.  Then the outline of my window frame started to sway and move like a piece of grass in the morning breeze, it almost reminded me of a mild mushroom trip but more intense and with a sort of twist.

Emotionally it was also a very unusual feeling, before I got high I had a lot of stuff on my mind, but now I felt almost emptied of my emotions, but to replace that whole my senses seem so acute that I need every brain cell I could muster just to simply look around my room. I couldnt think of anything else, my brain was well, full. There was just enough room in my brain for my basic functions like breathing, never mind actually trying to speak.  I though about how weird language actually is, all it is is just sounds arranged into a familiar fashion so we thing that you can communicate with someone.  After some more pondering of life and staring off into nothing I must have fell asleep again.

7:25 am: I wake up five minutes before my alarm is to go off for school, and I realize that I am still fairly high. It is all I can do just to put words together and talk to my Mom. She knows something is wrong and I tell her in a very slow and tried voice that I feel really sick, so I stay home and she goes to work. After everyone leaves the house I sleep on my bed.

2:00 pm: After about six hours of sleep I am amazed that I am still somewhat impaired from the marijuana, although the effects are not as near as intense as previously recorded it feels like I am still all not there.

6:00 pm: I sleep till supper time were I eat a massive amount of food, the worst case of the munchies Ive ever had.  I still feel very tired, despite having slept for most of the day. I dont return to what I would call normal till I wake up the next day at 7:30 when I wake up for school.

All and all I enjoyed my very intense high. Although I have learned a valuable lesson.  I think I will continue to experiment with taking marijuana orally because it has shown me effects that I have never thought possible with weed, but next time I will plan it much better.

This is my third time burning, and we're in Benny's car, waiting for Nick and Sam to arrive with the weed. When they finally arrive, John scoots next to me in the middle to make room for Nick. He passes the bag to John and tells him to start grinding. The smell is pungent in the air and I drink it in--the way it mixes with John's cologne brings back good times. It's always grossed me out a little how he eats the leftover bits raw. He sprinkles the grounds into the paper Nick holds, and all of us rag him for spilling. It's nearly midnight and Benny turns off the car light and turns on his iPod to watch a movie. Nick holds up two joints for all to see, lights up and passes one on to John, and then to me--it doesn't burn it's way down my throat last time, but maybe that's because of all the cigs. 

Everyone's taking two hits so I do the same before passing it on to Benny in the front seat, who then offers it to Michael, who declines. Pretty soon the car morphs into a very good hotbox--John turns to me and asks if I'm high yet, I don't know, it always hits me slow. So he laughs and a few minutes later I feel it, and I feel it good. I knew I was blasted when Sam--in the very back of the car--leaned over the back seat to talk to John and he turned into a white, Voldenmort-like devil in my peripheral vision. The joints were still being passed along and John was patient and gave me tips before I had the chance to screw up. 

My eyes move real slow--like when I'm drunk, except that everything has a weird view to it, like I'm looking through a bubble out into the world, and the edges are blurred. I'm studying everyone, paying little attention to Michael, which is odd, because he was most of the reason for me joining this little excursion in the first place. I was still depressed from when he broke up with me the week before and I needed to 'sort out' all of the feelings pent up inside before I drove myself mad from running in metaphorical circles. And I needed to figure out how to not feel so awkward around him, and this seemed like a good path to try out. 

The dark is nice and everyone hisses and rags on whoever turned on the car light, but we all quiet when the pipe comes out, a little blown-glass thing with green stripes. Again, Nick started, the light went out, and we all went back to breathing in the hotboxed fumes. My eyes were glued to John, studying the way he used the pipe--I'd never used one before. But, like before, he was patient and lit it for me and walked me through it.

I let go of my breath and watched the smoke meld with the rest of the atmosphere. I lean forward and try to focus on Michael, on what I wanted to accomplish regarding him, but I just can't care. Here's another thing: my attention span shrinks to about fifteen seconds, and everything has a meaning and a wonder, but none of it it worth pondering, if that makes sense. 

I look at my hands--they really are huge. A giggle escapes, a dry, high sound. They don't look huge, perse, only feel huge. Like my nerves had stretched out about six inches from my body. I lean in to touch John's face and find that I can feel him without any physical contact. The sensation was like to touching your foot when it falls asleep--that feathery caress that leaves you in a dull, numb ache. But as soon as too much pressure is applied, the feeling goes away, leaving you unsatiated. When my hand lay against his cheek, the 'aura' left until I pull away. John announces to the group that I'm officially blasted. I say nothing--there's no need to. 

I trick my eyes into seeing things in the shadows, scaring myself and revelling in it. Briefly I wonder at how my pulse is doing, but I can't feel it in my chest--it's found a home between my ears. I 'touch' everything, feel the people around me even though I don't reach out, recoilling from Nick (who's always made me nervous) and ignoring Michael. John finishes his hit and looks into the bowl, laughing a little. It's almost ash. He asks Benny (who's next after me) if it's chill that I finish it off, and with the okay, I take the last hit. My lips leave the hot glass and I taste ash in my mouth--John holds it up to me, giggling about how I completely ashed it. He puts it away and when he looks at me again I tug on one of his dreads, feeling the carpet texture scratch my fingertips lightly--almost teasingly. 

Every now and then we bump our foreheads together, staring at eachother until one of us grins and breaks the connection. I'm concentrating on tricking my eyes, and then on keeping my mouth shut so I don't accidentally drool. I can no longer multitask, everything is separate. I have to make my eyes adjust and move instead of letting them roam free--I can only feel one body part at a time. Hands or thighs or lips or eyelids. Everything becomes singular.

When the car revs to life, I panic. Benny was going to drive stoned--totally blasted. My voice finds its way past my teeth and I say no over and over again, telling him that we would get caught if he drove, that it was stupid. And somewhere in my gut I knew that this would happen--something like this would go down. We stank of weed, none of us were in our right minds, smoke billowed out of the windows. John and Michael tell me to relax, that I'm being irrational. I think the only thing that gets me to stop flipping out is Michael's assurance that Benny was one of the best stoned drivers he'd ever seen. When the car moves down to the stop sign, I put my hands over my face and lay down, head resting next to John's thigh and eyes shut tight. He leans down and asks if I'm okay and am I having a bad trip? My answer comes out strangled and tight. No, I am not okay. 

I'm scared out of my wits, shivering from the cold of the wind and John tells Benny to roll them up, but I'm still frozen. I can feel my nerves stretching out to find warmth, latching onto John and leeching the body heat away from him. My body is numb but I know it's cold, because I can feel the trembles emmanating from it, pulsing thorugh those metaphysical nerves. Where John's body heat reaches is hot, but it stays only where it hits and goes no further.

Every so often one of them talks, and when Michael's clear, lazy voice inquires as to my state of consiousness. 'She's out,' comes the confident, lyrical cadence of John himself. 'Wow, she just freaked and passed out.'

This statement is only half-true. I am awake enough to hear them and differentiate between the their voices, but not quite so much as to get up and prove them wrong. Besides, I add, if I got up I'd probably act even more suspicious, so this is the smarter thing to do. So I content myself with watching the patterns inside my head--the wavy lines of blue and green and purple and yellow on the sea of black. The skin-toned circles that signify where the heat is located in a triangular pattern, with dark lines making out my head and his thigh, separating the triangle into two different shades of skin--light and dark. 

The car turns into Michael's driveway, and when he gets out, he decides that they would have to wait another day to get the four nugs he offered to Benny and John--there was no way he could get in and out of the house undetected. The door closes, Benny turns the car around and after a minute he notices that he needs gas. This scares the bejesus out of me, because we were already cutting it close enough as it is.

The whole time, I'm laying there, and now my body is lightly spasming away because I manage to work my way up to a panic attack. When we stop my mouth is dry. Then comes a deep, authoritative voice: 'Mind stepping out of the car, please, sir?'

Benny giggles and I could see the cop's large nose through my eyelids. He begins to open the door and then remembers to shut off the car, saying 'whoopsies' and turning it on and off again, laughing at the noise. My heart pounds loud in my ears and I go all tense and shaky, filled with so many different emotions--panic overriding them all. The muscle is pulling at the constraints of my sternum, trying to fight its way out.

Breathing is hard, I'm shaking uncontrollably. I should call for help, because the vision behind my lids is greying, the lines and circles loosing their tint until my mind is empty except for one thought: I'm caught. I've disappointed my mother, what will I tell her? And then I realize that I really can't breathe--it's not coming to me. I want to scream so that I can get help and not go down in the stats as another OD--get a tube pushed down my throat to force the oxygen in. But I don't, and as the cold feeling of dread spreads steadily, building the pressure like a crucible, death stares me plain in the face.

I curl my body inwards and briefly wonder if that's why I was so numb. Everything is overpowering--the heavy silence, crushing atmosphere and terrifying prospect of dying. Then it all makes sense, why I can never fully envision myself with a future, how it all blurs when I think too far into the future--I had none. This was the end of the line, so to speak, and I wouldn't even be remembered as anything more than hurt. Guilt built up, about how this would affect my mother, how disappointed she would feel to know that her pride and joy had screwed up royally, and how she would blame herself for it. 

These are the worst moments of my life. 

John's thigh is still there, and a little logic makes its way through the fog of my mind. If there really is a cop, John would be outside with Benny. I would have been noticed immediately. It's him that acts as an anchor to reality, gradually pulling me back into rationality. Then I hear Benny's voice again, happy as ever, the crackle of a candy wrapper sparking through my thoughts. John reaches over to get it and they eat in relative silence while I focus on slowing down my heart. As I work up the willpower necessary to move I squeeze my eyes shut, making sure that I still had some control over my body--I don't believe that I do until I feel the two lids rub against eachother. Then I brace myself and pull away from the leather upholstery, staring lamely at a spot on the floor while I convince myself that there is no cop. 

John asks if I'm okay, but I don't respond--there's no need to, no hurry, no care. He repeats himself, and Benny backs him up, but I lift a finger to signal that I heard them, I was just getting my bearings back. There was a dampness just below my eyes and I wiped at it, amazed that I had cried without noticing it. But when I look over my shoulder, that dread comes back full force as I realize we haven't even left the gas station yet. What felt like eternity was really only a few minutes. My brain can't take the conflicting logics and with a prominent 'Oh, fuck' I crash back down to the seat to wait out the rest of the ride to John's house--there is no way I'm going home state I'm in. 

When the car stops the second time it isn't surrounded by bright flourescent lights--it's dark and cool and quiet. Benny turns around and I feel their gazes on me, and Benny laughs and remarks on my eyes, so I squeeze them shut and make a mental inventory of my vanity: am I drooling? Are my eyes going wayward? Are there creases on my face from the seat? Is my hair sticking up? When I decide that I am as presentable as one in my position can be, I let John coax me into getting up with promises of a warm house and soft couch to sleep on instead of the car's interior. It works and I fiddle with the door handle until it opens and I undo the seatbelt and slide out, bracing myself with the side of the car. I walk with Benny and he teases me about my stumbling, zig-zagging walking patterns, even though the ground is solid and straight beneath my feet. He fools me into believing him until I figure out that he's messing with me, and them I go to John instead. 

He reminds Benny and I that we have to be quiet since he wasn't supposed to have people over and goes in first to make sure it's all clear. When he nods we follow, and I notice how nice it is--matching couches, entertainment center, flat-screen TV, and weights. I catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror and see bloodshot eyes and only slightly tousled hair. The table in the living room isn't bad, either, but we don't go there, because that's just asking to get caught. John tells Benny to sit when he tries to follow him into the kitchen, and after a quick-whispered squabble, Benny sits on the small couch. I let out the breath I'd been holding and relax when they work it out grinning--controversy makes me nervous, and we'd all be in deep trouble if we got caught now.

John comes back with a box of Coco Puffs, which look fairly sickening, and puts on Airplane. He dumps a blanket in my lap and they go outside, and--aside from the nagging paranoia of getting caught (again)--there is peace. I feel a tug on my bladder, but I don't know where the bathroom is and can't walk straight anyway, so I decide to deal with it in the morning. In the flickering light of Airplane I play with shapes and shadows, making figures that scare me and designs that I can see, but only in the very back of my mind. Like an idea, I can only see them for what they are if I don't look directly at them. Maybe they're just shy, lingering at the peripherals of my thoughts. 

When I remember my promise I contemplate the floral pattern of the blanket, smiling when I realize it looks almost exactly like the blanket I get at every house I sleep over at. Deciding that I can't balance with the blanket, I leave it on the chair and curl up on the small couch, back to the television. While I drift off Airplane plays in the background, later interrupted by the click of the front door and Benny and John's quiet voices as they tiptoe back inside. They watch the movie a bit longer before it goes off, the patterns the light was making against the back of the couch fading in the darkness, roiling there in the shadows before flickering out of existence. The hall light goes off and I listen to them rustle around in the darkness, paying attention to the tune the random noises made. 

It must have been a couple of hours, because I'm stiff and aching. I push myself into a sitting position and press the heels of my hands into my eyes. The hall light is back on and I assume John has the munchies or ran to the bathroom, so I let my eyes wander. Benny is on the carpet, half-covered by a blue comforter, and John is fast asleep on the couch. He has the blanket I left on the chair, his face covered with it, unruly hair poking out the top. I notice how much taller and leaner he looks laying out like that, all open and stretched end-to-end of the green sofa. In the reflection of the television screen I see a man with long gray hair and an orange shirt sitting at a table. The colors aren't moving so I guess I've come down. My heartbeat quickens and I lay back down, and within minutes I'm half-asleep again. 

I was up first the next morning, though I guess that's to be expected, since I never really slept. I watch Benny sleep, the way his nose twitches and his mouth sags just slightly. John is even more fascinating, and when he turns facing me it seems like he knew someone was watching, because his eyes open. He turns around, looks to the hall, and then at me with such open confidence and lazy nonchalance that I have to avert my gaze--almost like he knew that I'd be watching him, like he was waiting for me to figure it out instead of vice versa. I prod Benny until he wakes and then we leave to air out the car. The sweet, heedy smell of pot hangs heavy everywhere--in our clothes, our hair, my hands. The car can't compare with this eye-rolling scent absorbed into my very sweat and skin.

I don't get the spiritual enlightenment or emotional clarity I was looking for, but I feel better--more at ease. When I have the chance to do this again, there will be no driving. I asked them about the cop, just to make sure it was a hallucination/dream, and it turns out it was--all caused by a Sublime song, apparently.

I had just recently moved away and had gone home to visit some old friends and party alittle bit. I am a very expierenced pot smoker. And have also drank many times.

It was 10:45pm and we had just gotten 1/4 ounce of some decent marijuana. There were 3 other people there besides myself.

We started off the night by chillen and sittin around, smoking cigarettes, and watching tv. When the time came to smoke, we got out my friends bong, and I decided to go first. I was very excited about this trip, it had been a month or so since I had smoked, and I had been with my good friends. So I was eager to smoke. I started off taking a huge hit, I held the smoke in for some 30-40 seconds and then exhaled, to amazing find I was already starting to get buzzed. My body was numbing slowly, and everything around me just made me happy. Soon enough the first bowl was finished and I was definitely high.

Everyone had left the room but myself, they had gone to call some friends up and make this private affair into a little party. I smoked the 2nd bowl all by myself, and I could tell the outside world was different from before. My distance judgement had gone to hell. I stood up, looking to get something to drink, my mouth was dry and didn't feel good. Cottonmouth has always been an issue while I was high. Right when I got to the fridge I forgot what I was there for and didn't remember for some 15 minutes or so. Eventually I got some pop, and walked back into the smoking room.

The air was filled with smoke and the beautiful fragrence of marijuana was in the air. I felt so good, to my suprise there were 6 people there that I didn't even know had entered the house. I knew only 2 of them I was a little tense being around people that I don't know. This cleared after I helped finish off a third bowl. I was in a state of complete euphoria. My body was numb and I was without a care. Thoughts raced through my mind, about everything that I thought was good in the world. I felt completely blessed. It was amazing. I was a little hesitant about smoking anymore, considering this was some really really potent stuff, considering I was wasted on 3 bowls.

I was extremely hungry at this point and found there was no food in the house. I was angered by this, but immediately returned to happiness. My friend suggested I tame my appetite by smoking a few more bowls with the gang. Soon enough I had smoked 4 more bowls. Incredible! I am feeling overwhelmingly stoned, every movement I make feels like I'm floating, almost sexual, It felt good just to move a finger, or blink my eyes. It was now 2:30am and then night felt like it had been going on forever.

I went into the living room to get out of the smoking scene for awhile and explore my surroundings. When I entered the living room, there was a girl named Nicole sitting on the couch watching TV. I sat in the loveseat nearby, and tried to engage in any form conversation that I could with her, but by this point I couldn't talk. I couldn't move. I was dead. I wasn't tired, but I was slipping in and out of conciousness, all the while trying to comprehend what was going on, on the tv.

Soon enough a guy appeared out of what seemed to be nowhere, he was demanding that everyone take a bite out of the gigantic sub-sandwhich that he had purchased. I opened my mouth and he shoved the sandwhich in my mouth, I immediately realized that there was something in the sandwhich that I didn't like, pickles and onions. These two things made me very sick, very quickly. I pretended like I needed to take a crap, and attempted to go in my friend's bathroom, where I found it was being occupied by someone else, so I went to the private bathroom, my best friend's (person who lived at this house) mom's bathroom. Where I knew no one was allowed to go, so I would be safe to throw up and no one would walk in and find out.

I threw up the sandwhich. It tasted horrible coming up, but soon enough I couldn't feel my mouth anyways, and my taste buds had been temporarily killed off. I returned to the couch to find I was all alone, just me and the tv. I felt connected to the characters in the show. Even though I was in no way relatable to the people in reality. I then suddenly became sick.

I was dead again. I felt like my soul had been ripped from my body, and I was no longer alive. The room blackend, and suddenly I was all alone, alone in a chair, nothing at all around me. I could hear music and voices in the distance but I felt as if maybe I really was dead, even though in the back of my mind I knew it was only the drug's effects on me. I then lit a cigarette and took a long hit. The world was back, I was now in my friend's bed room, sitting in a wooden chair, AMAZING! how did I get from the living room to here. Everyone was tapping their fingers on me and asking me alot of questions, to which all, my best friend replied 'He's fucked up, just leave him alone, he's alright'.

I finished off about half of the cigarette and then set it down in the ash tray everyone was using. I went and layed on my friend's bed, just staring up at the ceiling. Out of nowhere a girl named Pricsella laid on the bed right beside me, not close, but she was looking right at me, she smiled and said 'You gonna be alright?', I just smiled as my reply to her question. She got up and walked out of the room. I felt reborn. I felt as if I died in the living room and was rebirthed in the bedroom, a new person. Happier. I was smiling ALOT at this point and had found some chips to eat. I devoured nearly half of the bag, and then ate an entire bag of chex mix spicy flavored type. I felt so good. I felt like I had beaten all odds, and the world was beautiful again.

I soon enough was walking around the house, semi-socializing. I felt so good. I was coming down from my intense smoking session. I entered the bedroom once again and found there was a little weed to spare. So me and my best friend smoked another bowl and a half. I was pleasently high again. It was now 4:30am. Everyone was starting to depart to go home. I was spending the night at his place, so I went in the next room, and decided to go to sleep. I fell asleep as If I was a small child, not a care in the world.

I awoke the next morning, covered in flour. What had happened!? I was laying in a pile of the white flour. It was in my ear, in my long hair, and in my eyes. I couldn't believe it, I didn't even know this had been done to me. My friends had thrown 3 hand fulls of flour at 'rapid speeds' as my friend explained at my head, smacking with loud flesh like sounds each time, and I didn't even budge, so they left me alone. I went to the bathroom and took a shower. I felt clean and renewed. I was hung over, nothing noticable though. I just felt tired, run down. This passed after eating breakfast.

To this date I have never had a more 'powerful' expierence with weed. I didn't even know weed could make me react in the way that it did that night. So many effects on my body. It felt so good. I will definetaly smoke large amounts of weed like I did again. Hopefully to find a similar expierence.

I had been smoking for about 2 years, before I had this expierence. It is definitely worth while in the end. That night has forever changed me, I see the world in a new light. I enjoy doing things more, I enjoy being with good friends more. I think it has indirectly made me a better person.

I am writing this to share some of my experiences with marijuana; a drug that is in my opinion, extremely under studied and highly misunderstood.  It was this very plant that first pried me from reality as I once knew it, unraveled the very fibers of my consciousness, and for that I am ever grateful.  It takes a drug-induced experience to truly reveal the potential of the human mind.  I sincerely believe we all have the ability to interact with a multitude of altered mindframes; each one unique, each one with something to offer, and we are deluding ourselves by refusing to accept this.  My endeavors with marijuana have taught me this; to limit one's consciousness is to deprive one's self.  Reality is essentially multi-faceted; there is so much more to life that remains unexplored by many of us, and psychoactives serve to inform us of these vast possibilities.

Ever since the first inhalation, I had been intrigued by the effects of marijuana.  I am not a spiritual person, and yet I would certainly describe the marijuana high as nothing short of 'enlightening'.  Being a man whose religion consists of logic and reason, marijuana shook the foundation of my straight and narrow principles; I had been very anti-drug prior to experimenting with marijuana, and saw no value in altering my 'perfect' neurochemistry.  Little did I know that I was far from perfection, and that the first introduction of cannabinoids into my body would gradually blossom into something which until this day, fascinates me.  

I did not learn much from my first encounters with the drug.  Being unaccustomed, my memory was very jaded, and I could not recall specific emotions and thoughts whilst under the influence.  The only solution to this age-old dilemma, as I have now discovered, is to continue using it.  The brain has a wonderful way with chemical intervention; it can adapt and respond in a more positive fashion once it has been exposed to a substance for a prolonged period of time.  As of now, 2 years after my first sketchy encounters, my ability to recall thought has dramatically improved while under the influence, as have other aspects.  My motor function still remains impaired, but only to a slight degree.  When I concentrate, I find that I can still exhibit controlled dexterity with tasks such as drawing or percussion, both very rewarding whilst high. But when I am in a situation where I can release my focus and simply let the drug take over, such as in the shower, something peculiar occurs.  I feel almost as if each and every part of my body is fixed to an axis, and my movement is restricted to rhythmic, repetitive cycles.  I can easily control this feeling, but I see no reason to, for I do enjoy it, strange as it may sound. I also become aware of a sort of separation between body and mind.  My body becomes a mere minion of my brain, a robotic mass of rhythmic muscle contraction; difficult to describe in words.  In all their peculiarity, it is during these occurrences that I can let my mind roam free.  I can only achieve this during times when I am alone, and for me, the shower seems to be the ideal area for cannabis-inspired contemplation.  My imagination has no horizon; I spontaneously jump from one random thought to another, most of which manifest a type of creativity which I normally do not possess.  I can always seem to generate a series of random imagery at will, and the clarity with which I can envision them is beyond what I can accomplish sober.  The only negatives that present themselves are the fact that much of these thoughts and images are indeed random and in fast succession, and it is difficult to process them so that I may recall them later.  I am adapting to this; slowly bringing back more and more thoughts and feelings from the marijuana experience, and although not all of them are of use, I find it quite intriguing, if not a little befuddling.  Long trains of spontaneous, creative thought are typically not in my character.

Much of what I think and do while high on marijuana is quite out of character for me.  I undergo what I call a 'mentalmorphosis'; a change very difficult for others to detect, even those very close to me, for it is of purely cerebral nature.  The way in which I convey myself seldom changes even when I am overly intoxicated, yet there are differences in my mannerisms that are so intricate as to only be recognized by myself.  I will show a greater interest in the arts at times, especially music, art, even cooking.  A song will have much more depth, lyrics and instruments tend to embody emotions that can only seem to be derived while high.  The effect of sound and its ability to evoke thought and feeling are heightened.  A good work of art will open itself up when beholded through enlightened eyes; this could be a painting, literature, a movie.  And cooking becomes a journey, a quest motivated by the will to create something worthy of my taste.  My lack of cooking skill does not allow me to develop anything special, but the pleasure of eating while high can make any culinary monstrosity taste exceptional.  The taste sensations experienced under the influence of marijuana are quite astounding to me, I would say that it is the sense most adversely affected.  Deep fried foods release their warm, oily flavors, and their crunchiness is exemplified.  Mashed potatoes have a profound smooth, earthy texture, and meats feel pleasurably moist and firm against the teeth, and the list goes on.  It takes longer for me to finish a meal, simply because flavor sensations become more intense, and I will savor them almost to excess.  I remember consuming a bowl of popcorn one night, one kernel after another, tasting each one individually, because that was all that was necessary.  

These are just a few of the effects of marijuana that I find particularly interesting.  There is indeed much to be learned as to the limits of human perception.  As I have concluded from my usage of the drug, there really is no limit to be spoken of; only factors which cause limitation.  In this day and age, the media strikes me as one such factor, spreading mass amounts of unsupported claims and misinterpretation.  I do, however, see this as a waning trend; society is slowly becoming more informed.  My relationship with this profound plant still progresses, and I am continuing in my efforts to make sense of the drug's impact upon my thought and feeling.  I hope one day to be able to harness the power of marijuana, to strive ever forward in my passion to seek alternate levels of consciousness.  We have only one life to live; why not live it a variety of different ways?

Marijuana is a substance of fleeting effect. It has been used for centuries by millions for numerous reasons, and has been a topic of developed discussion on many levels; including medical, philosophical, and spiritual levels. Still, after its massively widespread use, marijuanas specific effects and use remain a mystery even to its most serious supporters. It is well established that after taking a dose of marijuana, one feels enthused with his/her existence, relaxed, and euphoric at times, but the specifics of these effects have been hard to focus in upon. It is through my effort here that I wish to provide scientific documentation on the psychological effects a dose of cannabis has upon my body, and the varying sensations that my body is stricken with throughout the progress of my session.

Due to legal issues, my study will, unfortunately, be quite unscientific. I have, as a medium, this computer, on which I will record in 10-minute intervals the exact sensations, emotions, and varying temperaments I may come to experience. I also have my personal webcam, on which I will record, at significant legal risk, my actions within my room. This document will most certainly be kept secure, as its public release would be a massive legal liability.

Finally, I am making preparations to address the specific cravings and effects of various audio stimulation throughout my experience. As a somewhat seasoned stoner, if you will, I am quite familiar with the dramatic effects of music upon a person while in the midst of a marijuana-induced high. In the same manner, a variety of food and drink will also be provided.

And thus, let us begin with some previously-acquired data:

Name: Aes
Age: 15
Gender: Male
Height: 59
Weight: 128 lbs.

7.45 am - Smoking began. 0.25 grams of moderate quality acquired in New Jersey, USA by means of a two-car trade off, beginning in New York City, USA, where it was grown.

7.55 - I am, at the moment, filled with a deep psychological pressure to make haste and finish my work so I have time remaining to clean up my smoking tools, as well as a fear of being caught red-handed by a number of my superiors. I repeatedly picture them coming to my door in my mind, and they each, for some reason unknown, have face and body textures very similar to those of the Simpsons television characters. I must make haste to clean up, I will return. 

8.00 - I have returned, supplies hidden, and have been recently staggered by the discovery of a sixth plane of sense. I can, not by means of any other sense, detect the presence of non-incandescent light, specific pressure in different places, and scents upon myself, my clothes, and objects I am directly touching by skin alone. I seem to have gained a new way of thinking, but slightly written over previous objects in my mind. Hence a retarded expansion of thought. I must beg the readers pardon on any confusion caused by my part. I am quite intoxicated at the moment.

8.04 - I am still going up, believably. When I close my eyes, I can view coloured graph-generated lines forming pictures of what I can see in my mind. I seem to type by predicting giant mathematical patterns in my mind outlined by these wires. This sensation cannot be grasped by anyone who has never used marijuana. I just feel happy and content, yet massively hungry and thirsty. I also feel satisfied with myself for the labour required to purchase this bowl. And I just completed my inhalation of the first bowl of chips. The world around me seems fascinatingly dynamic, and I am filled with an urge to rush out and behold of its beauty, but I must hold fast. I will return, with a plant from it to satisfy me. Oh, and food.

8.11- I have returned, with Triscuits, green tea, and a small cactus. I choke upon a dry Triscuit, and I feel waves of discomfort flowing through my body, but it only makes me feel more tired and nature-acclimated. Once again, I fear being apprehended as my small marijuana stash container is still left on the table. My thoughts move fast, but my body feels as though a racing car in one of those bond movies is chasing him, and hes flying downhill. I also feel an earthy attachment to my car. Anyway, on the physical sign, I now see a psychedelic cloud with earthy video-game tones in it and I feel very close to nature. I am now very warm everywhere, and greatly stimulated to relax..

8.14 - As my watch beeps the time, I struggle for exterior contact for no reason. I wish to call someone, and speak aloud, Damn, everyones at school. I crave salty food and inhale some more Triscuits, but then take a fearful swig of green tea. The life existing around me feels so beautiful, I wish to clad myself in clothes much in its colour and natural patterns, and go out into it where I can experience the beauty of music and love right in its deepest deaths. I feel as though the world has just thrust upon me the key to life in this marvelous cannabis experience and wishes me to emerge from the world relaxed and rejuvenated. I require a different musical selection now, and I restart my webcam.

8.21- Euphoric is the only way I can describe my situation. Its save time. Nirvana deeply connects to my soul, I feel like an artist. I wish strongly to play my bass or guitar, but I deeply crave to just listen to what I am doing in my experiment. I feel empowered by the grunge music on, and feel much empathy towards Kurt Cobain.

8.24 - Still stoned, my world is surrounded by colours. The cactus represents Mickey Mouse in quite a severe manner. I wish to present it to the camera.

8.27 - A sudden burst of hilarious ridiculous action hits my body like a truck, but I gain control. For some reason, I continued to move my body as though I was laughing, but did not maintain the facial expression or focus at all. I feel as though my ears are being pulled down in a sensual way by the lobes. I also feel a wonderful sensual pressure by pressing upon my temples. I must now go outside, I will report back.

8.34 - Still stoned. I am starting to begin to come down, but it is slow and gradual. Time seems to flow slowly. I am feeling alright as so many smokers before me have said. I for some reason feel as though smoking has brightened and improved my life, rather than acting in a negative, dirty way as I might unfortunately consider while not high. At the moment, I feel happy, content, and sleepy. I wish nothing more than to pass out on my bed, but I feel dedicated to staying awake to further my study. All colours currently associated with nature. I am now filled with fear, as I see a blue light entering my room. I rush to the window, expecting to see an officer to arrest me, and see nothing. So I lock my door and turn down the music. 

8.39 - I am amazed that Ive only been high for 40 minutes, it feels as though it was an eternity, considering the movement of the sun over the earth has been dramatic, and my mood has changed so deeply. I am really stoned now, and am experiencing a euphoric full-body buzz, as so many of us have heard described. I consider going out for Chinese food, as fried rice with little pieces of meat sounds amazing. Maybe I will order it, they couldnt be too upset, eh? Maybe some spare ribs too. Oh, shit, no delivery. Damn, I wish they delivered everything. Or they had like a totally automated method for delivering all food, where like everything would be kept in giant metal containers or something. Wow, I just had a total out-of-body experience, I feel content and happy with everything the world has to offer, and am thrilled with the thought of my article being enjoyed worldwide.

8.44 - Still stoned. I realize I repeat still stoned often. I now must play Mechwarrior 4, the thought of piloting a gigantic robot fascinates me.

9.24 - Amazing program, really. I seem to be suffering from a significant loss of concentration, currently, and need to browse the web, but I am overdue on a report. My head is heavy, and my eyes are tired. I have a mild headache, but my entire body feels tingly nerve stimulation. My entire vision is a floating blur. Colours are vibrant but primarily green in base (all of them). I feel relaxed, happy, and accomplished. Thirst is very strong, with hunger waning. All thought is very random and brief, and seems to bounce disconnectedly.

10.05 - After a significantly long Diablo II session, I now feel relaxed and tingly all over, and desire sleep deeply. Time seems to move very slowly, reggae music is highly stimulating, and all colour is bright and wavy. That is the only word I can come up with to describe it. I feel gentle and very sincerely nature-acclimated once again. I feel accomplished.

10.20 - End of study. I now just feel warm and content, and this feeling continues for an average period of approximately 6 hours (until 4.20 in the afternoon, in this case). 

The next day - I feel refreshed, alert, and have a slightly lacking memory of yesterday, but I associate a very positive and natural feeling towards it. I feel less stressed than usual, but feel, aside, absolutely normal, if slightly more inspired and focused.

Thank you for reading my study, It is my sincerest hope it has proved an interesting resource.

Saturday night was one of the most remarkable nights of my life, I believe. Let me start from the beginning.

At around 9 o' clock, hair combed and cool shirt donned, I trekked a short ways across campus to a dormitory, where I would meet my very attractive friend Carrie to go see an improv show with her and some friends.

I got to her room and worked for about a half an hour on her computer, fixing various problems and showing her how to get her e-mail on Outlook, and a few other things. Afterwards we went to the Improv show, which, being chock-full of absolutely perverse and disturbing humor, was ultimately very entertaining. Yada yada yada... so Carrie and I ended up, somehow, on M Street, sitting on a step outside a small, indoor shopping center of sorts (which was closed by then), at midnight, drinking coffee and talking about a multitude of incredibly random things that wove together quite nicely into what I'd call an amazingly cool conversation. We sat shoulder to shoulder, and there was a lot of the conversational sort of touching that just makes you feel good. And we walked back, and I said good night to her, and things were good.

Ah yes, but my night wasn't over... this was 420, and I had a slight interest in pursuing some activities that could possibility serve to yield a little bit of universal enlightenment... so... to make a long story short, I got my buddy Elwin, secured implements, trekked over to get a bag of the green herb from a good friend, and we wandered forestwards.

In the depth of the small forest we have on the outskirts of campus you can't see very much, except for hazy blue in the sky and a few lights from some distant houses on the other side of the surrounding fence. The place where most of my friends and I have tended to smoke out is at the foot of a large hill entoured by trees, and sitting on rocks at the bottom of the hill, you can relax and lean back and truly enjoy the scenary around you.

So settling into our cozy spots, the two of us began to light and pass the bowl around, and it was strong, flavor-filled chronic, and we were pleased to feel the warmth fill us, and it wasn't long before we started to feel the effects. However, maybe due to the atmosphere, the warm night that surrounded us, the pleasant feelings all around, we didn't just feel lacadaisical, funny, forgetful... all of that stage seemed to pass by in seconds, and suddenly we were both thrust into a dream-like world of colors, and we began to talk about it. The world around us was no longer so easily conceptualized and interpreted as a forest with a fence with trees and a sky... it was a fractal-like pattern of colors that our brain saw in front of us; it was a beautiful flowing picture we could touch that filled the entirety of our vision. Looking up at the sky, the leaves and hazy blue of the sky swayed and flowed, and suddenly you were seeing the entire world in the reflection of an enormous lake. Small ripples expanded into large ones, which you could feel and smell and taste and know. Looking back down at the ground, we were both mesmerized and made unable to move by the world around us, which danced and sang like so much art, and suddenly I saw it all.

Imagine if humans actually discovered extraterrestrial life. But it wasn't just some aliens in a UFO, though that's how everyone would think of it at first. It was extraterrestrials discovering us. It was a huge, huge, huge world of creatures all over the universe, massively connected and with already well-developed civilizations (kind of like in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy). It would be for us like a native tribe on an island on the Pacific rim that had never known any other tribes, and though they theorized, had no real reasons to ever consider the possibility of other tribes or other people. So far as they knew, they were the universe. And then the rest of the world finds them, and suddenly they're part of a sphere millions of times as big in an instant.

That's how I felt. I was suddenly outside of the world that I had thought of as total, and I remembered (for over winter break I had felt this, and forgotten somewhat) what it felt like to truly realize you could get outside of your experience and know what it felt like to sort of remember that you'd been seeing the world through goggles your entire life. Like a much bigger version of getting sucked into a movie so much that you feel like you _are_ the plot, and then something brings you out of it, and you remember you actually have another life you'd completely forgotten about.

I looked into the forest deep through towards the lights from nearby houses, and I made an slight effort to imagine as if those lights weren't scant lights in a thin forest, and thus all we were seeing, but rather parts of a lot of light obscured by a thick forest in front of us, and suddenly I was in a much denser forest, looking through seas of trees at far off traces of light that indicated a Elven or fairy festival of sort in the distance. My entire reality changed with my perspective, and I knew what total virtual reality would feel like, someday. Looking upwards, Elwin prompted me to imagine as if the sky wasn't dark and hazy because it was the middle of the night, but only because we were in a hugely dense, thick forest, and the scant light we had was due to the tall canopy of above our heads. And it became true, and it was daytime for us, and we knew the night would be even darker. Elwin actually came to believe this so sincerely he was convinced that we had passed an entire night and the following day in the forest, because he later made several references to 'tomorrow' being Monday and it being 'Sunday night.' We had no real conception of time, and I definitely felt as if it had ceased to be an important factor in this world. It just seemed dark and hazy whenever I thought about the concept, so I gave up on it and enjoyed spiritual tangibility of the present.

And looking around, I suddenly realized my entire perception was palpable and existing, instead of just THERE and not so much existing tangibly than all that I knew. I could feel and remember how I've felt during my life, and could relive old experiences with vivid detail, now able to sense the dimension of perception, something we humans generally take so for granted that we don't even realize it exists. I began to consciously try to change my perception of my surroundings, and guided Elwin through this process as well. The leaves in the trees began to become more uniform, and the entire wilderness turned into glowing purple and green tessellations, interconnecting and phosphorescing right before our eyes. As we moved our eyes around the pattern followed, and then, I decided to add a dimension to it in my mind, and in a moment I was thrust into the center of a swirling green sphere of fractalized tessellations that swam around in a constantly moving sea of infinite complexity. And I knew that this sphere had an outside, and that I was just inside for a while, trying to pick up what I could while I was there. I felt, truly and palpably, that there was an afterlife... or better, an exolife.

During this time I noticed a lot of things that I don't normally pay much attention to, in a serious way. Every single movement of my fingers was palpable, and the vibrations my vocal chords made were so amazingly easy to feel and control that I began to sing, truly feeling as if every note I made was perfect, for my senses were so enhanced musically. As I walked back I found it hard to walk regularly and easily, for the world danced with my footsteps, and with the outer perspective that I had gotten, it took much more concentration to walk normally and act normally, for my mind was much too busy dancing around the gigantic universe it had just discovered. When I got back to the dorm, I found I could type much better, for with my eyes closed I could see a perfect map of the keyboard and how my brain drew the correspondances between finger location and letter typed, and could also spell out long words clearly and quickly in my mind. I put on a pair of headphones and I thought I was listening to some music for a while, but several minutes later I realized I had never started any music in Winamp, and all of the music had been in my imagination, though to my brain it was by then just a vague auditory memory. I thought of Carrie, and was instantly (and still remain) entranced by our excellent night together, and truly felt connected to her and everyone else in a way that seemed very childlike and wonderful... another recalling back to a level of perception I think I definitely had when I was younger and have since forgotten.

Soon, very tired by now (it was around six in the morning), I decided to settle in, and my mind, floating around wanderingly all over the new universe that had found it, eventually faded out of consciousness, and I fell asleep.

I had rented out a lakeside cabin with 16 friends for the weekend.  Typical college-age kids getting drunk and crazy type stuff.  I was just emerging from a period of moderate level depression.  I wasnt taking medication, and my therapist had told me I longer needed to go to therapy sessions.

Now, I dont know if its my brain chemistry or whatnot, but I find myself to be much more susceptible to the effects of cannabis than the next guy.  Im constantly having people tell me theyve never seen somebody act as fucked up from weed as me, and every time, it seems more intense.  I will say that I believe myself to be considerably more creative than the average person.  I wouldnt say I was anti-social, but I tended to keep to myself when I didnt need to.

Whatever the case, on the final night, prior to sundown, Scott and I snuck off behind the cabin and smoked what was left of last nights bowl, which was about half, and to quote Scott, was the bomb ass shit.  I took two or three drags and I was feeling pretty good.  Scott then said itd be cool if we rolled another joint and sat on the pier since the sun was going down, which we did about 20 minutes later.  Immediately after doing this, Sara and Chris found out and asked if they could get in on the action as well, so it was back up to the cabin to pack another bowl, and then back to the pier to smoke it.  I was pretty out of it at this point.  I remember feeling lost in the woods as we trekked back to the pier, even though its only a 5 minute walk.  I joined in on this new bowl, knowing that I really didnt need anymore, but this that weekend was about getting away from it all, and boy did I do just that.  Total, I smoked about a one gaping bowl to myself that night.

First thing I did was lay on my back and look at the stars.  I was immediately hit with the most intense feeling of déjà vu Ive ever had.  Even now, I am certain that the patterns of the stars and the words my friends were speaking were something I had dreamt about several months prior.  I tried to leave my body unsuccessfully.  My friends were worried that I was having a panic attack because I was shaking as I attempted to astral project, but I assured them I was okay.

Because Scott and Chris were drunk to boot, we figured it best to get the hell off of that pier.  I remember walking through the woods back to the cabin and seeing a faint chain-link fence between us and the trees, and having to ask my friends if there was a fence, even though I knew there really wasnt.  My first true hallucination off of weed!  I was pretty excited.  By now my head was being bombarded with a constant flux of images and accompanying sounds.  I believe these were images I used to picture when I was very young laying in bed, that I had long forgotten, I cant say why I think this way, but some other part of me was telling me that, and it came across as very convincing.

I could hear a dog bark reverberating through the woods.  This time I was certain I had dreamt this encounter when I was about 6 or 7 years old.  It was exciting:  Us in the woods, and this angry dog, our adversary, was trying to keep us from getting back to the cabin.  We eventually happened upon the dog.  I immediately realized that the dog was lost, and was barking because he was scared, not angry.  I felt so bad for the dog I began to cry, and Im not the type to normally cry.

Back at the cabin, Chris and I sat in one of the cars and listened to this ambient mix cd Id made for such a purpose.  Sitting there, listening to the relaxing music, I felt so many different feelings, many of which are lost now.  I do remember knowing what if must feel like to die and go to Heaven, if such a place truly exists.  I remember that path to Heaven felt so amazing, I was convinced that no living person could ever truly know what Heaven itself feels like.  Perhaps Heaven is just the end of physical life, when one re-joins his greater consciousness?  I could clearly see the universe as being the offshoot, or even child, of another, larger universe.  I felt like I was almost above being confined by time, constantly traveling to different points in my life, yet still watching the present.  I could feel the music moving through my body.  Not the physical sound waves, but the actual melodies themselves.  It was an amazingly spiritual feeling; very impressive considering Im a borderline atheist.  For the first time, I truly felt like I could climb inside other peoples minds.  I saw the world through some of my friends eyes, and saw how they interpreted the world differently that I.  

Ever since then Ive been much more accepting of other peoples beliefs, ideas, and arguments, because I know their minds all work differently, and nobody is ever going to act just like me.  The most amazing thing was seeing that my entire physical life, from birth to death, was just the tip of the iceberg of my existence.  Im pretty convinced now that who we are extends well beyond these human shells we inhabit.

I confided in Chris how attracted I had found myself to Evans girlfriend since the last two days.  Earlier in the day, the two of us had gone for a walk, and now the whole episode as being even more amazing that when I was sober.  I knew it was wrong for me to lust after her like that, but I knew Id make a better boyfriend for her, and I was certain she felt the same way, but it killed me because I couldnt say anything to her, given the circumstances.  It was no longer even about me, I just wanted her to a have a better relationship.

I felt so much more open, I talked to several of my friends that night, telling them how appreciative I was of their friendships.  I realized I dont call my friends enough, and that the only thing keeping me from being more social was me.  I now saw depression as truly being all in my head.  And I truly had the power to change the way I think.

When it came time for bed, I was in no condition to sleep.  Those images and sounds I mentioned early were still coming fast and furiously.  On top of that I was now dealing with probably the most intense sexual feelings Ive ever had.  It wasnt lustful though.  I didnt want to fuck, I truly wished to make love, for the sexual union of two souls.  Being that I had no female companion for the trip, I snuck off to the bathroom to take matters into my own hands, so to speak.  I easily had the best solo orgasm I could remember.  Somehow I finally drifted to sleep around 3:30

I was the first person up the next morning, at about 7:30 am, feeling incredibly well rested.  I was still a bit high, and I decided to head off to the pier again as I slowly grappled my way back into soberbia.  I was good after about 45 minutes on the pier.  I had enjoyed my trip and taken much from it, but I came to realize that the me whom is clear headed and sober is whom I truly am.  I felt like I was being welcomed home with open arms after a long journey, it was wonderful.  I sat there, overlooking the lake and smiling.  Sometimes you dont realize how good something is until its gone, I had missed being myself immensely by then end of the night.  I had never felt so much love for myself as I did at that moment.  And it wasnt drugs making me happy, it was this new, absence of drugs!

Upon hearing this story, some people tell me the weed was laced, but everyone else who smoked it that night can attest that this is not how it was.  I would recommend to those whove never smoked the herb before that its not always a party drug, for some people its a very spiritual experience, and a party atmosphere will only dampen, and possibly ruin a potential trip.  Try it for the first time someplace quiet, not in public, and with good people.

I've noticed that sometimes people (including me) have a significantly different type of experience than just being stoned after smoking pot. It seems to occur either soon after use of a heavier psychedelic such as psilocybin or LSD or after abstaining from the habit for a while and then returning. It is unrelated to the amount smoked... it can happen from one or two hits. 

I'll describe my own experiences first. The first time was about the sixth or seventh time I smoked pot... I had smoked a lot more than this previously and not had these effects, but this was the first time I'd smoked after a beautiful Mushroom experience that changed my life (in a very good way... I will never be sad again). I was on an ironic spring break vacation with some college friends in Daytona, a city of pure 'genious.' My friend C and I smoked from a water piece on the balcony. The weed was pretty low quality and tasted like shit. I started gagging from some water droplets that had come through the tube (it was a very cheap plastic affair, this piece). I triggered my gag reflex a little and felt like something came up in my throat, but it stayed down and i felt better. Neither of us felt like finishing the bowl, especially since our friends seemed kind of put off by us smoking pot. We went back in and C joined J and J in some sort of card game. 

I was feeling a little disoriented and really disliked the game they were playing, feeling it was a waste of time. I also felt a little bit ousted for my new behaviour, i was still unsure of the validity of my justification for starting to do drugs (this problem disappeared after I realized the beneficial nature of my mushroom trip). Anyway, I was standing in the kitchen watching them play cards and swaying back and forth. Suddenly I realized I was swaying and decided to stop, but everything in the room continued to sway in a very nauseating way. I closed my eyes for a second and then opened them and it was like perspective had gone away and the third demension had disappeared. Everything was flattened like a cartoon, but extremely sharp the way things seem to people before they faint or when oxygen deprived... along the lines of an anxiety attack. Everything was 2-D, but i saw it clearly, so that there were no straight lines and everything was at horribly odd angles and the entire room was tilting. It was too much for me too take and I tried to shake it off but began to feel like I was going to vomit, so I walked to the toilet. 

I realized I didn't really have to, but as I looked at the bowl I heard the sound of someone vomiting. I went back to the table and muttered 'did someone throw up,' knowing that no one did since they were still seated at the table with their cards. They looked at me and said I looked pale. I stood there a little longer. The bottoms of my jeans were folded under my heels and it felt as if my foot was giving away where they were pressing against it -- a feeling like my foot was melting around it, or it was cutting into me. Then I realized that C was functioning fine and playing cards, even though she had smoked the same as me and I panicked and thought something was wrong. I didn't want to admit it though, because I felt J and J would be justified in their disapproval. I was also extremely thirsty and my mouth tasted metallic. I remembered reading something about a metallic taste in the mouth associated with death and I panicked again. I got in bed and started to think that I was going to die. I felt I could feel my organs and see them failing. Then I remembered gagging outside and thought that something had gotten lodged in my windpipe and my brain was starving for oxygen (which makes no sense, I was still breathing fine). 

My friends came over and said again that I looked pale. I didn't respond and just kept lying there hoping it would go away. After about ten or fifteen minutes it did and I felt normally stoned. I laughed off the previous experience, though I had really despaired at the thought of dying in Daytona, another idiot destroying himself for no good reason in the kingdom of fools. I thought I was better but realized we were all just as capable of destroying the fragile thing we have been given. Of course I was never in any real danger, it was all psychological, and I realized this as J and I left the room to explore the nether regions of the hotel. I had a great time exploring the various beer-can littered hallways and kept thinking I was on a boat. 

Another freak out I had was, again, from a small amount of pot i smoked with my girlfriend in my car. After that we went and sat in the park. Everything was fine and i felt good and stoned since I had been smoking nearly every other day for months and had stopped for about a week beforehand. We were sitting at a picnic table in the dark and being quiet as we usually do when stoned (we both have hyperactive brains that turn introspective while stoned, though we analyze the hell out of it all afterwards). There was a tennis court in front of us and the fence leading away from our line of sight at a very small angle so that when a car came toward it, the lights illuminated it and made patterns of light and shadow on the chain links. When I looked at the pattern I immediately saw a Koala bear (though I said panda) chewing on eucalyptus. The image was repeated exactly on each section of the fence. I laughed and told M and she looked and said that she saw the same thing and corrected me, explaining that it was a Koala, not a Panda. Then the bugs were getting to her so we went back to my car. 

Right before we left I looked at a large tree lit up by a park light and saw that the leaves were in the shape of a huge turtle facing downward with the head of an old man staring at me. It was a rather disturbing image and I looked away with a worried sort of laugh. Sitting in my car i felt that it was moving and then expanding and I had the same melting feeling in my limbs. There was no perspective flattening but there was some distortion of proportion. I began looking in the side mirror across from me and saw that it was a sort of screen that was playing images from my subconscious. I've read about this phenomenon occuring in schizophrenics... a sort of vision of uncontrollable thoughts being displayed faster than they can be comprehended. 

I saw many things in the mirror, they were extremely clear and I could see how they were composed of the actual elements that were reflected in the mirror, yet the closer I looked the faster they became other images. They ran a gamut from trains with gaping, fanged mouths, to the faces of old men whose mouths moved at the same time as mine, which were unconsciously muttering everything I was seeing trying to ground myself with M. I had a strong desire to melt into her, feeling that would save me from this strange phenomenon, but the design of the car would not permit it. When I looked away from the mirror I was disconcerted and felt like I had sunk to the bottom of a hole that was very hard to climb out of. I looked forward and the pattern of light on the tree branch in front of my car became a huge wolf with its mouth open lunging at the car. I knew these were hallucinations so the subject of them didn't actually produce fear in me, but the fact that I was having them did. 

I then looked at the branches farther ahead of the car and saw another forest growing up from one of the branches. This was bizarre and very persistent and I tried to see if M could see it, and she couldn't. I was worried because it was extremely realistic and wasn't going away. Finally some more friends showed up and we got out of the car. Once outside I pointed out the branch to everyone and we were all perplexed to see what looked like more trees growing vertically up out of this large branch. I wasn't crazy. I felt a lot better then and everything returned to normal (and stoned).

Now for analysis. I have talked to a lot of people and have heard many people talk about a flattening of perspective. They all describe it exactly the same as mine and I've even found other accounts on Erowid. It's happened to me several times, always the same way, always from pot. I have never been able to observe it for long, because it's very maddening and I feel violently compelled to keep my eyes closed till it stops, which is always fairly quickly. I find it interesting that in some accounts of freaking out on pot people describe things like gaining multiple dimensions or existing in multiple demensions simultaneously. This is the opposite of what I describe, I think. It seems like worthy phenomenon to pursue scientifically and philosophically. Another thing that I have found to be a widespread effect of freaking out is the visualization of internal organs. A friend of mine was very skeptical about drugs and when he smoked pot for the second time he had this happen. He felt very sick and crazy. When he told me about the organs I got excited and told him that the same thing had happened to me once. I have since heard others describe this. 

I wonder if it is psychological or if it is actually an effect of Huxley's idea (not his originally, actually, can't remember the first name... but he popularized it) that the mind is a reducing valve and that while under the influence of psychedelics (a term coined in a letter addressed to him... it means 'showing the mind'), this valve is opened by various degrees to allow more information than is functionally useful during daily life to pass into the brain. I think that freaking out is what happens when one is in an extremely perceptive mood and is suddenly aware of very detailed streams of information usually not available to perception due to the opening of perceptual doors by drugs. The mind's purpose is to mold sensation into perception and the ego functions to form perception into meaning. The mind and ego are not equipped to process all of the information that the brain is capable of sensing and so when they step in to try to process increased ammounts they can malfunction and create delusions. The ego, in particular, can get very insignificant information such as the inner working of the body all mixed up with personal problems and issues. This is when the freakout occurs. 

I'll end with quote from an incredible neurologist named Paul Bach-y-Rita who did experiments proving that each sensory organ could perform, to a certain extent, the function of the other sensory organs... eyes can hear, tongues can see, etc. 'You can do so much more with a sensory organ than what mother nature does with it.'

I have been a pretty big 'stoner' for about two years now.  I had experienced some minor bad trips before, mostly in the form of delusional paranoia.  When I first started smoking weed I always had great experiences, but after smoking heavily for an extended period of time the paranoia began to set in.

The worst experience I have had occured one normal Friday night.  My roommate and I were sitting around bored and consequently decided to smoke a couple bowls. Shortly afterward , she had to leave to go to work, so I was left by myself.  I have been stoned by myself quite a bit before and have always enjoyed it, perhaps even more than when stoned with other people.  Generally I have a great time listening to music, watching TV, and just thinking.  This time, however, was much different.  Soon after my friend left (probably only ten minutes after we finished smoking) my mind began to race with paranoid thoughts.  I was thinking about how worthless I was and how everyone in the whole world is just some sort of selfish animal.  I was pretty sure I had figured out human nature, but I didn't like the conclusion I came to at all.

Then my thoughts started coming harder and harder, until my mind was reeling.  I was thinking so fast that I couldn't absorb anything that was entering my brain.  I felt my heart pounding in my chest, and I felt like I couldn't breathe.  I began to literally gasp for air.  These physical symptoms only made things much worse because it made me realize how messed up I was.  As a result, I convinced myself that I really WAS insane, that this was not the result of some bad trip.  I felt like this was the real me coming through that I had repressed up until this point.  Somehow the pot had given me access to my innermost psyche.

I went to my room and laid down on my bed, hoping to calm down.  But it only got worse.  I felt this incredible blinding pain in my head.  It was like my head was throbbing with agony, and every ten seconds or so all this pain would shoot up to the top of my brain, causing me agony.  I had already turned off the lights, and at this point I wanted to put my head under a pillow with the hope that this would somehow ease my pain.  But I couldn't do it because I was having so much trouble breathing I was sure I would suffocate.  This ordeal lasted for one terrible hour, easily the worst of my life up to this point.  After I had calmed down enough to breathe normally again I fell asleep for the night.  I woke up the next day and felt OK, but the experience has stuck with me.  I can't smoke anymore without worrying that another similar experience might occur.

A lot of people have talked about the value of having a friend around during a bad trip, but having people around me was the last thing I wanted during this experience.  I was terrified one of my roommates, who are both good friends of mine, would come home and find me freaking out.  I figured they would think I was insane and disassociate themselves from me permanently.  I now realize this fear was very irrational: they are very good friends of mine and no doubt would have tried to help me through the experience.  They probably would have been freaked out, but not overly judgemental.  At the time, however, I felt like I was a big fraud, trying to hide my ugly secret (insanity) from the whole world.

I later realized that the phsysical symptoms I had experience were symptomatic of an extreme panic attack.  The weird thing was, I had never had a panick attack before, either high or sober.  I have absolutely no idea what brought this on: the weed I had smoked came from a good source, and my roommate that had smoked with me told me she had a great time.  Furthermore, I have smoked often for a number of years, and have had much greater amounts in one time than I did in this particular instance.

I suspect this was actually a result of a long, slow buildup.  I began seriously smoking pot when I was 18, I am now 21.  At first I always enjoyed smoking and had a fantastic time.  Over the past year or so, however, I have noticed a pattern of more and more paranoid and depressing thoughts when I am high.  I have a number of friends who have experienced the same pattern, but I don't know if it is the result of some sort of predisposition or if it can solely be attributed to the pot.  Either way, if you have been smoking for a while and are experiencing the same pattern I did, I suggest you ease up on the smoking before something catastrophic occurs as it did in my case.

Cannabis - Hash

When I was 19, I tried Cannabis again, after having endured a massive overdose two years earlier [see First High: Massive Overdose at 17]. Again, I was living in Europe, where Cannabis consumers mainly smoke hash. For some reason, all my friends were heavy Cannabis users. I preferred my Cannabis-using technical college friends to the stodgy university students. 

I finally felt one night that surely I could take a tiny hit of Cannabis and be fine with it. So I did, I took a tiny hit off a tiny roach. And I really didnt feel different. We went on a long walk, and returned to a dorm room. I reclined against the wall, on top of a bed, just listening to people talking. My creepy chemist friend who always smelled of ether was lying next to me, tapping the locket I wore around my neck, looking up at me with a mischievous look. And then, completely out of the blue, hitting me like a bolt of lightning, I felt what I have described as a blossom of terror explode in my chest. In retrospect, it was a plain old unprovoked intense panic attack. Im not entirely certain whether the cannabis caused it or if it was a coincidence. But it was suddenly centerstage and what I was forced to deal with. The fear was so mind-numbing, so incomprehensible and big, that I was struck speechless. I considered trying to communicate to my friends what I was experiencing, and dismissed it as impossible. It would only make me feel more alienated than I already suddenly felt. So I bolted out of the room back to my own room. 

Once there, I called up my only other American friend in the dorm and asked her to help me. Thankfully, she was a regular Cannabis user and had done a bit of experimentation with mushrooms, and pretty much knew what was up. She was incredibly helpful, talking in soothing tones and telling me I would be OK. She asked me how she could help. I told her I felt like I was having a heart attack. We decided I would try to sleep and see how I felt in the morning.

Once I turned off the light and tried to sleep, I felt as intensely altered as I had back when I was 17 and massively overdosed. Only this time I was positive that if I fell asleep, I would die. (This pattern has re-emerged during subsequent psychedelic trips.) I had a picture in my minds eye of a shadowy door that was ajar, as if a door in my mind had been prematurely kicked open and subconscious material was leaking through. (This was several years before I heard the phrase, 'the doors of perception.') I had an uh-oh feeling. The muscles around my heart felt clenched and hurt. This pain and fear were worse even than my experience 2 years earlier. In the morning, a doctor came by with a portable EKG machine and declared my heart healthy. This did little to ease my fears. Essentially I was on a hair-trigger, with a fresh panic attack ready to burst open at any moment. Anxiety crowded almost everything else out of my mind for over two weeks. I was barely able to function in class. I was scared to put any medicines in my mouth, for fear that they would alter my body chemistry in a strange and evil way. Finally I went to the doctor and he boredly gave me pills to take; in retrospect they were probably a benzodiazepine anxiolytic. I endured the next few weeks. The panic attacks became less frequent, but I was still on edge constantly, for fear they would come back. It was a vicious cycle. Even just thinking about smoking Cannabis would trigger a funny sensation in the back of my head, like a panic attack beginning to bubble up. Smelling it was even worse. I was wound tight.

When I returned to the States and resumed my regular college life, the panic attacks seemed to melt into a phase of migraines. They felt related. The same sensations would start in the back of my head, but they exploded into intense headache tinged with a sense of loss and fear. I continued to be in mortal fear of smoking Cannabis. Thus began my battle with migraines.

So overall, there was a pattern emerging; I am highly sensitive to Cannabis. It has taken me 12 years to realize to what degree this is true, and how to handle the information.

I feel like much of my searching for meaning in this world has been related to better understanding what exactly happened to me that night, as I lay alone with fear and pain gripping my heart. This may sound overly dramatic, but it really was a reference point for years and years, a looming shadow on my horizon. Now I have integrated the 'terror blossom' and it is a memory with no charge to it. I have reached a point of gratitude, where that trauma is just a thread in the tapestry of my relatively stable and happy life. I think I was being nudged out of a sheltered suburban mindset, out into a mental space where I was forced to think for myself and question consensual reality. But what a journey! I think I would have benefited from access to data like what's posted here on Erowid. But who knows? That's not how my life has gone. This was before the ubiquity of internet.

I had the following traumatic/enlightening experience about 2 months ago.  It's really long, but I think it is very interesting.

I was at a 'party' out in a field, and had a couple beers, nothing enough to even feel.  A friend held up a baggy of weed and a makeshift aluminum foil pipe and grinned.  We lit it up and started smoking.  I noticed no effects until it was almost all gone.  Then i just got real spaced out, stoned feeling, and things started moving like they were under a strobe light.  My friend said he'd had enough and staggered off (he was already pretty drunk), and I finished what was left.  After I finished it all, I kept getting more and more stoned.  All my coordination was gone.  Pretty soon I started seeing a red-violet colored random patterning appear evertime I blinked.  It would last about 1 second and then disappear.  I got into my car to drive back to my house to get something, planning to return.  I had no idea what was in store for me.

As I drove I kept getting more and more disoriented.  I kept realizing that I was fidgeting an unbelievable amount. Then I started rapidly blinking involuntarily.  By the time I got home, it was like my whole body was in hypertension and I was just blinking, writhing, and fidgeting up a storm.  I sat down and tried to calm myself down, and I just started to panic more and more.  I kept catching myself moving my legs and hands(which were really shaking) involuntarily. My blinking had slowed down by now, but every time I blinked, i'd see a bright blue flash. By this time, I could hardly keep a thought in my head for more than a few seconds.  I felt like I was just insane and couldn't think at all.  Then I got all panicked, thinking I might never return to normal. My thoughts kept getting more and more messed up.  My attention span was so short, I could think about something, and it would instantly trail off into a stream of random thoughts. I doubt I was even capable of saying the whole alphabet.  

By now I was completely terrified, and my mind was just a swirling jumble of random thoughts.  This was about 1/2 hour after I had smoked the weed.  My imagination was so vivid, I could see everything I was thinking when I closed my eyes.  The things I was seeing with my eyes closed seemed more vivid than what I'd see when I opened my eyes and saw the real world.  When my eyes were closed, I just saw bright yellow and swirling colors, and occasionally very bizarre things, such as an abominable snowman with globules of cheez-whiz over for eyes which had rapidly revolving black olives for pupils.  I felt like I was in a nightmare with no escape.  I was utterly TERRIFIED that I would never return to normal.  Then crazy thoughts kept jumping into my head, like how I should just kill myself now and not have to deal with insanity/retardation for the rest of my life. 

Eventually I started to feel like I was coming back to normal, but then it would keep coming back in HUGE waves that just completely incapacitated me, even worse than before.  By now, all the fidgeting, etc, was gone.  Every time I'd start to feel better, a huge wave would just hit me like a load of bricks.  Every time it happened, I'd feel and hear my heart start to slow way down.  This was really freaking me out, because although it was probably just a hallucination of some sort, it seemed VERY real to me.  After it happened the first time, I got up and staggered into the next room thinking I should get my mom to take me to the hospital, but I came right back.  As I walked, I could hardly feel my feet touching the floor.  I could just hear my footsteps.  My heartbeat got all fucked up again briefly when I walked, and I felt like I was blacking out. I could hear music from the TV in the background, and I kept thinking, 'Maybe my perception of time is messed up so it seems like my heart's beating slower than it really is', but when I'd listen to the music it was at normal speed.  I thought I would die unless I got to a hospital.  But every time, it started to slow down, it would go back to normal so I figured i'd be ok.  

It kept getting worse and worse.  Every time it would hit me, my vision and all sense of the world would fade away.  I kept praying, because at the time I was sure the weed had been laced with something very powerful and I was fearing for my life. About the 3rd time this happened, I actually felt my heart stop beating.  I hope to god this was just a hallucination!  Everything was cold and black, UTTER black.  I felt like I was in a huge void, and drifting away. I was sure I was dead! I also felt so peaceful, like this is what I really wanted.  Then I thought about all I would be missing out on if I let myself die at the age of 19.  All this happened in about 2 seconds.  I heard an erratic heart beat start again, and then start beating normally, and I was disappointed at first, but after several seconds my vision/consciousness returned.  My eyes had been open the whole time, and as I came out of it, I could see my sight coming back like someone turning up a dimmer switch for the lights in a dark room.  I started to get back to normal again.  

Then ANOTHER wave hit me.  A feeling of spiraling down into sheer terror.  I felt my heart slow down again... this time after pumping weakly for about 2 seconds it returned to normal again, and so did everything else.  This happened one or two more times. This seemed SO REAL I still have a hard time believing it was probably a hallucination/dreamlike thing. I don't remember falling asleep or passing out, I just woke up about an hour later.

I got up feeling sort of weird, really tired and spaced out feeling.  This was about 2 1/2 hours after I had smoked the weed.  I decided to go back to the party, to let them know I was all right, because I had told them I would be coming back.  Then as I was driving, all of a sudden I just started tripping again.  I suddenly became completely disoriented.  I kept thinking I was passing the same spot in the road over and over.  I had no idea where I was.  Then boom, I snapped out of it.  After I got back I was standing around telling some other people about what had happened to me, and all of a sudden I heard rain falling all around me.  I was like 'shit, it's raining!', and everyone just looked at me and said 'That's just someone taking a piss!' (we were in a field).  I swore for all the world I heard rain all around me!  When I drove back about 45 minutes later, I freaked out twice more, I just became totally disoriented, everything looked so confusing, it looked like I was seeing the same thing repeating over and over.  As I drove over the top of a hill, I kept thinking I was about to go off a cliff!  Then I'd just snap out of it as quickly as I'd go into it.  This even happened when I was driving at 4 PM the next day, 18 hours later.  Hasn't happened again since.  

I still don't know if that weed was laced with anything, or if it was just extremely powerful. The other kid that smoked it was bigger than me and didn't smoke as much, and he was violently ill, puking/dry heaving non-stop for a whole hour. 

If I am watching TV and it shows someone dying or something, and they have the sound of a heartbeat slowing down in the background, I get completely terrified.  I was so traumatized by this 'Trip', that I can't even see/hear anything like that without turning into a scared cowering fool.  It's like when a vietnam vet hears a helicopter or something! 

 don't even drink or do any drugs anymore.  That one experience was just TOO intense for me to handle.  I go to sleep every night thinking about it.  It was the worst and best experience of my life, because after thinking I was insane for over an hour, I have learned the IMMENSE value of having a good brain that works.

This was by no means my first experience with Marijuana, but it was by far the most insightful.  In the past, I have been awe-struck by the slow passage of time, or the fleeting moments when I believed myself to be in total understanding of the infinite depth of the universe.  However, this trip was most unusual.

Two friends and I, let's call them D and E, set out the other day to find a mystical environment to smoke up.  We found a small wooded area with a large tree in the center.  Once in the wooded area, we could hardly see the fields around us.  The area was perfect, the sun was out, the birds were singing, the place had the atmosphere of being somewhere in the jungle.

We lit up and soon, as was well anticipated, time slowed down to a crawl and we were thrown into hysterical laughter.  Once the laughter died down, we began to try interesting things.  E began to rapidly blink and let his head sway around on his shoulders.  Becoming a bit nervous, I poked him with a nearby stick to snap him out of it.  He quickly explained that he felt like his head was a tetherball, floating about his body.  Immediately, I said 'cool' and began to do the same thing myself.  I completely understood the feeling.  On a previous trip, E began breaking sticks, claiming that he was super strong.  We all thought he was nuts, but this time I actually understood what he was talking about back then.  E held out a fairly thick stick and I karate chopped it.  I must have hit it so perfectly that my hand seemed to pass right through it.  We began to find bigger and bigger sticks and would be able to chop them in half with the greatest of ease.  Realizing our incredible power, we decided not to try anything thicker for fear that we would seriously hurt ourselves.  The funny thing is, when we all had come down from our trip, our hands didn't hurt.  Weird, no?

D always tends to go internal while tripping so he didn't have too much to say.  However, he did suggest smoking a cigarette while high.  This was probably the best thing I could do.  Cigarettes give you a head rush to begin with.  Now imagine if that blood is tainted with THC.  It all goes to your head and it is an absolutely amazing feeling.  I'd definitely recommend it.

Anyway, perhaps the message behind this account of my experience is that, if you try, you might find it extremely easy to relate to other stoned people's experiences at the time.  I think this is the most rewarding part of being stoned.

Recently I was offered a job that paid significantly more than the one I had most previously. At this point I had been unemployed for a bit over two months. 

Everything was going peachy-keen until I showed up to officially receive the offer. My prospective employer apologetically informed me that they had forgotten to tell me that I was required to undergo a 'drug test' prior to actually starting employment, as required by the company that had recently bought them out. Having been a regular daily cannabis user for the past seven years or so, I figured I was screwed.

After several days of despair and depression, I began researching ways to beat a drug test. I had been provided with a Chain of Custody form, which told me that I was getting a 5-drug urinalysis panel (for cannabis, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and PCP -- the 'NIDA 5', the most common urinalyses). The Web site for the lab where I was to be tested bragged about their adulterant detection skills (I highly recommend researching the tests and the lab prior to any screening!), so I knew that route was out. They even test for glutaraldehyde.

After more research, I formulated a plan using only methods that had been proven to be reliable, with a low margin of error. Being extremely averse to risk with so much cash on the line, I invested $30 in Concentrated Urine (CU) from a fine online merchant, and a few bucks at GNC for B-vitamins and creatine, and CVS for condoms.

The plan was this: Just prior to the test, stop at a restaurant to use the restroom. Mix one vial of CU with piss-warm tap water (3 oz per vial in an unlubricated condom. Tie off the top. Strap to upper inner thigh, wedged against scrotum, with masking tape, to bring the sample to and maintain it at body temperature. This way I could prick the condom and 'naturally' donate 'my sample'. However, in case this substitution was risky (due to observation), I had Plan B. 

Plan B was the usual dilution trick -- drink loads of water. Take a B-vitamin to make the watery pee nice and yellow. Eat some creatine so the lab won't suspect dilution and summarily flunk you (they test for it -- even if you aren't diluting or on drugs, a vegetarian should always eat some creatine before the test). Actually peeing carried a much higher risk, but there were no other options.

I arrived at the lab and did all the paperwork stuff. They looked under my hat to see if I was carrying a substitute sample. (Ha!) I was led to a restroom and told not to flush or turn on the sink until I had donated and handed it over. I was alone and unobserved in the stall. (No Plan B needed!)

I unzipped and pricked the condom, and 'pissed' into the little cup (with a temperature strip on the side of it), making sure to drench all inner and outer surfaces of the cup with piss (take that!). It made a nice realistic pissing noise, and I had enough extra left in the condom to pee some into the toilet ('added touch of authenticity').

I said 'I'm done' and the lady came in and took the cup, scrutinized the temperature, and found it to be normal. A week later I started my job (and have held it a while) so apparently the CU passed the test (for creatine and all). I was alarmed when I mixed it because it doesn't stink -- but it's just really clean pee. I was almost surprised that it worked, figuring that CU might be a scam like those 'detox' products are. It Isn't. This Shit Works.

Pete the Happy Homegrower

1) Amsterdam Sprouts

Peter looked at his books. There were a few of them, he would have to make a list of them later. The seeds that he had placed on a plastic tray filled with moist cotton wool had begun to sprout after a few days, and now they were the ideal length to plant.

They were about 1' long maximum, most of them smaller.

Pete took small drink cups (he had forgotten to buy Jiffy pots) filled with dampened soil of the same composition as the final growing pot. He poked his finger about 3cm into the soil and gently placed the sprout into the hole, head up, and sprinkled soil around it.

The seeds had come from the same variety... but it didn't matter much too him, he was only a hobby home gardener. The best plant would later be singled out to provide seeds for his next crop.

But first, he decided to have a closer look at the earth he was using:

2) The Earth

Peter looked at the bag of potting mix that he had bought. It would supply his plants with nutrients for a while, even though most commercial potting mixes required additional nutrients for his hungry plants. The texture was the primary consideration: It had to drain well and allow air to enter empty spaces so that the roots could breathe oxygen. Too fine a mix would make the soil sticky or soggy, preventing ventilation and promoting the growth of harmful bacteria.

He squeezed a clump of his potting mix: Perfect. If formed a clump when squeezed, and the clod broke up with a slight poke. The last time, the clod had stayed together and he had added soil conditioners.

He had also used some natural soil, which he had had to sterilise. This had been done by placing it in the microwave until steaming. Anaerobic bacteria might have harmed the roots of his plant, and the many insect eggs in the soil had been microwaved away. (The microwaving had taken 5 minutes on high for a microwave-safe container full of earth).

The components he had used in previous mixes were:

FOAM. It holds water trapped between its open cells, but also holds air. He had used pea-sized pieces of foam once, instead of styrofoam.

GRAVEL. In his hydroponics system, only gravel was used: Easy to clean, doesn't wear out, does not lock up nutrients, doesn't cost much. It creates large spaces for air pockets and gices the mix weight. Pete knew that gravel containing limestone should not be used.

LAVA. Lava was a very good medium on its own or in a mix, Pete knew. It is porous, holds some water on its surface... By itself, Pete felt it was a bit too dry. One frined of his had mixed 3 to 6 parts of Lava with one part of wet vermiculite. The vermiculite had broken up and coated the lava, creating a medium with excellent water-holding abilities and plenty of air spaces. This had to be watered from the bottom in order not to wash all the vermiculite away.

PERLITE. Puffed volcanic glass. Peter sighed. It was not a bad material, but the dust could harm the lungs and he had not wanted to buy a mask and respirator.

ROCKWOOL. A friend of Pete's had told him that he had achieved a phenomenal growth rate using rockwool. It absorbs water like a wick, and is convenient to use. It could be used in all systems, but Pete thought it was most often used for hydroponics.

SAND. Pete used this to add some weight to his planting mixture. It promotes drainage and keeps the mix from caking. It came in several grades, and all of them seemed to work. The sand to use was usually quartz. Peter avoided limestone sand because limestone raised the pH, causing micronutrients to become unavailable for the plant. Sand also had to be salt-free, Pete knew: Salt was bad for your plants.

STYROFOAM PELLETS. Pete's old chemistry teacher had called Styrofoam a 'hydrophobic' material: It repelled water and was an excellent soil mix ingredient. It allowed air spaces to form in the mix and kept the soil from clumping, since it does not bond with other materials or itself. The only problem was that it was so light that it tended to travel to the surface of the mix. Peter used Styrofoam pieces no larger than a pea in fine- textured mixes.

VERMICULITE. Pete tended to use the larger sizes of this material, which is processed puffed mice. Mice? Ah, Mica. Vermiculite broke down into smaller particles over time, Pete knew, and the larger ones provided more aeration. When he had used it, he had wet it before using it to avoid breathing inthe dust.

The book he had just read had included a list of conditioners. A one- part-in-ten mix of cow manure was excellent and would break down over the growing season. Chicken manure was very fast-acting, and Pete used a one-in-20 mix. Blood meal, dried blood, worm castings, guano and even hair and feathers were included in that book... he would have to have another good read of it later.

Ah, the miracle of Life. Peter sighed and took another deep drag on his hand-rolled cigarette. The sun was the best light for plants, but his shaggy apartment had no large windows and not even a balcony, and certainly no garden. His few plants were in a back part of the cellar. As he went down, carrying lamps and foil, he could hear a helicopter circling nearby, and praised the Law Enforcement Agencies who kept dangerous criminals at bay.

He had heard of thugs with rifles, dogs and bulletproof vests, who had shot people and harrassed them because of a small herb garden. 'Murderers', he thought, and was glad that the friendly police force was always ready to help and protect the citizens of this country. 'To serve and protect'! He started whistling his national hymn as he went down the stairs.

3) Can You See The Light?

The garden was a small section of the cellar. The walls had been painted white, which was a very reflective colour and worked about as well as aluminum foil. Heavy foil, hung in vertical strips, sealed the area off and reflected light back towards his baby tomatoes.

Light requirements varied with the vriety of plants. During the growth period, 1000 - 1500 lumen per sq ft would do, although the plants could use as much as 3000 lumen/sq ft effectively. The equatorial varieties tended to need brighter light. During flowering, the various plnats would need between 2000 (the indian variety) and 5000 (equatorial) lumens.

Peter set his camera for ASA 100 and the shutter for 1/60 second, with a 50mm ('normal') lens. He then set the f-stop, using the manual mode, and looked at the chart.


1/60 second, ASA 100
F-Stop          Footcandles
f.4             64
f.5.6           125
f.8             250
f.11            500
f.16            1000
f.22            2000

1/125 second, ASA 100
f.4             128
f.5.6           250
f.8             500
f.11            1000
f.16            2000
f.22            4000
 

Incandescent bulbs and quartz halogen lights were too inefficient to provide enough light - Pete recalled having read that they only convert around 10% of the energy to light. Peter was on a low budget and could not afford professional growing lamps, so he used fluorescents. They were easy to set up, were 3 to 4 times as effective as incandescents, and his plants grew well under them.

A minimum of 20 watts of fluorescent light per square foot would be necessary, Pete had read somewhere, and he knew that the more light his plants would receive, the faster and bushier they would grow. Light also improved the tomato buds, making them heavier and more developed. For each foot of width of his garden, he would use two fluorescent tubes. He had achieved the best results by using a mixture of tubes with various shades of white light. The light was fixed to a movable bar that could be lowered, and he had carefully mounted reflectors. More fluorescents were mounted on the walls for side-lighting.

He had read about metal halide and sodium vapor lamps... maybe sometime, when he had more experience.

There were plants, he had read, that measured the amount of daylight per day in order to 'know' the season, thus determining when to flower. As the periods of darkness become longer, a certain hormone level builds up and the vegetative growth stops - and flowering begins. Different varieties of the same species of plant would need different amounts of light/darkness to flower.

For this purpose, he had an automatic switch that he could adjust to turn the light on and off.

He would let the plants grow under 18-24 hours of light for the first period, he thought. Say, 18 hours of light a day for 3 1/2 months. Then, 12 hours a day for a while, to create autumn, and 1 1/2 months later his plants should be flowering. The full period of flowering might take as long as two months.

A friend had claimed that days shortened to 9 hours a day of light had brought plants to flower within 6 weeks of germination... they had been rather small though, all flower and not much of that either.

The cutback from 18 (or more) to, say, 12 hours a day had been quite aprupt, Pete thought. He marvelled at the ingenuity of the plant, who had responded to the new regimen without any problems., without showing signs of shock or unusual growth. After a month of flowering, he usually set the daylight period to be another hour shorter, especially in equatorial plants.

Also, Peter usually removed male flowers immediately... The female tomato flower tasted much nicer in his herb tea. The desexing was done carefully, as even the female sometimes grew male flowers. One plant would be set aside - the healthiest one - and its flowers dusted with pollen to make seeds. 

Peter checked the thermometer. Moderate, that was OK. Although the plant could withstand hot weahter and cool climates, it grew best between 60 and 85 degrees. Strong light and low temperatures seemed to make the plant smaller, while moderate light and high temperatures seemed to make it higher. Peter had installed a fan to provide his plants with CO2 and to keep the temperature down. The fan was operated by a timer switch: 10 minutes every hour.

Cannabis





BODY WEIGHT:

I am a regular smoker-- I smoke a bowl or two every couple of days. Because of this, I was not expecting such an intense, almost unbearable high when I smoked a bowl last night to facilitate sleep. 

I smoked in the bathroom, with the shower on so no one would be able to smell it. My highs lately hadnt been doing much for me due to THC tolerance, so I made sure to breathe each hit deep into my lungs. I wasnt keeping track of how many hits Id taken, but I noticed something very strange about my surroundings that Id never noticed before about halfway through the bowl. This was not the usual distortion I experience while high; it was much more blurry andI dont know, it just felt a lot different. My pipe looked enormous. I decided I was too high to smoke the entire thing.

I barely made it back to my room, and quickly checked the clock when I did (I always enjoy the surprise of time dilation). Only ten minutes had passed. 

When I am high, I always become paranoid that Ive burnt some eyelashes or part of my eyebrow off, so I checked the mirror. I spent five whole minutes looking into it, and still couldnt decide whether Id singed anything or not. I then became distracted by just how red my eyes were. I saw the rivers of blood and their tributaries running over my eyes. I found this beautiful, and laid back in my bed and closed my eyes, smiling about it. 

All of a sudden, this tidal wave of electricity began to run through my body, like a wheel of fortune, spinning slowly until the wave was constant, moving from head to toe. I jumped up. What the fuck was that?! I asked myself. I realized that I hadnt even let the whole wave cover me. After Id worked up a little courage, I closed my eyes again. I felt the tiny waves coming in with the tide, and washing away from me ever so slightly. It felt like marrow was being stolen from my bones- like I was the ocean, attempting to hang onto the cliffs just a little bit longer. Then, I felt the beginning of the climax of larger waves. It really was like someone was spinning a wheel and I was inside of it. They kept increasing, and I wasnt sure if Id be able to handle it. 

Though I was extremely uncomfortable, I kept my eyes closed for experiences sake. I was breathing very rapidly, and as the most intense wave washed over me, my breathing stopped and I thought my heart might beat itself to death. This wave experience was akin to having an orgasm, but less pleasurable. This wave experience was akin to having an orgasm, but less pleasurable. It's hard to articulate the strength of this wave orgasm, but it really was overwhelming. I felt like screaming, but I knew the waves would go away only when they felt like it. 

I began to worry about my eyelashes again, though a tiny voice was saying, youre stupid, you dont need to check again. I could barely sit up without feeling nauseous, but I eventually found the mirror. I laid back again and held the mirror above me. I couldnt decide whether I was pretty or not. I began assessing my appearance, inspecting my face and body for flaws.

This is the weirdest part about the high. The nonsense word umph kept running through my head in place of other words, and it was really hard to refrain from laughing about it. My internal speaker sounded like it was mumbling youmaybeumphbutmaybeumphly and it kept doing that for the ten minutes or so that I examined myself. In fact, there was more than one speaker, and they were all telling me different things in this nonsense language. I think I finally concluded that it was my red, squinty eyes that were making me look ugly. 

As soon as I stopped concentrating on any task, the sensation of being electrocuted would come over me. I wanted to get up and go on the internet so I could talk to anyone at all. Being alone was almost scary, and I really wished I had someone next to me to at least calm me down. 

I got up, and my legs were shaking and bursting with electricity. I noticed the time. Only twenty minutes had passed. As I reached for the doorknob, I almost fell over. I knew that Id have to be bed-ridden until I started to come down a little. I became lost in my thoughts. I wondered if I was this high every time I was high and just never felt it because being around other people took some of the weight off of me. 

Umph umph umph no umph you have never umph been this umph high, said the voice. 

I sat on my bed with my head between my legs, wishing the sensations would weaken, making it a fun high instead of a confining high. Though I wasnt particularly enjoying myself, its not that I didnt find what I was feeling interesting. I thought it was great. It was like seeing the world again. It was just that I was taking in a lot more than I was used to. 

When I could finally function, I was too tired to go downstairs. I was also hungry, and took solace in the munchies, one of the only familiar things about this high. I ate leftover popcorn and three granola bars. They tasted like candy. I remember watching a TV show, but couldnt follow the plot. I also recognized the amplification of taste and overall bleariness, which made me feel a little better. I was now coming down, but I still felt as high as I usually feel when I smoke. 

The high wore off nearly completely after the show. I got ready for bed, and then slept perfectly, getting to bed at 10:40 pm, when my goal had been 11. When I woke up this morning, I felt radiant. I have certainly never been so high in my life, and though I would hate to be that high every time I smoke, Im still really glad I experienced it. I might like to again at some point, under better circumstances. I think the weed gods may have been making up for my unimpressive first time.

Two Cannabis Experiences

I would like to start this report with a quote from William Burroughs:

Arab music has neither beginning nor end. It is timeless. Heard for the first time, it may appear meaningless to a Westerner, because he is listening for a time structure that isn't there [...] It is interesting that the drug of Islam is hashish, which affects the sense of time so that events, instead of appearing in an orderly structure of past, present and future, take on a simultaneous quality, the past and future contained in the present moment.

William Burroughs, Interzone

First Experience:

This was the first time I smoked cannabis in many years, and through a bong. My mindset was one of relative calm, with a desire to gain spiritual insights, and a general openness to the experience. I took it in my room, with calm music on.

At first I felt giggly, then more intense sensations, feeling my skin more sensuously, eating with more gusto and spontaneity, less inhibited, and looser in my being. These I suspect are common effects of cannabis. But what was more profound for me was what was going on for my thoughts. 

It was as if I was hyper-alert to each thought as it came, and as it did come, it was as if some hyper-acceleration cleaned or swept it away. For example, I thought, Im not sure about my job situation, and then, it was as if this new coating on my thoughts said, Yes, okay, youre not sure about your job situation, thats okay; its okay to be uncertain, move on. And then, to whatever other thought arose, the same thing happened.

And I remember thinking about more morbid things for some reason, such as death, but still, the same thing happened, which was most reassuring, Thats okay. I am what you might call a deep thinking person, and am trying to get with the whole meditation, live-in-the-now vibe, and it was as if the cannabis enhanced this, made it manifold.

There is definitely something about a speeding up of motion, that seems to bypass the problem of getting caught up in my thoughts, and the ambivalence and anxiety that ensues. It is a kind of peace, a playfulness. I also had a sort of image-sensation of kaleidoscopic, enhanced movement, where an amazing, beautiful pattern played in front of me as I went out for a walk, with a new buoyancy to my step.

Second Experience:

Another time I took cannabis, I smoked two nuggets. I did not mean to smoke so much, but had trouble separating a nugget and so just chose to smoke them both. It was a substantially larger amount than taken previously. 

The experience was significantly different to the previous one described above. The experience was significantly different to the previous one described above. My perception of myself, my surroundings, and ultimately, time, was altered. First, the cannabis made me feel kind of loved up, giggly, sensual in my skin, but then things changed.

I sat on my bed cross-legged, and looked at my legs. There were no hallucinations or distortions in what I visually saw, but things just didnt feel normal. I went into the kitchen, and to the fridge to eat part of a muffin, the muffin tasted intense, more recognised through the senses, as has been the case when I have eaten before whilst stoned or on magic truffles. But then I looked around me, at my furniture, and things just didnt feel right, or normal as I was used to them.

Whenever I moved from one place to another  the kitchen to my bed or the bathroom  I was intently aware of this movement. I suppose in a sense it was as if I was experiencing these simple, day-to-day movements as if they were new. I sat on my bed for a while longer, still very freaked out by it all. Because it was such a new experience, I wanted to check my sanity, reassure myself that things were okay, so I would frequently check my watch on my mobile phone to see that I could understand things and that time was ticking by as it always did!

Those who have used psychedelics or cannabis before would likely label this a bad trip. I decided to lie in bed, as I was paranoid that I might do something strange or my neighbour would notice something. As I lay in bed, I frequently got up to go and urinate  whether this was a nervous reaction or I was very hydrated Im not sure. After a while, I felt an exquisite sense of release and elation. As I left the bathroom and got back into bed, I felt the softness of the bed, my head on the pillow, the womb-like cosiness of it, intensely, as if, again, for the first time. This in itself was a heavenly feeling, particularly in contrast to the strange, unfathomable one previous. It felt as if I had gone through something, or more, got through it and reached the finish line. 

I also felt a kind of love for myself in this elated moment. Perhaps a pure, sensory feeling that we all feel in early life, maybe when a baby or a child, but quickly lose touch with. This was very profound to me.

Prior to my first experience with weed I have used nutmeg three times, twice with severe negative effects. I also don't drink and have had no other drug experience. 

I have always wondered what being 'high' was like. Ironically, ever since I completed the 7th grade D.A.R.E. program my view on drugs has been positive. I had sworn to myself for years that I would never drink or do drugs because they were 'wrong' and would totally screw up my life as my D.A.R.E. officer had told me in 6th grade. However, after reading the posters in my health classroom and seeing their idea of the negative effects of marijuana, I began to realize what they were telling me was a load of bullshit and I began to question. Instead of reading the D.A.R.E. material they provided me, I decided to turn to the internet. I read many unbiased articles and finally figured out the truth, Marijuana is not what they say it is. I now find it funny that the kids in my D.A.R.E class who aced the class (like me) have now ALL done drugs one time or another. The kids who are still opposed to drug usage all got Cs in the class.   

When I was in middle school only a select few students were known drug users, none of which I was friends with. The possibility of me getting weed was not feasible. After reading online about nutmeg, I decided to give it a go. I now regret this immensely and blame it for a large portion of my paranoia. This first time I megged it was a beautiful experience. I had taken it the night before at around 9pm and woke up the next morning in a dream like state. It was beautiful. I went to school the same day and was constantly forgetting things. I asked a kid in my science class what time we had math. He looked at me with a puzzled expression and said, what? We just had math last period. I still didnt remember but agreed with him and replied oh yeah, wow Im dumb. 

The next two times I took nutmeg were horrible. I had taken the same amount (2 tsp) but with a new bottle this time, rather then the one I had previously used that had been sitting in my pantry for over four years. I megged both times the night before and woke up totally fucked out of my mind. It wasnt a good high though. I puked multiple times and was high as shit for at least eight hours both times. I had extreme cotton mouth and a racing heart that was beating out of my chest. The last time I megged, nearly two years ago now, I even contemplated telling my mom what I had had done and telling her to call an ambulance. Afterwards I was very happy I didnt. For the next week my heart would beat out of my chest every time I would do anything remotely athletic. 

Up until about April 14th of this years school year, I did absolutely nothing illegal or mind changing. Although I hadnt forgotten about drugs, I had pretty much given up because none of my friends had access to drugs and I had no wishes of ever doing nutmeg again. In the beginning of April however, my best friend was introduced to weed and became a regular smoker. After a couple failed attempts at smoking together (our plans didnt work out for one reason or another) we finally got our shit straight and she invited me over on a Saturday afternoon. 

After admiring the little baggy of what she told me was a gram and a half (I had never seen weed in person before) we decided to head out.  We took turns taking hits (around seven each) and she became very high. Her eyes drooped and she looked incredibly tired. I on the other hand felt nothing and was pissed off because I wasnt even going to get high my first experience with weed. I was sitting on a rock at the time and looked down to swipe away a bug beneath me while it was her turn. As I brought my head up to take another hit, it hit me out of nowhere. I was high. I had never felt anything like this before. As I brought my head up to take another hit, it hit me out of nowhere. I was high. I had never felt anything like this before. I was speechless and couldnt form words. I was frightened and couldnt even make words to tell my friend what was happening to me. She nudged me again and told me to take another hit. I did so but didnt want to. My mouth wouldnt make words to tell her no. I ended up taking one more hit then finally figured out how to say no. IIIIIm done. I said in a slow slurred voice. She told me she was too and we went to stand up. As I stood up the high hit me even harder. I felt like I had bug eyes and more peripheral vision. I stumbled across the rocks and finally figured out how to walk straight. I was not enjoying this and told myself I would never smoke weed again. 

We walked down the sidewalk together smelling each others hair to see if we smelled like weed. I imagine we looked incredibly strange to oncoming cars. All of a sudden I screamed. Her friend had beeped his horn at us. This scared me immensely as my super-charged heart nearly popped out of my chest. My chest was warm then, I could feel it in my lungs and throughout my face. It was not at all normal and obviously from the weed. 

By this time I was starting to calm down a bit but was still only able to form simple sentences with slurred speech. I sounded like someone who was just learning English. My friend had the munchies so we decided to go into our local fast food restaurant and get something to eat. When we were in line waiting to order I spotted a girl I knew from one of my classes. I couldnt tell if it was her or not so I stopped and stared at her. She looked at me strangely but I didnt realize what I was doing could be considered odd. My friend decided not to order and told me we were leaving. I continued to stare at the girl as I slowly walked out of the restaurant. Walk faster! my friend told me. I didnt realize how slow I was going. I must have looked ridiculous. 

We then decided to go and get something to drink because I had extreme cotton mouth. I was afraid I wasnt going to be able to pay for my water and practiced what I was going to say over and over again in my head. When I finally reached the man at the counter I quickly handed him a five dollar bill and said thank you. He looked at me strangely. I had the water in my other hand below the counter where he couldnt see it. Give him the water. My friend reminded me. He rang me up and looked at me strangely as I left. 

The water tasted so good in my mouth but the cotton mouth wouldnt go away. We decided to go buy sodas instead. The soda machine was a whole other complicated problem. I couldnt find the place to put the money in. I ended up jamming my dollar into the side of the soda machine against the hard plastic. If anyone had seen me they would have known something was wrong with me. My friend insisted that there was no place to put bills in but I saw it, it was right in front of me. Suddenly it disappeared and I gave up.  I bought a diet coke in the machine next to it. The coke however was impossible to drink. I sipped only about a teaspoon of it and it exploded in my mouth. It was way too bubbly and wouldnt go down with my dry tongue. Throughout the night I kept forgetting things my friend had just said to me and would forget what I was saying mid-sentence. 

My friend was still hungry so we decided to go to the grocery store and put in eye drops while we were there. The bathroom at the grocery store was a white room with white tile. This scared me. I felt like I was in the movie 1408 and would never escape the room. I needed to leave the room. The floor started to move in a curvy motion like a snake. I was so relieved to finally leave the bathroom. Inside the grocery store, my friend decided to go get some food. We were standing in front of the goldfish when she declared, I want goldfish! right next to an elderly man. Wheres the goldfish aisle? she asked me. I shrugged my shoulders. I still couldnt make words to tell her they were right in front of her. (she later explained to me she was looking for the flavored goldfish rather then the original ones in front of her)

We decided it would be best that we start heading home because it was approaching 9:30pm and we had smoked at 6pm. This was strange because we were both incredibly high and we should have come down an hour and a half ago. 

We finally got back to her house around 10pm and I was still very high. I was very frightened I wasnt going to be able to handle myself in front of her parents. When we walked in the door they were both sitting in front of the T.V. she talked to them for a quick minute and I didnt say anything. Hey her mom said to me. I had forgotten to greet her parents, something I always do. We went upstairs and listened to music I would never let myself be seen listening to. Oddly I enjoyed it as I closed my eyes and concentrated on the rhythm. I felt incredibly tired and like gravity was pushing down on me extra hard. We decided to watch T.V. I think we were watching Saturday Night Live but I still dont remember. I fell asleep soon after she put it on. When I woke up around 11pm I had finally come down. I didnt feel normal but I definitely didnt feel the same way I had an hour ago. 

When I woke up the next morning wasnt high anymore but I felt different almost nervous. I felt like this the entire day. 

I have smoked weed once since this experience but I smoked a lot less. Unlike my first time, I was able to talk and function and had a wonderful experience.  I have smoked weed once since this experience but I smoked a lot less. Unlike my first time, I was able to talk and function and had a wonderful experience. I will definitely smoke again but never as much as I did the first time and I feel I am stable enough to. 

I still blame my first horrible experience with weed on nutmeg. I felt very similar to the way I did during my nutmeg high. Ever since my nutmeg experience I easily freak out and would not recommend nutmeg to anyone who is not an experienced drug user.

It was a quiet, fall evening and I had just sneaked outside of my parents house to indulge in some of the dankest nug I had ever encountered.  The herb was covered in crystals and smelled skunkier than anything I had ever been around before.  Outside of the garage, I loaded my McGuiver-style Gatorade water-bong and began one of the most intense cannabis journeys of my life. It was about midnight, and a full moon hung in the sky; an omen of good times to come.  As I lit the bowl, the only thing that flared across my excited mind was that I hadn't been ripped for almost a month, and that this was probably going to be one of the most astounding trips I had even encountered.  

After blazing two and a half bowls I sat down on the cement outside of my residence and waited for the stuff to kick in. A glittering 'screen' of visuals suddenly covered my peripheral vision and clouded whatever was right in front of my eyes.  My body felt as if it was floating, then falling into an abyss that seemed neverending.  I didn't mind.  I stumbled into the garage and - as stealthily as I could - wandered up to my bedroom.  After laying down on the fouton, I pumped up some 'comfortably numb' by Pink Floyd, and just went along for the ride.  When I closed my eyes, a completely different world floated before me.  Alien, globular lifeforms marched in swarms about a vast desert; then a sudden shift of wind and I was in heaven, looking down upon the vastness of our Earth as everyday people worked their daily lives.  Suddenly, an explosion and I was in space; floating lifelessly towards the sun.  I had no idea simple pot could do this to me!  I had tried 'shrooms before and witnessed visions of splender, but never on weed!  I opened my eyes and the floor was covered with flowers, then a blink of the eye and they were gone.  Every light socket I looked at exploded with red bolts of lightning, electricity soaring into the space before it.  Looking at my ceiling, I realized that it wasn't the ceiling, no, it was the floor! I was floating on top of my room looking down, but up at the same time into a void that seemed to spin as the fan in its center whirled aimlessly.  I closed my eyes again and a being came to me.  It was white with bright blue eyes, fingers like ropes reaching out to me.  I reached for them as well.  When we made contact, the world froze and I was in a forest with the being.  It spoke, simply saying 'do not worry. The world as you see it will end eventually, but will begin again; with me'.  

I suddenly woke up and it was morning.  I was still lying on my fouton, staring at the ceiling, but feeling no effects of the herb anymore.  I have no idea what this experience means, if anything, or if my nug was laced.  But all I can say is that I have never again experienced such visions on marijuana, and never plan to again.  I dont know if it was the pot or the mindset, but whatever it was, that experience wildly changed my feelings on life as I know it.

This is a story of my process learning to inhale from a vape properly, and accidentally getting uncomfortably baked in Jan 2018.  

TL;DR -

If you just want to read about me getting baked, skip to 'Getting Baked'. 

If new recreational consumers want a soft-landing into cannabis, in addition to following the common 'start low and go slow' wisdom, start with a 1:1 CBD:THC product, either in a vape-cartridge or soft-gel. This can give one a taste of the relaxation and lightness without the potential for racing or anxiety from a THC dominated product. 

If one coughs at all (or alot), it's because one are taking the 'hit' in the throat and bronchial tubes, where it's poorly absorbed and mostly just causes coughing reflex. On can take a smaller hit, and chase it with a deep deep inhale of clean air to take it all the way into the lungs. If one do this, one will not feel *any* urge to cough, and one will get much more absorption. One should be careful, as this makes it much easier to inhale too much.

If one is looking for the safest ways to consume cannabis, it's edibles or vaping and stay away from water bongs and bubblers. The MAPS inhalation studies showed that water and ice bongs, while making the smoke more comfortable, actually produce the highest and least healthy tar-to-thc ratio. 

Practice a basic 'mantra meditation' for a few minutes first. It's basically repeating a non-meaningful sound to oneself over-and-over in your head. (I use 'ayam', like 'i am', but you can use 'ohm' or anything you want). If ones thoughts bother one when high, one could just mantra meditate. 

The portability of the PAX Era system is really nice, but I prefer the vaping experience, better cartridge selection, and economics of the standard 510 cartridges with a variable voltage vape pen battery set to low. 

* How I decided to try it...

I'm a mid-40s successful computer programmer with very young kids and a wife. The only legal infraction I've ever been given is a speeding ticket. The most illegal thing I've done was pirating computer software when I was a kid, in the 1980s. When I drink alcohol, I generally only have 1-2 drinks, as too much alcohol first makes me tired, then startles me awake in the night. The last time I was drunk was more than a decade ago.

I have several life-long friends who smoke occasionally (1-2 times a week, normally on the weekends), and so I'd taken a few hits before. The first few times were in my mid-20s (near 2000), and I didn't feel anything. (in hindsight I think I was inhaling improperly) One of my pot smoking friends took it as a challenge, and when he got some really good stuff months later, he called me to try it. I was probably 28y/o when he got me stoned. We were sitting in the dark, and I remember not being able to complete sentences. It was a curious feeling, but not something I would intentionally repeat. 

With California legalizing medical cannabis 10+ years ago, and recreational cannabis as of Jan 1 2018 (a month ago), it's much more available. At a big gathering we threw, a long time pot smoking friend brought a joint and a friend who would never have touched it while it was illegal had a pack of edibles. I took a hit and ate a 5mg indica edible. It made me buzzed enough to be happy, laughing, and a little more fun than usual that night. Later, I decided I liked it much better than being buzzed on alcohol, and since pot was legalized, I got curious to buy some myself. 

I'm a very calculated risk taker and a quick study. Before I went to a dispensary, I read as much as I could about cannabis. 

Addiction rates being low is good, though that's not my primary concern. I've had lots of doctor prescribed hydrocodone (for kidney stone pain) and benzodiazapines (for sleep), with no abuse patterns. Being in my 40s, the negative effects on the adolescent brain (and life patterns) are not a personal concern for me. The possible correlation with mental illness exaggeration is more worrisome, as I've struggled at times with anxiety and depression, and tried many prescribed psychotropics. After a bunch of research I couldn't find any 'smoking gun' here with cannabis and mental illness. 

I'm certainly not one to regularly inhale burned tar and carcinogens, and I didn't think vaping would fly around my wife, so I thought edibles would be the way to go. I went on a field trip to a super-posh over-priced dispensary. It was actually pretty intimidating, as there was a huge 4 page printed menu, and all the product was hidden from view. I picked up some edible Valhalla gummies and a disposable hmbldt calm vape pen (which I didn't know at the time was 10:1 high CBD). At home, I took a couple hits off the dose pen and felt something so mild I wasn't sure if I felt anything. 

That night I had a conversation with my wife about this all, and her opinions turned out  different than I thought. She was terribly against the gummies, and most forms of 'kid appealing' edibles. Even though I keep mine in a locked-safe (with my ibuprofin), she still doesn't want laced kid candy in the house. Her preference was for me to take capsules, so if the kids are ever aware of it, it's just medicine. She isn't thrilled about vaping, as she doesn't want our kids ever see it and then grow up wanting to emulate this. However, our 6 year old wouldn't know what to do with a vape device, so she considered that much safer than a package full of sweet candy that would send a kid on an hours long traumatic high. She also pointed out two friends we have who are true medical cannabis consumers, swearing by it for anxiety, and supported my exploration. She expressed concerns about the safety of products in this 'new' market. 

* Toes in the water, dispensary visit #2

A couple times in the first week I took half an edible in the evening (5mg of indica). The effect was mild, but noticeable. I'd describe it as a lightness which is part relaxation and part tingling. I realized I have to take it much earlier than I thought, because it takes 1-2 hours to even have an effect, and then the effect lasts a super long time.  I also tried the dose pen a little. I didn't get much from it.

The experience made me really curious, and I flew back into research mode. 

I found out that the dose pen is 10:1 CBD, and extremely small cost-inefficient doses. I learned more about the long delay and duration of edible effects, and that they tend to make you more sleepy than inhalation. I also learned just about everything I could learn about vaping. The different forms of waxes and oils, the different extraction methods, and the wide array of devices. 

I read up on cannabis legalization and product testing. California has tough standards for mold and pesticides, but lacks the testing facilities to enforce it immediately, so they gave dispensaries a 'free pass' to sell anything they have until July 2018. I found some dispensaries that claim to only sell mold and pesticide tested products, and made a list of which oil concentrate producers that publish test results or at least make strong testing claims, and which have been found contaminated. 

Armed with all this new information, I decided I want to try a 510 oil cartridge, the pax era, and a dab pen. I ordered a Linx Hypnos Zero online, and I'd pick up the other two at a local dispensary. 

I found out that the high end posh dispensary not only had ridiculous markup, but also had very little product selection. I visited a much more down-market (one could say seedy) recreational dispensary. Ignoring the dreary location, I actually found it much better than the posh place. All the product was laid out in plain sight, so it was easier to wrap my head around. When I asked about absolute extracts cartridges, the 'budtender' just put all the cartridges on the counter and went through each one, explaining the differences. It was much more helpful and less intimidating than the posh fancy place. 

I ended up getting two abx carts, two kurvana carts, a 510 battery, and 2 pax era cartridges. They were out of the pax era devices, so I went to another dispensary and got a Pax Era, 2 more pax carts, and a 0.5g shatter. If that sounds like alot, it's just because I'm not at all financially constrained, and wanted a bunch of different stuff to try without having to make another hour trip to a dispensary. It was under California's 8g of concentrates per day, which honestly seems like an insanely high limit considering how little it eventually took to get me super baked.  

* Learning to vape

With the new stuff, I shifted gears and started trying to learn to vape. First I tried the Pax Era Legion of Bloom Lavendar, hitting it, then waiting, then hitting it again. I found it pretty harsh, and mostly just coughed a lot. I didn't feel much. A different day I tried the absolute extracts OG Kush. I liked the lighter draw, but still coughed alot. After a couple hits, I felt a little something, but not much.

I didn't understand two things. Why I wasn't feeling much, and why I was coughing so much. Time for more research.

I watched vaping videos on youtube, and watched experienced vapers cough and cough and sometimes edit out their '10 minutes of coughing'. That was no help.

I found lots of conflicting experiences, some claiming vaping didn't get them as high as smoking, others claiming vaping was more potent. I tend to trust science, and the science says vaping can deliver higher doses, so I concluded I must be doing it wrong. I read about Mouth to Lung vs Direct Lung inhales. I tried to execute them, but I still coughed. 

Then I stumbled upon the article that would teach me how to vape without coughing, and inadvertently get me super high.  Basically, it explained that what one wants to do is draw to create the vapor (with either mouth suction, or inhalation), and then chase it with a giant column of *fresh* air to get the vapor deep into the lungs. I've read in other articles that THC absorbtion is small in the mouth and throat, so this made sense to me. I must not have been getting the vapor far enough into my lungs. 

* Getting Baked

I set out to try the new technique. First I tried Mouth to Lung. It was complicated. Once I ended up swallowing rather than inhaling. Then I tried direct inhalation. Using the abx 510 battery and OG Kush cartridge, I took a gentle draw for ~3 seconds, then chased it with as much fresh air as I could inhale. I felt a warm gentle sensation in my lungs (the hit), but absolutely zero coughing. There wasn't even an urge to cough to suppress. I was so surprised, I did it again, just proving to myself it wasn't a fluke. (I might have even done it a third time?) 

I was really really satisfied at having vaped without any coughing or discomfort. I took that small victory and decided to see how it went. I went back to my computer, where I was playing PUBG with real-life friends online. At some point later, I started feeling kind of woozy and lightheaded, and realized something was definitely happening. I suddenly felt a little uncoordinated in the game, a bit like being really drunk, except I wasn't mentally foggy like being really drunk. I think my friends said something about having to go. It was after midnight, I was tired, and I could tell I was getting high, so I said goodbye.

When I stood up, my entire body felt light. Like I was filled with helium. It was really weird, but really neat. I was actually pretty tired, so I made my way to our guest room, so as not to wake my wife. I felt a little unsteady walking. When I made it into bed, the covers felt nice, and I could feel the high was still increasing. 

I looked at something on the wall, and in a couple seconds my visual field tunneled, with the periphery blurring, and the center becoming very clear, almost seeming closer or zoomed-in. I was familiar with the sensation, as it was a really exaggerated version of something I've experienced many times during sitting meditation when staring at an object for 90 seconds or so. Moving my eyes made everything normal again, but if kept my eyes in one place everything would tunnel. So it was basically the same thing, but it happened in 2 seconds instead of 90s. I thought that was cool.

It was cool, but I really was tired. As soon as I closed my eyes, it felt like the world was spinning and I felt like I was going to throw up. Kind of like when really drunk, except all the nausea was from dizziness, none of it from a belly full of poison. So I opened my eyes and immediately felt better. At this point, I was mostly annoyed, because I was feeling super tired, but couldn't very well go to sleep if I was going to throw up by closing my eyes.

That's when I got the negative idea that I might be way too high. I didn't really understand how it happened, because I'd taken a couple hits off these things several other days in past couple weeks, and got virtually nothing. Yet this time three hits sent me to the moon? I wondered if something was wrong. I took out my phone and did some searches on what it's like to get high. Most everything says MJ can't actually hurt you, but somehow I stumbled upon serotonin syndrome, and spent a little time wondering if it's possible something had triggered in my brain. I wasn't immediately fearful or anxious, just planning. I really didn't like the idea of going to sleep alone if I was going to have a problem, but I didn't want to go wake up my wife, tell her I was super high, and ask her to make sure I lived through the night. I didn't want to go wake up my wife, tell her I was super high, and ask her to make sure I lived through the night. I figured if things got really bad, I could call an uber to take me to the ER without waking my wife. 

I could tell I was getting a little too worried. I recognized the feeling from a different experience on a doctor prescribed psychotropic. It was like the gap between thinking something, and believing it, was becoming smaller. It was like the gap between thinking something, and believing it, was becoming smaller. My typical way of dealing with this in life is just to stop my internal dialog and be calm. Several seconds of failing at that was making me anxious, so I switch to a mantra meditation. That made me much happer, so lie there chanting my mantra for a minute or two. Once I was calm, I decided my symptoms didn't match seratonin syndrome, and that all this spiraling ideation was the kind of thing that people said happens when they are high.

I did a couple searches on 'what to do when you're too high', and read through various suggestions. One of them said to watch porn, which sounded like a good enough idea. I felt like I was wobbling all over as I got headphones from my computer and made my way back to bed. As soon as I got some porn on my phone, I got another window into how crazy high I was. I was getting the tunnel vision, but also something else. It almost felt like I was there. Like the stuff in the porn was happening to me. It was pretty crazy in a fun way. It distracted me for a little while at least.

When I'd bored of watching porn, I tried to close my eyes, only to again feel dizzy like I was going to throw up, so I immediately opened them and felt fine. At this point, I was feeling super annoyed. I just wanted to go to sleep, but I couldn't. I wondered how long it would last, and decided I didn't really know when I had vaped. I took out my phone, guessed it was about 30 minutes ago, and started a stopwatch to track the time. I just had to wait out 1-2 hours and it would go away. 

I watched some more videos on my phone (maybe porn? i don't remember) Then I checked the clock and it was only a few minutes later. This is when I realized time was moving very very slowly. At this point I was super annoyed, and wondered why anyone would voluntarily get into this state. I had some thoughts about how ironic it would be to have bought several hundred bucks worth of cannabis products only to toss it after getting too high once. I really just wanted it to stop, but knew there was nothing I could do but wait.

I decided I wasn't going to make it two hours lying in bed trying not to close my eyes while uncomfortably holding my phone. So I moved to our media room with a big TV. I considered watching one of my favorite movies, but didn't want to trigger any exaggerated fear or anxiety with a violent or scary movie, so I put on a kids movie, Madagascar. 

For the next hour and a half, I basically chilled on the couch, sometimes watching Madagascar, sometimes zoning out into my thoughts, the whole time forcing me eyes to stay open so I wouldn't feel dizzy and nauseated. Sometime around 3am, I felt all the effects calming, and made my way back into bed to fall asleep. 

The whole next day I felt predominately tired, from having only slept 3-4 hours. (bed at 3am, kids woke me at 7am). I also felt a slight mood lift. 

At various times during the experience, and a little the next day, I experienced tingling sensations, mostly on my hands and arms. 

* Since then...

I've taken tiny vape hits off the ABX OG Kush and enjoyed just the little buzz. That's really all I'm looking for. For me it's like a 'good alcohol buzz' which I so rarely get off alcohol.

I've tried the Legion of Bloom PAX ERA pod 'RE:lieve 1:1' a bunch of times. A couple hits off that makes me a little relaxed without impairment or a mental high, which is nice. I feel a little tingling in my hands and occasional sensation in my mouth. If I keep my arms and hands really still, I can 'feel' sounds running through them. This same thing has (rarely) happened to me during meditation without any drugs, but the cannabis makes it much easier to experience.

I tried the Legion of Bloom PAX 'Lavender' pod one night. I was able to get 'just a little high', but I didn't like the high as much as the ABX OG Kush. It was much more head centered, and ended up feeling like a tight sinus and slight headache after a while. 

The PAX Era portability is really really nice, but I don't really care for it. The draw is too tight for me, and I don't like that pods are very overpriced and have very limited selection. So far I prefer the typical variable voltage push-button 510 battery, like the one ABX and many other companies slap their logos on.

Alone 

It was only a few months ago that I tried smoking some weed.  I had always been somewhat interested in it, but my family has had a long history of drug use, so I was always reluctant to engage in any illegal substance.  I had told my friend about my wonderments concerning pot and he openly admitted to me that he smoked.  He persuaded me to smoke some with him when my dad was away at work one day, and I, totally curious of its effects, just went with the flow.

He brought his gravity bong over and he loaded a bowl into the bong stem he'd screwed into the cap.  He took the first hit since he was experienced and I wanted to see how it exactly worked.  It seemed intense.  He lit it for about 40 seconds until it seemed to produce into sticky black resin.  The hit was huge, and the excess smoked filtered past his cheeks and clouded in the hair.  It was now my turn and after watching that I wanted to try it even more.  I lit up another bowl and proceeded to follow his smoking method.  The smoke rushed into my lungs and it immediately felt like someone has started a fire in my throat.  Seemingly, I blew the smoke that troubled my lungs out the open air and let the rest simmer down in my lungs

My phone rang and it was my dad.  We had a pretty normal conversation but I felt everything speed up.  I had trouble getting my words out correctly, and the tone of my voice increased.  I got through the conversation fine and resumed to the garage where my friend was taking another hit.  At this point in time I felt very nervous; almost paranoid.  I told my friend he needed to leave because my dad was going to be home soon, which was true.  I cleaned up all noticeable aspects that would suggest I was smoking.  

After 10 or so minutes into my high I noticed my sister's boyfriend's truck outside.  He came in and immediately noticed I was high and asked for some assistance in giving his dog some medicine.  I held the dog's mouth open so he could submit the pill to his mouth (I think it was for worms - I'm not sure).  The pill opened up and the powder went everywhere.  It was hilarious to me.  As the dog struggled to get away from my grasp, everything seemed to go in slow motion.  He'd twitch and his figure would cast an illusion... as if he was moving in slow motion.  After he had left I was definitely feeling it, and when I sat in my computer chair and leaned back I felt as if I was flipping.  Over and over again I flipped.  It was interesting, and probably the best part of the high.  Then it turned bad.

I felt alone.  Very alone.  And I knew if my dad were to unexpectedly come home he'd know I was under the influence and I'd be dead.  I began to lay down on my bed and hopefully sleep off its effect.  But no, I was to energized to fall asleep and was scared as well.  Later that night I was still very buzzed but was coming down, and I ventured onto my computer.  I messaged my best friend and told her what I was feeling.  I felt like she was going to leave me and I would be alone.  I don't know why I felt like that, but I did.  She told me I was just having a bad high and repeatedly said she loved me.  For some odd reason I didn't believe her though... and at the point I just wanted the high to be over.  

By the time my dad got home I was almost sober and he didn't notice a thing.  That took a lot of worry of of me, but the paranoia aspect still haunted me until I feel asleep that night.  The next morning was a great wake up... all insecurities of the past night went away and I was vindicated of all burdens.

This was around two months ago and I'm still smoking.  My second experience was great and I managed to control my high completely.  Initially I just wasn't able to handle my high and I wasn't exactly prepared for what it contended.  I'm glad I didn't let that experience ruin weed for me, since I'm very happy with it now and no longer have bad highs.

I tried cannabis for the first time in 2004, after much nervousness and deliberation. I'm a thinking person and had great fear of losing control over my own mind. I drank some alcohol prior to use in order to allay my nervousness (my first mistake). After about three or so nearly consecutive hits  from a pipe, I lost consciousness and, upon coming to, had the most nightmarish experience imaginable. All sense of continuity between events was gone; my short term memory was almost non-existent. It hurt to be alive. My brain felt drawn and quartered and everything was spinning. Worst yet, the two friends with me refused to believe the degree of discomfort I was experiencing, further propelling me into a paranoid, solipsistic state. It felt as though for about half a year thereafter, I could not 'tune in' to my surroundings, questioning if the things before me were really there.

I decided I was never going to come near cannabis again. Yet, a curious puzzle bothered me: is what I experienced what the normal and intended effect of cannabis is supposed to be and it just so happens that I personally do not enjoy it, OR is what happened to me abnormal and absolutely not what most people are looking for when they do cannabis? How could I ever know? After all, I thought, maybe I am just different from many other people; it was suggested to me, for example, that I 'think too much' and had 'overanalyzed' my trip and that I just have to 'let it take [me] over'. 

The only way to answer this question was to try cannabis once again. This, however, I was unwilling to do until I became a marijuana legalization supporter a few months ago.  Someone challenged me with respect to how comfortably I shun substances based on their legality status. This made me uncomfortable because my own father's life had been destroyed by LEGALLY prescribed pharmaceuticals. Once I began thinking about the issue further, it became apparent that I have very few reasons to not support marijuana legalization---with the exception of my own very horrid experience.

This meant that I had to try cannabis once again. After all, how can I claim to be an avid supporter of something that nearly caused me to lose my mind and without having an objective understanding of what a more normal reaction to the drug is supposed to be?

A few days ago, therefore, I tried it again--this time in the comfortable company of a friend. Despite his expertise and assurance that the effects occur on a spectrum, it was difficult to try it again; I sat for a long time with the pipe and lighter in my hands. Finally, toward the evening, I managed to take a very small hit. I sat for a long time with the pipe and lighter in my hands. Finally, toward the evening, I managed to take a very small hit. (I had quit smoking tobacco three years ago and the process of inhaling any kind of smoke was psychologically and physically not easy for me.)  

I felt a very slight rush but began to doubt that anything was going to happen. A few minutes later, my attention was drawn to a colorful tortilla chip bag on the table, which somehow seemed more vibrantly colored than it had been before. Suddenly, the most strong and pleasant desire to sleep came over me. I had never felt so relaxed. I fell asleep and the dreams I had were vibrant and musical: I dreamt that an orchestra was playing very loudly on stage. Furthermore, all of the subconscious thoughts that would not have normally been released through dreams occurred in the particular dreams I had; I dreamt that the man I love was touching another woman. When he saw me he looked up in shock and fear but his expression revealed that it was no mistake and that he had been caught in an act that truly spoke of his desire. I dreamt of his mother and the unbearable nature of communicating with her--not being understood and confused by her erratic behavior. In short, my deepest fears and sentiments about people in my life were revealed to me.

In the morning, now feeling no fear toward the substance, I took another small hit. My friend and I headed out in search of brunch. I felt, again, a general light-headeness. Sitting in an outdoor cafe, I stared intently at another patron's bright yellow and blue sneakers. An interesting realization surfaced in my mind then; if what I am feeling now, I thought, is a function of dopamine and serotonin receptors being acted upon in my brain, then perhaps all of my behavior in general is governed by these things. That I have control over my mental life is an illusion. From the mere fact that I think I have free will does not follow that I do. The person with OCD who opens and shuts drawers 300 times per day also thinks s/he is choosing to do so, although that is false.

Upon returning home after brunch, we were preparing to part ways. This time, I took one rather large hit for the road. We walked out into the street. I was feeling rather disappointed that nothing more significant than sensation perception enhancement was going to happen. It's a shame, I thought, that my first experience was so nightmarish but that this time, I was going to feel almost nothing too significant.  About ten minutes had elapsed. I said good-bye to my friend and proceeded to take a walk outdoors.  It was at this moment, upon being alone, that I realized that I have a lot of difficulty containing my facial muscles, which keep morphing into a huge smile. Suddenly, I burst out in laughter. I walked about a block bending over in uncontrollable laughter. There was no particular reason for this, I decided, and becoming paranoid of the fact that others might see me in this dumb state, I tried to reason with myself; 'Just remember what you told yourself before you got high: You said that you would remind yourself that this is only a drug and that, by understanding the situation, you would feel comfortable with letting go and enjoying it'. This worked in quelling the paranoia. I put on my headphones and enjoyed the mild euphoria, like a million little ants in my chest, and desire to laugh all the way home.

While this peak of the high was pleasant, for two days thereafter I felt incredibly lethargic and thoughtless. Usually being a mentally productive person full of ideas, I felt that my brain was an empty metal bucket. I had nothing to say. I spent those two days around a very mentally active physicist. He kept engaging me in our usual conversations but I felt that I had nothing to offer him and was merely reacting to circumstance. Each time I reached into my brain, I was scrapping the bottom of a metal bucket.  I decided that if I were to keep up smoking pot, then I might very well destroy my relationship with this person.

In summary, I now understand much better what a more typical experience is supposed to be. I understand that, generally, cannabis is far less dangerous than the legal barbiturates, tranks and anti-depressants that are killing off my father. While I don't find that it suits me personally, I respect those who choose to use it responsibly. After all, my second experience was pleasant overall because the person I was with had established rules and was very responsible.

DOSE:
  
 
Caffeine
(daily)


 
  
oral
Cannabis
(cookie / food)





BODY WEIGHT:
135 lb





Background
17 year old light drug user. I had been smoking for five years and was reasonably learned in the art of toking. Smoked perhaps three grams a week. Heavy caffeine user, somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 milligrams a day. I had occasionaly experienced with hallucinogens, although I was by no means a regular user. Drank rarely, perhaps five servings per month.

Preperation
10:40 AM (T+00:00)- I can cook quite well, given that most teenagers can't figure out how to boil Ramen. I decided that my method of eating would be old school: brownies. I pulled out my jar of leaf, by which I mean the actual leaves of the plant. Totally unexperienced in the Way of Cannabis Eating, I simply reached into the jar, grabbing approximately four large pinches of the substance and dropped it into the brownie mix. I baked the brownies, eagerly awaiting the unfamiliar experience. When they were finished, I devoured the entire batch, which probably could have gotten six or seven people twisted. 

Set and setting
I was very eager. In retrospect, much too eager. I did what most inexperienced drug users do: took way too much my first time. The setting was better, though. It was a cloudless 29 degree day (85 fahrenheit) and I planned on enjoying the sunshine out on the lake.

Experience
11 AM (T+00:20)- Started feeling the first waves. I can't stress how different this is from smoking the plant. It doesn't come on the same way. With smoking, it hits me entirely in about fifteen minutes. When I eat it, it can take 1-2 hours to fully affect me. I had been watching some television show and the theme song had come on. All of a sudden, I felt like I was part of the music. I had gotten up and performed some sort of inane dance that seemed to just come to me. After the song ended, the wave receded a little and I sat back down and watched the rest of the show.

11:40 AM (T+00:40)- I was really starting to get a buzz. This was the cannabis that I knew, or at least this was what I thought at the time. This is the point where I started making the series of mistakes that made this high miserable. Firstly, I should have planned a little more and done this shit WELL before my parents were home so I could experience it, come down, and baseline before either of them even walked in the door. Instead, I gave myself about four hours, which would have been enough had I eaten a safe dose instead of something that even the most veteran eaters would pale at. My second mistake was calling my cousin. He had no knowledge of the high that I was about to descend into, and I intended for it to stay that way. My third mistake, and one of the worst, was bringing my dog, an 80 pound German Shephard. As long as I keep an eye on her, I thought, She'll be a good dog. Mistake # 4.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

12:10 PM (T+01:10)- I met up with my cousin at the lake, which is a short walk from my house. The day was great and the two of us set off on my boat, heading towards a beach across the lake. At this point I was totally twisted. My entire body pulsed with feeling and everything I touched felt alive. If my boat's design had featured a radio, I'm sure I would have gotten lost in the tunes and crashed. It was terrible. It was beautiful. We crossed the lake safely and went ashore on the beach. My dog trotted off and into the water, trying to cool off her dark fir by diving in the water. As long as I keep an eye on her, I thought, She'll be a good dog. Mistake # 4.

12:30 PM (T+01:30)- I was fucking stoned. I can't properly describe in words how high I was. I sat on the beach, watching the waves,  the sky, and the entire universe of motion before me. My world was alive. Distantly, I noticed that my cousin was playing with my dog, throwing a stick the size of my leg into the water for her. She was a large, intimidating animal. I left reality again, zoning out for ten minutes or so.

12:40 PM (T+:01:40)- My dog was barking. She was fucking freaking out on some people that had come ashore near us. I was way too fucked up to handle shit like this, but somehow I managed to rise and calm down the dog and apologise to the frightened couple. It was time to get out of there before something really bad happened. My cousin was already starting to notice that something was deeply wrong inside me, and I'm a very introverted smoker as it is. 

1 PM (T+02:00)- Alone again. The bad vibes were gone, but I was still miserably high. I watched the television and listened to music.

4 PM (T+05:00)- Parents got home. No way could I handle talking to them. From the research that I had done, I thought that it should have worn off an hour ago, but it was still coming on strong, I was blown out of my mind. I was twitching and jumping on the vibes of the strongest high that I have ever had. I retreated to the woods behind my house and walked the well-used trail that is frequented by hippies, bikers, joggers and the like. I walked the trail for hours, waiting for the high to wear off. 

8:30 PM (T+09:30)- It didn't. I was getting to the point where I was worrying. I had never experienced anything like this before. This was akin to drinking a cup of coffee and not being able to sleep for three nights. As I walked home, I asked myself how this could even be possible. I knew I had dosed too high, but this defied everything I had ever learned about the drug. I knew that I would just have to ride the wave and try to enjoy the scenery. 

9:00 PM (T+10:00)- I ate dinner with my parents. I relied on silence, speaking in monosyllables and staying as reserved as possible. By some miracle, I managed to keep my cool. I went into my bedroom and watched television for two hours or so, still as high as I had been eight hours ago. 

8:00 AM (T+21:00)- I woke up, lying in the semidarkness that was created by my cream colored shades, I realized that I was still high. This had ventured into insanity. I was high, although at this point it was a managable buzz, much like the one created when a bowl of some chronic is smoked. For the next four hours or so, I read, although I realize that it was much less than that. I was basically staring at the pages, because as soon as I turned the page, I forgot what I had just read.

12:00 PM (T+ 24:00)- The high was finally gone, and I was exhausted by the ordeal. I learned a great deal about both myself and the great drug that I have preached the innocence of for so long. Taken in almost any normal amount, Cannabis produces a great little buzz that have mind expanding effects. When taken to the extreme, Cannabis can become extremely dissociative and frightening. If you take anything from this story, it is that one must underdose when experimenting with any new form of usage that produces different effects. If I had eaten half a brownie and waited an hour, this all could have been avoided.

Mushrooms
(dried)





BODY WEIGHT:

This shrooms experience has been my strongest to date. Im not sure what it means or how I feel about it, so Ill just report what happened.

I obtained the magic mushrooms while doing fieldwork in the Transkei in South Africa. There they grow fresh in the coastal jungle, beautiful white shrooms with golden caps and just a hint of blue. One shrooms was over 25 cm in length  the cap was the size of my fist! I would dry them by laying them out on newspaper on the lawn, and the warm sea breeze dried them beautifully in about 2 hours.

I returned home and found a suitable Saturday to take them. My preferred method of ingesting shrooms is to grind them up (sometimes using scissors and a shot glass like I would with marijuana) into smaller powdery flakes. I then eat a small mouthful and wash it down with a big gulp of fruit juice, and repeat until everything is consumed. Because the pieces are already so small there is no need to chew and taste them, and they also kick in faster. I dont much like the taste when Im sober, and this is a very fast efficient way to eat them quickly without messing around with teas or honey etc. However I find when Im already tripping I love the taste and can eat the shrooms like potato chips :D

I decided to trip at home and to trip alone, which I love doing  it adds a whole other dimension to the trip. Because I was an experienced tripper I felt comfortable that I knew my limits and would be able to cope with whatever came my way. There was no chance of being interrupted, or having to interact with other non-tripping people, which I often find humorously impossible :) Once I had ground up the shrooms, I was left with a rather large dark powdery pile, enough to fill up a large cereal bowl. Im unsure of the exact quantity, but Id guess there was about 20 grams there. Normally for a strong trip Id take 5 or 6 grams, but this time around I decided to throw caution to the wind. This is not recommended except for the most experienced of trippers! And even then. WOW

I ate about ¾ of the shrooms, as much as I could stomach. I usually leave a bit for later to mix with marijuana for smoking, which I find to be an incredibly potent kick when already tripping. However, if I smoke shrooms while sober, the effects are negligible. I chilled out on the carpet of the lounge, listening to music and relaxing, trying not to think about coming on. I didn't have to wait long, about 20 minutes after consumption I felt the shrooms kicking in hard. Describing a shrooms trip is a lot like describing a dream, things are disjointed and its hard to keep track. Lying on the floor I began to feel very mushy and squishy, the ambient trance music softly playing in the background. I could hear jungle sounds, like frogs and crickets, and my living room soon became a lush jungle. But it was still my living room.

I got the feeling that I needed to go to the bathroom, which of course I didnt, it was just the shrooms. But the thought of going into my bathroom became horribly hilarious. I walked between the living room and bathroom, each time getting closer and laughing harder. In my mind I dubbed the bathroom The Bathroom of Hilarity, and all who venture in there would surely perish from laughter. I felt fantastically happy, everything was SOOOOOO funny. I eventually found myself lying back on the living room carpet, contemplating the utter ridiculousness of the entire universe, creation, life, myself, my fears, hopes dreams, other people. I cant really put it into words (as with so many things while tripping  language fails us utterly), but life seemed completely silly. And in that moment I was set free.

I went straight to heaven. I experienced Nirvana. Rolling on my living room carpet laughing uncontrollably, I realized the Truth. I cant really say much more about it, except that it is screamingly funny. I realized the Truth. I cant really say much more about it, except that it is screamingly funny. I have experienced this kind of laughter once before while on shrooms, and it feels really wonderful. The sensation is similar to dreams I have of breathing underwater, in that I stop breathing. Rather there is just a continuous stream of screaming laughter from deep inside my gut that comes gushing out like an unstoppable fountain, and I can keep it going for hours if I like. Its wonderful, but other people might be a bit concerned.

It was that thought that brought me down a bit - that my landlord lived in the apartment above me, and perhaps I was making too much noise? I always get paranoid about being too noisy when Im intoxicated. So I zipped up the laughter and decided to go have a bath. Ive yet to go swimming while tripping, which I understand is amazing, but taking a bath, or even a shower, is pretty great too. When Im tripping I find it very hard to tell if things, including myself, are wet or dry, and actually getting wet delightfully confuses the senses even further. Lying there in the lukewarm water I fancied I could hear the jungle noises again, and soon I got the sensation of lying in a swampy puddle in a lush, dark jungle, with lizards and frogs and other creatures all around me.

It was about that time that I noticed mushrooms beginning to grow everywhere  out of the tiles, the floor, the ceiling, the taps. I looked at my own body and noticed that there were mushrooms growing out of my limbs as well. This didnt alarm me in the slightest  being an experienced tripper I didnt freak out, rather I thought it was pretty neat and decided to see where it would take me. At this point I began noticing the fog, which I had felt I had been aware of in the living room earlier too. And in this fog, figures were moving, people were walking. It felt like the boundaries between this reality and another had broken down, that they had begun overlapping. Because this was the first time I had experienced this I decided to be cautious, and made no attempt to contact or get the attention of these people. Some gave me a cursory glance before walking off, and they didnt seem malicious, but I didnt want to take the chance on our first encounter. I went back to looking at the shrooms growing on my body.

I realized that I had become a mushroom completely, and my thoughts and consciousness took the shape of a mushroom cap. Every little leaf or page in the cap was one of my thoughts, one of my realities. I was simultaneously experiencing those realities, but I was also the observer, and could see each reality in the tiniest detail, and yet I was there too. I was there in the bath, but also at home with my parents, but also at work tomorrow, and also in the dream I had a few nights ago. I knew instinctively that there were an infinite amount of these realities, and given the time and effort who knew what I could uncover, but at that time I only had the energy/capacity to focus on 5 or 6 of those realities. Still, it was enough, and it was mind-blowing. Later my sister pointed out to me that in that moment I had Stopped time Carlos Castaneda style. I dont know about that, but it certainly fits the bill. Time and space really ceased to have any meaning or to exist at all.

Im not sure how long all this went on, but I think I only spent about an hour or so in the bath. I soon began to feel tired. I got dressed and returned to lying on the living room carpet, listening to ambient trance music and smoking a joint. I could see wonderful waves of energy around everything, especially my hands, and these waves flowed and swished around constantly in the most exquisite ever-changing colours. I began to play with the energy fields around my hands, trailing them around and contracting and expanding the colours. 

The way in which they layered and folded over and into each other reminded me of models that scientists used to explain the interactions between 4 or even more dimensions  which my sober mind couldnt conceive of, but now made perfect sense. There, in the palm of my hands, I had infinitely overlapping universes, where I could once again simultaneously see the whole and yet go into the minutest details of any specific layer, and yet none of this was confusing and no clarity was lost. I felt that I had a miniature working-model of the universe encapsulated there in my hands.   

After this I began to lose focus and feel very tired  it had been a really heavy trip after all. I went to lie down in my bed and pleasantly drifted between waking and dreaming until I drifted off to sleep. The total trip lasted about 5 or 6 hours. I felt fine the next day, a bit spacey, but nothing unusual. 

Im not particularly spiritual, more of a scientific skeptic, so Im not going to assign any deeper meanings or revelations to this trip. It was awesome, but it was just a trip. Also, I have NO idea how my marvelous brain works or what the true nature of reality is. There will have to be further experimentation :)

Although I've had many experiences with marijuana, some with ecstasy and other potentially 'soft' drugs, no experience of mine could ever match up to what I went through on the night of June 25th. 

Me and my buddy H. Went by his place to roll up a joint and watch some cartoons, which is part of our weekly routine. This time though he told me about this new strain he got, which was supposedly... Mind-blowing. I was very excited and we ended up rolling a 4 gram spliff. H. Didn't smoke a lot, just took one puff, and I smoked all the rest. I wasn't aware that I was going to experience the most frightening and the most euphoric moments of my life all in one night.

At first, the usual 'screen' (kind of like a bugged TV screen with lots of colors blinking) I saw during daily life got stronger, and eventually the screen turned into an image. There was something odd about this image that I quite couldn't put my finger on. I decided to ignore it and watch some cartoons, but the image could be seen anywhere. It was blocking my vision. The image sort of looked like a circle inside a square inside another circle, and it had infinite colors and went onto infinity. The circle and the squares were wearing colorful hat-like structures.

After a few attempts at ignoring the image, I began falling into it. Reality was falling. And as I did, I realized the image was made up of billions, trillions of smaller versions of that image put together in different layers of reality. (Crazy, right?) I felt like I was going to die, that I was going to snap out of this reality and transfer into another one. I was falling, for layers, and layers and it wouldn't stop. I was falling, for layers, and layers and it wouldn't stop. That was the most terrifying part of the trip. I couldn't stop the falling no matter how much I tried. Reality always ended up separating and I was falling into a black pit.

After about 30 minutes I decided I'd had enough and that I wanted to go home. With great difficulty, I made it to a taxi but sounded surprisingly eloquent as I told the driver the directions to my house. As the taxi was moving forward, reality was moving forward with it. I was no longer falling down, I was moving forward, at an incredible speed. My heart was beating fast, I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. It wasn't as bad as the falling feeling, but it was still somewhat frightening.

When I got home, I opened the lights, I laid down on my bed and decided to record my thoughts. I felt like I understood everything, and I could link every single dream in my past to what I was seeing right now, I felt like my dreams were explanations to why the universe is the way it is and vice versa. I could find an explanation for anything and everything. I saw the string theory, I experienced the fractal theory, I went through thousands of layers of reality. It was the happiest I'd ever been, thinking I know the answer to why we are here. I could visualize all the dimensions and the shape they took... It was amazing. The most  beautiful feeling. I had found what the meaning of life is, for me.

I decided I'd go to sleep with this knew-found knowledge, but the falling feeling came back when I closed the lights. It felt like the light was what would pull me up into happiness, understanding and that darkness would send me to the pits of hell, the falling feeling, which was hell. The big drop. To death. I comforted myself by repeating a single thought: 'There always is a surface to fall on. It is a circle. It is endless. Even if you die, you will wake up and fall on something.' I managed to go to sleep after that.

In the end, it was a life-changing experience. Beautiful, frightening. Full of mixed emotions. I truly hope a lot of people get to experience feelings similar to mine.

It was a late-fall day, and my friend has prepared some dank firecrackers for me out of .5 gram of these headies called headband, a strain that had been wreaking havoc all through my group of friends, notorious for it's huge peak and devastating low. The strain is named after an iconic feeling you get while under it's influence, you feel like you have the biggest headband fucking ever on. I planned on eating the firecracker during school (first mistake), since I wouldn't be around for the weekend's festivities, I would get real high on Thursday, but come down in time to do some school work at a friends. I had eaten brownies before, and I was/still am a frequent smoker, so I thought little of the day ahead of me. Hah, little did I know...

I munched down the cracker at around 1:00, allowing 30-40 minutes before my gym class (I was psyched) for it to set in. It crept up slowly, and I almost didn't notice it, but looking back, it started somewhere in the middle of gym, and that was the most incredible gym class ever. I don't think I did much beside stand there, but I thought I was in 'nam, so it's cool.

After gym class, I made the first mistake of the day. It was 2:00, and I could feel the body high, but my head was relatively clear. My friend asked if I wanted to go smoke a couple bowls before school ended. Now, you must understand that I smoke fairly regularly, and I've gotten pretty fucking stoned, but I had never been too high, you know? Like completely fucking bonkers. I had a feeling there was a line that once crossed brought you into the realm of the hopelessly ripped, but I was not sure where it was or what it would take to get there. After that fateful day, my definition of baked would change forever.

I agreed to smoke.

We trudged on over to a pretty spot off school grounds, sat down and began smoking. It felt like the moment that ganja smoke whipped down my throat and swirled around in my lungs, I was infinitely higher, an effect I had never felt before and it unsettled me a little. Two bowls (roughly 1 gram) later, and I'm gone. Straight up destroyed. Really. Fucking. Baked. I recall that my two friends were talking about something and packing up, but I was too busy looking down at my body and and thinking that I looked like a giant robot or a puppet or something. I don't remember the walk back at all. Shit. I just realized that. Anyways, we returned to school just as the last bell was ringing, and as it rung, feelings of anxiety and fear pervaded my body. I did NOT want to be in school, let alone... crossroads. 

After school at my school, literally every student and their dog likes to form a gigantic crowed at a spot in the center of the school called Crossroads. It's actually pretty convenient for socializing and planning shit out normally, but not when you feel like you're riding a space-horse with Jesus, like me. I knew my eyes were blood red, I probably smelled, and I could not properly formulate a sentence. I tried to look down and avoid eye contact as much as possible, but a lot of people saw me, and each person would say Haha you fuckin' idiot! You're so high! or You're eyes are so red. Safe to say, I was TWEAKING THE FUCK OUT. I kept going to my friends saying Yo, man, we gotta get out of here! We're not supposed to be here, like that made any sense, and they just laughed at me. 

Eventually, what seemed like 26 hours later, we were walking the halls and I was feeling a little better, but still anxious. I had only been able to put eye-drops in one eye, as I ran out of drops before I could put some in the other, so I just looked goofy. This was one of the various relative lows that tricked me into thinking I was coming down. At various points, I felt like I was less high than before, but then it would smack me in the face again. This particular instance was probably me coming down off of smoking, but I'm not sure.

By some strange anomaly of space-time, we ended up in the cafeteria at what I can only assume was around 3:00. It was darkish in there, but I didn't mind, I was just chillin' on the table, minding my own business. My friends were talking about something, but sitting on the table I was just so god damn comfortable and HOLY SHIT DID I JUST FALL ASLEEP? I did. I fell the fuck asleep. Shit. Clearly I was still way too high. I began to feel like I was drunk, almost, like I was falling slowly backwards through sand. I was hella-dizzy, and felt a little weird in my belly. I jumped up (mistake), got SUPER lightheaded and shouted GUYS! I'm tooooo high! and they just stared at me and said Yes you are, you are so pale! and I said I know! I gotta go to the baffroom, aight they just laughed, and I sprinted over to an inconspicuous hidden bathroom to chill out. 

Now, four things happened to me on that toilet. The first was that I had the most satisfying dump of my life. The second was that I apparently lost control of my major muscle groups, as random parts of my body would just give out, causing me to bob and fall over at times. The third and most fascinating thing was that I began to hallucinate. Not just like, oh things look a little different, straight up seeing shit. The floor was a grid pattern and I stared at it forever! It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen! It was pulsing and vibrating and always changing. It would cycle through different ways of pulsing and moving like Christmas lights. I also saw what I can only describe as golden helices everywhere floating across my vision. Also spaceships. Lots of spaceships. 

The final thing that happened to me in the bathroom was that I obviously lost track of any sense of time, for when I peered at my phone to check the time, it was six o'fuckingclock. I had sat on this toilet for..... drumroll.... 3 fucking hours. How had I done that? It felt like 15 minutes at MOST. Jesus. 

I realized I had to leave, and in a delicate process of moving my body ever so slowly, I raised myself off of the toilet seat and called my friend Dane. Still stoned as shit.

He answers, Hey JP, what's up?
Yo, I'm in the bathroom.... uh..
What? Are you okay?
What?
Are you okay?
I'm in the bathroom.
You're stoned aren't you
Very and then I started laughing hysterically.

Eventually, Dane found me and brought me to his house, where I ate a lot of delicious food, played with his bunnies (fucking rad) and had mad intellectual talks. I left his house at 9:30ish, and realized something. I thought I had come down, but no, I was actually so stoned for so long that I just got used to it... I was still high, but being high just felt normal at this point. Once I got home, I sank the fuck into the couch. And slept for two hours. Upon waking, realized I was still destroyed, I hiked to my room and fell asleep. I awoke sober, but feeling... odd... I went over the events and realized that I should never mix a heavy body high (firecracker) with a heavy heady high (smokin' headband). Though, looking back, it was not a bad experience, because now I know and recognize my boundaries. Another lasting effect of the trip was that my tolerance went WAY down, but in a strange way. I get super high, but sober up within two or three hours. The strangest after-effect of the trip is that ever since that day, I have a narrating conscience, something I did not have before. It feels like a separate entity from myself just talking about what I'm doing, feeling, or looking at. It's by far the strangest thing I've ever experienced mentally.

I haven't eaten firecrackers since, but I'm curious. Let this be a warning to those experimenting with heavy edibles. They are no joke! And you will be stoned off your ass! Or in my case, on your ass... on a toilet seat... for three hours.

Cannabis (1) : General (1), Various (28)

Before I begin I'd like to state that I had rarely used Marijuana prior to this experience. Never more than a bowl at a time with some friends. In the days leading up to my 'trip', I had acquired a fair amount of Cannabis (more than the usual, over 12 grams), occasionally smoking a bowl with three or more friends.

Preparation: The day before, I had decided that I wanted to smoke the next day, so I got out my bag while my mom was out of the house, and began to crush up a couple of buds for a spliff. When I finished crushing up the large bud I figured I had enough for a little over 2 medium sized joints. For some reason I decided to combine two rolling papers so that I could fit all of the MJ into one big spliff, and once I had filled the papers with the weed there was still room left for more if I wanted. Well, I wanted, and so I started breaking up a smaller nug of weed from a different sack I got from another seller, which I considered to be pretty 'dank'. So after rolling this mammoth of a joint (at least 2.5 grams), which was rather difficult, I put it in a snack bag in my backpack for the next day. 

The next day at school I was expecting to smoke this huge J between me and one other friend (A) (habitual smoker), so during lunch we met up and were going to go get lunch before we smoked so we could eat while we were baked. Just as we were heading out she asked one of her friends (B) who I didn't know very well at the time, if she wanted to smoke. And one of my friends (C) showed up from a different school at the same time, as he was going to join friend A and I at lunch. So after we all got back from getting our food we walked over to this L shaped hallway by the school to smoke The Spliff. I was slightly nervous as the location was fairly visible from the road where the cops drive by regularly. 

T+0:00: I lit up right at 12:10 and took the biggest hit of the day right off the bat. About halfway through our session friends A and B were passing every other hit, so it was me and Friend C who were getting most of the green. On top of that I was the only one who didn't smoke just about every day, and the only one taking really big hits. It took us about 10 minutes to get to the roach, and when we finished we walked back to the school and sat down on a bench to eat lunch.

T+0:10: I was most of the way done with my food when it started coming on fast and hard. It hit me when I was chewing my food, I had forgotten that I was eating, or that I was even alive. For about a minute at least I was a stationary observer in this picturesque landscape of glowing haze and hopping rabbits and general euphoria. I snapped back into where I really was and instantly became very confused, as I thought where I just was, was the 'real world' and that the real world was the imaginary one. Once my brain came into gear enough to realize what was actually happening another wave of completely different 'effects' came crashing down on me. I continued to chew the same mouthful of food that I had taken on a few minutes earlier, only it felt like I was chewing some kind of heavenly dish reserved for the gods. 

T+0:18: Lunch was just about over and my friends were finishing eating and talking about things, I could hear everything that was happening as if I had heard it a million times before. I asked friend C what was happening, and if he could see what I was seeing and he just laughed. Then one my friends who didn't smoke with us smiled at me and said 'It's okay man, you're just really high.' I looked at her weird and then remembered that I had smoked, and I kept thinking 'I didn't even smoke that much', or 'This isn't supposed to happen'. My vision was trailed, every time I would focus on a new object or turn my head, the whole frame would shift, like watching a movie in slow motion but it skips certain frames. My body felt like it was vibrating, and my normal state of mind was completely destroyed at that point. I turned to a state of acceptance where it seemed like information about life and death and beyond was being pushed down a funnel into my mind. I remember thinking that it wouldn't matter if I walked out into traffic and got hit by a car, because what I was being shown was that we have no choices, that our lives have already been played out from beginning to end. 

It's too confusing to put the rest of the information into intelligible words, but what I 'understood' has changed the way I think about everything. There is no positive or negative, because neither can exist without each other. Everything we perceive, exists within created limits, and the only true life exists outside of all the bondage that we accept as everyday life. There are people and beings that want you to stay enslaved in this physical and spiritual prison they've created. And more than anything I want to know why, I believe if we understand that, then everything else will be revealed. Instead of breaking through the one way mirrors, we can just go to the end and see straight through them all.

T+0:25: Me and friend C leave the school and I walk with him back to his school. When we get there I turn back and start walking to my school, the whole time my body and mind are somewhat exhausted from the intense experience, but still beyond high.

T+1:00: School is extremely boring. Still feel very high.

T+2:15: School is out and I'm headed home. Still high.

T+3:00: I'm home and starting to come down from the way out of the box thinking, and now mostly want to take a nap. I feel stoned. I 'pass out' on my bed.

T+6:50: I wake up and feel real groggy and everything is hazy. I had a very lucid dream, though I can't recall now what it was about. It's dark outside and nobody is home, which adds to the grogginess. I decide to take a cool shower.

T+8:20: The shower was really refreshing and wiped away the groggy feeling, now I'm mostly relaxed and get on the computer to read about some of the things I was shown earlier in the day.

About a year ago I took an extremely heavy dose of psychedelic mushrooms. Since then, there hasn't been a day that I haven't thought about what happend to me on this day, which became one of the most frightening, and unexplainable 'experiences' in my life. I'm not sure if anything, or anyone could have prepared me for it. I had done mushrooms, 15-20 times before this, but never had anything like this.

Well, a little about myself. At the time, I was 19 years old, I was working at a job I didn't like at all. It kept me far away from my family, friends, and at the time, a girl I loved very much, but couldn't be with due to her unstable mental state.

Overall, life was confusing at the time, I was back home for a few weeks, and so were alot of very close friends I grew up with. I was happy to see all of them, we all agreed, what better way to catch up then hangin out and doing some mushrooms.

Alot of this trip I have to blame on very poor setting. The plan was to go down by a river where we thought we would be left alone. We didn't know it was a common place for people to go for walks, ect. We started by hiking down to the river, we set up our chairs around some rocks near the river, we each had 4 grams of very high grade mushrooms (we had no idea they were so potent, I told my dealer I ate 4 grams and he didn't believe me), mixed them up with some chips and salsa, and chowed them down. While we waited for them to kick in, we decided to smoke some marijuana. About 10 minutes had passes, I felt very giggly, more so then normaly from weed. Immediately after some people going for a walk, walked behind us. We all agreed this was a bad spot. We picked up camp and decided to move about 50 meters down the river, away from the path.

About 20 minutes had passed, we were moving our things, and I was tripping. One of my friends asked 'you feeling anything yet?' 'I'm a fuckin space cadet.' I replied. I was walking along these rocks, they appeared to be moving and forming a path right in front of me! 'Follow me! I know the way!' By this point caring all my equipment was too much for me. I dropped the case of water I was carrying, threw my chair down. I can't explain it, but it felt as if an incredible burden was lifted off my shoulders, it felt great. That feeling was very short lived. I looked over to the river. It was jetting different colours down the water. But the colours didn't move with the water, the whole river just jetted another colour, then another, then another. I looked at all the trees across the water. They were growing, shrinking, trading places. It was way too overwhelming, almost made me sick. Another one of my friends had set up a blanket on the ground, I went and layed down and tried to close my eyes to try escape all this. Didn't work. Upon closing my eyes, I saw a kalediscope of black and white swirls, but they were all in some sort of perfect geometric pattern. This was even more intense for me. My friends started to get concerned, I told them I needed water. They offered me some gatorade, but I wanted nothing to do with it. I needed water, and now. 'B' went and grabbed me a bottle of water, from which I dropped back down along the river. I grabbed the bottle and felt as if my quest had been fullfilled, but after drinking it, it did nothing. I layed back down, closed my eyes, and the intense closed eye visuals came back. I jumped up 'ants!' I shouted 'ants all over me! Get them off!' My friend 'B' asked my friends 'E' 'what is wrong with him?' E replied 'he's having a bad trip, my sister told me about this, we gotta just let him play it out.' Bad trip... The last words I remember hearing conciously, lingering in my mind...

This is where my trip gets very hard to recall. I had not a clue where I was, how much time had passed, who I was, some of what I recall has just been pieced together from what friends have told me.

My friends were all circled around me. In what seemed like a flash, the whole sky turned black, my friends looked like army soldiers, and the river turned to an ocean of blood. It looked identical to a scene straight out of 'saving private ryan.' I felt as if they were helping me. I looked at my lower body... 'oh my god! Where are my legs.' I was certain I was about to die. I can't describe how real this felt, it was horrifying' 

As fast as that 'episode' came, it was gone, in a flash I was no longer on normady beach, but on a beach in some jungle... My friends were now cannibals! They were going to kill me! I got up as fast as I could, ran into the trees... Upon arriving in this forest, it was a bloody mess. A bear had just been here, and completely oblitirated a hiker. The bear was coming back for me, I thought. Back to the beach I went.

This is the hardest part of the trip for me to recall, and talk about. When I was very young, I was molested, needles to say, I'm an extreme homophobe. It's not to say I'm against gays, but I do not want to be one. 

Back on the beach, I felt somewhat normal, I started to walk around. I thought, for some reason, we were a group of gay people. I walked around, and said 'Yeah, were gay.'
My friends G said 'I'm not fucking gay'

We started go and back and forth taunting each other, then ended up fighting.

By that time, another friend came because he said hed sit and make sure we were ok the other night. Thank god he was there.

Other then what I have wrote, the rest of the trip is too hard to remember, I was just too messed up. Proabally a good thing I don't. However, the only pleasent part of the trip, that I do remember is the end.

All this shit had gone down. I was now lying, staring at the sky. My mind was a complete blank, all these things that just happend to me didn't matter. I felt as if I wasn't connected to my body. I thought for sure, this must be death. But it wasn't like thinking... It was more, that knew I was. It's a very hard sensation to describe. It felt timeless. And I wanted it to be. 

Eventually, I woke up, in a daze. 

I remember, in my dazed state hearing. 'he can't know what happened to him.' 

'what?' I said

'Nothing' one of them replied.

I'm sorry the report is very unfinished, but in that kind of state of mind, it's hard to remember anything. Thank you to anyone who read this. I put it here hoping that someone will be able to relate to it somehow. I also apologize for spelling and grammer mistakes.

I feel that I must submit my recent experiences of the past couple of weeks with cannabis as they are truly profound, surprisingly intense, and mindbogglingly psychedelic. As a side-note, I have been smoking weed for a little over a year and a half and it has always been good to me. I've had some trippy highs, many intense highs, but nothing at all like what I've been experiencing as of late. I must also mention that about 2 months ago I had my first and only experience with psilocybin mushrooms - this remains my only real experience with a 'real' all-out psychedelic, barring some half-failed attempts at breaking through on Salvia. I mention the mushroom experience because I'm certain it must have had some effect on my cannabis highs, a theory backed up by just how high I have been getting recently.

It all started when I bought a gram of some 'Sour Diesel Kush' from my friend A, after once or twice of smoking it out of his bong with him and chilling at his place. What's odd about this is that it was only when I brought the weed home and smoked it by myself (from an apple pipe!) that I had my mind truly blown. It was a normal Thursday night, and like usual I made two perpendicular incisions into a nice crisp green apple, and proceeded to pack the top/bowl with bud. For the past few weeks I had been smoking weed that was average at best, so I was surely about to have a different experience, if you will. I packed what I guess was a decent sized bowl of this Sour Diesel Kush, went out back and lit up. I coughed immediately from the smoke, which has to be easily the harshest I've ever inhaled. I had to take a few moments to recover and take the second hit. I think I took two or so more nice hits before the bowl was either cashed or the weed had shrunk down into the center of the apple, rendering it almost unreachable by flame without practically burning my throat.

Upon coming back inside to the kitchen to dispose of the apple and have a drink of water, I realized I was already on my way to being very stoned. Random, quirky thoughts popped into my head as I filled up a glass of water, things I can't even recall but surely made no sense, as if I was having an imaginary conversation with someone that doesn't exist. Now, when I went to my bedroom to lay back and watch TV, the real high started. I gazed in awe, that familiar open-mouthed stoned look, at the television set, which seemed unreal. Unreal is the only word I can use to describe it, it was simply strange. It looked as if it was stretching apart at the seams or something. I laughed uncontrollably at Conan O' Brien as he made jokes while interviewing some dumb guest.

My head was pulsating strongly, and at the same time felt like all of it was on fire. I couldn't see my cheeks but suspected they were rosy red in color. I instinctively layed down on my bed on the opposite side with my feet by the pillow, and for some reason closed my eyes. I began to encounter a wordly array of images, feelings, scenarios, people, creatures, colors, and combinations thereof. This has happened every time I have smoked this weed since, and is beyond words because of its bizarre nature (and because much of it is later unrecovered by my best memory), but I will attempt to describe it all.

One of the first images beaming into my headspace with eyes closed was some kind of frightening storybook creature, blue and gruff, with big brows and leering eyes. The thing was a giant, peering past a tree into a deserted landscape of country lanes surrounded by picket fences on each side. Images like these would appear, and then disappear not long after, though if I thought of them specifically again, surely enough they would make a return.

As I began to peak and peak, more odd things appeared in my mind's eye. Even when I opened my eyes, I could still sense them, as if my third eye was beaming them out like from a projector. One of the more prominent images and recurring themes during the experience was this repeating image of some sort of 1990s kid's toy commercial. Often times I would see a cartoonish, vivid image like the storybook creature described above, and then everything would pan out as if a camera and I would see some outtake of a 90s-looking commercial with kids, filmed against a green screen or all-white background in some studio somewhere. It was not just an empty image, but also strongly tied to my memories of sitting home as a 7 or 8 year old, watching Nickelodeon and Disney, and all the cheesy ads that came with it.

More visions ensued. I clearly remember witnessing an oddball combination of a red pepper merging into a teapot, a lavish English one painted purple and white. Another image was that of a symmetrical Tudor-style house, but somehow constructed of retro skateboarding shoes and skateboards. Again, I would analyze this, and conclude it comes from memories of my neighborhood in New York, with all the Tudor houses that looked so much like the one in my vision. Moreso, I skateboarded as an adolescent for several years, and the skate shoes reminded me clearly of ones I used to wear. It is in this way that these images were/are so striking, as they seem to be a true manifestation of my subconscious, my memories, feelings, thoughts, combined with every image or color or creation I've ever seen in my life.

Some of these visions and images I saw with closed eyes were downright cartoonish, such as claymation-like figures moving about. Some of them probed the memory, such as repeated images of an old computer desktop screen my sister had back in the day, which I used a lot. Some were startlingly complex and intricate, easily rivaling the geometric patterns I witnessed on 1/8th of mushrooms. But all these were brief, no matter how vivid or amazing or psychedelic they were in fact. The high from this particular strain is fairly short, as well.

Overall, I think I've learned that cannabis is or at least can be a true psychedelic. I'd say it's a real probe of the inner subconscious - it can tell you a lot about yourself, past, present and future, when you examine these visions.

	This is my first experience breaking through on DMT.  At the time of the experience, I was an 18 year old white male.  I am still a white male, to avoid any confusion, just no longer 18.  At the time I had a high school diploma and very little college experience, lived with my parents, had a minimum wage job at a fast food restaurant, no girlfriend (although this never bothered me), enjoyed art, psychology, philosophy, physiology and anatomy, neuroscience, metaprogramming, and psychedelic drugs.  This was not my first experience with DMT, but the first time I was able to 'break through'.  I have had past drug experiences with cannabis, DMT, LSD, psilocybin, DXM, nitrous oxide, nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, cocaine, a few opiates, MDMA, LSA (morning glories), 'Spice' Product, 'Bath Salts', Sertraline (SSRI), and I am sure I am forgetting a few other chemicals.  

	It is important to note that at the time of the experience, I had discontinued my daily dose of 100mg sertraline for at least 2 weeks.  

	T-10 days:  My friend D and I split the cost on slightly more than 1 gram of DMT.  It is obtained easily enough, looks like a white powder, and every couple days we smoke some together.  

	T-1 hour: I am over at D's house with D, B, and T.  By this point, D had already broken through for the first time days ago, but I had not because I like to act very cautiously around chemicals I do not know well, especially when, upon reading about DMT (mostly at erowid.org and DMT: The Spirit Molecule by Rick Strassman), I learned that it is quite an intense trip.  Although none of my trips were 'breakthroughs' by this point, they were still quite powerful in the form of intense euphoria, visual and aural hallucinations, kaleidoscopic CEVs and significant time distortion.   

	T-30 minutes:  D and I are putting a DMT/cannabis mix into a small glass pipe, with the intention of sharing our DMT with B and T.  

	T-15 minutes: D realizes he should not smoke the DMT, as his mother is not home and he needs to watch after his very young niece.  He encourages us to smoke the DMT without him.  We comply, and begin to walk to D's Recreation Room. 

	D's recreation room is quite interesting.  It originally was not part of D's house.  One day, years ago, D woke up and his father had put a hole in the wall of their laundry room.  His father then poured cement outside where he wanted the recreation room, hauled a pool table to the middle of the cement slab, and built walls and a roof around that.  The end result looks somewhat like an unfinished garage, with an incomplete ceiling (basically just nothing to separate the 'attic' part from the rest of the room besides the necessary wooden boards), a few couches, tables, ashtrays, etc.  

	T-10 minutes: B, T and I are all in D's recreation room.  B is sitting to the left of me, on the same couch that I am residing on.  T is sitting on a directly adjacent couch to the right of me.  We smoke a bowl of cannabis.

	T-0 minutes: I light the bowl containing DMT, careful not to let the flame directly touch any DMT.  The cannabis packed around the DMT is helpful in getting it to vaporize, and I exhale my first hit.  I then take 2 more hits, the last hit being the largest.  

	T+25 seconds: I hold my 3rd hit in my lungs as I pass the pipe to B, and look at the 'ceiling' of the recreation room, which seems to be vibrating ever so slightly.

	T+27 seconds:   The wooden boards are vibrating in a more violent fashion now, bending at almost 90 degree angles.  

	T+30 seconds: From this point on in the trip, I am unable to perceive time at all.  The boards bend as far as they can and all begin to snap, sending imaginary wooden shrapnel everywhere in my field of vision, but with a pattern to it.  I realize everything is spinning in circles around me and I am pulled up through the ceiling into the sky and into another dimension.  The whole time this is happening, I am being filled up with an overwhelming feeling of intensity.  

	I am surrounded by light and for a moment, feel the most intense fear of my life, but it quickly subsides to a feeling of absolute joy.  I feel as though I am connected, literally connected and one with a benevolent entity that makes up all of existence.  I am the universe, and feel nothing but joy in the form of light.

	The entity then changes from light into a shape-shifting tree that I am inside of.  Vincent Van Gogh could not have created such a beautiful masterpiece.  I see millions of eyeballs, staring at me, occasionally blinking.  These eyeballs have veins and arteries pouring out of their backs, essentially a fleshy spider web, and as the fleshy veins/arteries move farther away from the eyeballs, they take on less of a fleshy nature and more of a wooden nature.  To put it simply, eyeballs are morphing into tree branches.  These tree branches then create a wooden 'spider web' that makes up the walls of the tree that I am inside of.  Simultaneously, I see billions upon billions of cells, giving the tree its real shape-shifting effect.  They are constantly moving around in a pattern that I cannot understand, and they make up everything that exists.  They make up what I am, they make up the eyeballs and they make up the veins and arteries that slowly morph into tree branches.   Existing in this tree seems to last an eternity.

	I look at myself, and I am not myself.  I am made up of white and blue light.  I am some sort of orb.  This is when I begin to come down.  I start floating in a downwards direction, eventually reaching the hole in the roof of D's recreation room.  I float through the hole and see my own body, unconscious on the couch, sitting next to B.  I blink.  

	T+10 minutes: My eyes open and I am once again inside of myself.  There is no hole in the roof of D's recreation room, all the wooden boards are perfectly okay, and I am quite confused.  I feel an incredible pressure in my body, and have no clue what to do with it.  I look at T, who laughs, causing me to remember how to laugh again.  As I laugh uproariously, the pressure in my body subsides. 

	T+11 minutes: Everything is bouncing around with energy.  I am no longer in the breakthrough, but I am still tripping.  I close my eyes and see nothing but rainbows.  I open my eyes and everything is still bouncing up and down, in unison.  It feels like a more natural, more calm LSD buzz than anything else.  The room has an Amazonian feel to it.  

	T+13 minutes: I stand up off of the couch, abandon B and T and run into D's room.  D's room has a completely different personality than the recreation room has, not Amazonian at all.  D's room feels more like an underwater cave.  

	T+14 minutes: I tell D all about what I had just experienced with my first breakthrough and he is happy to hear it.  Everything I say does not make complete sense, causing D to laugh at me a little bit, which I am okay with because I just want to try to explain what I had just seen to him.  

	T+15 minutes: I walk back out to the recreation room to smoke a cigarette.  

	T+16 minutes: I light my cigarette.  It tastes dirty.  I realize DMT makes me dislike smoking, but I smoke my cigarette anyways. (Damn addiction!)  

	T+20 minutes: I am almost back to baseline, with only barely noticeable differences in perception now.  

	T+30 minutes: I am completely at baseline from the DMT.  If I am feeling anything, it is the grass I smoked earlier.  

	Overall I had an amazing first breakthrough experience.  I would not recommend it to those who do not like overly-intense experiences, because I do not believe there is a way to enjoy it without it being overly-intense.  I also advise any user to be careful, because I feel as though there is not much of a way to feel DMT without feeling either intense terror or intense love.  I am grateful that I only experienced less than a second of intense terror, and the upside of ten minutes feeling intense love.  

	Would I do it again? YES.  Except if I do it again, I will attempt to indulge even deeper into the beautiful DMT void.

I feel I have to provide some background story to where I am at this point to adequately express my experience with marijuana. Thus, I have divided this into three sections: Introduction, which provides the story and events leading up to my beginning with marijuana, Enter the Herb: which describes my second, but what I consider my first and most intense experience with marijuana, and The Aftermath, which describes how marijuana has affected my life on a grander scale. If you wish to skip the introduction and get to the experience, thats perfectly fine, but it helps explain my state of mind going into the experience, which I believe to be a vital aspect of the use of any psychoactive.

Introduction 

Some four months before this experience, I was struggling with the question of religion. I have always lived in a Mormon society, but have always perceived myself as lying outside the Mormon circle. Many times throughout my life, I have investigated the church when I find myself at a different level of maturity. From the period of mid-high school to my freshman year of college, I was adamant in resisting religion because I had become fed up with the Mormons. To provide a short explanation about this, the Mormons of my generation are intolerant of different lifestyles and religions, and most will dismiss anybody who argues the complete solidarity of their church. 

Well, when a close friend died before my eyes some three months into my freshman year, I entered a period of intense, debilitating grief. I became open to religion again, as I needed something to assure me that there was another life for my friend. I could not cope with the idea that his spirit had dissolved into oblivion, disappearing. I began investigating Christianity (it seemed the best place to start) and compared and contrasted many different sects and faiths. To my credit, I met with some missionaries and heard them out, but I ultimately settled for the Catholic Church. I grew very spiritually involved with the Catholic Church, and after some four months, I made the decision to become a catechumen, who is a learner who has made baptism their ultimate goal. 

This is where things got messy. I had a good friend from high school, well call her S. Throughout all of high school, I was always very attracted to S but had stupidly chosen to pursue other girls, as S seemed too pious to ever consider with a relationship with a renegade like myself. I took her on a single date after we graduated (same year) and we talked several times on the phone during our first months at college. Of course I was optimistic, especially when we started writing letters to each other. But I was blindsided by the death of my friend, and I dropped off the radar, calling her only once more for her birthday.

I met her at a restaurant where she worked some seven months later just before I became a catechumen, and we instantly reestablished communication. We hit it off, unsurprisingly. She was happy to hear that I had opened myself to religion but, being Mormon, she was unimpressed with my choice of church. Nevertheless, despite my childish prejudice against Mormons and her naive dismissal of all other faiths, we grew closer. Eventually, I drove to her university hours away to see her, and we had a wonderful time. I spilled my heart to her and she said that, as much as she liked me, she couldnt get involved with me because I could never get her to the temple, a hugely sacred place to Mormons where they can perform baptisms for the dead and be wed eternally. I went home heartbroken but understanding. 

Nevertheless, we liked each other a lot. Being open to religion at this point, I decided to investigate the Mormon church one last time, to figure out it was that made S so wonderful. Predictably, I was much more easily persuaded at this point, and I discovered many similarities between the Catholic and Mormon churches that I had not anticipated. From this point on, I was embattled in a dilemma between the two churches. I was determined to conduct my investigation honestly and thus I never made a complete, dedicated decision, a fact that I think ultimately pushed S away. Anyway, I met with missionaries, read the Book of Mormon, went to church with my return missionary roommate, the whole package. 

Well, progress with S was frustrating, but I could tell I was slowly winning. Shortly before Christmas, I told her I loved her, and when I went to give her her gift, she told me we had become too involved, and she was afraid of contaminating my investigation into the church. She cut contact (that is, no calling or texting) and we went back to writing letters. I was in a weird period of resentment and attachment from this point, but I continued investigating the church. Ultimately, I was on the verge of making a complete union with the Mormon church, my ambitions in the Catholic church all but abandoned. 

At this point of time, I was still completing my semester, but she had finished hers, returning to her parents house and significantly cutting the travel distance between us. She came up to see me, my bitterness crumpled like paper, and we spent the rest of the time cuddling, which was much more physical contact than I had had with her up to that point. She came back a few days later, and we became more physically intimate this time. The intensity of the experience indicated to me that I truly loved her, and I was excited about the future. At the same time, she had a tendency to run away when things got too intense, so I was on my guard.

Sure enough, I received a letter a week later, informing me that we were, by all standards, done. This came in the middle of finals week, and I botched my last exam as a result, from which I still havent resolved my grudge. Anyway, I fought her on it, but she couldnt be persuaded. So this was the end for S and me.

After a solid five years of one personal or family tragedy after another, I suppose I had been counting on S to be my better tomorrow. I was finally pushed over the edge when that tomorrow never came, and the emotions I had held back in regards to the aforementioned tragedies came crashing down all at once. I had begun a summer semester of college, and I had entered a period of intense depression that I had never experienced. I continued trying to go to church, but it was hopeless. Every time I went, I was on the verge of exploding, so I stopped.

Enter the Herb 

The depression lasted some six to eight weeks, and I was desperate to find an outlet. I had smoked weed with some friends once the year before in celebration of my late friends birthday, and it was such a great time that my turned there. So I acquired some from a friend and smoked probably four or five hits right after the other. My first experience here was with Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon, and in particular, the guitar solo midway through Time. The experience with the album was ridiculously powerful, and the solo to Time was an absolutely crushing climax that I can most accurately describe as making love to the music. Each note tore through me like the waves of an ocean, and there was only one thought in my mind the entire time: My God, this solo is about love! The climax lasted a good two hours, and when I had finished the album, I returned to Time, and another Pink Floyd song, Pigs (Three Different Ones) replaying the soloes alternately over and over, rolling on my bed and laughing, crying, quivering with euphoria. 

The experience was completely universal to my entire existence (if that makes any sense.) To clarify, my mind, spirit, and body were all climaxing during this time. My mind was tickled to death by the weird movements in the music, and I have come to recognize this brain tickling as tripping. Tripping always makes me laugh because of the alien sensation which comes with it. Tripping is also always a good indicator that whatever I am listening to is quality.

My spirit, best personified by emotions, was completely obliterated, experiencing emotions of awe, completeness, love, gratitude, and connection. This connection came in two pathways. The first, was I felt an intense connection to David Gilmour, Pink Floyds Guitarist. As I listened, I felt that he was baring his soul on the record with clarity and perfection. I felt the connection because, despite the nakedness of his soul in the music, I felt I was the only one who had ever understood it. This sensation I experienced with comparable intensity only with Led Zeppelins When the Levee Breaks and The Beatles Within You Without You.

The second pathway of connection was with three people, S, my cousin R, who is a year younger than me and is one of the very closest people to me, and my sister, T. The connection is difficult to articulate, but it involved a strong, almost insane desire to show these people what I was experiencing, and a link between their souls and mine, one that I felt was astronomically important despite the fact that they were unaware of it. As I described above, the experience was like making love. This was not in the sexual sense, as I am a virgin, but more in the extreme, complete unification between two souls. In this, I understood the term, making love. I understood it to be not an ambiguous euphemism for sexual intercourse, but a perfect description of the resulting harmony when two souls are fused together, as they can be in emotionally charged sex.  To continue, this feeling of making love was what I experienced with these people. I felt no discomfort in using the term in regards to my family members, as the feeling seemed to supersede social definitions and inadequate descriptions of making love as sexual. 

For S, I knew that I was never going to have this experience with her, and that she would never experience the intense, life-altering dimension in which I resided. Nevertheless, I understood that only Ss presence in the world, only her existence was necessary for me to acknowledge her and be with her, and so I was able to bypass the silence between us and make love to her through the music. This was an unbelievable experience that reminded me again of the intensity of the love I had for her. During this time, I perceived God observing my fusion with S and I felt relieved approval. It was as if to say, God had been trying to show me what love meant throughout my entire life and I had finally reached the perfected, flawless love that superseded attachment, jealousy, and even the most heinous betrayals. This was the love that I believed He held for me and wished we as humans would hold for one another. I felt God recede after this approval, as I believed He saw me as having graduated and moved on to his other students. With S, I felt that, having achieved perfect love, we could then go our separate ways without hard feelings, wishing only goodness for one another. Thus, S receded also. It was a sad parting, but one without selfishness.

Once the universe S and I had created split like mitotically dividing cells, I looked for a new connection. This I found with my cousin R. It was not as intense an experience, and I believe this to be because R and I are so similar, whereas S and I were radically different. The resulting harmony then, was less of an awe inspiring event than it had been with S. Nevertheless, Rs connection was also with its uniqueness. R had been a drug addict before, and his addiction to heroin and the resulting damage to his life was one of the family tragedies I had spoken of. Here, I felt that I was journeying to a land that R had already seen - a mystical, secluded island in the universe for which there are no maps, no names, and no boundaries. I have since come to call this island Electric Ladyland in reference to Jimi Hendrixs album of the same name, as I felt it most accurately describes the place where many rock n rollers go and often become lost. Anyway, I felt a connection to R here, and I recognized him as a spirit companion to myself. I recognized that despite the difference in physical appearance between R and myself, our souls were drawn from the same spring, which had only produced enough water (soul) to fill two vessels. As such, making love to R was a celebration of the discovery that we were soul brothers, spirit companions - an innate and inseparable bond. R, interestingly, never receded from my awareness as he was truly a part of me that could never be rooted out. Having made this discovery, I turned to analyze my relationship with my one and only sibling, my sister T.

This was by far the strangest part of the trip. Whereas certainty and enlightenment pervaded every aspect of my connection with S and R, my connection to T was a feeling of intense vertigo, as I was assaulted by the greatest unknowns in the universe. T was my sister, my flesh and blood. She is the only person on Earth who shares my genetic makeup, so I figured connection would be easily analyzed. However, the opposite happened. Ts unique relation to me was confusing: she had been created from the same base components as me, my father and my mothers intertwining DNA. Yet, we were so different. The separateness was as vast as male and female. My life had been one of diligence and upheaval, whereas hers had been fast, erratic, encompassing experience of life. I was so disoriented by the fact that we were genetically similar, extremely close, and similar in personality, yet our life experiences had been so radically different. This experience was too strange. I am unable to articulate the feeling, except it is best characterized as the classic double mirror image, where one stands with a mirror behind and in front, and the resulting image spirals infinitely into the atomic scale. This thought was too much for me, and I began to the feel the sensation that my mind was deteriorating in the face of an unanswerable. In an effort to save my brain, I settled. I resigned myself to the fact that my sister and I both exist and given that we are so close, we could only accept the enigmatic nature of our existence towards one another, while never understanding it. 

Comfortably Numb - The Aftermath 

I felt much better after accepting this, and at last I turned the music down. The music, at this point, was too intense at the concert volume I had played throughout the trip. I drew back from intense music, as listening to it was similar to trying to sprint after a marathon. I switched to Led Zeppelins No Quarter, a perfect change of pace that steadily lured me into sleep.

When I awoke, everything was back to normal. The depression was back, the trip from the night before was nothing but a memory. Of course, I smoked more in the following weeks. I developed an obvious psychological dependence, and music became my outlet. I already preferred classic rock from the 60s and 70s, but now I dived into this music. Instead of going on from what had been acknowledged as my favorite bands best songs, I bought albums and discovered the true depths of the music movement. Music is and has always been an absolutely vital component in my life, and now I was convinced I had discovered the greatest music in modern history. The highest point in my depression came in a single song, Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd. Stoned as hell, the lyrics and mood of the song pierced my soul, but the ultimate moment came during the end guitar solo of that song. It captured my existence and gave it form. It was as intense as my first experience with Dark Side of the Moon, but this time it was the yin to the formers yang. It was euphoric, but mostly because I somebody else out there had been in the same, dark, comfortably numb place I had been. They had escaped the crushing ruthlessness of life through use of drugs. This felt like salvation. In the weeks following the first experience, I had not used weed to pursue the truth-seeing that characterized the first. I only used it to get lost in the music and dissociate myself from my life. 

The turning point happened from the day of my 20th birthday and in the days afterwards. S called me for my birthday, and our conversation was only slightly more than a minute long. This, that she gave me only a minute for all the endless days of emotional ruin, drove me into a rage the rest of the day, in which I was always seconds away from calling her and blowing up. I was disappointed that the perfect love I had felt for her during the weed trip was nowhere to be found, but it was something I could not control. Thankfully, my best friend, M, calmed me down and kept me from conducting such an enraged phone call, which I would undoubtedly regret. (By the way, M is the one who suggested I use music in combination with weed, so he knows all about it.)

I believe this kickstarted my brain somehow, as the next three days saw me become an adult. My philosophy on life drastically shifted, and I realized that adulthood is more a state resulting from the difficulties of life, in which one has to provide their own response to cope, to find enough happiness to keep them alive. As my depression evaporated, my addiction to weed snapped, and my consumption plummeted. After daily use, to where I was stoned as often as I was sober, I think the drop in my consumption disheveled my ability to handle weed. After only casual use, two consecutive times smoking it were both panic attacks, the first of which had me rolling around on my bed, begging God to kill me. Bad trip.

Even without weed, however, I recognized music as the great metaphor for my existence. Previous trips had allowed me to connect with the earth, plants, and animals, and I felt all life was an interconnected phenomenon. I became one of those college know-it-all hippies and I opened myself to all interpretations of the anomaly which is life. Islam, Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism, Confucianism, even Aleister Crowley all became conduits of wisdom as I tried to construct my own interpretation of life. I wrote S explaining my crazy summer in a gentle way without accusation, and received a pretty positive reply, letting us part on as good a note as possible. Since then, Ive been pleasantly surprised in that Ive come much, much closer to the perfect love for S that I had during my experience, as I want nothing but the very best for her despite the pain she caused me and the fact that I will never be with her.

My hippy lifestyle has continued, and I have begun smoking weed again in moderate doses. However, I am no longer abusing it, as I certainly was during my depression. Now, weed is used as a tool to remove the mental blocks my brain has erected, so that I may discover truths I had not previously known. I have also begun to use weed as an entheogen, experimenting in shamanism. My experiences with weed as an entheogen will be covered at a later time.

In conclusion, weed however you choose to use it. It can be used as a toy, a painkiller (both physical and emotional), or as a valuable tool to experience alternate forms of consciousness. I have experienced all of these, and I dont discount any of them. As a toy, it is undoubtedly the least fulfilling of these. Its a good time, certainly, but it also has the potential for a very, very, very bad time. As a painkiller, it has only limited use. I am fully aware that weed itself did not bring me out of my depression, but it did provide me with a way to cope until I could come out of it. That said, I have vowed to never go beyond weed to fight emotional breakdowns. Ive seen heroin and meth destroy people who were looking to these drugs to save them, and I am thoroughly convinced they have nothing but destruction to offer me.

As a tool to find the truth, it is extremely valuable. It may sound entirely ignorant and stupid, but I believe everybody should be high once. It threw open thousands of windows of perception that I never knew existed. In this regard, however, one must always employ scientific skepticism. Some ideas that you come up with on weed are not enlightened they are downright retarded. Anyway, besides weed, I am considering future use in psychedelic mushrooms for both the musical aspect and as a spiritual supplement. 

The one stoner statement I believe Ive come to find truth in is this: Between life and death lies peace. Ive been dead, and Ive been alive. In the middle is peace, which takes into account both of these symbiotic natures of life. Who is God? I have no idea. If he exists, I dont think Hes as simple as any one religion, be it Catholicism, Mormonism, Islam, etc. tries to claim he is. I do believe there is a governing force, however, as I cannot see life as being possible otherwise. For now, my life is dedicated to absorbing all truths from the great, diverse human family. Later, when Im ready, perhaps I will choose one life to dedicate myself to. But not yet.

The meaning of life? I think its whatever you want it to be. You are your own universe.

Cannabis (1) : Alone (16), General (1)

BODY WEIGHT:
111 lb





My first time was incredible. I had tried to smoke marijuana once before but I only got two (really bad) hits, which is very insufficient and dissatisfying, resulting in sobriety.

The second time was with my two friends N and C. N had smoked once before and experienced only the euphoric traits; no disorientation or confusion. Me and C were new journeyers into this astounding dimension!

A few reminders: First, I thought high meant extremely happyI had no idea about the disorientation and dream-like state you would encounter. Second, we smoked I-dont-know-how-much in grams or whatever, but we evenly shared 2 full bushels or nugs. Third, we smoked it out of a tinny- a simple device easier (I thought) than rolling it up. Fourth, we began smoking it in a forest that me and N had known our whole lives; we could be blindfolded and know where were going. (This forest was only a few acres big though.) Fifth, we began smoking it around 5:00pm-ish. This is in Ohio around Novemberish, so light fades away at 6:00pm-ish (at least from a dim forest perspective) Sixth, we were all around 15-16years old, sophomores in high school. Seventh, me and C are straight-A honor students (ironic, I know).

Okay, so were sitting there in our three white chairs right in the middle of the forest. I dont believe there is one spot in this forest where you CANT see some sort of house or building (which is reassuring in case of emergency). We each have our own lighter. It takes about 45 minutes to smoke it all. The first thirty minutes of smoking we were laughing hysterically and uncontrollably at random moments. After we were done (45min later) we started walking in the opposite direction from my house for no reason. We decide to call up our friend J to see if we could crash at his house, but he doesnt answer (I later found out he knew we were going to be high so he decided not to answer). I hung up. We continued in the opposite direction from my house. We were heading towards a little park where we could sit down. By now the forest is getting somewhat dark.

Five minutes after that conversation (+5min since we smoked all the weed), it suddenly hit me and N like a fucking tidal wave. We had no fucking idea where the fuck we were (even though we had known this forest all our lives). I said to myself Holy shit, this is weird, I wonder if anyone else notices this. Suddenly N exclaimed how he was experiencing this same dream-like experience. It LITERALLY felt like we were walking in a dream. While walking it felt like we were hovering or something, and our legs were extremely numb. It seemed as though my legs were mechanical devices and I could just fall asleep while I kept walking.

I told N that, despite our extreme loss of memory of direction, I KNEW the park was just straight ahead. Between our current position and the park was a canyon that was about 500 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 10-20feet deep. To me and N, it looked like a ditch that we could easily skip over. Now I understand somewhat why marijuana is dangerous. Luckily we instinctly knew that attempting to jump this canyon would result in a dangerous fall and a broken leg. I led the group around the canyon. By now C was listening to some tunes (some good classic rock or something) and he didnt seem to be experiencing the same qualities of a true high as me and N were.

We reached the park and sat down in a pavilion. By now it was so dark that you couldnt see 200 feet in front of you (in the forest). We sat down. We began contemplating our next move. C lived far away, so me and Ns houses were the closest. N contended that he had too many people at his house and his room doesnt provide much privacy (his room doesnt even have a door). My whole family (both my parents and sister) were home at my house, AND my house was further away than Ns, but not really that much. I had a room that had a tv, a Nintendo set, and a door. The tv and Nintendo set would give us a reason why us three were hanging out in my room, and the door would provide us with privacy (so we could talk about our states of being when it was closed).

I was so fucking paranoid. I contemplated on staying at the park until the high faded (which would slightly worry my parents and the darkness would be unpleasant). This plan was quickly abandoned as a car drove into the park. We were fearful of it being a cop or something, so we bolted. I decided to take a gas-line (a long, narrow strip of treeless grass about 10-20 feet wide). This would provide us a path halfway to my house (to help us from getting lost). The rest of the way we would have to travel in the dark forest until we reached my house.

So we began. Normally traveling this gas-line would take maybe 10min. To me and N, it felt like it took over a half hour literally. The time distortion was amazing yet it frightened me. I thought about going up to one of the nearby houses along the side of the gas-line and asking for a phone to tell my parents help, me and my friends are stoned out of our minds and dont know where we are. Luckily I didnt. One lesson learned: no matter how out of it you are, try to keep your cool, or, in Dave Chappelles words, keep it real.

C was still jamming to his tunes, not caring. He had the same effects as me and N but the effects were more powerful for me and N because we recognized this area clearly (or at least we did before) and C regardless had never seen this area, so he felt fine.

Skipping in this gas-line would help overcome the sensation of memory-loss and dream-like quality. Thats right, skipping. It looked stupid but it worked. Only while skipping though. You could skip and feel better, but once you stopped the effects came back to engulf you in a massive state of confusion.

The gas-line FINALLY ended and we parted from it into the dark forest. I still had no idea where exactly we were (it felt like we were discovering some new forest), but I told myself to follow this grassy hill (on my left), cross a river, and stumble into my backyard. This is exactly what we did.

Finally we entered my house through the backdoor. I peered into the mirrorour eyes were stoned red. Damn. I advised everyone to NOT make eye contact with my family. We entered my living room and after a well-handled conversation with my parents (which felt like it was in a dream), we departed to my room. There I would say the peak of my high reached. I jumped onto my bed and it felt amazing, like I had just fallen ten feet or something. If I sat still for more than ten seconds my whole body would completely numb over. C and N retired to the Nintendo set. I could not playI was so paranoid and frightened and confused that I just sat on the floor, pretending to text (with my cell phone) in case my parents came in my room (this would allow me to not make eye contact with them).

My mom entered once. She told us that the family was leaving (by now it had been an hour and a half since the smoking, but it felt like four hours to us). She said the family would not be home until 9:00ish. By then our high would be gone (since we finished smoking at around 6:00ish). I was very thankful for this random event. After they left we went into my living room. C and N traded off playing Guitar Hero (or multiplayed). I was still so frightened and out of it that I sat down in my recliner waiting for the effects to vanish. C listened to Black Sabbaths Sweet Leaf (how appropriate) and commented on how perfectly it sounded. I listened to the Doors The End but I dont believe I obtained any powerful insight or sensationI was still so out of it and frightened.

After The End finished, I thought that maybe I accidentally had it on repeat because it felt like it had been an hour or so. I looked at the clock and my heart jumpedONLY TEN MINUTES! I was really freaking out. I asked myself, is that possible? This is about when the peak of the high began to descend.

I began texting a few friends of mine who were experienced potheads. I asked them what to do. They responded to feed the high, or eat food and drink liquids in order to expedite the disintegration of the high. I guess it worked; Im not for sure though. I had begun to eat a TV meal, drink multiple cups of tea and water, and eat random stuff from the fridge.

By the time my parents arrived home the high had worn off. C and N went home (it was about 9:30ish) and I went to bed. The next morning I felt fine. N claimed he still felt somewhat disoriented for the next few days, but not in any way of impairing him from going to school and such.

Me and C are still straight-A honor students to this day. N maintains the same grades that he did pre-baked.

The following is an account of my first experience using any type of drug.
Btw guys, this is pretty lengthy. Just a heads up.

December 1, 2009. Before this day, my perception of drugs were quite misinformed and negative. This was my first time doing any illicit drug of any sort. I had drank alcohol prior but at this point I had never gotten drunk or tipsy. Just to clear up a couple things, I do have Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder and am still currently taking 20mg Adderall XR. This event took place after the medicine wore off though. My mindset was very positive and I expected nothing but good to come from this. (By the way, this is pretty long. Just bear with me. Its pretty interesting).

Over the years I had met a friend who we will call Fernando. On many occasions he told me many a times before, If you ever want to smoke with me you can just hit me up'. I always replied, Yeah alright. I dont really do it much but yeah Ill think about it. In reality, I didnt even smoke pot. I told him I did so I would seem cool. It didnt bother me that he smoked weed. I didnt care. I just told myself I wouldnt do it. 

During my sophomore year I had attained many friends who had at one point smoked pot or did it regularly. I became very curious about the subject and would ask many questions. I did extensive research on marijuana and finally gave myself the green light to try it. Well one day, lets just say, curiosity killed the cat. and it was reborn into an elegant unicorn. 

It was a normal day at school; same routine. After school I went to McDonalds to hang out with my friend. Lets call him M. You see, my friend M smoked pot, and I desperately wanted to try. M used to be a dealer, and ironically, he had no idea where to find any product. I thought my chance at finally getting high was lost, until M and I spotted our friend, whose name also starts with an M, but we will call him Fernando. Fernando knew a guy who sold some really good chronic, well call him G. Fernando hit his guy up and got the okay to drop by his house. We packed into Fernandos grandmas car (his was in the shop) and headed over to where G lives. When we arrived at Gs house he pulled out two bags of suspicious plant matter. This was the enigmatic wonderdrug that I had been dying to try. We smelled the bags, exchanged money for weed and headed off back to Fernandos house. I remember M making a remark saying, This weed smells like Gods vagina. I replied I love that movie. On the car ride back, M had revealed his metal bowl that was carefully concealed in the safety of his pocket. M packed the bowl. He took the first hit. Being the smoking noob that I was, I assumed it was like smoking a cigarette (no I dont smoke cigarettes, but Ive seen people do it.) I just lit the bowl, sucked in, and expected some crazy stuff to happen. Im pretty sure we smoked about 3 bowls on the way back to Fernandos house. Sadly, I thought to myself, Why would anyone do this? This isnt even doing anything. I wasnt feeling the marijuana work its magic. I figured it was a dud or I was immune. But my friends seemed to be acting pretty funny. I thought I might have been immune to the effects. But as aforementioned, I was a smoking noob and wasnt holding it in long enough. The car ride was uneventful.

Everything changed when we arrived to Fernandos house. Upon arriving to Fernandos house, he opened up the garage and we waltzed in. As M and I take our seats in the provided lawn chairs, Fernando puts the weed we purchased in his grinder and gets his one and a half foot Zong out of a closest. At this point I was told the bud was Trainwreck and that my train was about to get wrecked if it wasnt already. At this point I hadnt noticed but Fernando had packed his Zong and was taking a rip. Amazing. Watching his Zong fill with smoke is one of my most memorable moments in my lifetime. Theres something about the way the smoke creeps up that glass that sends shivers down my spine. Anyways, I learned quickly how to smoke from watching my friends. After what seemed like forever, the Zong is finally set in my lap. I packed the bowl. Spark the lighter.  Flame against greens. Blast off. The beginning of my ascension to space begins. I take a massive rip, not realizing how strong and enigmatic hippie lettuce really is. Repeat. The bong is passed left back to Fernando. He then, packs his bong and puts it on the ground. We sat in complete silence for what seemed like forever but in actuality, it was about 12 minutes. Out of no where, we all start laughing in unison. Silence again. At this point, my neck was feeling cold. I told Fernando I was cold and asked if I could wear his jacket. These were the first noticeable signs of onset. I didnt know it yet but my train was indeed about to get wrecked. He obliged and I wore that thing. It was like being strapped to the cone of a rocket accelerating thousands of feet per second into the sun and evaporating..

Oh my gosh, my legs felt like they were decomposing into putty. I felt like I was protected from everything in that jacket. Anyways, we started the stoner cycle again packing more bowls and taking more hits. Eventually, the jacket felt wet. I asked F why his jacket was so wet, he replied with Its not. Dude youre f@#ked up. Am I? M: Yeah dude. As soon as he finished that sentence, I closed my eyes, opened them, and everything was weird; just different. My depth perception was zero and everything looked so very flat. I started feeling pressure in waves down my body, over and over again. It literally felt like someone was pushing the skin against my face. I was literally smacked. It seemed like it hurt but it actually didnt. It was just so different I had no other way to explain it to them. This was the point where I started freaking out in my head. The panic set in. I wanted it to stop so badly. I would have done anything to make that wonderful feeling go away. I didnt understand it. I said nothing. I was nothing. I broke my silence. What have I done? Im never doing this again. M: You say that but. Me: How the hell are you reading my thoughts!? M: You said that out loud. I felt dumb. I was feeling everything and nothing at the same time. M tried to explain to me that this will be the best smoke ill ever have. He was soooo right. I have smoked WAY more than I did that day but nothing will ever compare to it. I whispered, I couldnt give 3 f@#ks about 4 f@#ks. M: Jared, youre a f@#king crack head. In my head, Insane in the membrane, insane in the brain is played on a constant loop. I was having irrational thoughts. Then as soon as I would have them, I would get sidetracked and forget what I was thinking about. At one point I stood up, ran around my friends grandmas car, and laid on the hood. Dude not the car! Me: Whoops. I stood back up, closed my eyes, and opened them back up. Some how I managed to wind up with my face on the lawn chair. This was a safety safe for me, where I laid for what I thought was an hour but was actually 2 minutes according to M as I asked him later. I asked Fernando where the bathroom was even though I had been to his house before, I just couldnt remember. Just go out back. Its f#$king freezing man, isnt there a bathroom I can use in the house? I stumbled out the door before he could even answer. This was one of the crazier parts of the night. I was still having those pain waves and they were becoming more intense as the smoking continued. I whipped my junk out, and peed. Suddenly the waves of pressure surged to my member; it made my pee very interesting. As I went back inside I tripped through the door and almost banged my head against a metal bucket. I laid there. M asks me if Im alright. I reply, Im gonna just chill here for a bit if you guys dont mind. 

Shortly after, I rose to my feet and claim my seat in my designated lawn chair. At this point, I put my headphones in and let the Technicolor sounds of Deadmau5 and Wolfgang Gartner caress my cerebellums third eye. It was finally opened. We sat there, rambling about nothing and listening to our iPods. Time flew by. I had no sense of time or space. It felt like a dream. Its sort of similar to when something REALLY good or astonishing happens and you arent even sure if it is actually happening. I wasnt even convinced all of this was real. At this point I realized I needed a ride home. We all packed into Fs grandmas car and the ride home commenced.

Today was 4/20 and I had been experimenting with cannabis for the past month or two to no avail. Today, however, was different. Last night I purchased a 20 sack, and smoked about 1/4 bowl in a poorly rolled joint (my first attempt at one). I don't know if it was the THC or the atmosphere or both, but the night was very nice, I smoked the joint in a place I had been looking for in the past, and stumbled upon just that day, an abandoned warehouse/dairy factory on a cliff looking at the skyline (which was not far away, I was in downtown.)

T=0:00
School was out about an hour and a half ago, so it was about 3:30 in the afternoon, and we were at a mountain biking park. I was with 4 other friends, all basically first-timers with weed, and 3 of whom were ladies (A good day even without the cannabis). We smoked about 3 medium sized bowls, I consumed about, if not more than half of the total.

T=0:10 
No noticeable effects, same as my past failed attempts, I felt like I was almost high, but not at all. The hike back up about 50 vertical feet of steep hillside to the city was no different than all the times I had done it without smoking.

T=0:13 
About a block and a half away from where we started, going to the car to get the munchies, I turned my head back to look at the group and WHAM! It hit me, my vision went into what I called Spontaneous Sensory Lag, everything in my sight when I turned my head went blurry, with very defined horizontal lines, almost like I could see the ground moving opposite my turning head. We reached the car and I could feel my knees tingle, I was overjoyed, my doubts were gone, I was actually getting stoned! However this sudden change of events began to freak me out a little bit.

T=0:15 
We were planning on walking to the park 5 blocks away, in an unfamiliar neighborhood with many dead ends and curved streets. I decided to run ahead to find the way, I made it half a block and it seemed like I had been walking forever, my thoughts were changing in a strange way, almost like they were cut up at random points, but if I thought about them in whole, they were fluid. My friends now started to mimic my effects (They are first timers and known to overblow things, so I was suspicious, but I also didn't really care.) Distances seemed incorrect, I could wait for my friends for what seemed like a minute only to look back and see they had progressed only a few feet. Along with this came a distortion of my perception of time, which I found to be somewhat split into two tracks, one short term, which seemed very fast, short lived and choppy. The other being long term, which seemed dragged out, slow and patient, not at all choppy. I found it very hard to concentrate. My slight fear had almost completely gone away.

T=0:20(about) 
My thoughts began to change all the time, I had to work hard to keep focused, I found myself switching from 'I have to get to the street sign' to something completely different and often the thoughts were void of any thought at all. My body was very tingly and I had a strong urge to lay down right there in the street, but I would wait until the park, my only motivation to move at this point.

T=0:25 
We got to the park, which unlike the other one nearby is not filled with stoners and druggies, but children and their parents. We all sat down in the shade and ate chips, I had to go to the bathroom and my round about journey to all 3 bathrooms in the park took only 4 minutes, though it seemed much longer. I also noticed a confidence boost, I was able to flirt freely with complete strangers, and quite well too.

T=0:50 
We headed for the swingset, about the time we got there I felt like the high was wearing off, but the swinging brought it all back. At first I felt constricted like I was being forced to stay close to the ground, but once I broke out of that I closed my eyes and was swinging as high as I could, the feeling was immense, my eyes had a frame around them, the kind of thing you see after you look at something bright, not much of a visual, I think I just noticed it a bit more than usual.

T=1:10 
I spent about 20 minutes laying down, and then listening to some Flaming Lips on the grass, it was a calm period, very relaxed.

T=1:20 
We got up and walked to the car again, this time my thoughts and perception wasn't broken up near as much, everything was flowing much better, and recognizing all the places I had seen on my way to the park was really enjoyable.

After that we moved on to the stoner park and threw a disc around, I was pretty bad, dispite my normal athletic ability, we climbed some trees, and for the most part had come back to baseline, but the effects were still slightly noticeable. All in all I had a very good first real high with marijuana, and on 4/20 no less.

Im not going to incude all of the talking and conversation that went on throughout my experience.But dont get the impression that we were doing this silently the whole time ya know...

Background/Mindset of experience:

Before this experience about 4 years ago I was sort of a rebelious person. I hung with the stoner/rebel croud and often did what they did accept for smoking pot. Its not that I was against it but I guess I was just intimidated by it i guess. I was around people who did it but somehow never convinced myself that it was anything I would benefit from. Again this was 4 years ago and I have settled down alot and am not a rebel but I do still smoke pot to this day frequently. The closest thing to any drug was drinking vodka or other alchohol on occasions. Anyway the mindset I had in my experience was eagerness, and scared because I didnt know what to expect ya know? But I tried to stay calm throught it and it was sometimes pretty hard. The settings I was in were in a shed, outside the house and inside different houses and we just chilled inside after we were blazed.

Events that lead up to it and smoking it:

It was the winter of 2004. One of my best friend(I'l call him J) was performing at a talent show at the high school he attended in a band with A and E. After missing the performance the show was shorty afterwards done so me and J's brother N got a ride going to A's house where eventually Me, N, J, A, E, and A's friend R(sorry if its confusing) were grouped together outside his front door talking about what we where about to do. After talking about a good place to toke A led us up a street and into an ally-like gravel back road above his house that had an old shed off to the side. The whole way there I was excited/horrified at the fact that I was about to get baked. I really didnt know what to expect or how it would feel. I was full of adrenaline. As we approached the shed I was actually shaking with fear while E(the oldest of us) was trying to calm my nerves telling me to '...enjoy it man.Dont make it an uptight and tense experience.' Once inside I think I quickly found a seat on a can or something(that i cant remember) and imediatly heard the door shut. And at the same instant J's cell iluminate the dark shed with the 6 of us in there. I faintly remember R touching and feeling around him for something(I was still talking to Elgin). After about another minute the cell was illuminating an obect I had never seen in real life.I knew it was what the stoners called a bong but I had never seen one in rea life. When R pulled a lighter from his pocket, and put his mouth to the top of the bong, I heard a confusing bubbling noise and N whispered to me 'Dude were gonna get fucked up!' I couldnt even reply and questions were going through my head like...what if we get caught?, how long will it last?, What if I have a bad reaction?, Am I ready?? And to my horror...the bong was already at E...who was right beside me. The shed was by that time pretty smokey. E nudged me while he was holding a hit to take it. I  hesitated for seconds but took it so my friends wouldnt think I was a sissy. A gave me a good rundown as to how to hit the bong. It seemed easy enough but I was still scared out of my mind. I sparked the lighter and began to draw air where I heard the familiar Bubble sound and held it close to the bowl which contained  fading embers that quickly changed to a glowing cherry as I was taking the bong rip. I dont remember how long of one I took but I do remmber that within seconds of lifting the bowl from the bong I was coughing madly and couldnt stop for around 2 minutes. Meanwhile the bong was still being passed around. Im pretty sure more weed was put in but I wasnt watching. As a newbee again I wasnt sure what to expect or if I had even did it right. From what it looked like to A he said that I did it all the right way accept for nnot holding the hit long enough. However each time the bong was passed to me, I got the hang and by the time we where about to leave I had gotten around 5 good sized hits that seemed to impress my friends. Through this whole experience I was coughing, especially with my first hit because of what I thought to be the smoke in the small shed. 

The Effects:

I wasnt sure exacty what to feel or what was going on.It was so dark and smokey and just uncomfotable at this point as we all exited the shed. As I exited I took one big breath of cool fresh air and opened my eyes.I was immediatley aware of the change. When I would move my hands, arms or legs I would subcontiously know I was doing it but I couldnt feel myself doing it and every noise or sound would be surrounding me but very dul and smooth(if i can describe it).It was just kind of a numb and quiet word. This at the time was very new to me so it scared me. I remember that every time someone would talk to me I woud hear it but it wouldnt process in my brain for a couple seconds and my vision. Everything so different. I cant emphasize enough how much different and confused I was from the time I entered the shed to when I got out. When I would turn my head and eyes the view I was seeing would have to catch up to where my eyes went. Sort of delayed frames. I also found that I would continuously get lost in the most random thoughts I had ever thought of. Thoughts that I never would have thought of in a sober mind. Some very creative, some scary, some had nothing to do with life at all. It was just thoughts about random objects that would kind of morph into the next thing my mind would come to think about. The whole time for some reason I was very paranoid that we would eventually get caught and I woud get hella busted. I dont know why but I remember that constant paranoid thinking I had. 

I was staying the night at N and J's house so I wouldnt have to worry about going home to get caught which helped me calm down a bit. As we entered A's house the bright lights of his basement was somehow relaxing to see. If I could explain how my vision was just then I would call it being in a kind of relaxing, trance, dazing feeling. The lights where somehow bright but also somehow not very bothering to me it was just very confusing. As we started talking and entering A's room I found that once someone would bring up a conversation with me, I couldnt quit talking but after I was done talking I would recap in my head what I said and it was very descriptive if I can describe it. For example, it was very easy to build off an idea or come up with a thorough answrer or remark to what the other person said to me. Sometimes I would think about what I said and it didnt even make sense. Coming in the house had aso brought down my paranoid thinking. And for around what I thought was 2 hours I had been in this trance of talking babble and relaxing numbness. After some hours the effects were waring down and I was sowly coming back to the real world. 'Coming Down' as I was told it was called by E. We were listening to Lil Whyte's -Oxyconttin when A pulled out around a dub more of weed and a glass pipe that was very small.(I never really knew where the bong we used was or what happend to it. I think they kept it in the shed). The pipe was better for what A wanted to do next anyway. A's plan was to use the rest up out side the basement door. The front door led to the top story of the house and once downstairs I  you just had to walk across the room to another door that led outside to where the vehices were parked. I wont go through details about all that went on but to keep up to date, R went home about half an hour before this and E wasnt going to smoke anymore. So only me, J, N, and A were going to smoke from A's pipe. Again skipping through the details, I got quite a few more hits.One I remember not holding it in long enough. Thats when I finally thought about the hunger taking over my stoned body. From the very first time of entering the shed to right now(around 3 hours later) hunger hadn't been a priority.This to this day is very puzzling to me because since then I have smoked much more pot and am always getting the munchies very shorlty into my high. Anyways fastforeward the future about 20 minutes we (me, J, and N) were getting dropped off at there house by E and I gueass I fell asleep in the car.  [Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

The next thing I remember was going into their house and collapsing on their sofa and the smell of this asian food shortly afterwards. While gobbling a plate of rewarmed up food that J prepared for me and N,I got a random thought of accomplishment that made me giggle to mysef(i was still high). That night I had smoked with a Philipino(E) and two Asian brothers(J,N) and two Caucasians(A,R) and myself (half Black and White). This thought amused me and it was like people from 3 different continets got together and smoked. I had an excelent night of smokin the reefer for my very fist time.

The Next Day:

I knew I wasnt high anymore when I awoke that day but something was still different. It was hard to pay attention and I would often space out in conversation or get lost in thoughts of the events that happend the previous night. It was also kind of a slow day but an excitment/achievement feeling was burning inside me and all I could think about that day was the night before.Little did I know that I, would become a frequent pot smoker. I soon realized how easy it was to get ahold of the magical substance and would smoke much more by myself, with the same friends, and new ones in throught all the years ahead of me to this very day. A great loss was when J and N moved away... but I still kept blazing.

I would recomend it to anyone who lives a life of stress or just likes to feel good alot and wants a positive way to look at your surroundings.

Anyway thats what I have to say about this Magical herb and my first experience. Have fun and be safe.

It was a late-fall day, and my friend had prepared some dank firecrackers for me out of .5 gram of these headies called headband, a strain that had been wreaking havoc all through my group of friends, notorious for it's huge peak and devastating low. The strain is named after an iconic feeling you get while under it's influence, you feel like you're wearing the biggest headband in the world. 

I planned on eating the firecracker during school (first mistake), since I wouldn't be around for the weekend's festivities, I would get real high on Thursday, but come down in time to do some school work at a friend's. I had eaten brownies before, and I was/still am a frequent smoker, so I thought little of the day ahead of me. Hah, little did I know...

T-0 hour, 1:00PM, I munch down the firecracker. It tasted somewhere between campfire, dankness and stale nutterbutter. The drymouth that followed was devestating. I had timed it out and allowed myself 30-40 minutes before my gym class (I was psyched) for it to set in. It crept up slowly, and I almost didn't notice it, but looking back, it started somewhere in the middle of gym, and that was the most incredible gym class ever. I don't think I did much beside stand there, but I thought I was in Vietnam, so it's cool.

T-1hr, After gym class, I made the first mistake of the day. At this point, I could feel the body high, and it was incredibly powerful, a bit more intense than brownies, but my head was relatively clear. My friend asked if I wanted to go smoke a couple bowls before school ended. Now, you must understand that I smoke fairly regularly, and I've gotten pretty stoned out of my gourd, but I had never been too high, you know? Like completely bonkers. I had a feeling there was a line that once crossed brought you into the realm of the hopelessly zonked, but I was not sure where it was or what it would take to get there. After that fateful day, my definition of baked would change forever.

T-1hr 10 mins, I agreed to smoke.
We trudged on over to a pretty spot off school grounds, sat down and began smoking. It felt like the moment that ganja smoke whipped down my throat and swirled around in my lungs, I was infinitely higher, an effect I had never felt before and it unsettled me a little. 

T-1 hr 20 mins, Two bowls (roughly 1 gram) later, and I'm gone. Straight up destroyed. Really. Fucking. Baked. I recall that my two friends were talking about something and packing up, but I was too busy looking down at my body and and thinking that I looked like a giant robot or a puppet or something. I don't remember the walk back at all.

T-1 hr 45 mins, We returned to school just as the last bell was ringing, and as it rung, feelings of anxiety and fear pervaded my body. I did NOT want to be in school, let alone... crossroads. 

After school at my school, literally every student and their dog likes to congregate at a gigantic crowded spot in the center of the school called Crossroads. It's actually pretty convenient for socializing and planning shit out normally, but not when you feel like you're riding a space-horse with Jesus, like me. I knew my eyes were blood red, I probably smelled, and I could not properly formulate a sentence. I tried to look down and avoid eye contact as much as possible, but a lot of people saw me, and each person would say Haha you idiot! You're so high! or You're eyes are so red. Safe to say, I was TWEAKING THE FUCK OUT. I kept going to my friends saying Yo, man, we gotta get out of here! We're not supposed to be here, like that made any sense, and they just laughed at me.

T-2 hrs, Eventually, what seemed like 26 hours later, we were walking the halls and I was feeling a little better, but still anxious. I had only been able to put eye-drops in one eye, as I ran out of drops before I could put some in the other, so I just looked goofy. This was one of the various relative lows that tricked me into thinking I was coming down. At various points, I felt like I was less high than before, but then it would smack me in the face again. This particular instance was probably me coming down off of smoking, but I'm not sure.

At this point I had completely lost my sense of time. I yearned for something to eat, and a place to sit down and ride this one out. 

T-2.5 hrs, By some strange anomaly of space-time, we ended up in the cafeteria at what I can only assume was around 3:30. It was darkish in there, but I didn't mind, I was just chillin' on the table, minding my own business. My friends were talking about something, but sitting on the table I was just so gosh darn comfortable and so deeply occupide by my ruminations on the intacacies of life that I slowly drifted off to sleep. I fell asleep. I did. Right there on the tables in the school cafeteria after school had ended. I fell the fuck asleep. Shit. Clearly I was still way too high. I began to feel like I was drunk, almost, like I was falling slowly backwards through sand. I was dizzy, and felt a little weird in my belly. I jumped up (mistake), got SUPER lightheaded and shouted GUYS! I'm tooooo high! and they just stared at me and said Yes you are, you are so pale! and I said I know! I gotta go to the baffroom, aight they just laughed, and I sprinted over to an inconspicuous hidden bathroom to chill out. 

T-3 hrs, Now, four things happened to me on that toilet. The first was that I had the most satisfying dump of my life. The second was that I apparently lost control of my major muscle groups, as random parts of my body would just give out, causing me to bob and fall over at times. The third and most fascinating thing was that I began to hallucinate. Not just like, oh things look a little different, straight up seeing things. The floor was a grid pattern and I stared at it forever! It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen! It was pulsing and vibrating and always changing. It would cycle through different ways of pulsing and moving like Christmas lights. I also saw what I can only describe as golden helices everywhere floating across my vision. Also spaceships. Lots of spaceships. 

T-6 hrs, The final thing that happened to me in the bathroom was that I obviously lost track of any sense of time, for when I peered at my phone to check the time, it was seven. I had sat on this toilet for..... drumroll.... 3 hours. How had I done that? It felt like 15 minutes at MOST. Jesus. 

T-6 hrs 10mins, I realized I had to leave, and in a delicate process of moving my body ever so slowly, I raised myself off of the toilet seat and called my friend Dane. Still stoned heavily.
	He answers, Hey JP, what's up?
	I'm in the bathroom.... uh..
	What? Are you okay?
	What?
	Are you okay?
	I'm in the bathroom.
	You're stoned aren't you
	Very and then I started laughing hysterically.

T-6.5 hrs, Eventually, Dane found me and brought me to his house, where I ate a lot of delicious food, played with his bunnies (fucking rad) and had mad intellectual talks. I left his house at 9:30ish, and realized something. I thought I had come down, but no, I was actually so stoned for so long that I just got used to it... I was still high, but being high just felt normal at this point. Once I got home, I sank  into the couch. And slept for two hours. Upon waking, realized I was still destroyed, I hiked to my room and fell asleep. I awoke sober, but feeling... odd... I went over the events and realized that I should never mix a heavy body high (firecracker) with a heavy heady high (smokin' headband). Though, looking back, it was not a bad experience, because now I know and recognize my boundaries. Another lasting effect of the trip was that my tolerance went WAY down, but in a strange way. I get super high, but sober up within two or three hours. I haven't eaten firecrackers since, but I'm curious. Let this be a warning to those experimenting with heavy edibles. They are no joke! And you will be stoned off your ass! Or in my case, on your ass... on a toilet seat... for three hours.

I was already in a jolly mood, having resently moved a bit further away  from the hectic life in the city to a small village, and had come to town for a party that was held in a commune that's a local legend for it's parties. I had been smoking my bong since waking up, and was already quite buzzed waiting for my friend who was to accompiany me for the party. On the phone he'd mentioned he'd gotten us something a bit more special, but since such things aren't talked straightly about on the phone, I had no idea what it'd be. LSD? Speed? In my spare time waiting I also drank a 75 cl bottle of 10% white wine and had a few hits from my ½ l bottle of Jack Daniels.

He finally arrived around nine, and indeed it was something special, since I consider all new experiences as special. I had never tried Bromo-Dragonfly since I had no trustworthy supplier, but since I've shared the last ten years of my life with the guy, in a sense, he is one of the few people around I know who've taken a wider range of substances than even I have, and I had my RC days...

It was just like your basic paper, the other side looked like it could be from a carddeck, and the other was white with a small clear print of BDF. 500 mics he said, and I believe it. Knowing the onset could take frustratingly long, we spent another hour smoking and rolling joints for the party.

When we got there, it was on. In under thirty minutes we were already offered cannabiscakes, the mood there was lively and we ended up immediately sitting in the kitchen, the heart of a houses social life. Since atleast half of the people there were either my friends or their friends, neither of us felt any unnesessary fears or such, we blended in just fine.

Since we'd taken the BDF three hours earlier, and I already had the sensation I have with acid rising that 'somethings coming', I took my friend upstairs, where the middle room at the top of the stairs is colourful in many ways, in lighting, in decoration, set up as a lounge to lay around in. A great place if you're expecting something visual. And it all went well, when it finally hit me I don't know if it was BDF or the alcohol, but I did have some short blackouts, some of wich I've remembered later on. But the loss of ego in a sense, that was wonderfull, I gave two girls the massage of their lifes, played drums with people, in one of the bedrooms there was a bit of a rave going on. And since it's Finland, a party ain't a real party without a sauna that's on all the time. It's almost impossible to precisely describe how the heat and steam felt, expect that they were wonderfull aswell. Everything was. The steam took colours when I wanted it to, I was very in control.

Afterwards I left the party at an unknown time, and headed to a place I'd arranged for myself to sleep in, but sleep ofcourse, was no option. I kept slowly drinking beer and smoking alone the entire night, feeling, pondering. I think after the actual onset around 1 AM the actual rising of it took like 12 hours or so. The visuals were truly great, so flexible and somehow controllable.   

The day I spent meeting friends and doing the prementioned, until I took a bus home, fell asleep around eight only to wake up at midnight to still a very jolly mood, restarted drinking with my roommate for a few more hours and finally crashed to real sleep after taking double of my normal 2 mg rivotril and a few valium.

Needless to say, the aftereffects are possibly the longest I've ever had. The next day I woke just in time to rush to my first meeting with the local social worker, and If I wasn't experienced with psychedelics, I think the meeting could have been akward, since her face kept flushing and I occasionally heard 8-bit Nintendo-like soundeffects out of nowhere. But in my case, the meeting went well. Later that day I had no more visual effects, but the occasional odd sound still came once in a while.

In retrospective, for me it was great, and I already eagerly wait to try it in privacy without the booze, in a very different sort of place and setting. It's just so long lasting, I'd recommend anyone thinking of trying it to do so on a friday, if they're in school or work or something like that...

I came across a low priced 1/2 oz. and decided to bake brownies. I used the method of heating up the vegetable oil and adding the marijuana to that. It turned a deep brown color, smelled horrible, and sat on the heat for a few minutes until it looked fully cooked. I let it cool, proceeded with the brownie recipe, and cut the final product into 12 evenly sized squares. After de-stem/seeding (and removing some for smoking) i had about 12.5 grams in the mix... so there was a good gram baked in each brownie.

I didn't eat any that first night (I had to drive), but the feedback from four of my friends said they were very excellent. I was going to see LOTR3 so i decided it being a 3.5 hour movie I'd try them out then. I ended up splitting one with a friend (which was probably a good thing). The onset was difficult to recognize, it wasn't like smoking at all. My head remained relatively clear, but the body buzz got increasingly intense. It finally got to the point where I considered leaving the theater, and felt very near a panic attack, but it seemed I reached a peak and things kept at a pretty steady level. Mentally, my head was 90% clear. I was able to think, observe, and understand things relatively normally. Physically, I felt like I couldn't have moved if I wanted to. It was just a extremely deep state of relaxation. Then the effects would go away for about 20 minutes and I'd think the experience was done, but it would come back just as strong for another 20 minutes. The effects wavered like this for a good 3 hours before finally starting the long comedown.

The positives of the brownies were that it was a extremely intense body buzz but with a very clear head. In that sense it reminded me of psilocybin, but without the profound insight, beyond deep thinking, and empathy/understanding towards the universe.

There were a few drawbacks to the brownies. For starters, the cottonmouth was the most horrible I've ever experienced. I constantly felt like I was choking. I would have gotten a drink, but in my physical condition and with the theater being maxed out there was no way I could have made it across my row and down the steps and back... so I suffered through it. Second, I was left with a pounding headache for the rest of the day which felt more like a hangover than anything else. Lastly, I wasn't able to keep my eyes open after I came down. I was on the verge of passing out for the rest of the day.

Overall, I prefer the effects of smoking weed over eating. I found the brownie experience to be a little dull and monotonous, and what normally would be an exciting and visually outstanding movie seemed boring and drawn out because I was more focused on my dry mouth than the storyline, although a whole brownie would have been far too much for me. I think in a different setting I may have had a different attitude, although I'll probably just sell the rest.

(powder / crystals)





BODY WEIGHT:
215 lb





So for New Years, after reading the trip reports available and trying to gain as much information as possible about 2c-c, my partner and I decided on the following doses:
I ingested 40mg 2c-c dissolved in water and mixed with juniper berry soda. He ingested 50mg dissolved in water and mixed with vanilla cream soda.
Wed heard reports on epic doses and reports on minor doses and decided that dividing what he had in half (more or less) was the best option.

We wrote down the time we dosed but decided against checking the time at all through the trip. While we waited for the onset we decided to put on some music with visualizations and cuddle up in bed.  Between kisses and cuddles the music started to take on distinct and detailed layers (as it tends to when Im high on anything) but I wasnt feeling much on the 2c-c as far as physical effects go.  

We proceeded to make-out and get naked; this seemed par for the course as we regularly have our own mini-orgies on 2c-i.  As we rolled round together I began to feel the muscles in my body spasm at random intervals.  It felt as though wires suspended my body and each cord was being cut away violently. Every part of my body felt as though it was being loosened and then left slack. This sensation started in my legs and moved randomly throughout the rest of me.

We decided to smoke a little weed to help the trip along. As we started having sex I felt as though I was continuously climaxing without actually having an orgasm. To me, it felt as though it would be difficult to actually come although on 2c-i neither of us had problems. Everywhere he touched me I could feel the ghosting of his touch against my skin; it was an incredible sensation.

Eventually the sex started to wind down back to cuddling. At some point we debated what time it was although neither of us could say for sure and we didnt want to look and my partner decided to use the washroom. It felt like he was gone for more than 20 minutes. In that time, without him (and the feel of him) to focus on, my attention shifted to the colors the visualizations were throwing on the walls and ceiling. My body felt weirdly silhouetted against that. I stretched my arms towards the ceiling and played with my fingers against the colors. My fingertips felt like they were full of electricity.

When my partner finally returned he announced that he had had difficulty escaping the distraction of the bathroom floor. Later and sober he explained that he looked down while he was standing in the bathroom and the green linoleum patterns looked like waterfalls falling away beneath his feet while he stood on a sheet of glass above them.
He got back into bed with me and we started to cuddle again but every touch suddenly seemed a lot more sensitive. I should probably mention that sober I have a problem with being tickled. I dont handle it well, Im extremely ticklish and I am fully capable of working myself up into an agitated frenzy.

He tickled me a little  I think as a joke  but it felt so much worse. I couldnt stop laughing, even the sheets started to take on an odd sensation as I thrashed around in them.  He tried to touch me sensually but now it felt as though the wires between tickles and pleasure had been completely crossed.  I tried to communicate this to him but he took it to mean that maybe tickles could now be sexualized instead of the opposite way around where sex would now become an unbearable ticklish mess.
He couldnt hold me still, he couldnt keep me quiet  and in fact, when he tried it made matters much worse. I would calm down if he wasnt laughing or touching me but if he touched me or squeezed me the wrong way I would start right back up again. His laughter only made me laugh harder. 

As I kept thrashing around in the blankets I began to notice extremes in hot and cold, too. Id get to warm under the covers but then out of them I would be freezing.  The cold made me spasm the way the first onset of the trip had. When I tried to hold on to my partner for warmth and for solidity he declared that I felt like a newt against his skin.

Suddenly the word newt became just as aggravating as being tickled and I begged him to take it back. Every time he said it or I said it the word only proved to send me back into a tickled frenzy. My laughter started to turn to full-out crying as I begged him to take it back but as soon as he hugged me and said hed take it back I just went right back into fits of giggles.

Laughing and crying became completely interchangeableI was between sobs with tears rolling down my face and total hysterics. It was completely bizarre; when the crying would start I would feel genuine sorrow and then the laughter would send me right back into a frantic mania. The two feelings seemed so close together that I was having a difficult time separating them again.
Eventually I did calm down and we rested in bed against each other. I think I must have been sliding in and out of sleep because before I know hes popping out of bed and suggesting dinner. I didnt feel completely down but I was no longer in the trip, either.

The world around me just seemed to have a weird and plastic quality to it. Lights had a bloom/halo around them and walls seemed misplaced  like kitchen shouldnt have been cordoned off from the rest of the world.
As he made dinner I sobered up pretty quickly and we smoked a little more weed.

It felt like it should have been at least 11pm; the actual time was 9:45pm.

I get an erection whenever I'm stoned on cannabis or its derivatives, whenever I attempt to urinate.

I first tried cannabis when I was 13, the date posted, and became extremely stoned, with a friend, at the beach on a nice day. I liked this a lot. My experience was probably very similar to that of many who have tried good cannabis, and in that regard was nothing unique, until the time came that I could not put off urinating any more. I had, up to that time during the experience, registered an increasing bladder pressure periodically, but became distracted by surrounding, conversation (such as it was), much laughter etc, repeatedly so.

As with most folk experiencing cannabis for the first time I felt I had to re-learn how to do everything anew. Just walking across the sand dune to an area of bushes to have a piss took a fair amount of concentration. (As did attempting to talk, listen, and pretty much everything else.) Nothing strange, there, although everything was strange at the time. In a very good way.

I unzipped, pointed my member at a tree trunk, and let fly. I felt the familiar sensation of the pressure building, and the sharpness of imminent urination - the sensations were somewhat exaggerated - and felt like I was actually urinating, but all that happened is my penis rapidly swelled into a very pronounced erection. It felt as though the urine had inflated my penis (and kept inflating it) instead of coming out the end. I wondered if I'd done  some kind of damage.

The contradiction, and the sight of my erection seemed very funny. It was unusually swollen and seemed to glow with each throb, a bit like a heat lamp. I giggled for a time, stumbled around a bit, then tried to piss, properly. At this age, in the late 60s, I had no idea about sex, what erections were for, or the mechanics/sensations of orgasm. All my learning was from a standard child-friendly pamphlet. I was still waiting for the 'special dream' that would signify my entry into adulthood, but had really not given it much thought. 

My piss attempts involved firstly trying to push it out, then when that didn't work, relaxing it, then squeezing the pc muscles hard as though stopping the flow of urine, then relaxing again, hoping it would start. At that point my penis became very rigid, started to spasm, and about a minute later I had my first orgasm, which was pretty mind-blowing. I wasn't even stimulating my penis, just holding it so I wouldn't pee all over myself. I can still see each squirt flying up to around head height, before sailing out and down and hitting the tree trunk. It seemed to go on for a long time. At first, and for a while, I thought it was a hallucination, until it was finished, and I was able to see the stuff on the ground, and on the tree trunk, and verify that it actually existed, and definitely wasn't urine.

My friend had seen the whole thing. He'd been able to urinate normally (lucky bastard) and was both impressed and a little weirded out at what was happening. (So was I.) Since we were both finding everything very weird as a result of being stoned for the first time anyway, it was just another magical weirdness; sort-of par for the course: part of this brilliant adventure. He had many questions, which, mostly, I had no answers for, but we both worked out what had happened. He wanted it to happen to him, too. I had no idea what to suggest. Sounds naive. It was. We were.

Eventually my penis started to de-tumesce, and  I was able to finally urinate normally, although as I finished, another very abrupt erection occurred, but without the orgasm this time.

Every time subsequently that I have been affected significantly by cannabis, I have experienced an erection during, or sometimes after, the first urination after getting stoned. That first time was the only time I had a spontaneous orgasm in that circumstance, however. I guess the dam was just ready to burst, at that age. 

I have mentioned this to a very few people, and looked for online references to the same sort of event, and come to the conclusion that it must be very rare. I have to say it does make me very shy of using a public toilet for my first piss after getting stoned, for obvious reasons.

Probably one of the most intense experiences of my life...

I had been smoking pot pretty heavily for about three months up until two weeks before these events.  I had quit totally and hadn't had even a second hand buzz.  I found out that I was going to have to take a drug test in about two months so I decided that I would use up the last of my stash.  I measured it out, there were exactly 6 grams there, a little more, but I just left that in the bag.  I got online and found a recipe for peanut butter cookies and gathered all my ingredients.  I ground up the pot in a coffee grinder until it was completely powdered and added it to the batter.  I got six large cookies out of the batch.  I picked peanut butter because it has a lot of oils in it and I baked it at a very low temperature, maybe 200 degrees F.  I didn't use eggs or anything dangerous, just a really basic recipe for baked peanut butter cookies.

I called up my friend who I had expected to zone out with and found out he couldn't make it that night.  Instead of waiting until he could join me I decided to just go right ahead and eat all six cookies.  I really like being stoned outside, and it was a wonderful October evening, light breeze, cool air, not exactly day but not really evening yet either.  I headed out on my usual walk, about 45 minutes long.  I figured I'd probably start to feel it by the time I was done with my walk.  I was very wrong.  About fifteen minutes into my trek I started to feel very stoned.  It was not the slow onset I expected from ingesting pot, but a very violent rush--as if I had walked through an invisible portal into stoner land.

Instead of turning back at this point (which probably would have been wise) I decided to push on and finish my walk.  As I continued on my walk I got more and more confused as to where I was.  I recall leaving the path and wandering through a neighborhood looking for my apartment building-which, by this time, was on the other side of a large train switch yard.  This went on for some period of time which is completely lost to me, it may have been 20 minutes, it may have been an hour.  At some point I found my way back to the main bridge over the train tracks.  I have NO idea how I did this, I was so confused at this point that I thought I was still in high school and about four years younger, I constantly was looking around for my moms car, even though she was over 800 miles away.

I think I stayed in this neighborhood for a rather long period of time.  When I got there it was just dusk, and by the time I had gotten back to the road it was full on night, but I have no idea what happened in-between those events.  I have flashes of walking past houses and trying to look in and realizing how fucked up that was and moving on.  I know that I walked behind some houses trying to get to a river (no idea why I was doing this, it was a terrible idea).  I think in the end I walked in circles for a long time and then managed to leave the way I came in...  I have tried to FIND this location several times since and have never managed to, so I don't actually know where I went for that time.

By this point it was getting very dark, all the cars had their lights on, the street lights were in full blaze, and I was stumbling across this bridge that seemed to go on forever.  At the far side of the bridge is a little retail district with shops and lots of pedestrian walkways.  As I neared this I realized that the shops weren't exactly right.  I had seen them almost every day for a year but now they were just a little bit off.  I stopped on the bridge and looked at them for what was probably far too long.  Suddenly I realized what it was, they weren't real.  I could look at them and see the people walking around and it wasn't real.  It was a model of the retail area that I had seen before, but it wasn't the real thing.

I was now very freaked and and sorta stumbled/sprinted forward past this area and off the bridge.  I was now only about four blocks from my apartment, but it was through a busy bar district on a Thursday night.  Thursdays were big bar hopping nights in this town.  I tried to take a wide path around the bar area but as I walked I would see people up ahead under the street lights and every single one of them looked exactly like my boss's wife.  I would wave to her and try to say something sane sounding and would realize halfway through that this was just a random stranger.  This probably looked utterly ridiculous to anyone nearby.  Somehow I managed to realize this and rushed the rest of the way home.

In the mirror my pupils were massive and my eyes were bright bright red.  My roommate was coming home shortly and I realized that I probably couldn't keep it together if I had to interact with another person one-on-one.  By this point I was hearing voices from outside and believed strongly that they were inside my apartment watching me.  It was probably the freakiest experience I have ever had on pot.  When I heard his key turn in the lock I ran into my room and locked the door and blacked out on the floor.  I woke up sometime after midnight and realized that I was still high.

It was interesting, especially the part where the buildings looked as if they were models of themselves, complete with little model people walking around (but they weren't really walking, more like shuffling, it was very odd).  All in all it was probably a waste of pot, and I think there were lots of things that happened that I will never remember.  Probably the oddest part of the entire experience was that it was very un-pot-like.  Most of the time when I smoke I zone out and just enjoy being around and doing whatever.  This was much more intense.  Unlike regular smoking where I feel connected to everything and want very much to talk to people (even if I can't), with this experience I was incredibly lonely and confused the entire time.  It was too abstract to be really enjoyable or unpleasant.  The things that happened to my body did NOT happen to 'me' and vice-versa...  I don't have anything to really compare this too.  It wasn't a social experience (which is usually how I think of pot) at all, and probably being around other people would have made it much much worse.  I felt very self conscious the entire time, which is also not what I expect from pot.

I have recorded this journal to chronicle a particularly fun weed-smoking experience, display a safe and fun way for novices to sample and experience grass, and demonstrate the diversity of modern marijuana.

I'm a relatively new toker of only about a year but, I've somehow managed to become my brother's and friends' resident reefer guru. I invite them up to my college dorm (smoking section, of course) a few times a month to sleep over, play some video games, walk the city, groove to music, have dinner, and of course, taste the cheeba. For this particular story, I'll refer to the three involved by their favorite foods; Chips, Ramen, and Burger.

One weekend, there was some confusion as to whose turn it was to provide the grass, and all of us brought our own baggies to my dorm. Chips and Burger chipped in and brought two dimes (about one gram each) of a dry cannabis that smelled strongly of oregano. Ramen had a dub (about two grams) of a scraggly but pungent cannabis we had bought from a city dealer a few weeks earlier. I had an eighth-ounce (about 3 grams) of a moist, seedy, faintly sweet-smelling cannabis Ramen and I had just picked up from a friend of the dealer. The end result was that we had a veritable buffet of cannabis to sample, which we jokingly referred to as a pot-luck. We decided to try each variety separately to experience the entire gamut.

The weed Chips and Burger brought up smelled intensely savory and herbal, to the point where we weren't sure if it was even real cannabis. We decided to test it first. I ground one dime, about a gram, in an aluminum grinder and loosely packed it into a clean glass pipe. It was surprisingly smooth to hit, and each of us extracted two decent tokes before the ash plunged into the pipe. I have a notoriously low tolerance and immediately felt a subtle buzz, but even after about ten minutes, my friends hadn't experienced even the slightest tingle. We decided to set off to McDonalds to grab dinner.

Under normal pot-smoking circumstances, I have a tough time stringing together even the simplest of sentences, but I was babbling on the walk. I'm not sure if it was because the grass was weak or I hadn't taken enough tokes, but I had a nice head rush and general positive feelings that subtly crept in and lasted for the entire walk. Chips and Ramen noticed the grass kicking in about halfway through the walk, and Burger seemed to be hit full-force midway through ordering, and bought two entire meals. We finished our food fairly quickly; I still had a decent sense of time and judgment.

While we walked back to the campus, we contemplated which variety we would try next. Chips, my brother, is younger than me but at least two inches taller and probably twenty pounds heavier, and takes a tremendous amount of weed to make significantly stoned. Ramen takes a moderate amount of weed to achieve a satisfactory stone but easily smokes too much and ends up in a silent, introspective mode with occasional weird mutterings. At one point, Burger smoked an absolutely astronomical amount of weed, eventually quitting after he was caught carrying three pounds of the stuff; he was still difficult to make significantly high. I drained my McDonalds drink and used the ice to assemble a frosty bong (water pipe) with a generous bowl of my aromatic grass. 

I always test a small amount of weed after I buy it from my city connection, as the quality varies wildly and without explanation. This particular dealer has supplied me with everything from cheap, granular schwag that delivered a trashy buzz to authentic Purple Haze that literally glistened with trichomes and left Ramen and I with a stupefying high. The sample I tried gave me a unique high that rendered me a giggling mess for hours, and I couldn't wait to test it on the bong.

I took the first hit and was surprised at the sweetness and smoothness of the smoke. Ramen took the next one and coughed like a maniac; wheezing, he passed it to Chips, who drew off a large plume and also started coughing and belching. Even Burger succumbed, coughing like an asthmatic after he took a thick pull. This was particularly surprising; Burger was a guy who regularly smoked joints the size of carrots and carried his pipe more often than his wallet. I took another draw and was floored by the surprisingly scorching vapors. Soon, the room was literally rattling in a cacophony of coughing that drowned out Ramen's favorite electronic music.

Suddenly, Burger stopped coughing, sat bolt upright, withdrew his eponymous sandwich from his jacket, and started devouring it. Halfway through the last bite, he looked at the last morsel and started laughing his head off. Ramen, Chips, and I looked at Burger, then at each other, and burst into maniacal laughter as well. We clowned around for a while, making stupid faces at each other and watching Burger become progressively more stoned. At some point, one of us refilled the water jug and we passed it around; Burger held it in his arms and stuck his tongue into the bottle, apparently forgetting how to drink. Chips attempted to tug it from his arms, but Burger drew it closer and muttered, 'My baby!' 

Amid our insane laughter, we managed to set up the movie Grandma's Boy on my laptop, and watched as we tried to think of a way to finish the night. Finally, the idea struck us as the movie reached one of its most famous scenes; the main character tells his pot-smoking buddy to roll his myriad marijuanas into one joint. We paused the movie, looked at each other with lunatic grins, laughed our heads off, and reached for the King-Size Rizla rolling papers, rolling machine, and grinder. We mixed up equal parts of Chips' and Burger's savory weed, my laughter-inducing weed, and Ramen's mind-numbing weed with a pinch of tobacco from one of Ramen's Camels, and rolled it into a long, chubby spliff.

I ignited and passed the potent composite cigarette in one direction and the water jug in the other; the wafting aroma of the mellowing mix, the atmospheric electronic music, the greasy but comforting scent of cheap college food, and the strains of great conversation filled the room as we lay back and let the marijuana's effects wash over us. After a while, the conversation unravelled, the album drew to a close, and the pot's power caused us to sway as we fought its soporific effects. Finally, I switched off the light, Ramen left for his dorm, and I drifted off into sleep. 

We woke up late the next day, still mellowed, and spent at least an hour talking about our blazed shenigans, comparing and contrasting the different smokes. We decided that every time we toke together, we'll all bring a different flavor to the table. I can't wait to see what unique strains the next pot-luck brings!

I'm a healthy, 19 year old male who regularly smokes marijuana. I will never forget the first horrible, horrible trip I had from smoking too much weed.

It was 'senior skip day' at my school, and me and a couple of friends decided to hang out and smoke some weed. It was me, these 2 girls that I worked with at a grocery store, my friend 'D' and my other girl friend named Jazzy. 

I had smoked weed before this incident, but only a few times, and they had been pleasant experiences. I was looking forward to smoking with them because I wanted to see how high I could get.

That's a bad thing to test.

We all go down to this abandoned bridge by a river and load up a bubbler with some mids (regs, basic-grade marijuana) and I take about 3 hits. I'm feeling pretty high from those hits, my vision slows down and seams to streak when I move my head around and look at lots of different things. I feel my eyelids hanging heavy, a light body-spanning vibration and a general sense of peace and euphoria. 

We leave the bridge and go to one of my girl coworker's friends' house. My friend D passed on smoking from the bubbler, and when we came to this guys' house, D wanted to leave. He didn't want to be around us smoking, so he walked home. So I meet this guy, his name is Alex, and we all go into his shed. Apparently he was a huge stoner, his parents smoked weed and didn't care that he did it. So in his shed, there's a circle of folding chairs. We all come in, he shuts the door, and pulls out a bong. I remember commenting on how it looked 'trippy' (mind you, at this point, I was still pretty high). He loads up a bowl and hands it to one of my coworkers. She hits it, then passes it to me. I hold it to my lips, light the bowl and pull out the slider after inhaling for about 5 seconds. I blow out a pretty decent amount of smoke and hand it to my friend Jazzy.

The bong was passed around to each of us once, before Jazzy, Alex, and the one coworker of mine all get up to go into the house to use the bathroom. So it's just me and the other coworker in the shed at this point, and we keep hitting the bong. After we had killed it, they all came back in to the shed and were kinda mad that we kept smoking when they were gone. So they load up another bowl and send it around again. 

This was when all the THC really hit me. I remember feeling an intense vibration on all sides of my body. I felt numb; I couldn't feel my arms or legs or hands or feet. I could move them, but it was like they were just numb appendages sticking out of my torso. The only feeling I had was my body 'vibrating'. I began to laugh uncontrollably. My friend Jazzy thinks that I am just the funniest man on the planet, and when she sees me laughing, it makes her laugh. Her 'high laugh' is something that I find to be hilarious; so it makes me laugh harder. Which makes her continue to laugh. You see where this is going. After laughing for so long and still feeling numb, I start to feel uncomfortable. Jazzy's laugh sounded like it was inside of my head. At this point I stand up from my chair to try and reconnect myself to the world. I felt like my soul, everything that was beneath my skin had seperated from my body. I was seeing everything through my eyes, but my 'body' was just gone, disconnected. It felt like I was in a movie. I had no physical feeling left in my body. Walking around felt like floating, touching things prompted no physical response. My soul had seperated from my body, and it was just an empty vessel through which I could see. During this time, a BLUNT had been rolled, lit, and sent around, which I foolishly took about 3 hits from.

I crouched behind my chair and took three deep breaths. They were loud and throaty inhalations, with the third breath bridging back into uncontrollable laughter. Which made Jazzy laugh, which took me to a bad place.

I stood up and let everyone know how strangely I felt. They all just laughed and looked at me dumbfounded. I took more deep breaths but my stomach began to lurch. I coughed. I said 'I feel like I'm going to throw up' and cough again. Not a 'throat irritated' cough, but a 'oh no, here comes some vomit' cough.

Alex told me to run outside if I had to puke. I ran outside, coughed again, clung to the side of the shed and coughed once more, and vomit came out this time.

I bent my knees and sat on my heels, closed my eyes, and continued to throw up. This was not 'normal' vomitting, where it's just three or four long streams of puke. This was maybe a dozen coughs where vomit would come out with each cough. My stomach deflated, throat constricted and I spewed vomit, punctuating each deposit of vomit with a wet cough. I threw up maybe 8 or 9 times before it subsided. 

They each came out to me to see how I was doing but I had no interest in speaking. I just told them to leave me alone, don't talk to me, don't touch me, etc. Recieving and processing physical stimulus seemed impossible to do. I couldn't answer questions. I could only say a few phrases. I was huddled outside for maybe 30 minutes before they insisted that I stand up and they help me to my car. I asked to be left alone. I could not even open my eyes. At one point I tried to, and looked at the grass and vomit between my feet. It *hurt* to look at things. It caused physical pain to my eyeballs, and my brain, to have my eyes open to look at things. So I kept them closed.

When they decided to help me up, (against my wishes) I had two friends at each arm. I opened my eyes a bit and watched myself take baby steps toward my car. My stomach began to writhe again (likely because I had my eyes open and no sense of direction/equilibrium) and I started vomitting again. The two friends at my right arm jumped away in fear of being hit by vomit, and I collapsed again and threw up a few more times.

They told me how close I was to my car, 'it's only a few more steps' but I honestly felt as though I was dying. I could not open my eyes, I could not move, I felt like I was trapped within a withering body and I simply had no energy to do anything but curl up into a ball and puke. I told them 'guys, I can'd do this, please call 911' but they insisted that such a measure was unnecessary. I felt like I was in an anti-drug ad, where all your 'stoner pals' aren't really friends at all, and just want to be high and not get caught. It seemed too real.

They helped me up once more and this time I made it to the car. I laid in the backseat, with my head on Jazzy's lap and let my coworker friend drive me home. We got to my house and I was feeling a bit better by this time, enough to get out of the car on my own. Thankfully no one was at my house, and I thought it would be best if I just took a nap in my backseat. So I did. Instead of getting out, I just passed out in the backseat. For maybe, 2 hours I just slept and hoped the feeling would fade.

Around 4 pm, after 2 hours in my backseat has passed, I made myself come inside the house because my stepmom would be home in 1 hour and I didn't want to be in my backseat. So I made it in the house, up the stairs, and to my bed, without a problem. No more nausea, feeling a little more reconnected, but still really high.

I passed out again on my bed, at 430pm, and didn't wake up until 730pm. And I was STILL HIGH.

The whole experience was truly frightening, and a good bit of advice to take from this is: DO NOT SMOKE unless you have a comfortable mindset and are in a comfortable setting. Such as, in your house, with PEOPLE YOU KNOW'. I believe I just smoked way too much, too fast, and experienced a 'whitey/whitie' or 'white out'. All good things in moderation. You can always smoke more weed, but you can't stop being too high just because you're freaking out and want it to end.

Several months ago I started to smoke cannabis on a regular basis, something I had done several years before, but had to quit to save money. Anyway, one of my first times back on the pipe was actually with a Volcano Vaporizer. I had made a few new friends in a new town, and I was invited to a little smoking powwow at a guys house whose name was Mario. Now, normally I would preserve his anonymity by not providing his name, but it does come into play later.

The party was a really chill sort of event. None of the people were party smokers, they were artists. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was a lack of pipes, bongs, joints any of that stuff. I was thinking 'What are we to smoke with?'. Well, Mario had brought this heavy, electric cone which was a volcano vaporizer. I had never used a vaporizer, and thus didn't know anything about them. When he packed the first chamber and filled the bag, I thought that this was some kind of joke. When I took my first hit, all I could think about was a memory from when I was a kid, and I hung out in the grocery store getting stoned off the nitrous in easy cheese cans.

The initial effects were odd, I wasn't really baked, but I was getting a sort of fuzzy headache. I did at least five, or six more hits before I felt baked. At this point I was questioning the credibility of the people who swore by vaporizers as the best way to smoke. I can't quite remember the total of hits I took in the end, but Mario kept filling the chamber, and I kept hitting the bag long after people dropped off. Eventually it was just Mario and me, and I noticed he looked like hell. He looked totally fried. That's when it hit me just how stoned I was. I didn't feel like I was getting high because it didn't have the usual harshness of a normal pipe, it was just like breathing air. I tried to stand up and walk to the bathroom, but I had to crawl. I was way past my comfort level, and I was far from the peak of my experience.

In the bathroom I looked at my eyes, which were a pleasant shade of light pink. The red eye wasn't what made me look high though, it was my sunken eyes, and blank stare. I then did some light meditation in the bathroom (kinda strange, but the quietest part of the house). I turned my psyche into two parts, one that was on the trip and the other that was guiding my movements so I could function. When I walked out I took off my shoes and socks so I could feel the tacky shag carpet squish between my toes. Pure ecstasy. I was inspired to lay back on the carpet and take it in. As I did, a dozen little gnomes jumped out of their huts somewhere in my body and reupholstered my insides with the velvet they have on pool tables. 

To truely experience pleasure, one must also experience pain. I've never been much of a masochist, but I was feeling somewhat philosphical, so I put on a kettle to make some yerba mate tea. (WARNING: The following is a VERY bad idea) When the kettle started to steam, it turned first into a fire breathing dragon, and then into a Dalek from Doctor Who (I didn't actually see them, I was thinking about what the kettle looked like, and as a result I thought I saw them). I picked the kettle up by the sides, the pain was excruciating, and poured four cups of mate before I decided to put the kettle down. About two seconds afterward the pain was replaced by a rush of relief that never went away the rest of the night.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

Several minutes later I decided to go back to my dorm. Mario offered me a ride, my first instinct was to say 'No you idiot, you're high!'. Somehow I ended up in the back of his Isuzu Trooper II with one of my good friends, L. I totally forgot that she was the one who introduced me to Mario, and the reason she hasn't been mentioned up to this point is because I have no recollection of her being with me at the party. I remember the ride as the most terrifying experience of my life, not because of the drive itself, but because L kept poking me in the stomach, being a ticklish person normally, combined with the turns of the car which I perceived as violent fish tailing and swerves, it was a horrible experience. All I wanted to do was get out of the car, and at one point I tried to open the door and bail out, but being a dumb stoner I couldn't figure out the lock. 

When we got back to the dorm, I was almost instantly back in my room. Where I picked up a rubber frog, a mountain dew, and Ovid's Metamorphoses. Anyway, L, who doesn't smoke, and doesn't know what it's like to trip out, called me and forced me to watch the movie 'Saw' with her. I had seen the film before and thought it was a little scary, and now that I was baked, I dreaded watching it. Anyway, to cut a long story short the movie felt like it took forever, and at the end I realized that the movie wasn't scary at all. After that I was sitting in L's room, and I was reading Ovid - which was actually more scary than Saw because the words were tough to read baked - when I dropped into a trance, and went catatonic for a few minutes. It was completely unexpected, and I think it might have been a result of the techno that L habitually listens to. The trance itself is completely impossible to articulate, and half forgotten because L started to shake me because she thought I had passed out. This wasn't cool, I jumped to me feet, turned around, chucked the rubber frog at her and dove out of the room. I ran down the hall laughing, I felt like I'd just dished out justice. She disturbed me when I was in one of the most awesome experiences of my life, so I punished her by throwing a rubber frog at her.

At the end of the hall I sat on a bench and decided to lay on my back. A few minutes passed when an RA came by and saw me. I would normally have freaked out, but this particular RA was a notorious stoner, and I had even sold him some weed once. I was laying there looking at him, all of the bizarre cerebral things were gone. I was coming down, but still pretty stoned. I looked at him, waiting for him to speak. He then said 'Are you blazed?' to which I replied in a sarcastic tone 'Nooooo...' he asked 'Who'd you smoked with.' I told him the truth, and it couldn't have sounded more ridiculous 'Mario'. He laughed at that, he was thinking Super Mario, the iconic video game character. This threw me through a loop, I felt like a bad dog for no reason. I had actually smoked with a guy named Mario, and I could in no way express it without sounding baked. I had down right limed my own feathers to paraphrase Chaucer. I then went to bed dejected. I had no dreams, but I felt like I was in bed for forever, and that the sun had exploded or something because the night was days long. 

When I woke up, my hands were excruciatingly painful. I went to the doctor, and lied about what I'd done. They treated my hands of second degree burns, and I had them wrapped in bandages for the next week and a half. He said I was lucky not to get third degree burns and lose all sensation in my hands.

All in all, I'd say the trip was ambiguous. Mentally it was good, but the lasting pain made it kind of not worth it. I still wouldn't trade the experience for the world. It was a valuable experience. I now know not to underestimate the vaporizer.

I would just like to start of that this was my third time smoking marijuana. The previous two where awful experiences. The first time I felt nothing. The second time I just freaked out, mainly because I was surrounded by people who I did not know as well as being in the heart of the ghetto with my sister.

Well this time was very different. The pure form of euphoria, un-adulerated and clean. My mind-set was very neutral. I was at my house alone since my parents and siblings vacationed to Mexico for 2 weeks, leaving me paranoia free. The setting was very calm, no body home, no nosy neighbors-nothing to get me paranoid. I decided to pick a very calming and soothing tune, 'The Flower Duet by Lakme'. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a hip-hop guy, this is the only opera song I will listen to. Now for the experience.

T+ 0.0 Hours
I finished rolling the joint and waited for it to dry, I chose a joint because its very classic and original, no non-sense. I took a big toke and exhaled. I didn't hold it in much, THC is rapidly absorbed, my good pal told me that you feel more fucked up because you are getting less oxygen and thats it.

T+ 0.125 Hours
It's been five minutes so I took two more big tokes and extinguished the joint and saved it for my friend. I wanted to be mellowed out.

T+ 0.25 Hours
Ten minutes from the first hit and I'm feeling 'it'. I walked to my computer to listen to the opera tune. I thought to myself 'I'm high' and the biggest grin came to my face. Coming up was excellent, didn't just feel high, I felt that I was becoming high. A smooth, rich transition from normal to intoxication. As a matter of fact, intoxication is probably a bad word to describe this high. I'm going to call it ineuphorication from now on. Toxic is an ugly word for marijuana.

T+ 0.5 hours
Thirty minutes, feeling good, thinking good, seeing good, hearing good, smelling good, tasting good. Being good.

T+ 1.0 hours
I can think about anything and everything easily, my thoughts are melted together rather than choppy. I can connect thoughts easily, I can see my thoughts.

T + 1.125 hours
Still listening to The Flower Duet, it's melody and rhythm just makes me feel heaven. Just loving everything, anger, fury, hatred-they don't exist. Couldn't describe the feeling of pain. I literally tried to explain it to myself, all I could think of it being an untangible object with no meaning. Love and pleasure meant everything good, pure, and excellent.

T + 2.0 Hours
Still feeling quite high, cotton mouth and eyes did not interfere I just ate a quick snack. The munchies I received was not a craving, more like my stomach was a bottomless pit where I could not satisfy my hunger. I did not seek food I just never felt full.

T + 3.0 hours
Went to sleep feeling good in every nanometer of my body, giggling on my way to bed. Seeing things in new percepective, finding meaning to the meaningless.

T + 7.0 hours
Feeling very refreshed. I feel reborn, I know found more meaning to things that I always overlooked. My religous beliefs strengthened. If there is no god, why are we here? Science explains the how but not the why. Theories and hypothesis, knowledge and fact, fantasy and euphoria. Me and Mary Jane.

This is a recollection of one of my earlier experiences with marijuana. It took place the second semester of my freshman year in college, Im now a sophomore, so I guess it wasnt too long ago. I certainly cant claim to have been smoking for very long yet, but I have certainly become much more experienced. I cant remember with any certainty how many times Id smoked prior to this, it wasnt very many, if I had to guess maybe something like 10 occasions, that being in the high range. 

Anyways, I had tripped once before on weed, or at least thats what my journal entry says, but for the life of me I just cant remember it. The point is, I was still a noob, and despite having tripped once before I was still entirely inexperienced with regards to tripping or even the fact that marijuana could make me trip (I suspected that perhaps it was laced, though I now doubt this). Despite my doubts as to the exact details of my life leading up to this experience, I did happen to take down a detailed account of the event itself, written only a day or so after it happened, so thats what Ill share:

It was in my new dorm room, probably about 7:30 pm, and I had just returned from a trip to the botanical gardens behind our gym where I had smoked a nice, fat jay. It was some quality weed, and I got nice and high. Shortly after having returned to my room, my roommates friend, who Ill call C, came into our room and offered to make us a Sobe bong. My roommate was all for it, so I watched as C skillfully turned an empty Sobe bottle into a fully-functional gravity bong (or waterfall bong, whatever).

Me being the noob, my C suggested half-jokingly that I should take the first hit. I agreed, wanting to be higher than I was, and also very curious. My mindset as I agreed to take this hit was a little dubious, since I had tripped before, and was just an unsuspecting noob, and hadnt liked it one bit. But I just told myself to buck-up, mind-over-matter, Im as sober as I think I am, I then took one long exhale, and sucked up all the smoke. I had only just learned this technique, and also to hold it in as long as possible, which I found surprisingly easy as this smoke was incredibly smooth and cool. I exhaled out the window, very pleased.

I sat back down in my chair and watched as the other two took their hits. I dont remember a whole lot, except that I was pretty happy just sitting there, doing nothing. But I didnt get long to enjoy this, as my two companions decided to head down to the convenience store and buy some snacks (of course). So my roomie ran off to use the restroom, and I stood up to get ready to follow them once he got back. It was then that I noticed the first unusual effects. One thing I noticed, everything in the room was flashing. The closest thing I can come up with is like our light was strobing extremely rapidly. The very next thing I noticed, as I stood up out of my chair, I moved my hand past the armrest, and I thought I saw my hand pass straight through the solid wooden armrest! I couldnt believe my eyes! I found that if I passed my hand back and forth next to the armrest, it looked like I was passing my hand through it, and I amused myself in this fashion for a moment until C asked what I was doing. I explained the situation to him, and he seemed mildly amused. 

But now my roomie was back, and so we all headed off to the store, about a minute or so journey down the stairs and into an adjacent building. This is when things became more difficult. At this point, the flashing effect I had been feeling had steadily worsened until now it felt like I also had the spins, and I was also seeing double. Basically, I was getting the flanging effect I get from DXM, except that rather than reality just appearing to be coming in frames, each frame was also rotating slightly, so that it seemed like what would happen if I were both very drunk and also on a low-level robo-trip. As we stepped outside of the dorm building, C looked at me and said, See how your arms are all tense? Its cuz youre cold! Despite his observation, I didnt feel cold at all, which I was pretty proud of. 

We entered the store, where I saw many of my hallmates and also some other people I recognized but didnt really know. I was surprised that there were so many people still there this late at night, but then I realized that it still wasnt much later than 8pm. My companions went into the store and got some snacks, and I decided I should sit down on one of the couches outside, since by now I was getting an absolutely spectacular body high. 

I dont have a very clear memory of anything that happened after this, but I will do my best with what little I remember, and what I had written and also what others later said theyd seen. I apparently had drawn some attention, because a few people there claimed they noticed that I looked a pale green color. One of them mentioned this to my companions, who were chatting with people outside the store. So they came over to ask me if I was ok, and said I was trippin. C reassured me I wasnt and not to freak, and to get up and take a drink from the water-fountain a few feet away. So I very slowly got to my feet, and found that everything below my waist felt like it was submerged in wet cement, making it very difficult to move, almost like wading upstream in a river. With some more encouragement I eventually made it to the water-fountain, and stopped. I looked at the fountain, and the nozzle from which the water would squirt from, and realized there was absolutely no way I was going to be able to intercept air-borne water with mouth, and then swallow it! I had to think with all my might just top even imagine the process, and I certainly couldnt imagine actually successfully accomplishing such a complex task. So they led me back to couches and brought me some water in a cup, which I drank with much difficulty. 

At this point they decided it was time to head back to the dorms, so I once again stood up and got ready to go. By now, the visuals had gotten nearly out of hand, as each frame of reality was nearly spiraling through me, such that my peripheral vision was completely whited out. As I stood there waiting to follow my companions back, this effect increased dramatically, until nearly everything was fading to white! Finally, the only remaining vision I had was of my roommate standing right in front of me, everything else was white. Doubts and fear flew through my mind, but I tried not to make a scene. 

Suddenly, a terrible thought occurred to me: If everything from my peripherals in had whited out, why could I still see my roomie? Wouldnt it make more sense that he would have been whited out just as well as everything else had? Or if I could still see my roomie right in front of me, why couldnt I see anything else that was right in front of me? The conclusion I came to was that I wasnt actually seeing my roomie, but just imagining him, and that I was really passed out on the floor of the lounge, completely tripping! This theory appeared even more likely as suddenly everything became very quiet. The lounge is a very noisy place, but at that moment all background noise suddenly receded. I could still hear everything, but it was like someone had just stuck ear-plugs in me. This was now the most terrifying experienced Id ever had, and wondered if I was going to die. I still tried to remain calm, but I wondered if people could tell I was this fucked-up, or if they cared. 

The rest of my experience I didnt record in my journal, but I do remember being set back on the couch, and brought a garbage can to puke in, which did for quite a while. Eventually I was well enough to make it back to room, where I managed to fall asleep, but reality was still slightly flashing when I awoke the next morning. This was the most extreme reaction Ive even heard of someone ever having to weed alone, although I do know of others who have puked from smoking large amounts. I have since become much more experienced with psychedelics in general, and have tripped on at least two more occasions after smoking weed, although these experiences were infinitely more enjoyable, since I was able to recognize them and appreciate them.

This certainly scared the fuck out of me, and it was made all the more harder when my own friends later insisted there was no way anyone could possibly trip from weed alone.

*Cough Cough Cough*

I decided to smoke pot after my friend asked me to smoke with him, I had just turned fifteen. Him and I had known each other since grade three so we went back quite a ways. We had both warred with and against each other over those years but that was behind us. For the sake of anonymity he will be known as his Zim. Zim and I started hanging out after being asked to leave the same christian school. Neither of us are or ever were 'bad people' as the school put it. We were simply two people who didn't follow the same moral compass as others. We are both artists and free spirits which makes us a minority amongst most human beings let alone religious ones. Smoking pot was something he had picked up with one of his friends and I had always heard that it expanded your creative potential so I thought why the hell not?

I remember the conversations we would have about pot and it's effects, how to take a hit and many other subjects. That really made the experience go a lot smoother than other first timers I had seen. The first time he told me he smoked though I didn't know what to think. We were watching a movie and he spoke up.

'You ever smoked pot man?'
'No...why?'
'You should man, it's pretty chill.'
'How would you know?'
'How do you think?'

I looked at him like he had just showed me a mutated kitten, with a mix of interest and humour. After that awkward moment we continued to watch our movie. A few weeks later I asked him if I could smoke pot with him. He looked me up and down like a piece of meat with a mocking sense of superiority and asked me if I was serious.

'Yes.'
'You sure?'
'Yes.'
'Alright man, let's do it! This is so cool!'

I was a little amused at his excitement but I figured it was a good thing. That night I watched eagerly as Zim showed me how to roll joints. He wasn't very good at it back then but I was sure impressed. It was a warm September night but not warm enough to go without jackets. We walked for a while before we decided to smoke, the air was crisp and clean and the streets were empty. The light pollution was at minimum that night so we walked under a rarely seen ceiling of stars. I can remember going through smoking the joint in my head over and over. I remember thinking about taking it in my hands and how I would hold it, then lifting it to my lips slowly and taking a long pull and breathing it out like an actor in a movie would if he was playing a gangster. I was nervous but I wouldn't back down, this was something I felt I needed to do. I believe in experiencing life at it's fullest and I was sick of missing out.

We arrived at the local school, obviously Zim's favourite smoke pit at the time. I remember walking behind the school is anxious anticipation. Zim took the joint out and offered me first hit, I told him to go ahead. It wasn't until a few hits had gone by before I decided to take the hit. I took the joint in my hands and my heart started to pound in my chest, I could barely grip the joint I was so nervous. I moved the shaking joint to my mouth until I could feel the paper on my lips and smell the smoke billowing in front of my eyes. I pulled hard, eyes closed and pulled some more. I had taken way to big a hit way to fast, in short, I coughed like a little bitch.

*Cough Cough Cough*
'Oh my god man you took such a fat hit!' teased Zim.
*Cough Cough Cough*
Red Hat's laughter echoed through my head.
*Cough Cough Cough*
'Dude, are you OK? he asked through giggles.
I managed let out a messy 'Fuck you!' between coughs.
More laughing. More coughing.

After a few minutes I stopped coughing and looked my friend in the eyes, and with supernatural determination asked for another hit. After the joint was gone and my throat was as raw as hillbillies steak we decided to sit on the swings for a while. Zim was messed up, looking at the stars and swinging from side to side hypnotically. I was not high, I was uncomfortable from the feeling in my throat and the taste in my mouth. It tasted like sand from my old sandbox, the one the neighbors cat always shat in. At that point I was not impressed, in fact I was a little mad.

'Dude, how long until I get high?'
'Why? Are you not high?' asked Zim groggily.
'I don't think so.'
'Wait a while.'
'Dude, it's been twenty minutes, you're fucked.'
'Well, I don't think you'll get high then. You'll have to wait until next time man.'
'Seriously man? that is weak!'
'Sorry man, that's just how it goes. I'm high and your not high, sucks to be you.' laughed Zim.

I decided that I wanted to walk around for a while and see what happened. In short, I didn't get high. We ended up walking around the neighborhood while Zim laughed to himself and I anticipated my next joint. That weekend I smoked again. This time with my cousin who will be called Gir. We also smoked with two of our friends who will now be known as Tak and Dib. We went to Tak's house to smoke because she lived by Gir and Dib. I was finally going to get high and I was confident this time. I thought about what had happened the first time and I decided not to let it get to me. I wasn't embarrassed in front of Zim, we had been friends too long, but I was worried what my cousin and our friends would think if I messed this up, they had all been smoking much longer than me and they had grown up in the 'Canadian Ghetto' if you want to call it that. Out there if you showed weakness you got eaten alive. Luckily my fears were just that, illogical fears.

We arrived at Tak's house around nine I believe. Tak came to the door and led us inside her simple home. We were in a complex of housing that Gir had lived in his whole life and Tak and Dib had recently moved into. Tak's house was small but cozy, it had worn out carpets and old broken in couches around a huge TV. The pots and pans were piled up next to each other around the sink. It was a big difference from my comfortable life style but I had seen worse so I embraced it. We sat around for a while and watched the tube until my cousin finally asked me if I wanted to smoke. I eagerly accepted and we went up to Tak's room. Tak's room was empty but for a frame-less bed, an immaculate old mirror and a cork board. The cork board had a piece of paper that Tak pointed to.

'This is my menu.' she said.
'Your menu? For what?' I asked innocently
'Lot's of things, booze mostly, weed and shrooms too.' Tak replied proudly.
After looking at the paper I realized that a menu was a perfect explanation. On the left side of the page were all of the various narcotics and alcohol she could acquire with a coinciding price on the right side of the page.
'Cool!' exclaimed Gir and Dib.

Gir proceeded to approach the menu in a comical fashion and pretend to be a high class businessman selecting fine wines. We ended up buying a forty bag and waited anxiously while Tak rolled some joints. This time the nervous thoughts and shakes were gone. I was completely comfortable surrounded by my friends and my cousin. Then I thought about coughing and I decided that if I coughed then I coughed. There was no way around it, I had seen the way the stoners smoked and I figured it would take a while.

'Done.' chimed in Tak, popping my thought bubble.
'Alright let's smoke this shit Nigga!' shouted Gir.
'Yeah man!' exclaimed Dib.
'OK.' I said timidly.

Tak took first hit as it was her house and her roll job. She lifted the joint to her mouth ever so delicately and took a drag. She kept going, like some kind of machine, some kind of gorgeously deceptive, pot smoking beast! I felt intimidated all of the sudden but decided it didn't matter. After the joint went to Gir and Dib it came to me. I held it hesitantly and then decided to just go for it. I took the joint to my lips and pulled hard, this time though, no coughing. Nothing. Not a peep. I held the hit and let it drift out of my mouth, slowly, watching the smoke create small wisps in front of my eyes, swirl and float towards the ceiling, I still didn't like the taste though. The joint came around again and I took another drag, held it, released and passed it on. 

Again I got the joint but as the joint was passed to me it slowed down, everything slowed down. It was like being caught in a gelatinous blob of the smoothest jello ever made. I watched every cinder float off the joint as it was passed to me and the glow of the lit joint made me feel warm. It felt comfortable in my hand, like I had been doing this my whole life. I slowly raised it to my smiling lips and took a small hit this time, letting the smoke run under my tongue and through my teeth, tasting the bud and loving it until it finally went into my lungs. I let it fill me like a balloon and then I released it slowly, releasing with it all of my stress. I began to view myself, seeing life as if watching a movie. I could see myself and my friends on the bed and then everything would fade into the smoke lingering in the room. I would come back from my trance and see Gir and Dib laughing as they sang old school rap songs. I looked over at Tak and noticed that she was just enjoying watching us. It was surreal beyond anything that has ever happened to me. Like being suspended in a warm fluid environment. Like becoming something other than another body taking up space. It's as if I had all of the answers to all of the questions in my head.

All of the sudden I was falling, falling backwards into something, into some unknown universe or dimension. My head landed comfortably enough and as I looked up I realized the terrible mistake I had made. I had fallen right into Tak's lap. I know it sounds over dramatic saying it was a terrible mistake but Tak is scary. She's scary to anybody who fears for their own life and at that point I was afraid. Dib and Gir went completely silent as I looked up at Tak. It was as if time had stood still. It started quite harshly as Tak swatted me in the head and off her lap. We had a laugh as I apologized over and over again and then resumed chilling. Tak's mom entered the room shortly after and laughed at us all and called us stoners. That's all I really remember of that night.

I was pretty embarrassed but Dib and Gir only gave me grief for a second or to and I think Tak understood what had happened. It was the most intoxicated state I have ever been in. I have been smoking pot ever since but haven't been able to attain such a state again. In some ways I don't care, I have leveled out and developed a tolerance to pot in the sense that I don't become an idiot when I smoke. I am always the one just chilling, philosophizing and enjoying life. I've really learned that smoking pot doesn't have to be about secret outings and shady deals. It can be about spending time with and connecting with my fellow human beings. Just enjoy the love and peace that I get while smoking pot with my friends and that's all I will ever need to do.

I don't smoke everyday but close to it, I know my limits and always smoke with moderations, preferring the ability to think and remember the night to getting completely fucked. I have done shrooms and hash on multiple other occasions but pot is my drug of choice, it really has made my life better and made me a more controlled and accepting person. I live in Vancouver city and growing pot is out largest industry in our province. It has been estimated that if the pot grown in BC was taxed that the profit would be upwards of two billion dollars. Almost a third of the people here smoke pot which really surprised me. Start watching for stoners and you might be surprised how many people smoke around you.

Prior to the float trip I went on, I purchased an ounce of mid-grade marijuana and brought it with me. It had been a year since I last smoked, so I knew that the effects would hit me hard. The result I got was far beyond anything that I had ever experienced.

It was night-time and our campsite was right next to the river. We all had lawn chairs set up in a circle around a propane lantern. I started up some weed and was passing it around to a couple other people. During the time that we smoked, we were talking and cracking jokes and just having fun. Everyone else was finished smoking so I finished off two more bowls by myself. Elapsed time: about thirty minutes. 

After I was done, I got up and went back to my tent. My girlfriend walked out of the tent to go toward the bathroom building, so I followed her. We stopped outside the building and sat on a grassy hill and began talking. The only effects I began to feel at this point were dizziness and relaxation, but things grew heavier. During our conversation, my mind lost everything that was going on in a split-second and I had to go back and retrace the events to get myself back into real-time. That was a very tough thing to do. She started to get confused at things I was saying because they were just a bunch of jumbled words, but they made perfect sense to me. I then started with the hallucinations.

My vision turned itself and confused the crap out of me. The only way I've found to explain this was that I wasn't looking down to look at the ground. If I wanted to look at the ground, I had to look to my right because that's where it was to me. A light was reflecting off of my girlfriend's hair (which she had up at the time) and when I noticed that, she immediately turned into a princess because I thought her hair was a crown of some sort. As soon as I saw the crown, I began to see her in a full princess costume. Things she was saying were becoming jumbled to me and I couldn't exactly understand her when she spoke, but my mind independently processed everything and I understood it somehow.

Auditory hallucinations followed. Thinking back on it, I was hearing this stuff throughout the whole time we were sitting on the hill, but it took me until the end of the conversation to actually acknowledge that I was hearing it. In my right ear, I could hear some sort of gospel reggae music, if such a genre exists. It was very vivid and very loud in my ear and sort of calmed me down. I asked my girlfriend if she could hear the music and she just looked at me bewildered and said, 'What the hell are you talking about?' Then in my left ear, I was hearing some sort of a conversation. My mind was independently conversing with itself. It became hard to focus on what my girlfriend and I were talking about because I was trying to figure out what was being said in my left ear. When I focused on it, it seemed to me like it was something that I had said before, but I wasn't sure. It kept going on and on without my help and it became quite interesting to listen to. 

The mental conversation ended, though, when my girlfriend decided that she was too tired and wanted to go back to the tent. Walking back was one of the hardest things I think I've ever done. My legs were like lead and it seemed very hard to lift them. That, and I was still horribly dizzy. When we finally made it back, I laid down and became very paranoid because I didn't know what was real and what was just going on in my head. The other people that we were with at the campsite were up and yelling stuff and playing their music very loud. Or at least it seemed that way to me. I would randomly hear screams and loud ambient noises and I wasn't sure if any of that noise was audible to anyone else. I eventually tuned it out somehow and went to sleep.

The next day I had a hangover of sorts, though I never had experienced one from weed. That day was when we did the canoeing down the river for about 16 miles. After that, we packed up our stuff and left. I was the one driving and it was a three-hour trip. I just felt completely out of it the whole day, but I also was very contemplative and I seemed more in touch with reality and calmer with everything happening around me. I was sort of at peace.

The effects I felt during this experience were far more elaborate and crazy than any other time that I have been high. This tops the last high that I had when I was running around my house with a baseball bat because I thought that someone was in my house. That night, I also saw the Trix bunny in the calendar hanging on my wall and I got into a yelling match with it for about fifteen minutes. But that experience is a whole different story.

Sitting over at my friend's apartment, I decided to, once again, attempt an oral dose of cannabis.  I have consumed marijuana in this fashion several times in the past but only to minimal effects.  My other drug experiences include, but at not limited to mushrooms, salvia divinorum, san pedro cactus, amphetamine, demerol and alot more.  I have, in the past year been sticking to natural psychoactives only, with an occasional low dose of DXM.  

I had, earlier this day, received a half ounce of some very good schwag, hardly any seeds or stems and it smelled great.  I asked my friends' permission to use their bread, cheese, and butter, and went to work making a grilled cheese and weed sandwich.  I grated the cheese onto the bread and added 4g of herb on top of it, making sure I mixed it in with the cheese.  I then cooked this concoction just as anyone would cook a grilled cheese sandwich.  I will now attempt to explain the events of the evening chronologically:

12:30 AM - consume grilled cheese and weed sandwhich on an empty stomach.  I then leave my friends' apartment to head to my friend J's place before the sandwich kicks in.

12:45 AM - I arrive at J's place and am slightly disquieted to feel the weed already taking affect.  I write it off as placebo for the moment, roll a ciggarette, and smoke with J outside.  

1:00 AM - no it is not placebo.  I am slightly altered, but in a way that is differnt from smoking.  I take just one hit of J's brother's KB and this really seems to kick the oral dose into gear.

1:15 AM- J is getting ready to leave so I will have to leave soon.  I talk with his brother and secretly begin getting very anxious and slightly confused, but Im having a good time, none the less.  Speaking of time, it has slowed WAAAAAAAAAY down at this point.  5 minutes seems like 30 minutes easily.  This time dialation is not as noticable as it is on mushrooms, but still, it is there.

1:30 AM-  I leave Jim's house and begin shaking quite violently upon sitting in my car.   [Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  Im not scarred of anything but I can NOT stop shaking.  I am also becomming very clouded and everything seems loud and chaotic. Fearing that my anxiety is going to drive me mad by the time this is all over with, I put in Incubus' album 'morning view'.  Its an old CD and I have lot's of good memories involved with it.  After singing a few songs I am starting to feel a little better, and alot higher.

2:00 AM- I arrive at home.  I can no longer feel my body much at all and I am starting to be bombarded with thoughts, much like a mushroom trip.  I begin making stories up about everything I look at in my bedroom.  Pointless stories of lunacy coming from nowhere and everywhere.  Really random stuff.  I attempt to play Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, but soon realize I am too incapacitated even for that.

3:00 AM - My heart is really beating quite heavily and quickly and has been for a while, now.  Being very comfortable with marijuana, I realize that this is a common thing for the dose I have taken and dismiss it before it can trouble me anymore.  I am still comming up.  I am already more stoned then I have ever been in my life (and Ive been smoking weed for years and years).  It is not a funny, ticklish stone, but a delerious and downright psychedelic stone.  

3:30 AM- I have reached the peak and at this point my body feels like it has fallen asleep and is waking up slowly (the way an arm or leg would fall asleep).  It is a very, very strange sensation.  When I walk I feel like I am floating.  Closing my eyes reveals indescribable pictures, many of them containing animals and plants.  With eyes open, my eyes focus and unfocus constantly.  Light is very bright.  My posters on my walls creep slowly, as though they are running down the wall like fresh paint.  My eyes burn and they are more comfortable closed.  I turn on some dntel (ambient electronica) and lay down in my bed to relax in the dark.  I am experiencing slight ego loss.

4:00 - 6:30 AM- I spend this time in a half dream/half awake state.  I continue making up random stories in my head that seem to be comming from an outside source.  I think about how marijuana really is a powerful psychedelic and is sometimes easy to take for granted when you smoke it every day.  The body fry is still extremely intense and my body feels very warm all over, almost like I have a fever.  It is not an unpleasant feeling, however.  

6:30 AM (?) - 12:00 PM - I sleep at this point, very deeply.  I awaken feeling good but with a slight headache.  I drink a few glasses of water and feel much better.  I go about the rest of this day as I would any other day.  I notice that smoking weed makes some of the oral dose feelings come back a bit.

---

All in all, oral dose seems like the route to go if you are into a really introspective and more serious high.  I do not think I will be eating weed again any time in the next few months but Im sure I will again.  This was a very intense experience and I can see how it would really freak someone out if they are prone to panic or bad anxiety.  I had a great time though and it is nice to be reminded how powerful of a plant marijuana really is.

Cannabis (1) : Music Discussion (22), General (1), Various (28)




 




DOSE:
4 
smoked
Cannabis - Hash
(extract)





BODY WEIGHT:
210 lb





Introduction: Tonight my roommate and I were out of bud, so we decided to try to do an cannabinoid extraction of some leftover stems using rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) as the extracting solvent.  I documented the experience for a forum I frequent, and it was suggested that I submit the report here as well.

At the time, I had no other drugs in my system except a small amount of caffeine from the Mountain Dew I drank throughout the preparation of the hash.  I can't speak for my roommate on this topic, however - he's on an ever-changing battery of mood-altering prescriptions for his bipolar tendencies.  He is comparable in body size to me.



Our ingredients and tools:

-Spare bud, leafs, trimmings, stems, and/or shake.  In our case, this was about 1/2 an ounce of stems leftover from mostly middle-of-the-road quality cannabis buds.

-Enough rubbing alcohol to completely coat the plant material.  The only ingredients in the bottle were isopropanol and water. In our case, one 16 oz. bottle of 91% isopropanol was more than enough.

-A mason jar to mix the alcohol and plant material.

-At least two coffee filters to filter the alcohol/plant matter mix.

-A cup to catch the filtered liquid, a smooth glass or ceramic surface for it to dry on, a fan to blow the resulting fumes away, and a double boiler of some sort to prevent fire.  Make sure you're in a ventilated area - warm rubbing alcohol can let off some impressive fumes.

-A razor blade or X-acto type of knife for scraping the hash off the evaporation surface.  We used a plastic ID card, but a razor blade would have probably worked much better.

-Rolling papers or some other smokable material on which to apply the hash.



Preparation: After going out and buying some 91% isopropanol rubbing alcohol, we came home and ground what I would estimate to be half an ounce of leftover stems and poured the result into a mason jar. Then rubbing alcohol was added until the ground-up stems were thoroughly soaked with a layer of about an inch of extra rubbing alcohol on top. We used about a third of the 16 oz. bottle. The jar was sealed and shaken vigorously for about three minutes before it was opened and the contents poured through two coffee filters into a measuring cup.

There was about one-half to two-thirds of a cup of green/yellow semi-transparent liquid after the filtering. This was poured onto a large (10' in diameter), circular, flat, ceramic plate which was placed in a deep baking pan filled with water. The pan was placed over the stove burner and served as a makeshift double-boiler - we didn't want to apply the flame directly to the plate for fear of the alcohol igniting. Instead, the water was brought to a gentle boil and a fan was placed to blow all the fumes and steam away from the area. The filtered liquid evaporated over the course of about 50 minutes and formed a thin, sticky, dark green coating over the top of the ceramic plate.

This resin was loosened from the plate by applying heat with a lighter and scraped using the edge of a plastic student ID card (the only tool available). Then the resin was wiped off both sides of the edge of the ID using a piece of rolling paper folded in half. The areas of the paper with thick coatings of green-black resin were ripped from the rest of the paper and rolled into balls, each the size of a large pinhead.

The balls were placed one at a time into a pipe and smoked.



Observations: I honestly didn't think this was going to work in the first place, but I figured it was worth a try. The whole procedure was pretty simple - the only change I'd make next time is to use more material to start with and to evaporate the filtered liquid over a smaller area than the large ceramic plate.

I used all the leftover plant matter I had available, so the materials issue couldn't be helped. As for the evaporation surface, the plate worked decently but made scraping the hash/resin somewhat difficult. Evaporating the filtered liquid over such a large area made it go quickly (it took less than an hour for the alcohol to evaporate), but the result was spread very thinly across the plate. This made the scraping bit harder, especially because the resin that formed was really sticky and held fast to smooth surfaces. In spite of those problems, we still got a decent result.



Results: I smoked it first, as my roommate was leery of scraping and smoking something we mixed together on a whim that resembled dried green paste. I rolled the first ball and smoked it. It took a couple hits before I figured out how to get enough smoke into the pipe each hit.

The little balls of resin and paper seemed to smolder more than they burned, and the carb of the pipe had to be plugged until the very end of each hit to draw enough smoke. The smoke itself was thick, but lacked the typical taste and scent of bud. My roommate compared the taste of it to 'burning plastic...sort of.' Personally, I didn't think the smoke had much of a taste beyond that of the rolling paper we used to wipe the ID's clean. It was a little on the harsh side compared to most bud, but by no means unbearable.  Each ball lasted for two to four hits.

Within a minute after I finished smoking the first ball, I noticed a change in my state of mind. I wasn't getting sick, which was encouraging, so I rolled another ball, larger this time, and smoked it as well. At that point, my thoughts got a little jumbled, but I distinctly remember a heavy head rush that lasted for a couple minutes. Once that was over, I noticed that the high was considerably different from the high gotten from smoking bud. It was almost entirely centralized in the mind - I didn't feel the normal body high that I do from bud, but my line of thought was obviously altered. The lack of a body high made it a bit disorienting. My body felt sober, but my mind felt heavily intoxicated. It led to a few weird times when I wouldn't *feel* stoned, but when I got up to do something, like getting a glass of water, I'd have to pause and remind myself what I was doing. Over the course of three hours, I smoked about four balls in all, with about equal time between each.

It's now about two hours since I smoked the last one, and I'm still far from sober. To be honest, this report feels like it's taking forever to write, and I keep getting distracted by small things. I also have to reread paragraphs to make sure they make sense after I type them - a few of them haven't.

My roommate, who has been smoking weed with regularity for only a couple months, felt the effects more strongly. After smoking a couple of the balls, the head rush hit him hard. He had a lot of nervous energy and started pacing and saying things that didn't make particularly much sense to me, though to be fair, I was high as well. At one point, he entered the kitchen then left it, sat down on the couch for a moment, got up, walked to the kitchen, paused at the entrance, looked around for a moment, stiffened up, and said 'uhh...water!' before finally grabbing his cup and filling it up. He did a lot of strange little things like that for the next couple hours. He also seemed rather confused and didn't look like he was enjoying himself as much as I did. Also, the taste of the smoke got to him much more, possibly because he used more paper than I did when rolling the balls. In any case, the hash had a profound effect on him.



Conclusions: I was surprised this worked so well. It might be worth repeating if I can get my hands on a lot of cheap, low-quality weed. In this case, we were able to roll six balls from the resin we scraped from the plate. But considering we started with nothing but a half an ounce of stems, I'd consider this a success.

I'd recommend this to anyone luck enough to have extra weed around - especially schwag, trimmings, stems, and/or shake - and some time to kill. It's a simple experiment, and somewhat crude, but the results are definitely interesting.

It was the end of March, 2006.  About a week and a half before the one-year anniversary of my first time smoking cannibis.  I hadn't smoked in about a week and a half, because of being sick, but I finally felt a little better and my friend invited me out to smoke a bowl with him before class.

All I could think of as I walked to meet him was getting as high as I could off this little bit, because I was eager to start smoking again.  I met my friend at about 10:30 AM in a cemetary on campus, where we usually met to smoke.  I didn't expect much, having been smoking weed of similar quality as what we smoked that day for months now.  After we smoked, it took a few minutes for the high to set in, while we walked out of the cemetary, each of us lighting a cigarette.  I felt a typical high as we parted and I walked back to get my books for the day.  I was very relaxed, kind of distant from reality.  I made it back to my room fine, and after grabbing my books I walked to one of the dining halls for a quick lunch before class.

By the time I got inside, I started viewing things in frames.  By the time I sat down to eat, my memories of getting and paying for my lunch were like snapshots my mind took, and all I could remember seeing was the stack of trays where I grabbed one, the salad bar, and the woman who was working the register that day.  Even now, that's all I can remember of lunch.  I thought it a little odd, only having experienced vision like that with much larger amounts of weed.  But I was in a good place by then, and didn't really care that much, so I ate my lunch and left for class.

This part of the day I remember in vivid detail, though it still amazes me how it happened.  I had made the walk from the dining hall to my first class enough times, I knew how long it took.  The walk to the building was about 13-15 minutes, and then it took another two or three minutes to get to the classroom.  I started the walk with about 18-20 minutes before class, just enough time to get there if I walked at my normal pace.  Of course, my normal pace was only normal when I wasn't as completely high as I was that morning, but the worry of being late to class barely registered as I turned my mp3 player on while walking outside.  I lit another cigarette once outside and started walking to class.

I usually favor trance-based music when I'm high, because it always seems to make the time pass that much more enjoyably.  I put on one specific song to listen to the entire way to class, and turned the volume up.  About 10 feet into my walk, I started having these crazy hallucinations.  It was almost like there was this sphere surrounding me, and it moved with me as I walked.  Images based on the music were projected onto the surface of this sphere, and I could barely see reality past it.  The images weren't even very fluid now that I think about it, but they were at the time.  I was amazed at this, as it was the first time I had ever seen any kind of visuals while high, especially during the day.  The part that really amazes me, is that somehow, even though I know I was walking slower than normal to pay more attention to the halluciantions, and the fact that my schedule that day was slightly different and I was going to a different class than normal, I made it to class with 4 or 5 minutes to spare.

To this day, I have never had a similar experience, even with the other drugs I've tried since.  I have never seen any kind of visuals during the daytime, nor have I ever been able to achieve the same level of 'highness' as I did that day.  I believe that there was something going on with the virus in my system at the time. I was on week three of recovering from a pretty bad case of mono. I would give anything to reach that intensity again, short of having mono.

Welcome to the mind of the mad, the brilliant and the foolish. Today, you shall experience past gone present, a life become yours, and you shall know in the best of words possible, what 'I' have experienced, and all there is to know.

But before I get to the storytellin, I must familiarize you with a few terms, 2 in fact.

Sess: Organically grown marijuana. Weed that has been grown the way it was meant to be, almost always outdoors, and always with soil and sunlight. In most cases, this kinda weed is considered your normal stuff - obviously far better than shwag, but not comparable to 'dro' in potency, unless the strain which your sess happens to be is naturally very potent already (example: White Widow). In simple words, your basic, organically grown stuff - kinda like garden grown vegetables.

Dro: Hydroponically grown marijuana. Weed that has been grown with the aid of hydroponics. What this means is that the weed is grown somewhat 'artificially', as in no soil, but with nutrient-filled water instead. Also, there is artificial lightin rather than sunlight, and even artificial humidity. Weed of this kind tends to be of better quality and far higher potency than 'sess'.

Anyway, I shall begin my story at about 1:40pm, yesterday. Me and 2 friends (I'll call one T, the other P) met up in school, and all of us were plannin to smoke up. You see, I have heart problems, and not long ago, I suffered a very minor heart attack (more like a heart cramp), and I am very prone to heart tension from stress/anxiety. Quite an odd ailment for someone as young as me (18). Anyway, I agreed to smokin up with them, as I needed some heavy relaxin myself, and although weed does bring your heart rate up a lil, it's better riskin a lil than riskin what may be potentially a lot and end up dyin from stress. So really, weed would be a great benifit to me.

So we wander around the neighborhood, and then we find a dealer within the vicinity. So I ask the dealer if he's got any trees, he asks how much, and T tells him we want 5 dollars' worth. So we get our weed, and head off to T's home. As soon as we get there, we open up the plastic bag and take the weed out. I tell them I have about 2.5 grams of weed in my stashbox, which I had brought along with me, but the weed we got for 5 bucks apparently seems like 10g more than 5g, and they assumed that by the smell and look, it was probably sess. Good for chillin, not for trippin, but they were wrong. The stuff I had was sess, the stuff we bought was dro. So we decided to chop up the newly bought dro, and put it in a large spliff, and the remainder in a smaller spliff, the sess that I had brought with me would be smoked in a pipe later on. Then came the smokin session.

We went outside the buildin to this balcony-like place, where not many people come by, and we sat down on some metal seats. We then proceeded to light up the spliff, in which P took the first few puffs. We decided everyone would take turns, 3 puffs each person's turn. When it came for me to smoke it, I began to inhale, but T told me I was smokin it wrong. You see, I have smoked a few times before, gotten high, but it was mostly more of a relaxin and passive high, where nothin seemed to bother me. T had told me to inhale deeply into my lungs, breath in some fresh air with it to push it down, and then hold it for a sec, and exhale soon after. I did.

My eyes began to feel heavy, somewhat like when I haven't slept for a while, and my eyelids seem to weigh more than they really do. A smile slowly grew on my face, as I began to notice myself far more relaxed than I ever have been. The sunlight seemed a lil more intense, although I didn't seem to mind it at all. But I also felt this odd lightheadedness, a tingly sensation in my brain, with a very light headache that somehow didn't seem to bother me at all. We finished up the spliff, and then the next, and then this is when I decided to get up - the weed had kicked in good by now.

I stood up, and I suddenly felt dizzy, and I felt like things were slightly movin (both in vision and feelin). If I could best describe the feelin and sight, it was like how I feel and see after I have been spinnin in a circle in the same spot for about 30 seconds. That 'world is turnin around a bit' type of thing. But what I didn't notice is how odd my walkin was. I was apparently wobblin a bit from side to side, not as much as a drunk losin full balance, but more like I have been shook up a bit instead. T and P were laughin at me, and had told me to sit down, afraid that I might fall from bein so damn high. Whether I had fallen or stayed sittin down, I didn't care. I was havin fun. I started laughin at nothin, and my friends look at me as if I was some kinda lunatic and then began laughin with me, or was it at me? Regardless, I was still havin fun.

Then after a lil while, I had decided to get up again, and we all decided to go back to T's place. We had to walk past the security, and I tried to look normal, but instead I had my eyes wide open and a serious look on my mouth, and everyone else was tryin not to laugh. We got upstairs, and put on some music, and I have no idea how, but every beat I could feel inside my body. Music was greatly intensified, and I seemed to like everythin I heard. We were playin a lot of techno, hip-hop and rap, and the bass felt sooooo gooood. Then, they put on this color show thing on T's Xbox. So for about 10 minutes, I was starin at this crazy color and patterns show on T's 50inch tv, trippin out of my mind, and bein hypnotized by somethin so vivid and beautiful. Then we decided to play some Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and I just kept laughin whenever someone died (aren't I the mature one?). But soon enough, I had decided to let myself test out my creativity, and here I shall go in some depth.

I am artistically talented at both dance and music, 2 precious gifts that I treasure with all my heart. When I am inspired, or suddenly get a concept or idea of art, I am for that moment either in a trance, overwhelmed by an immense feelin of bliss, or am energized by an incredible adrenaline rush, and then I imagine the art, whether abstract or followin a concept/idea, and I have the urge to put the most beautiful thing I have ever come up with down into the real world, and appreciate my wonderful creation.

Well, durin my trip, I was constantly in that state. I had an amazin feelin of bliss, a creative mindset and imagination that rivals the most abstract concepts and images found in dreams, and somehow more passive and relaxed than someone could be in the best massage chair ever built. I was in a constant artist's bliss. Images, sounds, ideas and dream-like thoughts were comin into my head every second, a lot of them often somehow bein related to the song that might've been playin at that moment. One of the most beautiful yet peculiar things that came up in my head is this music video-like scene of this mirror image of a green distorted girl dancin to the music, with bright yellows and greens flashin in the background. I have never felt a thing so artistic yet beautiful in my life, and the intensity of the feelin was somethin that rivals (not intendin to be vulgar) sexual pleasure - mainly orgasm, and although it is not as intense physically, my mind was just as delighted.

As the time went by, my trip went down a bit, and I just became more mellow, and passive, relaxed beyond measure, and just felt like starin into nothin, lettin my mind float into whatever universe it may have been headed at. Then, my friends decided to pipe up the weed I had brought with me in my stashbox, and we headed downstairs to the same spot again. I inhaled, and the smoke was hot, and unfortunately, we did not have a filter, so when I inhaled some ash. I was overwhelmed by a fit of coughin, and a horrendous burnin feelin in my throat and lungs. The pain in my lungs was very difficult to bare, I simply have not felt so much discomfort in my lungs before, and I just didn't want to take it.

As we headed back upstairs, I had this feelin of paranoia that lead me to believe that my friends were plannin somethin behind my back, and whenever I saw them talkin to each other, I somehow thought it was about me. I was even afraid to walk in front of them, for fear that they might do somethin behind my back, and I always wanted to walk behind them, so I could observe everythin they did. Then, they DID notice my paranoia, and one of them hid by a corner, jumped and scared me outta my lights - I let out a scream that could've woken up the dead. They laughed, and we eventually got to T's place, and sat down once again. Then we proceeded to play Need For Speed on T's Xbox, and somehow I was playin better than I ever was before. The controls seemed more natural to me, and yet, at the same time, I was still mad passive and relaxed, hypnotized by the game. The road in the game somehow seemed to be a path into another dimension. It felt like travellin through a tunnel.

Eventually, I had to go. It was 6pm, and I wanted to get home, so I left for the bus, and durin the whole ride I was so relaxed, yet tired and sleepy the same time. My vision was still funny, and the dizzyness was still there, though. I'm pretty sure people noticed I was high, because when I stood up, I was all wobbly and whatnot. By the time I got home, which was at about 6:45pm, I ate like crazy, and noticed that movin gave me the biggest headache, and so I sat down. After a while, the headache went away, as well as the sleepyness, and so I sat there, waitin for my girlfriend to come home, so I could experience that one unique feelin that nothin else could ever mimic, love.

So all in all, yesterday's experience with weed was amazin. I have felt like an artist in every genre durin the whole time, was relaxed beyond my mind, and was happier than an alcoholic durin a wine-festival. I wanna try out eatin weed, as well as usin bongs and vaporizers. I really wouldn't mind somethin that would be a lot easier on my throat and lungs - especially when I am passionate about dancin (breakin), hehe.

BODY WEIGHT:
125 lb





I have smoked marijuana regularly for the past 2 years, but have never had an experience quite like the one I had last night:

I was at a friends house with four friends: Kyle*, Rizzo, Bella, and Aqualung. We were just hanging out and watching trippy movies, and then Kyle's parents left, so we decided to go outside and get blazed. Usually I'm extremely careful when it comes to bongs, because they make me cough a lot and they get me high really fast. But this was the last day of school, so I wanted to get fucking high as hell. I took a deep hit and coughed a lot, then drank some water and took two more slow, deep hits. After that I refused any more, afraid I'd get really giggly and not be able to control myself. 

We all went back into the house, and my throat felt really scratchy, and I kept coughing repeatedly. I felt fine, kind of spacey and subtly happy. Then suddenly I got this weird feeling that I was in a different place and time than the others. I looked at them with huge eyes and they looked fine, but I felt like I was tripping out. Whenever somebody spoke, their voice sounded so loud that it echoed all around me, and yet I could hardly understand what they were saying. I decided I really needed to lie down and calm myself, so I went into Kyle's bedroom and laid down on his bed. I took a few deep breaths and told myself that no one would know I was tripping out unless I told them. 

I flipped onto my side, nestled my head into the pillow, and gazed up at the black-and-white Beatles poster that hung on the wall. I watched all of the Beatles faces and they all seemed alive. Paul McCartney's eyes looked so huge and awake, it was like he was about to say something to me. And at that moment I realized that the photograph didn't just capture an image, it captured a piece of their souls. It caught their essence and preserved it forever, which is why they looked so alive. Just as I was really starting to enjoy looking at the poster, Aqualung called me from the living room and told me to come out and watch a movie with everyone. I really didn't want to leave the safety of the bedroom, but I went out and lay down on the couch and started to feel really weird again. 

I knew that the effect of the herb would pass, and the only way to make it through was to close my eyes and ride the roller coaster. I closed my eyes and as soon as I did I started seeing hundreds of pictures in my minds eye, all were incredibly vivid, as if I was actually seeing them. One of the things I remember seeing very clearly was a kind of two-dimensional cartoon. I saw cut-out pictures of mine and my friend Jude's faces on top of childish stick-figure crayon drawings. We danced about on our 2-D stiff, square cartoon bodies in front of a crayon-drawn field of flowers. We held hands and looked happy, our photograph faces always staying still with the same expressions. Suddenly, the background changed from a field to dark hills and a red sky. Jude let go off my hand and turned away, walking away on his stick-figure body. Suddenly his photograph face expression changed from a happy smile to an angry frown. He picked up a bloody cartoon ax and then ran towards me with it, all the while in a comical stiff stick figure way. I ran away on my stick legs and he chased after me, baring the bloody ax. 

The images changed and I started seeing other things. I can't really describe everything I saw but the best way to explain it is to say it was like walking down a hallway, with psychedelic flashing colors covering the floor and ceiling of the hall. The hall had a bunch of open doors, and each door was a porthole to a different universe. Some universes were full of light and color, and some were dark and scary. Each one was different, and I felt I could view each one as I liked. As I looked at all these universes, I realized that I belonged in all of them and none of them simultaneously. I didn't belong in any one, but a part of me was in each one. It was the coolest feeling when I realized that I could be a part of every universe at once.

All of this went on in my mind with my eyes closed while everyone else watched a movie, completely oblivious to the fact that I was visiting other universes. I opened my eyes and realized that each surface in Kyle's living room was a different universe as well. I looked at his brown wicker stool and somehow knew that it represented a universe full of dead brown trees that were infested with millions of tiny brown gnomes. I looked at a blue couch and knew that it represented the Sorrow Universe, where everyone weeps and weeps for all eternity. I glanced at the floral carpet and happily realized that it represented a jungle universe, full of lush trees and fruit, where I once lived and ran naked with the natives in a past lifetime. 

Keeping my eyes open became too much of an effort and too much of a mind trip, so I closed them and realized that the effect was fading. I was happy but at the same time a little sorry that I had to leave my little universes. As the scary feelings wore off, I realized that I was completely at peace with everything. I saw a vision of myself lying naked in the middle of a desert, gazing up at a sapphire sky, completely at peace. 

The only other really weird thing that happened was I got really horny and even though no one was touching me and I wasn't touching myself, I felt as if I was about to have an orgasm. At this point I opened my eyes and watched the movie that everyone else was watching. It was a bunch of circus acrobats dancing and leaping, and I felt as if every movement gave me sexual pleasure. Every time an acrobat moved, It was as if their movement was touching me between the legs, as if I held everything between my thighs.

After the visions and the horniness wore off, I felt extremely hungry. I had the munchies worse than I've ever had them. Right before we got high I had eaten dinner, then when I got the munchies I ate a bag full of rosemary crackers, two fat licorice sticks, a power bar, and a dish of ice cream and I was still starving. I felt okay by the time I had eaten, but I still felt strangely like I couldn't move or talk/function very well, so I mostly just sat quietly and didn't do anything.

Me, Bella and Aqualung went back to Aqualung's house and lay down in bed. I begged Aqualung to find me something to eat, but she told me I had already eaten enough so I should shut up and stop tripping. I tried to sleep, but then for some reason I starting laughing and it took me a long time to stop. Then I slept deeply.

The End

Note: After last night I realize that I have an extremely low tolerance for THC. I have had trips like this before, but with this one I was in a fairly relaxed state, so I was able to try to remember some of it. There were hundreds pictures and philosophical discoveries that I am not able to remember. This is a little hard to believe I know, because all I did was take a few bong hits, however, a friend once told me that coughing can give you a better high, and now I think I believe it. I'm definitely not going to try any other drugs...if this is what pot does to me, I don't want to know what acid would do. : )

*Names have been changed.

After researching about the substance and talking to my boyfriend about it, I decided that I wanted to try it out with him. He's a usual smoker so this would be nothing new for him. I smoked for the first time a couple of months ago - I took in decent hits, but absolutely nothing happened. I smoked a few other times with friends at night at a golf course and still the cannabis did not affect me. In fact I smoked at least six times before actually getting high. My boyfriend and I discussed why perhaps I wasn't getting high and we came to the conclusion that perhaps I just was not comfortable. So he did everything he could to make sure I was comfortable and it finally worked. I just needed to relax in order to appreciate it.

He would take a hit and then shot-gun it to me, and then I would take a hit and breathe out like a dragon. We did this for an entire bowl and he asked me how I was doing. I was still feeling normal as usual. We slowly got up and as I was entering the room it blurred to the right and then to the left. The colors seemed beautiful although they seemed to bleed as the blur moved. I walk into the room and I tell him to wait up, I gaze at him a bit confused and then say 'No, never mind it's not happening anymore.' From that moment on my thoughts are just racing but everything seems so slow compared to all of the thoughts in my head. I start talking and it feels as if Im not the one doing the talking; it feels as if I were a mechanical doll just saying what I was programmed to say. This continues for awhile, I begin to walk around the room and just notice the difference in how things seem. My cheeks seemed heavy, my tongue seemed to swell up, the light outside was extremely vivid  then all of a sudden this burst of happiness just overcame me. 

I was filled with happiness: I was happy to be with my boyfriend and I was delighted to finally be high. He repeatedly asked me Are you sure youre high? and I would just nod my head up and down. Everything was happening so fast yet the time seemed to drag on and my thoughts just continued to go faster and faster. Out of nowhere I asked to hear the Zelda Theme Song  I dont even play that video game. I was in amazement at everything, all of this seemed so new to me, I was looking at it all in a new light. I was speaking my mind, at least thats what I think I was doing. It was as if I was thinking out loud, but I needed someone to reassure me. I wasnt sure if I was talking or if it was all happening in my mind so I continuously asked if I was being heard or not. And I kept apologizing because I thought I was talking too loud.

Then I got the sensation that everything was a dream, but it was a dream within a dream. I kept thinking that I was dreaming and that I was waking up only to wake-up from the dream of waking up. This continued on for a while and I continued to ask my boyfriend to not let me fall asleep. He filled up the second bowl and we went outside to his balcony to smoke. Once in the balcony I was just in astonishment by my reflection in the glass door. I took in a few hits, but the feeling of being in a dream was still over me. We had a few random conversations and continued to smoke. I took in a hit but I somehow thought I fell asleep or perhaps did fall asleep and just continued inhaling without really noticing what I was doing. Eventually it hit me and my throat seemed to close up and I began to cough. He asked me what had happened and I explained to him that I had just woken up. A bit worried he said we wouldnt smoke anymore that night because I could be overdosing. 

We went indoors and laid on his bed, but I was confused as to how we had gotten all the way from the balcony to his bed. I had lost all perception of transport, I no longer knew how I was getting from one place to the other, I just happened to be here at the moment and before I had been somewhere else with no explanation of how I got there. The whole time I was concerned with falling asleep, the feeling persisted; I kept thinking that I was waking up. I began to eat cashews, but I really had no desire to eat them, I just ate cashews because I was offered some. The sensation in my mouth that the cashews produced was out of the ordinary, I could pay close attention to the way it felt in my mouth only to be distracted by something else. We were on the bed for a while and I just have scarce memories of the thoughts I had. I was completely comatose, I felt as if I had no feelings, all the happiness had disappeared and all I wanted to do was sleep. 

The pizza arrived; we ate and then went back to the room. Once again I asked how we had gotten all the way to the room from the kitchen. I spent the rest of the night until 11:30ish asking him not let me sleep and also thinking that I was still waking up from different dreams all at the same intervals. I also noticed that my sex-drive decreased. Usually my sex-drive is over the roof but this time I was just paranoid. 

My first time was definitely unforgettable, although I wish I had not gotten so tired and sleepy. My first high was filled with happiness, lethargy, anxiousness, and confusions. This happened just yesterday, but I smoked again today, and although I did get tired, it wasnt as bad as yesterday.

This is basically a testament to the importance of knowing your rights and not allowing law enforcement to pressure you into doing something that would incriminate you or others. 

To provide you with a little background I have been smoking bud since my sophomore year in high school when i decided that maybe the DARE program really was bullshit and casual marijuana use might not be so bad after all. Long story short i enjoyed it so much that i didn't stop and eventually left for college. During my time in my hometown hotboxing cars was almost a tradition. Of course this is borderline retarded since its probably the most obvious way of getting stoned. Somehow this never backfired and I had avoided trouble with authorities altogether but of course you can't be lucky your whole life. 

During my freshman year at a notoriously liberal Big 12 campus I began smoking regularly with a guy who lived near me and we would roll a blunt or two and drive through the country to smoke. Usually we just drove but on one of these drives we found a park where there was a overlook point that allowed one to see the entire campus and surrounding area etc. We began frequenting this park and smoking since it was out of the way and generally pretty empty. Somehow the topic of hotboxing came up and he told me he had never done it and we resolved to fix that. 

The next day my roomate, friend, and I drove up to the park to hotbox a blunt. It was a little rainy and we considered this to be perfect conditions for a hotbox. We parked at the end of the lot and rolled up the windows and began chiefing. All was going as planned except for a few cars that drove in and out but generally paid no attention to us. The whole time my friend was so paranoid that we had to constantly reassure him that we had never had trouble before and eventually got him calm enough to enjoy the hotbox. About halfway through the blunt a car parked in the lot behind us for about 5 minutes and left which we thought was suspicious but ignored it and continued smoking. We weren't facing the entrance to the lot but I could see everything in my rearview mirror. As the blunt was ending (probably half an inch long) my friend got a terrified look on his face and told me a highway trooper had pulled in the lot. I called bullshit thinking he was just trying to scare me but sure enough the trooper pulled up behind us. 

Obviously the car was full of smoke and we didnt really know what to do so i told them to put the roach in the ashtray and hide all the paraphanalia like the box of strawberry phillies we had and waited for the trooper to make his move. Since I was driving i knew I would be the doing the talking and tried to think of a cover that would explain a car full of marijuana smoke. After about 2 minutes he left the car and knocked on the window and asked us to step from the vehicle. As I opened my door, which he was standing in front of, the cloud from the hotbox literally hit him in the face at which point I began to accept the fact that I was going to be arrested.

Before I go into the details of the conversation and series of events I think its important that two days before I had skimmed a page on this site about my rights regarding searches and my fourth amendment rights. If you smoke pot or even if you are completely clean I recommend reading the info on this site and others. You just never know.

Anyways he immediatly asked me where the 'dope' was at and I decided my only real option was to deny everything and refuse to allow him to search at any cost. I told him we didnt have any and that we were only smoking some cigars which he obviously didnt believe. He then started asking to search my car and telling me that if I had nothing to hide then it shouldnt matter. I basically respoded the same way every time and told him that it wasnt necassary and that there was no reason for a search and it would only waste his time and ours. During all this another trooper pulled in and observed my questioning but never really did anything. After realizing that he wasnt going to get me to allow a search he took all three of IDs and went back to his car while we stood next to mine. I assume he checked for warrants etc but we were all good and he talked to the other trooper before coming back and telling us that he knew we had something in the car and tried to convince me once again to allow a search which I continued to refuse, politely of course which helped the situation. We could tell he was frustrated and he eventually returned our IDs and told us that the drug dog was busy or else he would have busted out asses and told us to leave now and never come back which sounded like a damn good idea to me so we got in my car and left. 

You would think that he would have had a right to search since he clearly saw and smelled a car full of pot smoke. How else would a car fill up with smoke unless somebody was smoking in it? But he couldn't and what saved me was the decision to be firm and refuse search and it paid off in the end. 

The moral: read as much information about your rights as you can and be discreet

Knowing that I broke a hotbox on a state troopers face is pretty cool too.

I hadnt smoked marijuana in three months. That was a long time for me. But it made everything more so active, potent, and useful than not... 

I was sitting in a car that I was working on with a close friend of mine that I had never chiefed with before, and I thought (since I was moving the next day) that it would be a memorable experience for the both of us before I went away... You know, something to remember... Well anyway, He had maybe taken three or four hits off of my joint and he was baked, while I (being not as baked, but pretty up there) had taken the liberty to smoke the entire thing and chief all the rest of my weed into the car. 
The car was like a gas chamber, but with weed. He was sitting there staring at his mindful hallucinations, telling me stories of old, and in the beginning, I was seeing the same things as he was. I was sharing his hallucinations! 

Now, I do this a lot. When I am with people doing other things beside chiefing, I get glimpses of what they are experiencing, and it is something more than the visual aspects (even though the visuals are extreme and are there). I can travel into their world, their complex world. No, I can travel into their complex universe, where there they behold marvelous things... I can, when stoned, put my hands out as if I am playing a computer game, except with a complex keyboard with multiple dimensions and codes with complexities of nothing that can ever be imagined to be fathomed. I can see into my past. I can see things in my past that I have long forgotten. Things that seem unreal, yet are entirely real can be too real to me (if you can understand where I am coming from). I can become in the presence of God, and feel his warm smile upon me... I can be anything... 

But this night in the car was different. While my friend was telling me his stories, I seemed to drift farther and farther from my body... I became lost within a boundary that kept stretching to keep me thinking that the end was just at fingers grasp... But it was not. I kept falling and falling deeper and deeper into a state of depression that knew no bounds. I became like lead, constantly falling, yet gradually growing in speed, falling... There was never a 'rock bottom,' the state of mind that I was in was psychotic and kept changing from bad to worse. Things that once made since made no since, and I became aware that humans were not perfect... I was fully aware of this previously, but this was different. I saw a disturbing visage in my minds eye. I saw a completely wrong 'after death.' I saw that we as humans were all apart of a system, and that our souls were bound to the same central processing unit, but what it controlled I could not become aware of... I saw the souls of man aligned in rows and columns, which were perfectly in alignment, yet they were all the same... Like a program of little ants marching in, one with the same thoughts as the other, to do that which is told, and that no matter what they did, they could not change their fate, that they were apart of the system, and that no matter what they did, it was said to be done, and was in essence... Perfect. I saw every man on the face of this earth, and I knew each of their names, but they looked all the same. They looked, acted, and were all the same... They were perfect beings; following the motherboard everywhere it went. It was as if they had no free agency, and they were all under some sort of evil congregation disguised as something good... This scared me into a deeper state of depression, for I saw the light and was then, after almost grasping freedom, away from the shackles that were trying to bring me down... But just as I thought that I had achieved the state out of the state that I was in, I was pulled back to the pit of crude understanding that made me ill... I was tortured for a while. 

Over and over again I was given a glimpse of light and hope that God would save me from my state of mind, and almost when I felt that I had achieved freedom, the hope was raped from me and replaced with horror and belligerence and the thought that I was slowly dying and could not escape my fate that no matter how I tried, I could not escape the pit that I had fallen in. I felt like a dog jumping up for the ball hanging over his head by his master, and when he jumps up to grab at it, the ball is pulled out of reach and then let down so that he can believe that he has a chance to catch it and be in a happy land with his ball... 
Then I saw the light, I saw a foggy visage of Lucifer, and I knew the truth I knew what my experience had meant. The entire time I was in that pit without any light was the way life would have been if Lucifers plan had been the plan of life instead of Gods plan. Lucifer would have raped us of free agency, and kept us as that which I have described with the rows and columns But they all had accepted their fate, and were given no glimpse of hope as I was given that free agency existed, and that my experience was one to grow on 

I see now that my experience was worthwhile and was significant to my own personal revelation and testimony I see the importance of all things, and that God gave man, that man might use to better himself and glorify the father I thank God every day for giving me my unstable, yet stable mind to conjure and realize these things I have grown from my experience and am now more so wise than before I believe that man should not follow the law of man, but the law of the land, and that is: Do not Harm. Everything else falls under that rule alone. 

Too much of anything is not good. You must learn that there is a limit to all things, and learn that limit You must seek to expand your mind beyond the box that your mind lies in You must learn, love, and live (among many other things) 

So much more I could say So much more I could teach 

But for now, this will do 

Peace, Love, and Pancakes

My head begins to feel light, floaty, high.  It takes a little while to come on.  The next thing I feel is like Im in the back of my head, it's like Im watching myself from the vantage point of behind.  First I notice these sensations and before I know it Im gone. I speak to Perry and it's like Im not even speaking Im watching myself talk.  I'm not even sure where these words are coming from, how Im answering how this is sane and still working, because the real me is off in some other land, so who is it there able to have this conversation?  

It flows forth, watching TV, the TV first gets garbled it makes no sense and then begins to make a new sense a divine sense the real sense.  It's like everything is clicking, I realize that it's all a pattern, that this is all nothing that time doesn't exist, that this is how it will be forever.  But the nagging feeling still hasn't gone away forever, somewhere in there it is saying 'Yeah but what about tomorrow?' and what about tomorrow?  Tomorrow will never come, it can't come.

My body is twitching, it's like a shiver, but Im not cold.  The thought 'Im dying' is constantly flowing through my head.  I go with it though, what other choice is there?  I must go along with the inevitable, to fight would be useless.  It's all familiar, it's all known.  I have questions and the answers come back, 'Always has been always will be'.  I think of reincarnation and a way out, and it seems that there is no way out, that I will come down only to come back up again only to come down again, that's the way things go.    

I'm extremely attracted to the girl in the room, she is beautiful I think of telling her.  I think through all the past missed love opportunities that is my life and know that this one is meant to be missed also.  I fantasize, I feel stirrings in my crotch, but this is all it will be.  Before I know it she is leaving and I haven't even said a word, I don't even know where the time went.  I've been so caught in this loop.

Fear is flowing through me and away from me, it is so strong, scary, I mean Im fucking dying!  I know it would be stupid to freak out so I keep my mouth shut.  I go upstairs to go to bed to escape this fear.  If I go to bed I won't have this fear tomorrow, yeah but I won't have this genius this power this knowing this, this, it.  

In the bathroom everything is normal, but not, colors are normal but they aren't there is almost like a rainbow in everything, but so minute.  I pee, but not sure Im done.  I'm losing myself, who am I, what is going on, the fear.  I'm afraid Im going to lose myself and do something stupid.  I flush walk out, still feel like I have to pee go back in, pee more and come back out Im very confused now.

I lay down to sleep all my covers on me, I stare at a poster I have on the ceiling it is black and white and crazy like.  Im staring at this poster and I hear sounds one is like the sound of something when you spin it real fast whoosh whoosh whoosh.  I also feel the presence or know they are coming for me, aliens.  It's like they are going to come out of the poster or the poster is going to suck me up.  

My whole crotch area is going through two phases, first it feels like ecstasy it is extremely powerful great pleasure flowing through it, so good so good.  This lasts for a while then it feels like I had been knocked in the balls, it is pain, not too extreme.

These thoughts pass and soon Im falling asleep, Im still looking at myself from behind and it's like Im asleep with my eyes open and what Im seeing is what Im dreaming.  I think the thought 'lucid dream' I go over what it means being aware that you are dreaming it has more significance than just this moment it is applicable to this trip it has made me aware of the dream that is life.

I begin really falling asleep when I close my eyes there are visual and they all make perfect sense and yet they are wild indescribable, beautiful and have feelings attached to them.

Conventional wisdom in the cannabis-eating community has it that raw marijuana must be cooked with a substantial quantity of fats to 'activate' the cannabinoids.  The following report is an empirical refutation of that claim. 'Bud butter,' brownies, pot chocolate, and other imbued foodstuffs are merely a way of camouflaging marijuana's intense earthy flavor, which can undoubtedly offend a sensitive palate.

After reading countless forums, in which self-proclaimed urban chemists insisted that THC requires heating to facilitate its absorption into the human body, the need for someone to refute this claim once and for all was clear: here, we have one human guinea pig, about to enter the Twilight Zone.

Background: The test subject is not a regular cannabis user, and in all honesty considers use of same a silly waste of time.  He is, however, experienced enough to know exactly what it feels like  when smoked and eaten.  Test subject is also a physics major and schooled in the scientific method.

T+00min: One gram of mid-grade cannabis bud is ingested raw, on an empty stomach: chewed, swallowed, and chased with Smartwater.

T+30min: Slight physiological effects are noted: increased heart rate, a slight flush to the skin, slightly increased body temperature, and mild lethargy.

T+60min: Subject is subjectively and objectively intoxicated.  There is a general lethargy, increased heartrate, and noticeable uncoordination.  Eyes are glassy and the viscera has a reddish hue.

T+90min: Subject is completely rocked.  Mild auditory hallucinations are experienced.  Blood pressure is 135/90.  Appetite is stimulated: subject prepares a bowl of chili, Fritos, and a glass of water.  Body temperature is 99.2 degrees Farenheight.  Subject proceeds to watch entire first season of 'SeaLab 2021' and laugh himself into a hernia.  Lethargy is extreme.  Attention to environmental minutiae is experienced (ie, the pattern of raindrops falling on the window, the clock tick-tocking, the smell of incense).

T+120min: Subject is obliterated.  Pronounced ataxia experienced.  Subject is nearly overcome with drowsiness.  Subject is experiencing effects much more intense and long-lasting than those of smoked marijuana.

T+180min: Subject is overcome by drowsiness and falls asleep.

There you have it.  

Conclusion: eating raw marijuana produces strong effects.  The amount required to produce effects may differ between individuals.

This experience is more or less how I came to grasp the true strength and power that weed has. Before this particular session I felt I had only really scratched the surface of the true potential of this wonderful plant, and had only really felt just above threshold feelings. This was probably one of the reasons I went above and beyond the amount I would usually smoke.

I'm a 16 year old white male, not on any medication, without any (known) allergies and on this particular night, I had the house completely to myself. As soon as I was alone I grabbed the almost completely full baggie of bud and proceeded to get my shit together in preperation to enjoy. Although my parents were particulary bohemien in my upbringing, especially my mother of whom I speak openly about drugs with, I felt it was best to hide my smokables and such from them. I feared that if my parents found my weed I would almost certainly be sternly told 'I'm not mad, I'm just dissapointed' which hurts so much more, so naturally I wanted to avoid this as much as humanly possible. So, to recap, I have weed, equipment to make a smoking device and a free house for a good 12 hours.

I proceeded to go to my bathroom were I began to make the gravity bong (or 'waterfall' as they are called over here) that would no doubt insure numerous good times. I stuck the cone piece in the lid ensuring it was sealed and set about burning a small hole in the bottom of a 1.25 litre pepsi bottle. You may or not know the workings of a gravity bong, but I'll explain anyway. A waterfall works on the principle of water draining and sucking air through the cone piece screwed onto the bottle. As you light the cone piece (filled with weed duh), the water draining from the hole in the bottle will suck the smoke down from the burning weed into the bottle were your left with a bottle filled with condensed smoke, remove lid and suck the smoke in making sure the hole in the bottom is open. 

So now I was ready to take my first waterfall cone of the evening. I lit the cone piece and let the water drain, watching in awe as the bottle filled with thick, creamy smoke, quite a sight indeed! As the water neared its end, I regulated my breathing, unscrewed the lid and took the hit. Now 1 cone is 1 cone, nothing more. It will slow me the fuck down and I would probably notice a change but I wanted something more. I was aware that 3 waterfall cones would get the average person completely fucked up. I decided to up the anty 2 or 3 more cones, for better or worse.

As 1 became 2 and 2 became 3, I started to notice my bathroom sink and the items which inhabited the area around said sink becoming very interesting. At times I would have to snap myself out of my glazed stare to fill up the bottle again or pack another hit. By the 4th cone I was coughing like a coal miner and felt the need to sit down and asses were I was. It was either brave or stupid to ignoring my physical needs and push onwards for 1 or 2 more cones. After going the extra yard and taking 2 more hits (A total of 6 waterfall cones for those of you not keeping score) I went out to where I spent most of my time, The computer/TV area and looked to see who was on msn.

I first started to notice something was up when the computer monitor was alot brighter than usual. When I say brighter than usual I mean it was almost impossible to look at. My eyes could not focus on the intense light emmited from it and after looking away to the TV to see what was on, the full realisation of what I had done began to set in. My vision had no chance of keeping up with my head movement, The trails became more and more intense until they were thick and pronounced. This was were I started to bug out a little bit.

This was unlike anything before. I began to realise that I was alone in the middle of this intense high and began to worry a little bit. After this experience I found that this particular weed comes on relatively slowly compared to others. It took a good 25 minutes for the full high to come on. I started to stress about what I had done and more importantly where I was going. My thoughts were muddled and confused. I found this experience drew parallels with the come up of MDMA of which I had used for the first time on new years eve 2 weeks previous. As the high took hold, for no apparent reason I began feeling very, very uncomfortable with my surroundings and went to my room. I got to my doorway when I started watching TV to direct my attention away from the strange things going on in my head.

My thoughts soon drifted back to my original feelings of dread and I began to feel scared and alone once again, not sure if I would come out of this experience unscathed or not. I stood in the door way of my room for 5 or so minutes, not being able to make up my mind to turn out the lights in my room and lie under the blanket, or to try and watch tv and let these horrible few minutes pass. Eventually common sense prevailed and I went out to my living room to watch TV. Although I don't remember what was on I believe it was of the comedy qenre and it was fucking, fucking funny. I laughed till I could laugh no more.

This really helped me control the high I was experiencing and I soon felt good enough to try and get some kind of dinner together. Nachos baked in the micro-wave seemed a good idea. Requiring only 3 ingredients, Nacho chips, salsa and cheese, I didn't think It would take the 30 minutes it took for me to gather my thoughts long enough for me to assemble the nachos. My mind was constantly distracted. I soon became fascinated by the way my arms looked hanging at my sides. If I kept my eyes straight, the look of my arms flailing around in space in my peripheral vision was a very interesting sight.

At this time I had my bass amp hooked up to my computer and I was able to play songs through it with good results. I had been listening to pendulum and as I let the drum and bass beat intice and entrance me, then it dawned on me, I was in a music video! My warped vision helped perpetuate this feeling and I began to feel a bit like I was in the music video for The Prodigys 'smacked my bitch up'. I grabbed my nachos and began to eat. I had begun to feel intense rushes of energy in my body that went from my head, in particular from my right ear down to my feet. The feeling was momentary but it was quickly proceeded by another rythmic rush of energy.

I began to notice that If I saw something which prompted me to remember how fucked up I was, be it how my arms looked or how intersting a nacho chip was, I would feel another rush of body energy. It was like the weed was rewarding me with this feeling for embracing what it had done to my mind. This was a very pleasant sensation I thought as I sat, slumped and glazed eyed on my couch. This is were I spent most of my night, I mean, I couldn't really think about doing anything else, let alone expending energy on something frivolus like moving around.

I enjoyed just sitting and letting the high come and go, just watching TV and letting time slip away unnoticed. Of course I could have done something creative like play a musical instrument, or written a poem or something, but me and the weed both decided that just sitting and enjoying was probably the best thing to do at that moment. So that's what I did.

To summarise, After this particular session, I feel I have really unlocked at least some of the vast potential of mary jane. After a relativly rough couple of minutes easily on par with and MDMA come-up, the good most definatly out weighed the bad. I still feel I have alot to learn about this particualar plant and its uses beyond just getting fucked up, but for now getting fucked is fun and I will continue to (hopefully) use this plant recreationaly again many more times.

There have been four times when I died from smoking. I didn't actually die in the literal sense of the word, but that's the only way I can think of to describe it. The first time it happened was when I was 16. During my first two years of high school, I would go to my friend D's house everyday after school and we would smoke until we couldn't properly form thoughts anymore. This one time in particular we had smoked two bong bowls, a joint and a bowl out of a metal pipe. We went outside to smoke a cigg after we were done toking, and that's when I started to lose my senses. The first one to go was my hearing. Everything became muffeled and the temporary deafness bgan to make me feel quite sick to my stomache. We went back inside the house to get some ice cream to fullfill our cravings for munchies, and that's when my sight left me. 

Everything became blurred, geometric patterns had taken over my vision and the swirling patterns became too much for me. I muttered something to d about not being able to see anything and then I fell. D was able to prevent me from hitting my head and he carried me into the living room so I could lay down. He says that I fainted, but I could still feel everything that was happening around me. I could not speak, couldn't hear and couldn't see, but I still knew what was going on. After about ten minutes I was able to move again, and he helped me get to his bed. I lay there for nearly an hour, I guess I was in shock that that had happened to me. I felt miserable inside. I had never had anything even close to that happen to me before. I was embarrassed that D had to witness it, I never wanted to smoke again. Of course, the next day I felt differently.

The next time it happened was about a year later. D and I were over at our friend's house and we smoked five bong bowls and about a four gram joint. I took two shots of tequila. We went outside, once again to smoke a cigg. I was doing alright at first, but then it started to happen again. Once again, my hearing went first, then my vision. This time I fainted right outside, falling off of the fence I was sitting on, hitting my head on the concrete. I could hear everyone around me talking, I couldn't see them though and I couldn't respond to anything they were saying. All I could do was lay there and laugh. It took awhile for me to be able to walk again, and I guess they more so just pulled me inside. The second time was the worst, because I had convinced myself that it had just been a one time thing, and I was so dissapointed in myself for this happening to me, I was ashamed of myself as a stoner and a person.

The third time was my favorite. By this time I had come to accept that I had no control over what happened to my body when I get too fucked up, and when it started the only thing that really scared me was the fact that I was at a concert. My friend J and I were at an ICP concert. I had drank four Smirnoff Ices, and we smoked two or three bowls from a metal pipe. When we finished smoking J left me to go find a good spot to see the concert, I didn't go with him because I could feel death taking over me. When my hearing left me I decided to take the initiative and make this as easy as possible on myself. I got off the table I was sitting on, for fear that I would fall off of it if I didn't, and sat down in a corner where I could relax. My vision went as the music started.

The experience was incredible. I couldn't hear the music, I couldn't even see the band playing, but I could feel the bass pounding through my body, taking over every cell and organ inside me. My heart was pumping to the music, I was the music. I started to come around a little, and I realised that if I didn't find a way to cool down I would most likely faint. I made my way to a window and sat there for the rest of the show. At some point some guy came up to me and offered to smoke a few batties with me, which I graciously took him up on. And then I smoked a blunt out in the parking lot when the show was over.

The fourth time I died was yesterday. I smoked a blunt with a friend before school. I could tell right away that it wasn't going to turn out good. I was in the wrong state of mind to be smoking. I was worried about finals, and then I became worried that my principle would know I was stoned, and then I was worried that I would freak out and die in the middle of class. Well, this time my vision went first. I was walking into school, not being able to see where I was going, luckily having the route well memorized. I went straight to the bathroom and sat down on the floor. Two girls came in after me and tried talking to me, but all I was able to say was 'I am so fucked up right now.'

I forced myself to get up and walk to my class. I passed the principle on the way and told him I wasn't feeling very well when he asked what was wrong. I lay down on the bench in the back of the room and tied to let myself relax a little. The only comforting thought that I had was that at least if something went seriously wrong I was in a safe environment, my school is my sanctuary, and no matter how fucked up I am I know my teachers and peers would take care of me. Anyways, it took about ten minutes for me to relax and chill out, and then I was fine.

That's the thing with dying, while I'm falling deeper into it I feel like everything is lost and I'll never be happy or sane again, but then I fall out the other end and I see everything in a whole new light. My perception on everything is different for the next few days after my death, but I do get back to normal eventually. My reason for writing this is so that just in case anyone else out there experiences death like I do, I want them to be able to understand it and not be afraid. The more you worry during it the worse it's going to be.

What follows is a detailed account of last night's events, described as clearly as I can recall. This wasn't exactly my first experience like this, but it was more extreme in some manors than others times like it.

Now, before I really start going into the experience I think it paramount to give you a little back ground on my experience with marijuana as well as myself to maybe help you gain perspective into my story. I am 18 years old. I have been smoking for almost 2 years. I have smoked some of the worst pot and some of the best pot, as well as everything between. From dead and brown Mersh to glowing red AK-47. I love the feeling of being high. I don't smoke because I'm addicted, I smoked because I feel it expands my thinking capability, allows my mind to think and feel in ways otherwise almost impossible. I will say in honesty, that since I have started smoking I have became considerably more intelligent. Whether I can solely attribute this to my smoking seems unreasonable, I have also gone through many life changing events that also could have helped to improve my intellect.

At any rate, cannabis has never made me stupid, or slow. Lazy, yes, but I have always been lazy to an extent. I have lost interest in some things, but not school. That may be because I go to school for something I enjoy doing a lot. Smoking does have its bad points, after all, breathing in something thats burning can't be healthy for you. I have problems with depression and anxiety. I know the chemicals in my brain that produce these emotions/feelings can and do interact with the THC and other chemicals in Marijuana as well as other psychoactives.

It was just another day, same as usual. I hadn't gotten too much sleep the night before, a little more than 4 hours. That probably was not a good idea, because I require a decent amount of sleep on a regular basis as to avoid having problems with my anxiety. One of my friends and I had stayed up until about 4:20 in the morning before I finally decided to try and get some sleep. I woke up, got high and proceeded to get ready for what the day had in store for me. The course of the day itself is rather unimportant so I'll fast forward to that night.

My room-mate had just gotten home with a fresh bag of some good green buds around 10 o'clock, or maybe it was closer to 10:30, I'm not too sure. Moneys been a bit tight lately so finally getting a bag after about 4 days of smoking resin felt pretty good within itself. We wanted to get really baked, sit down, enjoy a good bag of green, so we rolled a decent size blunt out of a Royal Blunt Green Apple. I always have liked the Royal Blunts, this new package they use thats lined in what appears to be tinfoil really helps keep the paper moist, that, and they always taste rather good. The pot itself was just Green Bud. It was covered in a decent amount of crystals and was still somewhat moist. Other than the crystals I'd dare say it looked like really good mersh, it just didn't have the Green bud look to it. It was lacking that wonderful green color, instead it was replaced by more of a dull earth green.

We lit up the blunt and began to smoke it. My first hit was very harsh, much harsher than most Green bud I have smoked and I coughed for about 20 seconds. Not sputtering coughs but deep, forceful ones that leave your lungs and throat hurting. While I was coughing my room mate took his first hit, passed the blunt to me and then proceeded to cough a lot as well. I took another hit, held it for about 8 seconds and then blew out. I didn't cough so much this time, but my room mate still was. I passed it to him, he held it, didn't hit it then passed it back. By this time, about 2 or 3 minutes after my first hit, I was starting to feel the effects. I took my third (and last) hit, held, blew out and then sat there while my room mate took his last hit.

After about five minutes I began coming up very quickly, so fast, in fact, it was uncomfortable. I had been watching videos on my laptop so I continued to do so. After about 10 minutes I began to feel really tense (no doubt my anxiety kicking in) as my heart rate sped up. I made sure I kept myself breathing normally, I know a lot of bad things can happen when one overlooks these things. My chest felt very hot (my lungs reacting to the smoke, if I had to guess), and it felt as though my heart was beating very fast. I checked my pulse, normal except I could feel my heart thumping just a bit more than normal. No big deal. However, soon my pulse sped up a bit and I began shaking. It felt as though my muscles in my legs tensed up and then became relaxed, very quickly. Soon, I began loosing my concept of time. What was really 8 minutes dragged on for what I honestly believed was half of a hour. At this point I was sitting in my room watching 44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Bank Shoot-Out. It was during the process of watching this movie I hit the very peak of my high.

I was sitting on the floor, leaned up against a bed. Then, gradually every heart beat, every shake, every inhale and my every movement began to produce a sound. My heart sometimes would thump so hard I'd feel and hear a very loud, crushing thunder clap. When I breathed out sometimes I heard a deep grumbling, as though produced from a very tuned down electric guitar loaded with reverb and distortion. My shaking sometimes produced a very fast and very intense onslaught of mixed sound, what I could usually make out was the endless sound of what could be determined as ice breaking and cracking. Swallowing tended to produce the sound of an army of armored troops fighting like in the middle ages. At first the sound was random and didn't fit together, but then, it seemed as though my body was an Orchestra, playing a grand set, like one composed by Beethoven or Bach. The crescendo's and decrescendo's were part of me. The great ups and downs of the music seemed to be produced by my movements and thoughts. As I started to come down I slowly began to drift out of the music and into a tranquil sound of the wind blowing through tree's or something of that nature.

Eventually, I came down all the way and passed out. A lot of what I did other than that is a blur. The experience was very intense. I have had 2 panic attacks before, the first being very bad, leaving me unable to smoke for months. As well in a constant state of depression and anxiety for several months. Thankfully, most of the anxiety has gone away. The second I managed to almost stop before it happened, leaving me with the weak after effects for a couple days. I'm not sure if what I experienced was a panic attack, anxiety attack or what. I smoked once today at lunch, I took 4 hits from a joint and I barely got high but at least I didn't have any problems. I think the experience as a whole was a good one, even though while I was going though it it was very intense an almost scary. Had I not been though something similar before, I would have really had a hard time.

There are many, many reasons why that could of happened to me. I'm not sure why it happened. It wasn't very fun at the time. Looking back on it even a day later isn't too bad, but I wouldn't want to have that happen again.

The other day a friend of mine A, his roomate T, his roomate's girlfriend J, a friend of the girlfriend L, and I all went out driving to smoke. J was driving. I hadn't smoked in 5 years, and back then nothing really happened.  So I decided to give it another try.

As we drove, When it was my turn to hit, I took huge drags off of the pipe and held my breath for as long as I could, with the hope that I'd feel something this time.  After about 3 times around, each time taking as much as possible I started to feel it.  This was after probably about 15-20 minutes.  I noticed that everything seemed to become extremely slow.  Like time had slowed down, but not really.  When I moved my head, my hair would move and it would move with normal speed, but when looking at things not directly in my face, things seemed ultra slow.

I asked my friend A if he was feeling anything, since it was his first time too.  He said not really.  I noticed when I talked to him that my voice seemed an octive lower than usual.  My mouth tasted/felt extremely sticky and dry; I needed a drink.  A wanted to stop by his brother's anyway so when we got there I got out with him so I could get some water.  On the way into his brother's I found I could barely walk straight. Things looked very strange.  My head felt like it was compressing a little and everything looked like it had no depth.  It looked kind of like a pop-up book, with each object being a card on a surface, not 3 dimensional like usual.

When we got inside, I grabbed a small glass of water and drank it.  The water instantly cleared up my cottonmouth and I felt much better.  I wasn't feeling paranoid and I didn't feel like laughing.  I just felt like exploring the intensity of the experience.  After stopping at his brother's, A and I went back to the car and J started to drive back to the dorm.  We passed the pipe around more until our stash was gone. 

When we got back (about 45 min in), we all got out and I wondered if I really was moving as slowly as I thought.  I assumed no since no one said anything and started to walk towards the doors.  Before we made it to the steps up to the building, some friends of ours who were smoking cigs on the smoking island called us over to talk for a few.  Me and A went over there to talk to them.  One of my friends was talking to me, telling me something, but I couldn't focus at all on what he said.  I just replied with 'yeah' and 'cool.'  As I was standing there, I notice that when I moved my head it seemed that I was turning the background of everything with me, as If I was looking at a wall, and when I turned, the wall was still flat in front of me.  Eventually we got out of there and I noticed that A was acting completely normal.  I don't think he was anywhere near where I was, I could barely put a thought together, much less sing songs and talk fast like him.

We went in and I wondered how bloodshot my eyes were and if people would notice.  I wasn't worried, just curious.  When we got up to the floor we were staying on, I stopped at the mirror and noticed that my eyes were very very red, but doubted people would notice.  We grabbed a movie, 'Rounders' and put it in. I was sitting on the chair in front of the TV.  As I was watching, I noticed that I could only see things at one depth in front of me, like if there was a pop can 4 feet away and a bottle 5 feet, I could only see one at a time.  Once I found this out, I noticed something very strange, when I looked from one thing to another at different lengths away in a line going up I could like 'overload' my head.

I looked at the controller on the floor and from that to the desk, then to the TV, then the clock on the TV, then to the ceiling, and when I did that my head would 'overload' and I would trip out for a second and my head would go back to the beginning. I found that if I did that multiple times in a row quickly I could get my head majorly overloaded.  It wasn't a bad thing, just weird.  Kind of like I was dizzy, but not being at a disadvantage.  I wondered if the people in the room noticed my head rolling all over the place, but no one said anything, so I assumed they didn't.  Time seemed to be going by very very slow.  

It started getting late, so I rode my bike back to my real dorm which was across campus.  I had no problem operating it. The cold air bothered me.  I got back to my place, did a little more 'overloading' and then tried to sleep.  I was unable to though and ended up getting no sleep at all, I just couldn't fall asleep.  The next day after I gave up on sleeping and took a shower and ate breakfast I still noticed that I was slightly light headed and had a bad headache (easily cured with liquid Advil tabs).  

None of the other people who smoked had anything similar to the experience I had.  I'm glad that I was able to experience this 'brain overload' but hope that someone else will eventually be able to understand what I am talking about.

I, prior to this experience, had smoked pot 3 times, but they had not worked very well. I had not even a good introduction into the true nature of 'stoned.' My mindset at this point was a mixture of curiosity and unwillingness because of lack of understanding. My accomplice was a very good friend of mine and had gotten into marijuana in grade 7 (when he was 12), had nearly stopped in grade 8, then began again in grade 9. And at this time I was also in grade nine and 14. I was a very melancholic, self-isolating, and whiny being back then. I was very sensitive, and had no mental discipline and no fully formed concept of my spirituality. A very typical grade nine in many ways. 

Back to the experience, me and my friend had gone to hang out on a Saturday, I had no intention of smoking. It was a very nice day out, sunny, not too wet or dry. It was a regular spring day. My friend was smoking a fair bit of pot then and had brought along a five piece that he'd pinched from his older brother which he termed 'B.C. shit'. He said that he was going to smoke whether I did or not, I didn't mind anyway, so we went to a large ravine near my area. He asked if I could help him roll the pot into the paper, and I said sure. At this point I said that I liked the ritual better than the actual smoking. He brought out the bag, which was filled with a very fine, yellow, and hairier looking pot then I had seen before. What I didn't know, and he did, was that it was actually crystals scraped out of his brother's coffee grinder that he put away separately. I asked him if it would get me 'high enough,' because of my previous disappointing experiences. He said 'maybe,' in a very laughing manner.

He didn't know how to roll except with lined paper and that is what he used. I helped do a 'cheater's roll', where one rolls the joint before putting in the pot and widens the opening with a pencil. We did that with two joints, and he lit it, and was going to smoke it all, and I couldn't resist, so I said 'Please pass that.'

After smoking, I coughed and burped and, like he said, it tasted like milk. I think anyone who has smoked pot knows the feeling afterward. We walked up the stairs out of the ravine and it hit me as we were crossing the street, a lady passed us by and she looked like a pop-up book character. Nothing made sense. My friend who is short and stocky seemed evil and troll-like. I could hardly walk. At first it seemed like a video game, then a cartoon then a dream, or all of them all at once. To go where we were going we had to go through another, smaller ravine in my area. I for some reason was visualising/feeling a bouncing mushroom. I exclaimed to my friend 'I never knew you could feel like this.'

He said he would give me directions, he just tripped me out, telling me to walk with my toes 'on the inside out.' After exiting the ravine, I felt like I was floating. As well, there is a parking lot to a grocery store and it was barren. I couldn't believe that I was real or that anything was real. It was the first time everything in my mind became an abstract concept in the universe. I said to my friend that 'I am pulsing in and out of reality.' He just laughed.

For some reason the nice day had turned gray, and there was a pervasive fog that was everywhere and hard to see through. I kept asking my friend To stop me before traffic came because I thought that my legs were turning into a wheel. After a while I got body heaviness and really felt what gravity was for the first time, I felt like a bowling pin being swung every which way. We tried to find our other friend's house, but couldn't.

This was a very good experience over all, though I put many details in it, there were some very profound changes my consciousness underwent after and during the experience. It opened a new perspective for me. Now, without pot or drugs I access these states easily, and I meditate quite a bit. I don't smoke pot because I find, while I learn from the experience, I only do the big learning once, the rest is all details, as well, I can only focus on pot itself as the controller while on it, not myself as the guide of my existence.

I'm going to tell about my experience smoking cannabis last night (July 5th, 2006) because nothing like it has happened to me before that I can remember. Anyway, a little background. For a span of about 5 years I was a pretty dedicated smoker. All my friends were potheads and I was too. Every day I would hook up with at least one friend and if I didn't have a bag, they did, and we'd smoke up through most of the day. Most of the time it was purely recreational. I didn't think there was anything wrong with smoking every day and still don't as I'm pretty much a kind of 'do whatever you feel like' person. But in the past couple years I've barely smoked at all except very occasionally. I don't know if I just grew disinterested or what but it's rare anymore.

My dad rolled me a joint last time I saw him (a few days ago) of what he said was really good stuff, no paranoia just a great high, etc. so last night I decided to check it out. I smoked about 75% of the joint he gave me and within minutes started to feel the familiar mild head buzz coming on. Within about 5-10 minutes I was full on stoned. I was so high that my equilibrium was way off and when I walked, I kept feeling like I would stumble. Everything I did was impaired in some way. I thought 'Wow, this IS good stuff.' I decided to just put on some music and try to zone out for a while since doing anything else was pretty much out of the question for now.

I put on Camel's 'Mirage' album and was blown away by the genius of the music and production, considering that it was especially impressive for (I think) 1974. Then I listened to their Moonmadness album. But while I was listening I started thinking too hard about stuff. It had nothing to do with the music, it just happens sometimes because I tend to overanalyze things occasionally. It's a blessing and a curse. Anyway for some reason, all the negativity I have inside came to the surface and I was surprised how much negativity I had been harboring. I think of myself as a pretty laid back positive person, so I was taken aback by my own bad vibes here. Really I was plain shocked and pretty depressed about it.

I started really dogging myself out in my mind, and being really critical and cynical about everything in my life, the people, the things they do and say, especially me. Every single thing in life that crossed my mind was criticized by this sickening sarcastic voice in my head and I didn't know if it was my own inner voice or something else. I thought 'This can't be me thinking these things, I am way too relaxed.' Mostly I hated myself and felt like the only reason people must keep me around is because I'm so retarded that it is really amusing to them. I noticed a pattern of becoming friends with people for periods of a year, sometimes maybe more, and then they fade. I felt totally isolated from everyone I know.

Then I thought, maybe it's not that I'm just their entertainment, maybe they fade because I have a million walls up and won't let anyone really get to know me. That was a revelation and it hit me super hard because I knew it was closer to the truth. I know that I hide in myself and don't really let people see who I really am all the way. No one would have any reason to hate me, one of the few things I'm proud of is that I treat everyone with respect and pretty much let them be who they are. Except myself I guess.

During it all I was thinking 'Where is all this negativity coming from and why can't I make it go away????' It was really frustrating because every time I tried to distract myself, it didn't work. The negativity kept coming back and it got to points at times where I was nearly having anxiety attacks. I should have phoned a friend or something because I know I would have been proven wrong just by talking to a friend, and even while this was going on I knew it was just weird paranoia and issues surfacing that I need to deal with, but the thoughts were so exaggerated and I was so lost in it that I couldn't do anything but wrestle with it half-heartedly while at the same time trying to ignore it.

I should note I've also suspected for a while that I may have a sort of allergy to cannabis because I sometimes get bad headaches and my throat sort of closes off somewhat making it difficult to breathe, talk, or drink water. Maybe that was a factor too. Maybe those are normal effects though, I guess I should do some research and find out. Anyway I finally just figured it was a very negative high, a totally wasted buzz that by this point was beyond salvaging so I went to sleep. 

Both good and bad came out of this experience. It was almost like a real bad trip in some ways because my ego has never been so shattered. I wasn't just humbled, I was humiliated to even be who I am. That was a terrible feeling, but the good thing is that I did end up considering some legitimate issues that I need to work on in order to be more at ease with myself and with the idea of other people knowing me better. My mind is already working out solutions to the problems I was forced to consider last night. It was definitely a learning experience.

Ok, let me begin this by stating that I consider myself to be fairly well educated and experianced in the underground world of illegal drugs and substances. I haved tried many different kinds of drugs in my late teens which include weed, shrooms, acid, crank, crystal meth, cocaine, extasy, special k, opium, dxm (triple c), and various other drugs that I cannot recall at the moment, an unwanted side effect of such drug usage one would assume. I have tried all of these drugs at LEAST twice, some more often than others. I view myself as a veteran of sorts when it comes to weed. I've smoked many different types of bud before so I can safely say that smoking weed for me is about the same as smoking a ciggarette, just with a bigger and better high or buzz if you will. Ok so anyways enough about me, on to the story.

I belive it was around one year ago when this all happened, by then I had been smoking weed everyday for a few years. No problems with the drug at all, no paranoia or panic attacks and whatnot. So this day started out as any other, although I didn't have the urge to eat anything, just drank some coke and ate a few chips all day. So 10 pm rolls around and my friend who lives down the street from me calls me up and invites me to go over his house to smoke a blunt with him and a few of his friends. Not being one to pass up a free smoke I gladly jumped at the chance even though I was feeling quite hungry at the time. A few minutes passed and soon I was in my friends garage making small talk with everyone there. A few more minutes went by as my friend broke up the weed and rolled the blunt. When he finished we sparked it up and began the rotation. Everything was completly normal as I felt very comfortable in my surroundings. The usual feelings of being high slowly began to occur, and the usual 'cotton mouth' followed soon after. It took around 15 to 20 minutes to finish the blunt off and I was feeling very relaxed and pretty stoned. All seemed well, yet I tended to notice that my stomach would not stop growling. I just shruged it off and figured I would have something to eat when I got home.

We stood around talking in his garage after we were done smoking for around 8 to 15 minutes when I began to feel a slight headache creeping up on me. Thinking it was just a migrane I paid no attention to it, untill I began to feel VERY light headed. I tried to suck it up but it soon began to become very disorenting and I started to hear a high pitched ringing in my ears at a very low volume. At this point I began to take notice of what was happening to me and realized that it was best if I just went back home and layed down for a while. Trying to keep face with my friends I said I was going to go home and get something to eat and maybe go to sleep which was partailly true. I said my goodbyes to everyone and thanked them for the smoke out and began my walk home.

I had not walked more than 6 meters away when the light headedness began to intensify rapidly, it seemed as though me walking had somehow been to much for me at my present state, yet, I continued to walk down the sidewalk thinking I could beat whatever it was that was happening to me. I walked a few more meters and the ringing in my ears became much louder than when I had heard it before and actually began to drown out every other sound that was going on around me untill just a very loud and high pitched ringing was the only sound in my head. At the very same time the ringing grew, my vision seemed to become affected as well. My vision was slowly fading away as I began to see the sidewalk as though I was looking through a tunnel, a sort of a concave view that was slowly being overwhelmed by the darkness that seemed to come from all around me. Keep in mind that the whole time this was happening only a few seconds had gone by and I was still thinking I could make it down the street to my house which lay in my line of sight. Big mistake. My legs began to become very heavy to where I was stumbling untill the ringing in my ears and my tunnel vision had increased to where all I could see was black, even though my eyes were wide open, and all I could hear was this LOUD ringing. 

I then lost all balance and began to stumble rapidly to the side. Trying as best I could to regain my balance, but to no avial as just then I slammed into the trunk of a car that was parked in a neighboors driveway. Completely dissorented, I then stumbled immediatly the opposite way and fell yet again. But this time I hit the concrete sidewalk but was fortunatly able to break most of my fall on my arm which left quite a scratch on it. I tried to get back on my feet as soon as I could just in case someone who had seen me fall not think anything of it than me just having triped on something. I stood up only to have a small tree branch wack me right in my face. Oddly, after the branch hit me, my vision improved slightly to where I could see right in front of me and I yet again continued to walk home.

I got about 3 meters when I began to lose sight again and the ringing was getting louder. Finally realizing that I might not be able to make to to my porch in time before I fell yet again, I stopped and sat down on the curb 3 houses down from mine. I could feel my heart pumping at a very fast rate and I was sweating profusely. My breathing became very erattic and I was becoming very scared as I had no idea what was happening to me. I tried as best I could to take long deep breaths and tried to calm myself down in hopes I would feel better. It seemed like I was sitting there for 45 minutes when it could only have been around 15. Luckily, it seemed to work as the ringing subsided and the tunnel vision seemed to get better. Feeling slightly better I decided to go for it and walk to my porch and lay down on a bench. I got like maybe halfway and I could feel it all coming back, I kept going none the less determined to make it to the bench. Thankfully I made it before it got so bad as to where I couldn't walk, but just barely. I slumped on my bench and closed my eyes and continued my breathing technique which worked yet again after a few minutes. I then proceded inside where I quickly had something to eat and relaxed on my bed till all the symptoms faded away.

What happened to me that night I am still not sure of. I have smoked much more weed than one blunt at one time and never had I had anything remotely simmilar happen to me other than just the normal 'high' feeling. I know for a fact that the blunt we smoked wasn't laced with anything at all. The only thing that I can figure is that my body was just completly exhausted due to me not eating anything all day and then going and putting weed smoke in my lungs was all that it could take. It was a very scary experiance but I learned a good lesson from it and I continue to smoke weed everyday with much enjoyment and not with one bad experiance say for this one.

The other day, I went to an amusement park with 3 of my friends. When we returned, we decided it would be a good idea to go swimming at night at my friend Lukas's pond. Lukas is big on smoking pot. I had tried it two other times before, once over a year earlier and the other time about 2 weeks prior to that night. The first time I smoked, I took about 11 'hits' from a bowl and while packing another bowl I fell completely into a dream and started panicking, not knowing where I was. The last time I smoked though, I had not gotten high at all and I was dissapointed so I hoped this night would be better.

When we got to his house, we sat down in the basement, while Lukas and his friend Matthew played ping pong and the other girl Jessica and I watched. 5 or so minutes in, Matthew and Lukas decided to go leave for 10 or so minutes to go buy an ounce or so of weed. They gathered up 35 dollars and sent us to bring down water, a bubbler, and towels/bathing suits to the pond. About then our friend Mark arrived and waited while Jessica and I changed. Then we walked in the dark to the pond. We were having a bit of trouble walking through the brush in the dark, and Mark rescued us with a large flood light/flashlight and we went to go sit by the pond and wait.

Soon Matthew and Lukas arrived, and pulled out the weed while Mark felt it and estimated that the price probably should have been about 10 dollars cheaper. Then they packed the bubbler and started passing it around. Jessica decided not to smoke, but I did. I was the last in the circle of four that were smoking, and I managed one hit before the weed was kicked during the second time passing the bubbler around. They decided then to smoke a joint, and we sat there talking while Mark rolled the joint.

Slowly I began to stare off into space as they talked, and I began to catch snippets of the conversation they were having. Suddenly I realized that I had just said Jessica's name, but had no clue what I was talking about. I felt like I was dreaming, and started laughing uncontrollably. 'Jessica, its like I'm dreaming!' All the boys looked at me and started laughing. 'Dude, you're stoned.' Mark told me. 'After one hit??' I couldn't believe that I had gotten stoned after only one hit, but I could not pay attention long enough to keep wondering about it. I noticed that my tongue felt odd and I kept opening and closing my mouth. I decided finally that I had cottonmouth, and announced loudly one word, 'Cottonmouth!' then went back into my thinking. After what seemed like forever, we started smoking the joint. After it being passed to me twice, I opted to not smoke anymore seeing that I was already too stoned to function. 

After the joint was done, Jessica and Mark got into kayaks and paddled out to a floating dock in the middle of the pond. I waded into the water, but refused to swim out to the dock because I seemed to be afraid to be able to touch the bottom. For what seemed like a long time, I stood ankle-deep in the water, stepping forward then backward again, trying to decide whether to go back or to swim into the water. When I realized what I was doing, I started to laugh at myself. Somehow, I finally swam out to the dock and sat with Jessica.

So that we could see, the boys on shore turned on the flood light and pointed it towards us. The light to me looked like a beautiful sunset, a world of black with one sole light and the stretch of the light casting across the water. I told Jessica and Mark, who had suddenly gotten there, that it was just beautiful, gorgeous in fact. Mark asked what the fuck I was talking about, and I became embarassed that I kept speaking out stupid things and then forgetting them, I felt as if I was trapped inside my body while waves of forgetfulness and dreaminess kept me from functioning properly on the outside. As we sat, Jessica was shivering against me, freezing cold. I noticed that I was cold too, but I could not actually feel it and I could not tell if I was shivering or not. Time passed in a series of getting lost in my thoughts, then coming back, saying something, then becoming embarassed as everyone looked at me funny.

The combination of darkness and the one light confused me and allowed me to have minor visual hallucinations, like seeing my friends that weren't really there, or actually having dreams that I could see while my eyes were open. At one point, I was awoken from my daze of dreams to my friends acting worried and scared because of some noise that was being made in the woods. To me, it sounded like an owl but to them they thought it was a cayote or something. Lukas was the one appointed to swim back to shore and turn off the light so that we could go skinny dipping, and he seemed very afraid. At one point the owl/cayote sounded again and he swept the light across the shore, and suddenly I saw a cartoon lion sitting there. When the light left that spot, the lion dissolved into pink. I screamed 'There it is there it is!' and Jessica told me to shut up. I promptly realized that what I had seen wasn't really seeing a lion and was swept back into my thoughts.

Some time later, while I was being driven home with Jessica and our driver Jen, I started watching the road and feeling like I was on a roller coaster. Every hill we went on, I shot up my arms, yelling 'Wee! It's just like the coasters we went on today!' I am not sure whether or not we were actually going fast, but I am still shocked at my reaction because usually I do not feel as 'tossed around' in normal driving settings as I did then. When I was finally dropped off home, I discovered that I had the munchies and devoured chocolate chips, trail mix, and grapefruit, then went to bed still stoned. My dreams were fitful and different than usual, and I woke up wondering whether I was still stoned or not.

What has not been explained in these series of events was how my reaction was different to those of the other kids with me. Everyone else seemed calm, and their remarks at least slightly intelligent, they were able to hold conversations. For me, I experienced constant confusion, and mild visual and auditory hallucinations. This was after only 3 hits. So far both my smoking experiences have left me as the 'event of the night', with everyone talking about my actions and remarks. In the end, I am completely embarassed by my actions and would prefer to smoke alone and be left to my abstract thoughts.

As a kid and a pre-teen, and even during my early teenage years, I was highly creative, curious about the world, happy to hang out with friends, etc, but around age 15, for reasons I haven't fully figured out (extreme sleep deprivation may have played a part) my mind effectively shut down, I felt like I'd been lobotomized.  I was unable to write, which was my main creative outlet, or enjoy the things I read, as I no longer imagined or saw anything but ink on paper.  My friendships mostly evaporated; I was suicidal.  That was about 4 years ago and I'm no longer depressed.  I'm beginning to have a social life again.  But the workings of my mind still feel incredibly boring; my introspection from day to day is exactly the same; there's no imagination or daydreaming, just the physical world.

I'd tried weed 3 or 4 times before this one, but when there was an effect it hadn't been much; I'd simply felt completely numb (mentally) except for the time before this one, that is.  I'd baked in a car with my friend and his older brother and suddenly my thoughts had begun to unfold, leading to other thoughts and still others, a phenomenon that's probably ordinary for most people but that I hadn't experienced in years.  The ossified channels of brain pattern had been temporarily broken, the groove my thinking had been trapped in was breached.  This was incredibly cool, so it was mostly what I thought about: I was imagining a colorful neural model of my thought processes, the processes which were, of course, mostly concerned with generating the model.  Some ulta-recursive fun, but pretty narcissistic.

This time, I smoked on a whim with some guys I'd gone to middle school with, and hadn't seen much since, outside a party, at 3 AM.  5 minutes later, back inside, there was a complete shift in my inner state; I felt slightly surreal, sort of like I'd stayed up all night but without the fatigue.  I didn't actually hallucinate, but there was a feeling like the air was sparkling, evenly luminous.  I had a couple heart palpitations, which was kind of scary; for a few minutes I sat in the chair and paniked, trying to figure out whether I should get a piece of paper and write last thoughts or whether I was being a hypochondriac (the latter, obviously).

But I was thinking cool thoughts again.  I'd developed a bad habit, normally, of thinking in a sort of shorthand, without going through all the component chains of logic; now it was like the interal structure of every thought was laid bare; I was thinking in assembly code rather than C++, and parts of my brain that had been unused for years seemed to be coming back into play.  I blurted something I'd just figured to a friend of mine 'Eyelids evolved to keep stuff out of the eye!  That's why fish don't have eyelids!' my friend, who hadn't smoked, gave me a strange look.  I'd heard before that being stoned made things seem profound, but never appreciated why: the thought processes leading to conclusions might be equivalent to what they are normally, but on a low, component level, they're different.  I suppose that's not really an explanation, but it points in the right direction, I think.

In the car to the diner, I kept thinking cool thoughts.  For example, I decided that one the reasons people sometimes don't remember the experiences they have in altered states of consciousness is that the whole encoding system of the brain has been altered; neurons that normally are a part of one firing pattern are the part of another, and those responsible for memory are off doing something else.  I had a whole 4-D model of the situation in my brain, which I shifted 90 degrees so that time became one of the spacial dimensions and one of the spacial dimensions became time. But I found it impossible to have any kind of conversation with my friend, who was driving.  At one point, I was thinking up a reply to something interesting that I thought he'd said and lost my train of thought, and asked him to repeat the question, and it turned out that he'd just asked what I'd said.  Several times he told me he had no idea what I was talking about.

I can't remember the chain of reasoning, but I somehow became convinced that no two people could ever understand anything about each other, that empathy was an illusion and conversation consisted only of mutual misunderstanding.  I glanced over, and though I still felt like his friend, he seemed utterly mysterious to me, completely opaque, and I felt completely alone in the universe.  Sorry if that sounds melodramatic, but I can't think of another way to phrase it.

I'm looking forward to trying marijuana again, this time not at a party but with some friends who might be able to put the experience in perspective.  Though I don't like parts of the way being stoned feels (there's not much clarity, which I don't have enough of in the best of times) I love other parts of it (the free-flowing thoughts) and I'm going to try to get those things to permeate my normal thinking processes.  I feel less like a zombie now than two days ago, and more like myself, the way I was 5 years ago, and the best thing that could happen is for that to continue.  Also, I now appreciate Radiohead's recent albums. :)

The day was greatly anticipated: Friday, noon, a school holiday and I'd be in company of good friends, one of which I have known for a very long time, could, and always have, trusted strongly. But I had no idea that it would be one of the most intense, disturbing, entertaining, groovy, frightening and paradox-infested days of my life, man. It welled up like the great ascension of my favourite song projected into a tidal wave that looms over me in silence; a vision that plays somewhere else in the time-space continuum, while on the opposite side a fainted beat to that song shatters the fearsome dream-state into an infinite amount of pieces that veer off into the Universe only to come shouting back at me with full force, becoming my ego itself.

Don't misinterpret the few negative descriptive words used there though, man; they're just present to throw your conscious-brain off into subthinking and make you forget what reality is like when walking down that long and endless sidewalk that can't quite meet your feet. This is a very small part of the psychological jump that occurred for me.

Forgive the thoughts if they seem unorganized, but they are still struggling to return to this world even now, at 12:29 am after having begun to lose the trail of beta-level of consciousness long ago at approximately 1:00 pm.

I arrived at the place by a couple minutes passed noon, accompanied by my Strat guitar and a tiny amplifier that packs an insane sound that can vary in seemingly a million different ways. Today there was also a groovy navy blue beanie that held itself onto my skull very warmly, something that is somewhat out of character for me. But, luckily, the mood today called for something different, daring, crazy, out-there, and ready to make the world shout, 'Wow'. This something happened to be an unadorned beanie. Ironically, also, this was what saved my very life at one point in the day. Were it not for this thick winter-protective fabric my mind would have been subjected to visions that it wasn't ready to accept. It became a place of comfort and hiding; a physically comforting escape from the fear. 

After the arrival, we sat about for a while, jammed a bit, discussed some song possibilities and all the normal shit that I forget after the wave has left every part of my body soaked while the land around me dries up into a vast desert. Then one of my friends invites me to a part of the house that's safe, I know what's going on, he knows what's going on, and he knows that I know what's going on. All is cool.

Standing about, feeling odd and goofy like I normally do when the knowledge of the utter stupor and awkwardness of this adventure brews overhead, my friend extends a nice and pristine bud out at me and says:

'Take a whiff of that, man'

I do so and am totally unable to identify that particular scent, it has a crisp biting effect to it's personal smell.

'Wow, man' I say, 'That stuff seems crazy, man. What is it?'

'Guess. A very cool song was written after it'

'Dude! Purple Haze, man?' I whisper in the closest form of exclamation.

A nod and a big grin is the only response I receive. Now, man, I am not a strongly frequent user of Cannabis [It is only something I gladly indulge in on holidays, special occasions, weekends] and had no idea absolutely that this would be such an insane and other worldly thing for me. Sure, I *knew* this was a strong and crazy substance in front of me, but never did I imagine what was to come.

My friend loaded the bong and, as he did so, gave me a briefing on how to use this particular one. All I could think about was how nice this would all feel, how relaxing it could be. The first hit was nothing, effects didn't settle in like the marijuana I had smoked before and I began to wonder if my friend was even giving me anything at all. The second hit produced some vague feelings of dizziness and so I decided to sit down propped up against a wall, safe from any plunge to the earth below. These were normal sensations for a faint high and I thought nothing of it all. The third hit felt like the second. The fourth was stronger than the others and brought on an odd and different sensation of the muscles I did not know before. I may have taken a fifth or possibly even a sixth hit, but it's hard to truly confirm at this point seeing as my memory began to diminish quickly with specifics.

My friend and I sat in this room for a while and I remember him laughing about someone talking about us as they walked by the door. This freaked me out and made focusing very hard for some reason. Still, however, the effects were not strong at all; just the same as any common and weaker form of cannabis. This, as I remember, gave me mixed emotions that consisted of disappointment, curiosity, very slight paranoia, and a feeling of invincibility.

Finally, somehow, we reach the decision to leave the room and go watch some jamming that was about to take place again. At this point my friend says:

'I hope you're ready to enter the real world with a head full of marijuana, man.'

'Yeh, because I'm about to.'

Standing up and walking wasn't too different from any other time, there was that dizziness, the feeling of overestimating my movement for every step, etc. It was when I sat down on the couch to just watch the jam that everything began to turn. And fast. A sensation of becoming detached from my body began to creep up on me as the others jammed out to some songs I couldn't even identify at this point. I just smiled and enjoyed it, after all, the feeling was mild and rather nice.

Then visual distortions began. My friends began to move away from the world, as if they were coming off of the seems of reality and ripped away from a paper that they had once been glued onto, yet it was all 3-dimensional. This has never occurred before and yielded a feeling of suspicion.

Then the out-of-body sensation was amplified by about 10 times and it began to feel as though I had entered outerspace and couldn't return to my body, which had become a part of the couch. This thought frightened me and I started thinking that it would be impossible to return to reality now. Suddenly viewpoints shifted and it felt as though a part of my self was flying in the air and catching quick glimpses of people at different angles.

A thought entered my mind that perhaps I would regret doing this. I soon found myself traveling through space and time, which now merged insanely. One moment it took centuries for a single second to make it's pass, the next it seemed like hours could have been milliseconds. I began to think that I was moving at the speed of light and had the dire need to 'catch up to my body' but felt like I was moving too fast at the same time.

This is when I became very frightened and started to shake while trying to return to my body. I had to grab onto something and maintain reality, so began to hug the arm of the couch while moving into the fetal position. It felt as though my legs were moving rapidly and my arms and hands couldn't feel my face when I made the attempt to touch it. Nothing felt like it was actually a part of my body, even, almost like I was just a being without a shell, reaching back and touching my discarded and empty self.

My vision darted to every tiny thing in the room and focused on it for what I thought could be maybe just seconds but were possibly hours. This uncertainty of time made me self-conscious for some reason and I feared how my reaction could appear to those outside of my world. Suddenly, and unexpectedly, I noticed my friends laughing and pointing at me. It was like a jump in time to this occuring and they started to transform into these odd bird/dargon/lizard creatures. It was at this point that I felt entirely isolated in another realm and set apart from everything else but still somehow able to see everyone and hear them on some level. But no longer were we in the same place.

'Dude! You're in the fetal position, man!' I remember hearing.

I started wanting to disappear now but remember laughing while feeling my body get forced against the couch, my movements feeling increasingly more rapid and odd. Before I knew it, one of my friends was hopping up very quickly, insisting that I follow because there was a movie file that I had to watch.

Standing up was a real challenging task seeing as my body was out. But somehow I managed it and made it down the hallway to a room with a computer. The insanity of a show called 'Wondershozen' soon came on and it was alright at first, hard to follow or comprehend, yes. But then it became terrifying. The out-of-body sensation had seemed to be wearing off when it suddenly hit me again like a wrecking ball smashing into a rickity old building, but this time it came on about 10 times stronger than it had been before. 

A little boy was saying 'Stab you. Stab you. Stab you.' and I watched as his eyes melted off in complete fascination. But I was soon distracted again by the loss of my body and remember feeling odd and grabbing my legs a lot and eventually hugging myself. The insane thing is that I continued to watch this crazy movie file but had no idea what was going on at all anymore. My surroundings became only me and the screen in front of me. There was a vague awareness of others in the room with me, someone standing next to me and such, but that quickly left my thoughts. 

The strongest part of this trip came on and began to frighten me. I didn't know what was going on and thought that death was now inevitable if I couldn't return to my body so I was desperately trying to catch up to it but felt as though my movements were faster than the speed of light at the same time. I fell against a wall and held onto the folded parts of my beanie, pulling on it and holding it securely on my skull. The movie file began to get more intense. Things were popping out at me, sounds threatened my safety, eyes stared, mouths laughed, and ears closed to me.

I watched my hands feel the keyboard. Then they were back at my beanie groping the shape of my skull through the fabric, searching, moving like probes.

Soon enough, it became apparent that returning to my body would be impossible and that catching up to it would never be possible and the damn movie was still flashing in front of my eyes. I began to feel hateful towards the odd scenes for their frightening tendencies.

I was told to keep watching it, but I couldn't. I was so frightened of not being able to get back that nothing else mattered. I pulled my beanie over my eyes and began to cry while spazzing out and shaking horribly. However, I didn't even know if I was moving or if I just felt like it. This thought scared me. All the paradoxical realities were so complex with their simplicity that I felt like I was on a grid in the universe and getting lost in each tiny square that is only one in an infinite amount of more just as complicated as that single one.

The wall held me up. If it were not for it, I would have fallen to the floor and reached slowly out to it, to feel that I wasn't within it but just on top of it freaking out more than I ever had in my life.

My long-time friend said something to the effect of, 'Dude... she's really tripping out. Damn... Look at that'

They stopped the movie and I continued having trouble getting out of my spazzing and shaking. Vision became hard to even focus on and because of this, my sight was lost momentarily. I cried more into my beanie and closed my eyes, seeing all kinds of absurd animated-looking images that flowed like violent water into one another. 

The question was raised as to whether or not I was okay. Responding was an impossible thing. I couldn't talk. 'or maybe I can' I thought and then wondered if all my thoughts had actually been said. Then I remembered trying to speak and tell my friends what was going on, but it was so hard to truly communicate, sure I had that mystical feeling of being able to transmit all my thoughts, but something told me that wasn't reality; I was giving in to the sub-reality that my body was moving too quickly through. It felt as though I was talking too fast and too slow simultaneously. Words couldn't even be formed, I was just struggling to get a grasp of my body and to catch up to it's lightspeed velocity so that I wouldn't die.

My friends were then taking me out of that room and I remember hearing someone say, 'And it's common for this to happen?' as I was trying to stand. When walking down the hall I had to prop myself against the wall and remember sliding alongside it, feeling like a retarded animal, then I became a bird and felt a hiccup of flight before returning to earth somewhat. I began to become very paranoid, my long-time friend played some soothing guitar and tried to calm me down. 

For this, I tried to say, 'I love you, man!' but the spazzing continued. I was given a drink but remember thinking, 'AH! Poison! Oh god, It will kill me again. and again.' I drank it anyway.  Then remembered feeling like I shouted 'Water! Water now.'

Time skipped and jumped ahead, I became aware of the fact that was walking up some stairs and my friends were singing something about going to Mexico. I tripped out and saw all kinds of horse-shoes and other such things you might expect to see in some place like that.

We sat at a table and I laid my head down on it and remember feeling a lot of things on the table's surface. Then I sat up again and had the distinct impression that a malevolent entity was now present in the room with us and couldn't help spinning around to see if it would appear.

I was convinced eventually to just lay down and drink some water. My friends let me be for a while, something that I had wanted at that time. Every now and then one or the other would come back to check on my condition and try to get information from me as to how I was doing but it just wouldn't vocalize yet. I remember feeling very scared, abandoned, and fearful whenever they would leave after that.

Finally, the effects began to become less intense, but were still painfully present. I still felt detached entirely but the uncontrollable spazzing had ceased and it was easier to talk. I might have passed out at one point, it is hard to say, but I do remember waking up and thinking I was hearing a guitar lesson going on below me and that sound of a learning guitarist and his teacher talking and then playing being a very nice feeling that made the return to reality and the eventual repossesion of my body calm and beautiful.

The rest of the trip felt like any normal high. I became entranced by things on the television and couldn't focus on anything at all. The oddity that I never knew could possibly occur on something like marijuana had ended. Life was returning to normal, I had my body back.

All was good.

Before I begin this, I want to tell you that I'm affected very strongly by weed, I half-hallucinate almost every time I smoke weed, and I've been having auditory hallucinations more and more frequently, which I love. So, my friend and I went to a beach party, which rapidly descended into a huge sausage fest. As we were leaving, someone else, who was also leaving, asked if anyone had any drugs or alcohol, well we had weed!

We started smoking, the 3 of us, but were soon joined by 2 others. My friend and I aren't tight-assed about sharing weed, as I've grown some, and it's extremely common where I live. In fact you can get lots of high potency stuff for fairly cheap. As we smoked the weed, we started joking around having fun; we were laughing A LOT at this point, and the folks by the fire, who wouldn't touch drugs with a 40 ft pole, probably started laughing at us too.

After smoking both joints, and the roaches we joined them at the fire. I sat by the fire, and I remember being totally boggled by the concept of different temperatures; sitting by the fire, 1 side of my body was hotter then the other, and this amazed me. I started looking at my hands, because they were the most affected by the temperature change, and I became amazed that not only could I control them, but that I had not 1, but 2!

Whenever I'm high, I should tell you now, my vision becomes very affected; I see things on roughly 4 planes, which are fairly hard to explain. The best way, I imagine, is to picture a pop-up picture book. Everything is flat and 2-d, but the things are 'layered' if you will. I am the 1st plane, anything that I'm in (vehicle-wise) immediately becomes the second plane, along with anything near by me. The 3rd plane is for things farther away, trees slightly behind bushes for example, and the 4th is for things quite far away, across water for example. Water by the way, more specifically the ocean, is incredible.

As the other people around the fire became increasingly amused by the way we were acting, I started to get increasingly frustrated, it sucks being around people like this when you're stoned. So, my friend and I started to leave. We planned to walk back to his house. As I stood up, the hallucinations started, half ones like I usually have. If I look at the leaves of a tree, instead of seeing individual leaves, I see 1 shape, which tend to be dragons, or some other cartoony monster, not evil, just amusing and fun; they can dance, speak, even interact with me; but they can't leave the spot where they're seen. But this time they were almost full-on hallucinations.

I watched as we walked up the street gnomes appear and dance around, singing songs that would later become the ambiance for life. The strange things about these gnomes is that they were never directly visible; I could only see them in my peripheral vision, which seemed to extend to almost the dead center of the back of my head. As we continued walking, I was amazed watching the trees and bushes near by as they had the same dragons etc. that always populate them; and I enjoyed getting into conversations with them in my head. 

Then came the car. When I'm stoned, I'm terrified of cars. I can't stand them at all. In fact I can barely keep walking straight and keep my cool; if there's a spot to run to where I can hide, I will, and I'll stay there until the car passes. This time it was only the car of a few people from the party, and I was thankful for that. The gnomes had warned me in advance that it would be coming, and so I didn't freak out this time. However, a party had been busted a few nights ago, and there were a few cop cars cruising the area, my friend warned me.

As we walked along, the gnomes and creatures in the trees all the while keeping me company, I glanced over at my friend. All the colours on his body seemed to merge into one big puddle of colour; I can't really describe it. Everything was properly coloured, but it was also the same colours as everything else. The street, the trees, the light etc. I started to space out watching him, and then I heard the sound of a car.

This time, it was a cop car; and life immediately turned into a game. In fact, life was the most fun 'game' I've ever played. It was awesome. I was the hero, and I had to avoid the cars, while interacting with everything. It was at that point that I realized that pretty much the whole walk home, I'd been seeing myself from behind, as if I was an invisible camera, following myself.

We continued along, more cars passed, but I could generally control myself because life was like a game, and I was in control. I didn't have to suffer for my actions, so I didn't care; which in turn totally let me relax. Still moving towards my friends house, I talked to him the entire time, at least I thought. I asked him something aloud, something along the lines of 'That's true eh? (I'm Canadian) and he said 'What? What's true?' I realized that the entire time I had been 'talking' to him in my head.

Finally, we arrived at his house. It's awesome to go to his house, because he lives in a general store, so we did the usual routine for when we're stoned; Upstairs, grab a movie, some chips, some ice-cream, some candy, and a drink. I think the movie we grabbed was Lord of the Rings.

Downstairs, in the living section of his house, I asked him if he was burning out, and he said that he had been for about an hour. I was amazed at this, though when I'm sober I'm not, I've gotten used to being stoned way longer, and way more then most of my friends. I asked him to change the song that was playing. He asked me what I was talking about, and all of a sudden I realized that there had been a song playing over and over and over in my mind the entire walk home. More so then that, it was a single section of the song 'Don't Push' by Sublime. We watched the movie, though it was way too long with both of us burning out, so we fell asleep mid-way through it, though the parts of it I saw were incredible.

As for this trip, it wasn't particularly abnormal for me, I trip out like this all the time off of weed, it was just the most recent, and it was certainly fun. The game aspect was new, and I sure hope I can re-live that.

I am one of those people who definitely has 'his head on straight.' I get good grades in school, I have many friends, and I really do enjoy my life. I am not planning on trying any other kinds of drugs in the future, but who knows. Entering my junior year in high school, I had only smoked two cigarettes and drank alcohol but never been intoxicated. I had smoked marijuana several times in the past and never particularly enjoyed it. I had been high but never quite understood what was so great about it. In fact, I still don't. However, I am trying to fully understand the life of an authentic 'stoner,' so I have been smoking until I really achieve a great high.

My most recent time was one of the most intense. I had rolled a joint using a page from a 365 page-a-day calendar and tape; not the best joint. Nevertheless, it worked. I rolled one gram up and went out, telling my mom I was going out with some friends. I went for a walk to find a good place to smoke. Being that I had a joint, I knew it would be much less sketch to smoke in public, so I found a nice long street in a wooded area, struck a match, lit the end of the joint, and took in a nice big hit. I took several huge hits, but then I saw someone leave their house and start walking behind me. I quickly finished up the joint then stuffed the roach in an empty water bottle I was carrying. I continued to walk aimlessly, looking for a place to throw away my bottle because of the roach in it.

That is when it began to kick in. Just one brief moment later. It is hard to truly describe what it is like being high. It cannot truly be described through words. It is a feeling, nothing more but certainly nothing less. Telling it through words is doing the experience a disservice, but is the best way to convey the feeling accurately.

All of a sudden, I felt different. It felt as if I was starting anew; I hadn't just walked down the street, I hadn't just smoked a joint, I hadn't been at home earlier that evening. I felt like I was in a dream, too. It was as if I wasn't actually there. No hallucinations, no heightened senses. I just felt as if I was in a new time. My body was tingly. I heard my heart pounding in my head really loud, and my footsteps were rhythmic, as if I was walking to a beat. Everything looked so unfamiliar, and I had to concentrate really hard to know what I was doing. Time was distorted; the seconds felt like minutes, yet the hours passed by so quickly.

As I continued to walk, I felt like I was not actually there. It was so incredibly strange. In my head, I knew I was just stoned and that it would wear off eventually. However, the rest of my body was in a completely different state. It felt like my mind was detached from my body, like my body knew what it was doing and I didn't have to control it. I looked up at a street sign, then down at my feet. I looked back up at the street sign, and it looked like I hadn't moved at all. I kept doing it, and it kept working until all of a sudden, I was right in front of the sign.

I crossed the street because I remembered that there had been a dumpster across the street where I could throw my bottle away. Suddenly, I forgot why I was approaching the dumpster. I arrived at it, threw my bottle away, then had no idea where I was at all. This was one of the instances where my body took over. I felt like my body knew what it was doing, so my mind decided to trust it and I let myself walk back to my destination: a local hangout where all my friends were.

I arrived at this place; we will call it the Commons. When I got to the Commons, I was very disoriented. I still had that feeling that my mind and body were two different entities, but that I was stuck inside my body and it had control over what I was physically doing. I felt very free though when I was around people, and I was perfectly fine with this.

I was thinking to myself that, since I was stoned, I looked like one of the 'cool kids' and anything that I did was excusable because of this. With this in mind, I felt okay with the fact that I had no idea what was going on. A friend would come up to me and say hi, and I found it hard to talk to them. I could hear them perfectly fine, but my mind couldn't quite comprehend the situation. For example, someone would say 'Hey, what's up' to me. I heard the words 'hey what's up' but I didn't know at all how to respond to it.

I found my friend Warren and hung out with him the rest of the night. Everything that was happening, I didn't understand the reality of it. I would cross the street, oblivious to the chance that a car may hit me. I walked by a creepy-looking homeless man, unaware of my great fear that a homeless man will try to mug me one day. I walked along the busiest street in my city, not knowing that cars were zooming past me 50 miles per hour. I was very unattentive, but I decided to trust my body and let it do whatever it pleased.

I continued to go about the rest of the night, not fully understanding anything. I went into a well deep in a forest with my friend to drink. I took one sip of rum and everything looked a bit shaky. Then I told myself that being drunk and high just would not work, because I had to be home soon. I looked around the area. Last time I had been here, it looked simply like a small clearing in a forest. This time, I saw the well, the stone path leading from it, everything. I had a great fear that someone would come up from behind us and kidnap us, but I felt like this was simply my marijuana-infected body telling me this, not my knowledgeable mind. So I ignored it.

The rest of the night went by in a strange manner. Later that night, my drunk friend started messing around with some scary punk kids, and he got his skateboard and shoes stolen. I didn't find this situation dangerous at all. I just watched the whole thing and snickered. His brother got the crap beaten out of him later that night, but the whole thing seemed so fake. It wasn't like it actually happened.

I got picked up later that night, and all of a sudden I snapped out of this mindset. I felt normal now, but the night felt like a dream. Looking back on it, I remember the whole night clearly. At times, though, it all seems like it never happened. It is very strange.

Marijuana is a great drug to use, I must say, if it is used in moderation. It is a great escape from reality, something to get your mind off of things. When things are troubling me, I like to buy a gram or two, and the next couple days are spent contemplating when and where to smoke. I smoke up, and the next couple hours are a competely different world.

School was over, it was around 2:30 and me and a few of my friends decided to smoke.  It started out just like it normally did, 4 of us, sitting in my car in a construction site, taking incredible hits out of our 12 inch bong.  My first hit took me by suprise, I began coughing, a lot.  I kept on coughing until suddenly I realized I had another hit coming to me.  Good, I thought to myself, I'm happy I get to have some more of this, I want to get really high today.  I had no way of knowing what kind of very strange experience I was about to have.  

The rest of the story is first person, what I was thinking in my head while this strange trip was happening: 

After my second hit, I coughed even more, and decided, 'Maybe I should slow down, no, wait, maybe I should just stop.  Maybe I'll turn up the music, get my mind off the slight paranoia that is beginning to settle in my brain like a worm burrowing into an apple.  Wow, what the hell am I talking about.'  I turn the music up.  My friends keep passing the bong around.  'Don't do it' I thought, 'Don't take another hit, you will not like what you'll get.'  I decided to listen to my brain for once, and instead, I tried to come up with an excuse for not smoking anymore.  I suddenly yelled, 'I'm thirsty, who's thirsty, anyone thirsty, because I am, maybe I'll just eat some snow.'  That is exactly what I did, I crawled out of my car, and ate a handful of snow.  As I walk back into the car I think 'Wait a minute, that was kind of strange, why would I ever do such a thing.  Something is different here, very different.  Maybe I'll just look around and see what my friends are thinking.'

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

So I looked around and they are all waiting for me to do something.  'Oh, ya, ummm, lets go' I said, and slowly prepared myself for a drive.  I turn out of the construction site and am instantly lost, aware that my hand is fidgeting at a ridiculously rapid pace, I don't care, because it keeps my mind off the racing heart and the meaningless fear and paranoia.  I make it out of the streets, and go towards a parking lot for a supermarket.  Blurriness, everything molding into a ball which is turning at the center of my vision.  'Huh?  What the hell?'  That was all I could think.  HONK!!!  I was inches away from slamming into a car.  I tried to stay calm, and went into a parking space, the farthest one from the store.  'I could use a walk' I thought.  'Hey can you get me a gatorade'  my friend says to me. 'Sure', I said, 'I'll be back'.  

I made my way into the store, cycling in a loop of fear, paranoia, and absolute happiness.  Unfortunatley these cycled so quickly that I thought that they were all happening at the same time, so I felt almost like the past and future was the present, and the present was the past and the future.  My mind was completely distorted. 'Wow' is all I could think.  I grab a soda at a fridge, and open it.  I began taking laps around the store, while drinking the unpaid soda.  'Hmmm. Now what was it that he wanted, gatorade, right.'  I walk towards the gatorade, or at least I though it was gatorade.  When I got close, I realized it was powerade.  My mind twisted in horror.  I couldn't believe the way my eyes had played tricks on me.  'Okay, calm down, why are you so scared, you've been through this before, you've never gotten scared like this' I thought to myself.  At that moment, fear and paranoia went away. All that was left was happiness, and no control of my body whatsoever.

The director of my body decided to make me walk up and down every isle, if I saw someone, I felt quick panic, and tried to look interested in the products.  'Just look interested, they can never fool with your mind that way.  Especially that old lady right there, be careful, they make you feel guilty, paranoid, and fear.  Wait, its just an old lady you fool, just buy the damn coke like your supposed to.'  So I droop unwillingly toward the register, and I look straight at the lady at the register, hand her my wallet, and say 'Thank you for your help.'  The lady looked at me, speechless.  'I'm sorry, a little tired I am.'  I mumbled, and took my wallet back and paid for a coke and a candy bar.  The candy bar somehow got replaced with gatorade in my mind, strange.  

I walk out to the car, 'Oh shit, I must have been in there for ages' I thought.  My friends all look at me, and I say 'Here I can't remember what you wanted, so I got this' and I handed him the chocolate.  Then I mumbled, 'U guys wana just stay here for a while?'  They were like 'Dude were in a parking lot, its kinda sketchy.'  'Ok, I duno if I can drive though, I'm really messed up.'  I said.  So my friend says he can drive, and he drives everyone home, and then I get in the car when we get to his house.  I get back to my house, finally alone, and watch a movie. After this, I just drifted off into a peaceful daze, amazed by what had happened to me. The high wore off at around 6:00pm, but the after effects are lasting up to the time I'm writing this now, which is 9:00pm.

Although it was a scary experience at some times, it was also a fun and amazing one.  Something that in the long run, am glad that happened, but wouldnt want to go through it again.  I learned that thinking too much while smoking, especially bongs, will cause you to feel this way.  This was not just a high, it was more of a journey.  Everything was molding into each other, kind of like a strange movie, or reality tv show or something.

BODY WEIGHT:
250 lb





I had purchased three grams of some low-quality chronic from a friend of mine about a week earlier on Monday. Me and my sister decided to smoke it that Sunday night, but because we lacked the materials needed to make a joint, and I refused to smoke from foil, we used an apple. The hits were nice and smooth, and tasted slightly apply. Being only my second time, my sister was thoroughly surprised how hard I was hitting it while not coughing that much. Every time I took a hit she would proclaim, 'Oh, nice hit.' Together we shared two bowls.

After my last hit, probably about ten minutes from beginning smoking, I didn't really feel much at first. My sister was complaining about the quality of the weed and how she was only buzzed, and I told her that I wasn't feeling anything at all. Then, it started happening. I started laughing, and it seemed as if I was moving in a circular motion as if I was a top. I new from my one previous experience that this was normal and that I was buzzed, but I didn't expect what happened next.

As I sat there in the chair with my arms on my legs to support my weight, I moved one of them to position myself, and immediately noticed a vibrating feeling. It started at the very center of my arm, and radiated outward, and it would grow stronger and last long the more I moved. I started rubbing my hands on my pants uncontrollably because it felt so good. I knew I had to stop, but each time I tried to stop, I forgot and started again. I was very susceptible to laughter, and whenever I moved I had these wonderful vibrations. The top motion began to grow stronger, and eventually I fell out of the chair laughing and vibrating on my way down. Upon my sister handing me my stash box to put away, I also noticed how unable I was at handling objects and placing them in designated areas. I must have missed the small opening in my wall where I hid the box about five times before my sister intervened and put it away herself.

By this time, I was giggling furiously, rocking in a circular motion, and vibrating all over my body. My sister continued to tell me that I was freaking out, and that I should go to bed, but my perspective on everything was altered. It was not really consciousness any longer, but almost like watching a movie. Anything I said or did seemed to come sporadically, and I was just watching. I've had the same sort of feeling before after being deprived of sleep for more than three days, but this didn't have the same fatigue involved.

Eventually, I made it to bed, and I layed down to rest. As I lay there, the vibrations subsided slightly and just hung there like an engine idling. The bed felt as if it was encompassing me, and I eventually had the feeling of not even laying on a mattress, but on a cloud. Suddenly, I started pumping my legs as if I was riding a bicycle. It wasn't voluntarily at first, as I am known to twitch like this at times, but I soon began to pump them because the vibration feelings were stronger when I did so.

I did remember to mark the time down, as I was informed it alters your time perception, and it had seemed like at least an hour before my sister called me over to the computer to fix something five minutes after I went into bed. Using the computer like this was quite an experience. I knew everything I had to do to fix this specific problem, but each time I went on to the step, I forgot that I had done it, and wound up repeating it several times. My typing speed was also greatly inhibited. Normally, I can do about 110 WPM, but on this high I must've only been averaging around 10. My sister eventually just told me to go back to sleep.

I lay there for about thirty minutes, and the feelings of rocking back and forth and vibrations subside slightly, and I am able to go on my computer an operate it as if normal. I talked to one of my friends for a little while, and it was increasingly difficult to pay attention to the conversation, as it was to even recognize when she had said something, as she soon notified me of by asking why I wasn't talking much. At that point, I decided to sign off and simply told her I was tired; I did not want this friend to know that I was under the influence of marijuana. 

This high I experienced was quite an experience, and I'd have to put it on the positive scale. The feelings were wonderful, and throughout I can't remember having a single negative thought. The strong partvibrations, rocking, giggling feverishlylasted about an hour, and then the effects seemed to dull slightly, and finally an hour-and-half later wore off into a mild buzz that I had previously experienced.

I've never been a huge smoker, but certainly had enough smoking experience to dispel any novice status, so when my friend got hold of a quarter ounce of what was described as top grade skunk I was more than willing to help him burn it up. So, four of us go along to a nearby park on the way home from college and begin to smoke. At the time I had been on a bit of a health kick so I hadn't smoked for a few months, and I remember the first toke hit me like a slap to the brain. I can distinctly remember thinking that this dope was obviously strong, but I wasn't aware of just how powerful it was until we got up to leave the park to go to my mates house which was about ten minutes walk away. The act of standing up took an almighty effort, and as we walked it felt as if our feet were set in concrete. At this point, we were all stoned to about the same degree, and the shared sense of intoxication soon resulted in the four of us laughing feverishly at any random object that passed by. An old man walking a small dog with curiously oversized testicles produced a particularly strong reaction.

So after taking twenty minutes to complete a ten minute journey, we reached my friend's house and continued to blaze the weed. Once inside I remember feeling more sober than I had done outside, I had a stoned sensation but felt more or less normal. My mate decides to put on some odd trippy music, the kind almost designed to induce paranoia during a smoking session, lots of fast stereo panning and spatial sound effects. At this point I was finishing up a spliff, when all of a sudden while toking I heard a 'crackle' sound. I was certain it was the sound of an errant seed - which had managed to find its way into the spliff - popping as I smoked it, and I'd always heard you should under no circumstances smoke seeds, which made me a little worried. As I finished the spliff I felt something akin to an adrenaline rush, My chest felt light and full of air, as if I was holding my breath. As the adrenaline rush took hold my knees began to weaken so I sat down.

My friend was busily searching for more trippy music to play, and he eventually dug out a track by the Police called 'Friends'. You're probably unfamiliar with the track so let me give you a brief overview; The song is about eating your friends, proposing that cannibalism is the ultimate act of friendship and devotion being that it allows the victim to 'become part of' the eater...pretty grisly huh? The vocals are pitched down to make the singer sound monstrous and unhuman, again this isn't the sort of thing I would choose to smoke to, but my mate had a bit of a sadistic streak to him which perhaps explains his choice of sonic accompaniment.

Just before the song comes on, another friend - who'd previously heard the track and thought it was a bit dodgy - turns to me and says, 'Prepare to be afraid' His way of warning me about the track that's about to be played and the fact that it's a bit freaky. However, being stoned and a little worried by the whole seed in my joint thing, I misinterpret his warning as sounding more like a threat, as he fixed me with a red-eyed stare and drawled the warning, 'Prepare to be afraaaaaaaid'.  As soon as I heard the 'warning' I felt my heart quicken, then the song begins, with weird slowed down guitars and the line; 'You know I used to eat my friends...' sung in this creepy pitched down voice.

As soon as I heard this it was as if something clicked, and the situation became terrifying. I felt completely alone, panicking and confused, I 'knew' that my friends had lured me here so they could sacrifice me by eating me alive. They seemed to be looking at me as if they knew I was on to them, and I remember thinking that their faces were taking on unusual characteristics, as if the weed had allowed me to see through the masks they wore, revealing their true intentions. I got up and demanded to leave, but being stoned, they weren't interested. I of course took this to mean that they weren't going to let me leave, so I got up and began to walk out. One of my friends said he'd come with me, this luckily was probably the guy I trusted the most, so we went outside, and I got some fresh air. All the while I still believed that my friends were some sort of witches (I remember that I thought of them as 'witches' even though they were all male) who wanted to kill me, but as I got more fresh air I began to calm down a little.

I was shaking but I felt calm enough to go back to the house and get the things I'd left there, when we got back to the house my other friend was just about ready to leave, and I felt this tremendous mixture of embarrassment at the way I behaved, and certainty that I had lost my mind. I still had to get home which involved a couple of train journeys and a 2.5 mile walk. One of my friends also had to catch a train, and I remember praying that my train would come first as I really didn't want to be left alone, unfortunately for me his train arrived just as we got to the station so I was left on a packed platform still in the grip of the paranoia. I felt as if the other passengers were eyeing me warily as they passed by, in fact I'm not sure if they were or not, Was this another delusion or were they really giving me funny looks? After all I was probably acting a little strangely, so this uncertainty just fuelled my sense of paranoia.  

I eventually managed to get home, with the paranoia slowly wearing off after a couple of hours or so. Whilst walking home I was still suffering from aural hallucinations but strangely, as soon as I heard something I knew it was the weed and not anything more serious. I walked past two men in a car park, and was convinced that one of them insulted me - I can't remember quite what it was I thought they said, but I do remember that it was something that, when sober, seemed less of an insult than just a strange random remark.

For the rest of the evening I felt odd, in a sort of frightened but exhilarated way, and I kept going over what had happened and why I'd reacted the way I did. 
For the following fortnight I had a couple of 'flashback' type moments, where I felt paranoid again. I'd just bought a new CD and one track in particular would give me the creeps everytime I heard it, which was unusual as I'm not the type to be freaked out by anything I see or hear. 

Since then, I've smoked on countless occasions and only felt mild anxiety once or twice, and I've certainly never experienced paranois like I did before. In a way, I'd say the experience was beneficial to me in that it gave me an insight on what it's like to be truly terrified, even though this might seem like an experience you would want to avoid, I feel that I learnt from it. After this experience I was always more aware of how drugs could dramatically alter my perceptions, and I became more careful with the way I use drugs. Now I only smoke or take pills when I'm feeling totally relaxed and comfortable in an environment, and even when in the few instances when I haven't adhered to this rule, I've never had a repeat experience.

I'm not sure if it was due to the seed in the spliff (or whether that would even present a problem at all) or the trippy music, or just that I was unused to weed of that potency. Maybe I was uncomfortable or just not in the right frame of mind for smoking that day, who knows, perhaps it was just one of those freak occurences. After the event the kid whose weed it was (who was more of a regular smoker than I was) said that even he was finding it pretty strong stuff. Whatever caused it, I'm sort of glad it happened - It was an experience I'll never forget.

I only smoke the sweet leaf with my two closest friends, as they both know what I am into as far as conversation, music, food, and such; and I like to experience the pleasurable effects of cannabis most often in a controlled environment of quiet, relaxation, and serenity, with music being the exception.     

I am not what you would call a partier, at least not through the use of cannabis, as I feel respectful towards the good grass penchant for allowing me to explore my mind, and to empathize with my friends on a much cooler level than say, just getting fucking jacked up on whiskey and weed and jamming to Pantera at a crowded college frat-house.  

One of my favorite things about smoking cannabis is the unique musical experiences that are unlocked as a result of a really good stone.  I also like how cannabis, at least for me, is a compromising, agreeable drug, in the sense that it lets outside factors such as music, television, and human speech and movement drive The Stone, instead of The Stone driving my perception of the outside factors so that these things become unrecognizeable.   

I would like to share an interesting cannabis story, involving music and a really cool experience that I had just recently.  I stopped at my friend Rob's house after class.  I am freelancing and studying to become an arts and entertainment journalist, as I often do, just to see how he was doing.  As per usual, he was sitting on the couch smoking marlboro full flavors and watching the stock reports on some news channel.  

He had an open bag of some really excellent-looking bud laying on his coffee table, and a nice, clean-looking bubbler-pipe that was still smouldering from a series of hits that he had taken.  I snagged one of his marbs and lit it with his windless butane torch that is shaped like a bullet and asked him about the grass on the coffee table.  

He informed me that it was good Mexican Sinsemilla, which I had always wanted to try, and assured me that it was very sticky; very Cheech, very Chong.  I always enjoy a good whiff of a new bag, particularly one that I could smell from halfway across the room, through an ambient haze of marlboro and pot smoke.  And this stuff was just that pungent, filling my olfactory space with a woodsy, piny taste.  The buds were very burlacious, looking like wet tarantulas, basking in furry/crystaline brilliance.  

Without offering, or speaking, Rob began to fill his bubbler pipe, which generally holds about eight to ten large hits in a decent packing, with the furry, dank greens.  He then pulled a large hit and spewed the thickest, creamiest white smoke I have ever seen, handing me the smouldering bubbler.  I hit the Sinsemilla with a deep, long hit, because his bubbler-pipe was so clean and allowed for a smooth, easy-pulling drag.  The grass tasted really pungent, but not harsh, and it really heated up my lungs, causing me to cough lightly, which I don't mind, if you catch my drift...

Rob and I handed the bubbler back and forth four or five times, and I was already starting to have the celophane veil of clarity drop over my vision.  I call it my view from inside the aquarium of consciousness...Rob packed another, smaller pinch of the Sinsemilla, and we polished it off in two or three hits apiece, bubbling away with the same deep dragging hits.  In all, I imagine I had smoked about 2-2.5 gms of really nice bud.

The Stone was immediate, intense, but not brain-melting, and I really liked it.  At the time, I had been listening a great deal to an Australian artist, Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, and I had the CD with me so that I could let my friend Rob, also a music enthusiast, listen to the man's band.  As I put the disk into his stereo.  He has real quality speaker components.  I cued up the tune I wanted him especially to hear, the track is the last one on Nick Cave and The Bad Seed's Nocturama LP, entitled 'I'm On Fire', Rob went to pour us each a glass of Australian Shiraz, a pretty good wine if you don't get carried away with it.

We sat sipping wine, and discussing women, as per usual, while listening to the mildly cacaphonous song playing on the stereo.  The song that we were listening to is a sort of tribal chant of poetry with flourishing/discordant guitars and swirling, ultra fuzzed out Hammond Organ. It's a very repetitive song, and when you listen to it with a hard buzz on, which we both had, The Stone just sort of melts into the song and its one of those deals where you start to really pick up on things that the artist wants you to, as the the music steers your Stone.  At this point, my Stone, which was already heavy, got really intense.  

The supreme acoustics of the Polk Audio system, combined with Rob's large, hollow living room setup has a way of separating the various elements of music, in such a way that you can pick out the various levels of instrumentation in a song, and just groove on one or two things, such as, say, the lead guitar, or the organ's bass line.  The guitar line in this particular song was where my head was at.  

My buddy Rob was digging on that part of the song as well, because it had a strange quality to it.  I've never been a really a big noticer of visuals when I smoke cannabis, but I think the cues from the music were throwing me into a bit of sensory overload, because this is the point at which my cannabis-laced perception of Nick Cave's song went into Whale Overdrive.  By this time,  I was picking up some cool, firefly-sized whitish-yellow tracers swerving from the speakers.  The tracers seemed to time themselves with the flourishes of guitar in the song, as the speaker closest to me would release staccatto spurts of squiggling, tracing 'pellets' of light.  It was as though the notes of music were giving birth to little bullets of light, sending these revved-up, electrofunk babies streaking out through the pulsating woofers of the speaker.

The lamp on the end table to my left, as well as the standing lamp on the other side of the room, as far as the little b.b.s of light are concerned, seemed to function as magnets or  attractants, as the little bullets of light would accelerate, squiggling towards and appearing to bounce off the lamp shades.  It was as if the room were on fire with hundreds of whitish yellow glowing streaks of light, all in time with the song playing on the stereo.  

I don't think that Rob was experiencing the same visuals as I was, because when I asked him if he dug the guitar part of the song, which he was air guitaring to, he just said something to the effect of, Yeah, this shit is Insane Gargamel!, or something like that, but no mention of any tracers or light streaks.   Robs imagination and perception work a lot differently than mine (as everyone is a little different), but he was definitely entranced by the song as much as I was, so I just dropped trying to explain the phenomenon that I was picking up on and kicked back to enjoy it on my own.  Eventually, the little light show just sort of faded, as I had begun to shift from appreciating one aspect of the song to another, and another, and another.  

The rare weed visuals that I have flashed on in the past have all sort of worked in the same way, to where if I shift my concentration, say towards some cloud of thought that has floated in, or some conversation that is going on, the visual will just dissipate.  It has always been tough for me to consciously groove on a visual or something like that, because like I explained earlier, outside factors sort of steer my Stone as a free flowing entity.  And I enjoy that, because my Stones in this way seldom grate on my nerves or get me stuck on some monotonous plateau; but because of their maleability,  and the way that they constantly morph and change, my Stones always keep me coming back for more experiences that allow me to enjoy my life and the world around me

I just really enjoy musical experiences like that, and I think it is one of the main reasons behind my sincere enjoyment of Cannabis.  Not that I am a hard-line type of guy who thinks that everthing enjoyable can automatically be enhanced by pot, but I like the idea of lighting up a joint, and just chilling to music, because of the relaxed, opened-up headspace that good Cannabis can help to put you into.

Thanks for letting me share, and enjoy your lives in kindness and acceptance of others...

It was a fairly cold February day in the city of York, England.  Three male friends; B, L and R and I  had the week off from school as it was the half-term break, and decided to consume a tenth of cannabis each. B and I had usually smoked it, and had ingested cannabis before; R had ingested cannabis before and L had little experience of the drug. We had all eaten a meal before hand. None of us were on any medication of any sort at the time. 

We planned to consume the cannabis whilst we took a walk into the town centre, to get to a horse racecourse which has a small area of woodland situtated behind it. We obtained the cannabis and proceeded to walk.  

Time(approx)12:00 - The cannabis resin seemed a bit different to the usual that I am used to, the normal stuff for me is dark brown in colour, where as this was of a pale yellow hue.  Even so we all chewed our pieces to experience the unique taste of bitterness which I can only describe as a petrol like taste (the resin was probably mixed with petrol?).

Time 2:00 - A couple hours had passed where we were all thinking the cannabis wasn't going to do anything for us; when as we were walking down the street talking, I began to question how I felt.  The trip was starting to come on, and it began to hit me in a deja-vu like form.  It seemed I had a 3-second memory span when I spoke, everytime I spoke the words seemed to reverbatrate in my head and I would find my self saying to my friends 'Did I just say that?'.  Those words would then do the same and so on, in a kind of pyscological paranoia cycle.  

Time 2:30 - We had now reached the woods, by this time the paranoia levels had grown a little, and it felt as if everyone who passed by secretly knew that we'd all taken pot, but I was aware this was normal as I have ingested cannabis before.  We sat down on a log to roll a joint.  My friend R was now at the peak of his trip; which I would be at 3 hours later, and was walking around in circles biting his finger nails looking really freaked out.  He said he hated it and wanted to feel normal again; he was also worried that the trip may never cease.  We began to roll the joint; when a dog walker passed us, and his German shepard jumped up at the joint.  My heart stopped, as I had this notion that the bloke was an undercover policeman with a drugs dog.  He asked us rather unpleasantly if we were starting fires; which was a relief as I thought we'd been done for.

Time 3:00 - We proceeded to leave the woods, which I suggested were very like the woods in 'The Blair Witch Project' and for a second me, B and J believed we were actually there, as did R who began to panic that this could be true. We reassured him and reached the racecourse.  

We walked on to the race course track and decided to have a race and run back to the main road.  By now I was as about the most stoned as I have ever previously been; thoughts seemed to be flowing through my head at twice the usual rate, my heart rate had increased noticably, my body felt quite sedated and I was in a nostalgic dream-like state where certain things would conjour up a childhood memory that I probably don't even have. The concept of time began to feel somewhat disorientating, but the height of the sun in the sky aided the natural clocks we have in our heads.

We imagined that it was raceday, but today us four lads were the competitors instead of jockeys.  The sun was shining upon us and the breeze animated the greener than usual grass beneath our feet.  
The setting was magnificent  A bright blue sky, with huge stands in the background which we imagined were full of cheering ecstatic fans, waving us on.  The horizon appeared to flat as if we were in a giant box, and it was painted on the side of this box.  If anyone has seen the 'Truman Show', the part where he is in the boat near the end and reaches the door in the wall which has the painted horizon on it; you'll know what I mean!  

As we were running against the awesome breeze, euphoria set in.  I acually felt like a champion running the lap of honour past my adoring fans, who were dressed in 1920's peroiod wear.  This was probably my favourite time of the trip.  Im not sure who won the race, but we all felt like winners.

Time 3:35 

We had now left the main road on to a large area of grass land called 'Hob Moor' which leads us back to our village.  It had rained for a minute and a rainbow appeared in the sky.  I looked at it in awe and smiled like a little child would.  My friend B noticed another rainbow next to it and we all did too.  All of a sudden about 30 of them could be seen on the skyline, all crossing each other at their endings, all the same distance apart in their colourful glory.  I had never experienced this on cannabis before and I felt awe-struck.

Time 4:00

We were now at the end of my street, arranging when to meet for a trip to the cinema as L was meeting a girl for a sort of date.  We arranged to meet at 6.  This I couldn't wait for, I doubted I would enjoy being in the presence of my family in this state for too long. 

I got inside my house and went straight up stairs to my room.  By now I was wasted.  Thoughts were rushing through my head double overtime and were pretty much all paranoid. 'What if my mum knows?', 'Why would I go straight upstairs without greeting her?'.  I got upstairs and sat down at my computer.  Time no longer existed, it was just a false measurement of nothingness... The clock,  I couldn't wait till it stuck 6 ;whatever, the clock was the only comfort I had left.  I had to shut my curtains as the sun seemed too intense and the bright green leaves on the large chestnut tree shadowing my house were just far too bright.  Even this was a chore, it seemed to take ages just to walk a few steps.  I rested my head on the desk in front of me.  My left leg began to shake violently, I had no control over it.  My heart was pounding away like I had never experienced before, it was a crazy beast feriously battling to get out of the ribcage.  I feared I would have a heart attack, or maybe rupture an artery.  I began to pray to stay alive, and would have given anything to be sober again.  The side of my face seemed to be glued to the desk, I couldnt feel it anyway.  

I deciphered my name from a distant, distorted sea of sound that had washed its way into my room from the kitchen downstairs. 

My fears hit me. It was my mum.. tea time!  My heart skipped a beat when I beheld the thought of communication; what a feat that would be, standing up and getting down the stairs was an achievement.  I made my way into the kitchen, guided by the scent of freshly cooked pizza.  I was terrified, like a young child banished to the headmasters' office.  My heart was still pounding but I was glad my tremors had died down.  I spoke a few words, as to cover up my 'secret', which probably only added to the suspicion.  My mum was technically two feet away.  Really I was in space and she was on earth.  She didn't show any signs that she knew I was stoned.  My older brother didn't help though; grinning at me and making gestures resembling smoking pot.  In my head i was going crazy with him because I thought he was giving the game away, but physically I just looked at him and walked back up stairs with my pizza.  

I must have chewed the same slice of pizza for about five mintues it was too dry and I couldn't swallow.  I put my head back on the desk, began to tremble again and stayed there till 6 O'clock, listening to and 'Definitely Maybe' by 'Oasis'.  

Time 6:00 - YES!!! Thank god.  I walked out of my house mumbled an incoherent goodbye; to my brother's amusement, and sat on the wall outside of my house.  I pondered how cannabis could be so strong.  I shuddered at the thought of it being legalised - too many people would experience my fate.  My heart was still beating viciously and I was shaking and sweating.  As the Oasis song 'Gas Panic' goes 'sailing on a sea of sweat on a stormy night' the words couldnt have fit how I felt better. I was sailing on my sanity, a sea in the storm of intense paranoia and physical instabilty, battling to stay afloat. 

Time 6:30 - My friends arrive; late but I didn't care, I was glad to see them.  They said they were feeling a bit better.  My friend R also said he had a hard time in his house; fighting out a war inside of his own head.

Time 7:00 - We get to the cinema the film is 'Enemy behind the gates'.  I shoot through completly when the film starts as I though we were already half and hour into it; but they were the commercials before the film.  
I noticed how crap the acting could be because I was stoned, and saw straight though the linear, hollow storyline.  I think film critics should have a joint before work.

Time 10:30 - The film has finished and I'm feeling alot better, although physically and mentally worn out by the trip.  I get home and go to bed.  

Day 2 - Time 9:30 -  I wake up very pleased to be normal again and just feel happy.

After this trip, during the next few months I would occasionally snap into feeling completly stoned for no reason, which could last between 2 seconds till 1 hour.  My friend R reported this happened every single day and ruined his life.

Looking back I am glad I had the experience as I feel it has made me wiser and I have learned that cannabis is potentially as powerful as most other drugs.  I am glad I have the memory of that day to keep forever, and I believe the good side of it out-weighs the bad side.

I won't be ingesting any more cannabis for a while though! 

Cheers, Jonny B

Cannabis - Hash (93) : Various (28), General (1)

A drug that I've used for years can still surprise me utterly. I thought I knew what to expect, but with little warning I was thrust into alien territory. Or so it goes in this fable I just wrote, at least. It is based on a fever hallucination I had some months ago.

Sometimes fate has a sense of irony. Last year, I had been facing something I had put off for years: the obligatory military service period of my fair fatherland. I no longer had a legitimate reason to gain any further deferments, nor much motivation to fake one. Since I had no intention to become Jehovah's Witness or play a lunatic, neither of which have to go, the service was like the removal of rotting tooth: something that had to be faced before it got even worse.

There was no way in hell I was going to army proper, though. I am a part-time hermit and an esteemed misanthrope, so the thought of spending six months in confined barracks with a bunch of people I would neither like or respect was extremely unappealing. I chose civil service and made arrangements with a distant monastery for a 12-month service as a sort of jack-of-all-trades. Unfortunately this deal blew up, and I ended serving in the training center of civil servicemen. Instead of just six, I now had to spend twelve months in confined rooms with people with whom I had relatively little in common. Luckily, there was a constant flow of hippies, New Agers and potheads through the center, so there was an abundance of cannabis to soothe any frayed nerves and remove boredom.

Hiding somewhere in that constant flow of young men, a fellow traveller known as Influenza A entered the center. People started falling ill in droves, and one evening I too noticed the warning signs of rapidly rising fever. The next morning I got a sick leave, but decided to stay for one day and get a good night's sleep before starting the long trek home. Since I had woken in 6:15AM, was dizzy with fever and had muscle aches, this was a good decision, or at least the best I made that day.

That evening, my fever had reached a plateau. The feeling was not unpleasant. In fact, should there be a drug that replicated that sensation, I would be sorely tempted. My flesh glowed with warmth, but the flames under my skin weren't uncomfortably hot. I had a feeling of lightness, and sometimes when sitting or lying down, it was like I was floating. I felt a touch detached, and there was an oddly pleasing sluggishness to my thoughts, like running through knee-deep water on a hot summer day. I smiled a lot, deriving a great lot of satisfaction of the fact that this vicious invader inside me would be exterminated by my immune system, my beloved SS without mercy or regrets - and even now, in its heyday of parasitic rampage, the virus was only making me feel good!

I could claim that it had impaired my judgment, as well, but looking back at the decisions I made, I fail to find any critical lack of reason. I was curious of how my fever and mild sleep deprivation would react with stoned state. I saw the possibility of unexpectedly intense reaction, but was quietly confident that I could handle it. 

When an associate of my roommate came by and offered us a smoke, I accepted. Somehow, it escaped me that he had talked about a mix of high quality weed and Dutch hash. I inhaled again and again, for once matching the pace of my roommate, whose intake could take fairly heroic proportions whenever he got the chance. And I'm sensitive to psychoactives even in normal times.

We waltzed back to our room, with me feeling comfortably stoned. Of course that was only the fever at that point, with perhaps a tiny foretaste of what was to come. The main assault was still speeding through my veins, and when it broke through the blood-brain barrier, I went far beyond 'comfortably stoned' or even 'stoned'. But for a little while yet, I sat on my bed unaware of what I was due for, listening to psytrance and stoned babble.

Then, the first wave struck. Violently and suddenly, I was jerked further into the altered state. I noticed that I was very stoned now, and those feelings of lightness had disappeared. This was still the kind of stuff I was expecting, and smiling tranquilly, I emptied my mind and let it surf on the soundwaves bouncing around the room.

Suddenly, BOOM! The second wave hit me. At this point experience started to get derailed from its usual track. I literally felt gravity grip my suddenly heavy body. Surrendering to its pull, I laid down on my bed. My sensory perceptions felt distant and unpleasant, so I closed my eyes. I found colourful geometrical patterns pulsing and dancing on my eyelids.

It wasn't fun and games anymore. I was uncomfortably aware of the ever-present gravity, pulling me down and struggling against my chest every time it rose in an intake of breath. The body buzz was harsh, far more intense than anything you normally get from pot. And those visuals, for all their delicate beauty, were more intense also, with little of that paleness of colours and detachment which characterize my occasional cannabis visuals. All in all, the experience now lurked at boundaries of a proper trip. I felt mildly anxious, but rather than giving in, I looked at what was happening and adapted to it.

Something that felt like a minute passed. I was just beginning to get settled in, when the third wave rushed in. Gravity gained additional vigor, body buzz turned into electrical currents flowing through my body and visuals got much more vibrancy and depth, being now at par with those you could expect from shrooms or acid. My sense of balance started to malfunction, and lying there with my eyes closed, it was as if my body was slowly spinning and turning around. I began feeling dizzy, nauseous and weak.

It was still fairly easy to remain in control of my now considerable anxiety, but the unescapable fact was that my mind was far more altered than I had anticipated, and that I felt pretty awful. I tried to change the direction of trip by changing my sensory input. I rose to a sitting position and opened my eyes. For a little while, it cleared away some of that dizziness and heaviness. Yet soon the crushing weight returned, and those pulsing geometrical shapes started creeping inwards from the edges of my visual field, overlapping and covering what I was supposed to see with my eyes. I sank back on my bed.

The fourth wave came soon afterwards. My memory started getting fuzzy at this point, but generally, this wave turned the experience even harsher and brought with it intense tinnitus, infernal high-pitched scream in my ears. Sinking into my hallucinations and losing all grasp of my thoughts and emotions, I scrambled up once more. It wasn't a thought-out decision, since I no longer possessed a capacity for making those, but rather a purely reflexive attempt to escape, an act of misguided instinct.

Of course, it was a failure. Reportedly, I struggled up and tried to stand, but fell right on the floor, smashing my face into a chair in the process. Of this I had no clue whatsoever. There was no time and space, no awareness of self, nothing but pure chaos. The only thing that existed was mind static, white noise encompassing several senses. It looked and sounded much like a TV tuned on an empty channel, and felt like electricity. I regret I cannot really describe it further, but not only was it so alien to make it hard to capture with words, it was basically a very simple thing for all its oddness. I see nothing one could learn from it, nor anything that could be called 'spiritual'. It was propably nothing but static noise from rebooting brain.

I suddenly woke up, completely refreshed and happy as a clam. All the pressures had vanished, leaving me clear-headed and euphoric. Interestingly, I learned that my roommate had performed energetic healing on me before I woke up. I don't know if this had an effect on the way I woke up or not. Let those be certain who have found the truth. This could be compared to another mind static experience of mine years back, resulting from a combination of cannabis and antidepressant. Back then, I woke up on my own accord, also refreshed but not quite to the same extent. But, of course the different circumstances mean that any comparisions will be ultimately unconvincing.

Was this some transformative experience? Certainly not. Was it interesting, mostly fun and worthwhile? Definitely.

Welcome to the meaning of my life.

Let me start off with some background information.  At the time this experience occured, I was 14 years old (I am 17 now).  I had been raised in the typical anti drug and DARE environment, which had told me that all drugs are extremely dangerous and addictive.  This school of thought made no differentiation between herion and marijuana, and as such, it implied that any drug could kill you or ruin your life if you even tried it once.  I had pledged never to succumb to the temptation of any sort of drug.

Around this time, I was new in High School and beginining to question the authority of my parents and any official figure.  I was already interested in the human conciousness and any sort of hypnosis or meditation.  I read extensivly about OBE's and any sort of trance-like state.  It was a combination of this interest and the influence of one of my friends which led me to first try marijuana.  

This friend, I'll call him B, was always more of a counter culture individual than myself.  I know now that his parents had smoked pot, and he had even found their stash, but at the time I had no idea of this.  We used to get our thrills by stealing cigarette butts from our parents ashtrays and smoking those, or even smoking straw from his backyard.  He told me about his sister in college who smoked pot.  I had no idea that she smoked pot as I had always known her as an extremely 'straight and narrow' individual.  He told me that she loved it, and that all the information passed on to me as fact by my parents and the DARE program was false.  

As we talked about the effects it had, I became very interested and began doing research on the internet.  I decided along with a group of our friends who happened to be in a band with us at the time that I wanted to try it.  We saved up money for a week and passed it to B who on Friday obtained a decent amount of marijuana from his sister.

We all spent the night at my other friend C's house.  He lives on a farm, so we had four wheelers and an entire guest house to ourselves.  After riding around some and enjoying ourselves, we decided it was time to smoke some of our pot.  Stopping in a wooded area by a creek, we dismounted our four wheelers and packed a bowl into B's homemade wooden pipe.  We each smoked about 6 hits.

I had never been high before.  I had been slightly tipsy from alcohol before, but I really had no idea what to expect.  The first thing I noticed was that my perception of reality seemed changed.  As I looked around, I saw what I could only describe as a strobe-like reality.  Reality would come into my head, and then it would rush out for a dreamlike period which could have been a million years for all I knew, and then it would pop back into my head again.  I stood there for a few minutes with my friends saying 'Are you high?  Huh, did you get high?' popping in and out of this dreamlike state.

I wasn't sure if I was high or not so I tried to put my feelings into words, but I don't think my friends could understand.  C began to state that everything was 'going into strobe mode,' so I figured he was high too.  We rode the four wheelers around a bit more and then retired back to the cabin.  It was now about 6pm.

I walked outside towards the woods after everyone got busy with a game of pool and noticed that I felt completely different than I had with everyone around me.  I felt a complete peace about myself that I had never felt before.  I found a comfortable place and lay down in the woods.  There was a sense of oneness with nature.  I felt like all the trees and bushes and the few rays of sun lazily drifting through the canopy were saying to me 'here we are, now you know the secret to seeing us, you are no longer an outsider looking at us, you are part of us.'  Colors were exceptionally vivid, and my sense of wellbeing was phenomenal.

About an hour later, after playing the Pac Man arcade game C's parents had put in the guest house, playing music, and playing pool, we went on the back porch to smoke another bowl or two.  Although I had felt like I couldn't possibly become more high than I was after the first smoke session, I was surprised to find all my feelings intensified greatly.

We rode four wheelers around a bit more.  I was on a four wheeler with B and C.  B was driving while C sat in front of the handlebars, and I sat on the back.  We went up a hill and C fell off the front.  B actually RAN OVER C with the entire four wheeler.  We all stopped, laughing crazily.  C got up, brushed off his pants and fell over laughing.  He told us he was ok, and we all thought we were gonna suffocate from laughter as we related the tale to each other from our specific points of view on our way back to the cabin.

At this point it was getting dark.  I laid on the floor while everyone played music and closed my eyes.  I felt as though my body was spinning around and flying down some immense tunnel.  I had had this feeling every now and then as I lay in bed before I had ever even considered smoking pot, but it was greatly accentuated by the marijuana.  If I concentrated, I could see what I would describe as 'faint closed eye visuals.'  I was able to picture all sorts of strange things in my minds eye so vividly that I almost saw them.  Mainly psychedelic patterns that I had seen on posters, but also strange works of art and sculpture.

It was as though the filter in my mind which sifts through my thoughts, tossing aside irrational ones had been completely removed, and I was allowed to see things and think thoughts that would never before have occured to me.  I was communicating these emotions and sensations to my friends, many of whom felt the same things, but I felt like talking and any sort of external physical movement would 'bring me out' of my trance-like state.

We knew the night was just begining, so we rode C's four wheelers in the dark up to a spot on a hill overlooking his house, and a wonderful view of the lights of nearby cities and towns.  The ride up was unbelieveable.  Although it was dark, I could feel our speed with extreme physicality.  The cool rushing wind in the blackness was indescribable.  I imagined that I was in the Green Berets, rushing covertly to a bivouac site, and suddenly I was.  I imagined that a dog sled team was pulling me silently through the chill Alaskan night, and suddenly I was.  The ride, which could not have lasted for more than 2 minutes, seemed to strech on for a very long time.  Once at our camping site, we set up a campfire and roasted marshmallows and smoked more pot.

As I sat at the fire with my friends around me, I became increasingly aware of the universe above me and the world around me.  The celestial bodies and shooting stars above me seemed just as close, warm, and comforting as the crackling fire in front of me.  We warmly discussed our feelings about marijuana and our disgust at the blatant lies issued forth by the DARE program.  All was one.

As it became late, we decided to go back to C's cabin.  My friend P mentioned something about cow tipping.  Several people acknowledged that some friend of a friend or relative that they knew had gone cow tipping and thought it was extremely funny.  C noted that there were many farms around the area with cows.  B suggested that we go cow tipping.  It is now around 11pm on friday night.

We wandered out of the cabin totally stoned and filled with an invigorating sense of adventure.  I felt as though I was embarking on some spiritual quest, but I was fuled by the prospect of humor and adventure.  After a lot of walking, we came to a field which C insisted had numerous cows.  It was much too dark to tell at this point, and a flashlight wasn't doing us much good.  So we split up and began walking around the field.  It was huge and we all kept up communication with each other.  'Any cows?' someone would ask 'Nope, none yet' someone else would reply.  I felt a huge surge of energy and zest for fun while doing all this.  The cool and moist blades of grass brushing my legs felt marvelous.  Matched with the coolness and freshness of the breeze, I was in nirvana.

We eventually gave up, deciding that there were no cows after all and met in the center of the field.  We were all so overcome with our highs that we laid down together to watch the sky.  I can only describe it as complete and total peace and zen.  I laid in the soft grass, surrounded by pitch blackness.  I could hear the breathing of my friends, and the occasional wonder filled murmer.

In front of my face, the universe was vast and clear, each star shining and twinkling was extreme brilliance.  I saw at least 4 shooting stars.  I was aware of the immense size of the universe and I felt as though I was seeing it in 3 dimensions, rather than the typical flat view.  Every planet and star seemed a part of me, and filled me with joy.  I became aware of the sound of night, cicadas, crickets, frogs, glowing firebugs. It was all a part of me.  It was as though the universe was smiling at me and revealing itself to me for the first time.  I cried tears of joy.

We went back to the cabin reluctantly and went to sleep, waking the next day without the slightest hangover.  We smoked and then went into C's house for breakfast.  His mom had made it for us home made and it tasted fantastic.  We rode four wheelers and dirt bikes around more and watched tv for a few hours.

I spent a long time juggling and found that I was able to juggle EXTREMLY well while under the influence.  In fact I found that my performance seemed to be enhanced.  I would attribute this to the fact that the marijuana allowed me to free my mind from what I was doing.  It is well known among jugglers that if you start to concentrate on any single move you are doing, you will screw up a trick.  My previous record for consecutive behind-the-back throws was 3 in a row.  In one hours practice I shattered my previous record and pulled off 11 consecutive and smooth throws, much to the surprise of C's mom.

I didn't want to go home very much after the wonderful experience I had just had, but I did so, looking forward to the next opportunity I would have.  I still smoke every now and then, leaving just enough space in between sessions to allow me a full appreciation of the lessons I learn and emotions I feel each time.

My views of life, people, society, and law have been totally changed by my marijuana use.  Mary Jane has helped me to realize that the important things in life are love, and happiness, and the way we treat others, not how much money we make, or how big our houses are.  I regard this change as an extremely positive one.  I have been given great insight by my use of the ganja goddess, and I hope that this article will encourage other individuals to use marijuana responsibly, and for the right reasons.  If you do so, you will open doors in your mind which will enrich your life, and give you a greater perception of the everyday world which many people are never able to grasp.

I was at a pledge meeting for my fraternity on a Wednesday night.  I had an exam the next morning at 9:30am.  It was about 10pm and when the meeting had ended one of the brothers took out his grav bong.  I had been sick the past week so his shit definetely hit me hard.  He had always had GREAT weed whenever I was with him but this time was absolutely crazy.  He packed hits for everyone and I was last every time so he made my hits extra powerful.

The last hit of the grav looked like milk it was so full.  I took it all and even some of the bong water.  THE SECOND I GOT IT ALL IN MY LUNGS I knew I was in for a really really rough time.  I looked up and him and started to step over him and make it outside he said 'yeah!' and laughed because he knew what was up.  It was the best shit I've ever smoked becuase after the session was over I was outside coughing while on my knees gripping the stair rail.

I felt like I would never stop coughing but I finally did after about 10 minutes.  I sat on the porch steps and tried to keep it together.  I knew if I did too much I would have started coughing again uncontrollably so I just sat there.  I saw my friend M riding his bike back from cleaning one of the brothers houses.  I could barely talk I just yelled out 'EY!' and he came over.  He knew we were stoned but he had no idea the condition I was in.

I remember the crickets were so loud in my ears I thought there were two inside my ears.  I was feeling so fucked but he still made me get up and grab my bike to come home.  When I got inside everyone was looking at me laughing like 'OH SHIT! HE LOOKS LIKE POWDER!  YOU OK MAN?!'  I could barely answer them so I just nodded and smiled.  I felt still that I could break out into a coughing fit if I had talked.  I told them all I was going to head out and thanked the brother for smoking me up.  He couldn't stop smiling and told me to bend down.  When I did he told me 'Dude, I knew you were last so I packed your hits more than I've ever packed hits before.'

I made it outside and grabbed the bike.  The ride back on campus is probably about a mile but it is slightly uphill.  That bike ride home was the most interesting I've ever had.  Half way through I stopped M and kept telling him 'dude, this is so weird right now dude.  It's so fucking weird.'  He kept looking at me (not stoned) and saying 'nah man, it's fine, shut up.'  But as we neared our dorms I kept repeating the words 'near' and 'neat' in my head.  I found that they were cool words and I was excited to be near my dorm.  I kept repeating these words over and over again but that was nothing for what was about to happen.

When I got home M had to study and so did I so we split.  I had the hardest time locking up the bike on the bike rack.  I was shaking and scared because I was in front of like 5 Resident Advisors (RA's/Hall authorities).  I somehow managed to lock it up in about 5 minutes and walked inside.  I imagine my eyes were red as fuck.  When I got upstairs my roomy wasn't there so I sat down on my computer and changed my away message to 'studying' but as I did that I started slow-motion laughing where there was like a 2 second pause between each 'ha'.

I was convinced that I was a cartoon dog and that my face was all droopy while I laughed.  I could not stop laughing until I noticed how hungry I was.  I seriously ate about 2 full packs of Chips Ahoy cookies.  I noticed then that I had no idea what was happening, I had no idea what time it was and if I saw I clock I wouldn't have understood.  I was so confused by everything.  I was having fun but then I became nervious and felt really paranoid.  My face was twitching so I decided that if I took a shower I might start to feel ok since I felt as if I was on fire.

BIG MISTAKE.  When I turned on the shower the most complex musical score you could ever imagine accompanied the falling water.  My life was a fucking sound-track.  Everything I did blended into the music of the shower.  When I dropped the soap it's thud on the tiled floor became a dramatic crash in the classical overture that only I could hear.  I began feeling as if I would never be ok and I wanted the music to stop so that I could 'attempt' to study.  I leaned my head against the wall and closed my eyes.  I just kept thinking of how fucked up I was.  The music wouldn't stop.  I knew that I was tripping because I never had a high like this before, this was more extreme than any high ever.  I always hear sounds when I'm high and sometimes they sound like music, but not like this.  This music was so complex and sounded as if it could rival Beethoven's Fifth.

I have no idea how long I spent in the shower but when I got out and looked into the mirror a hallmate of mine looked into my eyes and smiled.  'Oh yeah' he said and I started laughing again. 'Yeah man, you know what's up.' I told him smiling.  The funniest thing when you're high is when you aren't sure if someone else knows if you are or aren't so you look at them and start laughing.  

I made it back to my room and tried to sleep.  My bed was like a magic carpet because it felt as if I was flying.  I had to put my feet on the floor to make sure I wasn't going anywhere.  The lights were off and I closed my eyes again.  I really felt like the bed was flying.  I could feel it push up on me as if the air underneath was raising it like in an airplane.  At one point it felt as if the bed was turning sideways but I didn't fall off.  It was in this state that I fell asleep and it was probably only around midnight so I got a solid 9 hours of sleep only to get up and get a 64% on my Communications exam the next morning.

Gravity bongs are definetely the best for getting fucked up hit for hit because they waste less weed than a bowl but hit you so much harder.  That was only about the 5th time I'd ever smoked out of a grav but since then I've built my own and my tolerance has increased so much.  I remember the good ol' days when 2 gravs would get me stoned for hours, now it takes about 5 to get the same result.  

I wouldn't say that it was a bad experience but at the time it was a little more than I wanted.  I've never been as high since. Well maybe new years 2004 when I took 8 gravs and smoked 3 bowls and had to call my uptight sister to come pick me up at 2:30am when I didn't know were I was, just in the middle of some street with a pine tree near it in a different county.

Prior to this experience I'd smoked and eaten low-medium grade pot on a few occaisions, with varied results. It wasn't until discovering the Leary biscuit recipe that I truly came to appreciate the effects of this plant.

On with the story...

It was another Friday evening, and as usual I was hanging out at my friend T's house. I'd spent most of the evening listening to music and watching anime with this other dude. Basically chilling out. Then I see Nos online, and he says he's coming over then we'll go get some weed and just hang out (like we always do at Ts, no one's ever there to bother us). Tonight however, we were in for a bit of a treat. Dingo knew one of the dealers and we got hooked up with about 2 grams of JA, which is a fairly potent strain of Jamaican weed we get here in the Caribbean. 

Time: 11:37 PM
Since I enjoy a more 'trippy' expericence, I opted to eat mine in a bun between two slices of cheese (microwaved), as did Nos and Dingo. It'd be about the fourth time for me and Nos eating our pot as such, Dingo had only previously smoked before. We then set about amusing ourselves while waiting for the effects to kick in.

Time: 1:09 AM
While lying on Ts bed I began to feel a familiar burning/tingling in my chest. W00! We're on our way baby! The effects come on *very* slowly however, so much so that I wonder whether or not I'm actually getting high as yet. Time slows down ever so slightly as I get up and go to the kitchen for some popcorn. 

Time: 1:37 AM

I can definitely feel the difference, somewhat spaced out, somewhat lighter. Every muscle in my face is active, and I'm aware of them all, individually. Suddenly I feel very active and playful, as I usually do when high, so I put on Queens Of The Stone Age to get the vibe going. Five minutes pass, but its like an eternity. I can feel the air around my limbs as though it is thickening, and start to get some intense closed-eye visuals, in which figures move in tune to the music. This world is green and muddy, much like a swamp. I open and close my eyes, going between the Green and T's Room, Its utterly fascinating for a while. Then Nos (who never, ever feels the effects as intensely as I do) realises my situation and starts to laugh and ask me stupid questions, presumably to get me to say some gibberish for his entertainment (as I usually do...). But not tonight. This is too real, too wonderful so I close my eyes and thrash about madly on the floor, swimming through the Green.

The song changes to Pink Floyd - Time (Winamp playlists are wonderful things) and strangely, so do my 'visuals'. This time the sea is red, then cycles through blues, greens, purples and yellows until I'm confronted with a myrian of dancing bears, in jester's hats. At this point I open my eyes and blurt out something about teddy bears and banannas and start to move to the music. As I close my eyes I envision my arms as great feathered wings. Dingo, on ther other hand, is pretty stoned, but in a different manner altogether. He'continuously talking about everything and nothing, all in a hilarious New York accent. Nos just sits and laughs at us, and tries to get into the fun.

Time: Sometime after 2 AM

After realising how intense this high was going to be I decided to experiment with it. We all pretty much had the munchies, so I take two Redoxon out of the tube and hand one to Dingo. After his initial paranoia (I had difficulty explaining to him that it was safe to eat) I popped mine as well and immediately the sensation burned through my entire mouth. The effervescence of it, coupled with the sweet tangy taste was mind-blowing. I felt my teeth vibrating as the tablet dissolved, and started to giggle uncontrollably, Dingo was obviously feeling the same thing (I could tell by his facial expression) and started to laugh too. We both fell on the floor, giggling like idiots.

The burnout was slow in coming on, but when it hit me I went straight to the bed like clockwork and lay down, but couldnt not sleep. Visions of green seas and shadowy dancers came to life as soon everytime I closed my eyes. Slowly I faded away, feeling completely at ease.

Just the other day I was walking by an old friend's house.  I hadn't seem him in years.  As I was walking by they called my in and I went into his room to see him.  My friend (let's call him K) is paralyzed in various parts of his body.  I hadn't seen him since before the accident so I was a bit overwhelmed at the sight of him.  This once active guy is now bedridden.

We were chilling with his brother just chatting and catching up on stuff when his brother started talking about his opinions on several different things.  That may sound irrelevant but you'll soon understand why I added that.

After about 20 minutes I still wasn't too comfortable because it had been so damn long.  K asked if I smoked, I said yeah, and he had his brother (we'll call him S) get his hookah.  S packed a bowl of some VERY skunky stuff and lit it while K took the first hit.  Then S took a hit and then me.

It was a very hot day in the high 80s.  The room was very nice though compared to outside, the AC was blowing right on me.

About 2-3 minutes later we all took another hit.  Then finally about 10 minutes after our first hit we all had another.

The high came on very fast and we were listening to rap, something I was never a big fan of.  Soon after I decided to light a cagarette and after smoking about half of it I noticed I was swaying to the beats.  I had come to the end of the cigarette and was taking my last drag when my vision left me, I felt around quickly for something to hold onto but nothing was there and I fell forward...Thank god his bed was right in front of me.

S pulled a stool behind me and told me to sit down.  My vision came back about 30 seconds after it left.  I put one hand on the foot of the bed and the other was resting on my lap.  I was staring at the carpet and the patterns were shifting, expanding, and changing colors.  I looked up and the room looked a lot darker but much more colorful.  I was completely panicked!

I thought that I was going into one of those seemingly rare marijuana trips.  I tried so hard to fight it and after about five minutes of heavy fighting I thought I was coming down.  Everything was getting lighter and back to normal.  I was suddenly overcome by an ache in my back so I laid down.

I was worried about lying down because I could tell both K and S were nervous about what was going on.  I was extremely comfortable on the floor, I had no pillow or head support but I didn't care.

After about five minutes I became very uncomfortable again.  At first I thought I'd wait for it to pass but when it didn't I realized something - waiting does absolutely nothing.  You have to fix things yourself because they won't do it for you.  I liked this a lot because I'm a huge procrastinator.

It stayed like that for about two hours.  Every five minutes or so I had to readjust myself.

During those two hours I listened to K and S talk and it was just so amazing.  I completely understood why S had all those opinions.  They're not brothers but you would think they were.  They got along so well.  The family in that house was incredible.  They were all so nice and full of love.  It was SO amazing.

Basically I felt like everything is so loving, nothing was worth getting angry over, I was in touch with everyone.  I lied there thinking about friends of mine, some of em I only had good thoughts about and others I only had bad.  There was no in between.  I now know who my true friends are.

I finally was able to stand so I did, I walked home with a limp but I wasn't in pain.  I walked that way to keep me from stumbling.  I went straight into my room where I sat in a trance-like state of thought.  I learned a lot from it.

Finally I fell asleep and woke up two hours later with something like a marijuana high but only physical effects, nothing mental.  I guess from all the looking back I've done onto that experience I've come to the conclusion that 'trips' on marijuana aren't for everyone.  Not many people seem to experience stuff like I did on marijuana but the people that have all have gained something from it.  It was a great experience and even though it was so unpleasant at times, if I could do it again I would (I don't mean smoke weed, I mean have a 'trip' from weed).

DOSE:

Cannabis - Hash


 
  
smoked
Cannabis - Hash





BODY WEIGHT:
174 lb





Subject: Male, 22. 174 lbs. 

For approx. 4-5 weeks (I truly did lose track) I ate daily a moderate to strong dose of hash; it varied.  When the high wore off I'd smoke a little, usually one or two bong-bowls, to boost me up until I fell asleep. I'm currently on my summer holiday after working my balls off through exams.  Therefore, I'd NO commitments of any kind to worry about, and the household is a loving one fully accepting of drug experimentation.  

The hash was prepared as either canna-butter or canna-fudge (you'd've thought creativity would have called forth more imaginative nomenclature).  Occasionally I'd also take between 10-15mg of diazepam.  When outside of my self-imposed 'safety zone' for diazepam, I'd drink whiskey (SAFETY ZONE: ~3hrs/mg - i.e. if I took 15mg of diazepam, I would wait AT LEAST 3x15=45hrs before drinking; this was usually rounded up to the following day as previous experience has led to nasty attacks of depression when the two mix).  Two days previous to the experience I'm focusing on I had also ingested 6g of 'premium powdered' Kratom as a tea, the day before I'd taken 15mg of diazepam.  During all this there were no problems.  What the following describes is my battle with what I truly believed was impending mental collapse.  It is intended to illustrate the potential damage ABUSE can cause, not responsible USE.  I have since made my peace with Cannabis, and her infinite love and wisdom remains willingly offered.  She is not one to hold a grudge.

Previous drug experience includes: 

Mushrooms: roughly a dozen trips (max. 3.5g dried).
LSD: 2 trips (max. 125ug)
DXM: ~8 trips (max. 300mg)
Salvia Divinorum: Sage Wisdom Tincture and smoked x6 extract (max. not sure, Tincture worked best but stripped A LOT of skin from my mouth)
Kratom: tried once, 6g of 'premium powder'
Cannabis: daily user for about 2.5 years
Diazepam: always have a good supply, but never take more than once a week. Withdrawal is NOT fun! (max. 20mg)
LSA: 4 trips (max. WAY TOO MUCH! 3 caps of a legal high called Druid's Fantasy, purportedly containing Morning Glory/HBWR seeds along with a couple of other things + 10 Morning Glory seeds, thinking it was an 'average' dose - never again did I take anything I wasnt 110% sure of - a leason learned early, a leason learned well)
Tobbacco (lame; worst drug I've ever tried), Alchohol, Caffeine

That's the chemicals dealt with, now for the character of the individual.  I'd consider myself a little emotionally unstable.  I have, in the past, had a few armchair-psychiatrists - all of which both were and remain my closest friends, and so know as much of the externally perceived 'me' as anyone is ever likely to - offer their diagnoses.  By these I've been suspected of Autism, Schizophrenia, Paranoia, Depression, and Manic-Depression (Bi-polar disorder if you want to be polite; they didn't, which is precisely what I'd wish of my friends).  I should stress that NONE of these have been confirmed by anyone with any official qualifications.  I am also an asocial (NOT antisocial) introvert most of the time, and during my 4-5 week stint I saw only two people (excluding members of my immediate family).

It should also be noted that I have a very psychedelic mind.  I'm not even sure myself what a 'psychedelic mind' would really entail, only that thought processes are extremely visual to me.  Logical progressions, syllogisms, etc can only really be described with visual metaphor (by me anyway, and I'm the only one who was in my brain at the time so you'll just have to hang with it).  This is transcribed, word-for-word, from what I wrote in reflection on my experience.

-------
A few nights uneasy sleep - i.e. smoking into unconsciousness rather than 'going to sleep' in the traditional sense - had led to me laying awake at 4am trying to stop the refluent river of my imagination making a deluge of consciousness.  Before me hung a desert, each grain of sand a crystalline formation of my flowing thoughts; a fluid concept made concrete.  In places this shining tide swept low, so deep in fact that from the valley in which it ran, a strange light below would twinkle a sardonic wink where Reason had bitten too hard at its cusp.  Others of these opalescent thoughts appeared to have been so readily accepted as to have taken on their own amorphous consciousness; a mass of answers so arranged, given toe and tongue enough to call themselves alive and scamper toward wonders of their own creation.  Great Towers stood high upon gaunt and quaking dunes, teetering as they pronged the barren blue of the sky, and quivering at the brilliant gleam; those life-heralding wreaths of Cloud that, in needing not a name can only be known as Absolute Truth; self contained and lonely in their beautiful plight.  We treasure them, yet weep when shrouded is our sun.  

These glittering interceptions of fact and prediction are building blocks of the nation of Mind, populated with a myriad known collectively as 'I'.  A myriad that will take fingers of delicate glass and make with them great Temples at which to worship and sacrifice.  These shall be called Logic, these shall be called Fact and Truth and Death.  At their alters are the Kneeling Sheep, whose knees score black with the filth we are forced to dredge up from their foundations of such monuments.  But, sheep, being as they are, will eventually cast out the darker of their lot; and my eye was on one such wayward 'I' as the minutes trampled by fast enough for that final moment to wonder what its friends were doing up round its ears.  It had left the sanctity of its flock, for no longer were they holy in its blank, starring eyes.  A tiny corner, shallower than the rest and glowing with the eerie light of uncertainty, was where it spent my moments, chip-chip chipping away gradually at the ground beneath its feet, then stomping with an impertinence I never could control.  Until, eventually, as I stood upon the last remaining fragments of a well constructed argument, I saw what lay beyond premise and predicate.  It is completely ineffable, because it constitution is not that of our Towers, our Temples, or even the Clouds and their radiant benevolence.  

It was not madness, nor the stuff of such, though madness would result from my descent I am certain.  I felt it pull at me, like flame with talons, leaching deeper with each moment that I stared it down.  The remit of Logic and Law (in its eternal opposition to Chaos) goes only so far, and circumscribing its kingdom is a hinterland that drugs will lead you through.  They are your guide, possessing an insight surpassing the capabilities of most human beings.  As such, absolute respect is not only a duty and necessity but wholly implicit in their very existence.  The new land is cold, and when you walk know your footstep fall far from the beating heart of the 'self', the Id, or the Ego.  These things are constructed as a bastille, and rightly so.  Society and its endemic impulse cannot exist without this sullen keep.  With each question we interpret our answer such that they reinforce these walls, when the very act builds in us a covert curiosity at what lies beyond any self-imposed boundary.  It would be foolish to think demolition a resolution, but I can't help but wonder; is he truly saved, who has not tasted damnation.  I also cannot help but wonder if this hand is my hand, these eyes my eyes, I need a third word between 'mine' and 'yours' that implies both possesion and dissociation.  I HATE LANGUAGE!  It's like trying to stroke your lover to orgasm with a chainsaw!  Too crude!  Hulking lumps of sylabic goo!

Dosage is kind of difficult with taking cannabis orally.

I once tried a product called MariPills that smelled much like hash, but was made orally active. A package was two 200mg pills, and lasted about 5 hours ( I took all 400mg), with onset taking about 20-30 minutes. I don't think it was very well made, considering the dosage and short effect. 

That hade me intrigued, so I used butane extraction to produce 40ml honey oil, which was then added to 40ml 95% ethanol (everclear), and heated until just before boiling. I then slowly dripped in about 20ml melted butter (real, unsalted butter, not margarine), sealed the container, and shook. This didn't quite produce an emulsion, so I added 5ml more ethanol, heated until the alcohol was boiling, added 5ml more melted butter, and shook like hell. This time, an emulsion formed, and I allowed it to sit, hot and open, overnight, where it cooled to room temperature, and most of the ethanol evaporated. 

I then added this, in place of butter, to a batch of 6 large (about 4in dia.) chocolate chip cookies. Let me just say.. one had me stoned out of my gourd. Another half, and I could barely keep my eyes open. Unfortunately, I can't say true dosage, but I'd say an average of about 6.5 ml honey oil per cookie, and I couldn't even guess how long the effects lasted, but it was from about 10 a.m. when we ate the cookies warm from the oven, and I believe I passed out some time around 2 a.m. that night. 

Please note that at this point, it was my second day off an 18 month sober binge, so it's possible it was just my extremely low tolerance at that point, but it seemed to effect my friends the same way as it did me (they smoked the entire 18 months I couldn't).

My sister, this guy and I decided to make brownies (for the first time), so we had him come over with 0.5ounce bag of weed (pretty good weed too). After they were finished baking, everyone took a brownie. The brownies tasted exactly like weed, but with a dark chocolate flavour added and were hard to swallow... sooo chocolatey and weedy... mmm...anyways, I ended up eating one brownie, the guy had two and my sister ate three. 

I'm a lightweight, and I have a very low tolerance to pretty much everything (for example 2 shots of vodka is enough to get me drunk). We all knew that when ingesting marijuana, you feel it a lot later than when smoking. After about an hour, none of us felt anything, which sucked because my mom was gonna be home soon. So we all went and began listening to music at our computer. 

I think it might have been half an hour, but I have no idea... they just kicked in... one second I was completely normal, the next second the music was all around me and it was GREAT! It was just like being stoned, only 10x as intense.  I felt like I was watching myself and everyone around me from a screen, but I was also part of the show and had complete control over my actions. My thoughts were going so damn fast! If someone said a sentence, I had a whole argument thought out and it all made perfect sense! I just never had the opportunity to say it (or the ability) because I was so concentrated on those thoughts. Usually when we smoke up, I am always the 'sensible, controlled' individual, if we have to talk to anyone or go anywhere, I always do all the talking. I see it as an adventure and it's always fun!

My mom got home a bit later and obviously I have to be the one that 'gets to' go grocery shopping with her (while trying to convince her to buy as much munchy food as possible.  Even on brownies, we were hungry). So we both left and went to the store.

The whole trip was so exilerating! I felt the cold from outside, but it didn't matter...as if there was nothing out there that could possibly hurt me in any way. All the colours were so bright! It seemed that I was very controlled and actually had a conversation with her! At the store I fetched all the food and was very helpful (which she must have found weird because I rarely help with anything) and managed to get her to buy us a lasagna, 2 bags of chips, 3 chocolate bars, ice cream, pop and macaroni and cheese....

When we got home, I helped unpack and went downstairs to tell them that everything was fine and we'd be eating soon.  My sis was sitting there, carefully examining her hands as if she'd never seen them before and the guy told me to try breathing cuz it was so fun! They were both giving me weird looks. It turns out that I was rocking (while standing) the whole time and didn't have the ability to walk straight.  My complex thoughts and analogies about every situation didn't sound like that when I tried to talk...I only said about 1/2 of the things that I was thinking...which wasnt very good since that meant that I had a lot of incomprehensable sentences that I thought were excellent. :S 

Falling asleep was just like the high...at first I didn't feel tired at all and then suddenly I just fell asleep. I am so glad that I don't get hangovers with weed! I had a better night's sleep than usual :D LEGALISE IT!

The winter of 2000 was by far the most crucial of my entire life. 

I'm not sure why I started, maybe because of peer pressure, sheer boredom, but most likely because of the bullshit I was supposed to 'learn' in D.A.R.E. What I'm describing to you here is not my first time I smoked weed, because it didn't really do anything for me, but rather I'm describing the first time I got really high.

My friend called me up when his parents left the house and told me that the house was empty for half an hour. I roller-bladed over, (was 15 at the time and didn't have a ride), and quickly stumbled onto his back patio. He had already prepared a make-shift bong out of a 3-liter cranberry juice bottle. He pulled out his little baggy of sweet, fruity smelling weed, which must've had at least 4 grams in it, and proceeded to pack the bowl. He warned me that this was by far the strongest Sativa he had ever smoked. (Where we live, we're used to getting shitty mass-produced Mexican Indica, which gives you a body high but doesn't lift you up. This on the otherhand, was homegrown and had made it all the way from Vancouver,BC courtesy of a friend...and I believe was somehow related to Thai.) Anyway...We lit this monster bowl up and kept hitting it straight for about 5 minutes. By the time I had finished, I felt warm and tingly..a sensation I had felt with my previous experiences...but nothing could've prepared me for what was about to come. 

I stood in this kid's living room with my roller blades strapped on and was talking to him about something I can't remember...when all of a sudden it felt like I had been inflated with helium. I felt like my head was hitting the ceiling and that I had left my friend a long long way down. This floating sensation was brought down by him slapping me. Apparently I had been ignoring him for quite some time. I began laughing histerically for a few minutes, and it made me feel so good. I finished talking to him, and told him that I had to leave before has parents came. He agreed, and I set out onto the street.

The journey home was by far the most mystical and enlightening trips I have ever had. My roller blades made me feel like I was floating even more. I was hallucinating mildly, but it was all pleasant. I could've been at 4 or 40,000 feet, I didn't know the difference. In my magical mystery land, time had slowed down to a near screeching halt. I recall thinking and feeling that the world was a beautiful place and that everyone was so nice and fragile. All I felt like doing, was making it mandatory for people to smoke a bowl of weed every morning to be put into a good mood. While I was high, I tackled difficult topics (ie. racism, war, meaning of life etc..), don't think for a second that I'm a hippy, but when I'm operating on a different level, I have perfectly logical thoughts pop into my head, that would never occur to me when I'm straight.

When I got home I put on some Bob Marley and danced for almost an hour. For some reason I thought that I was at his concert, and at certain moments, that I was in fact Bob Marley. I can confirm the powerful musical connection that weed gives. About an hour later when I was coming down, I went for dinner, and finished off the amazing trip with a good meal and a discussion with my family. 

Never have I had any negative consequence come from it. I am close to a straight-A student in all AP classes, and am also an athlete. I don't encourage habitual use, but smoking a big fatty once in a while, will give me time to meditate and expand my understanding of my purpose here on earth. I have since smoked almost every weekend, and continue to enjoy the benefits of the sacred herb, without going to hell, moving onto any other drug, jumping out windows, funding terrorists, experiencing amotivational syndrome, or even a loss of memory.

It started off as any normal thursday, I had recently bought a gram of some kind-bud off one of my friends in school.  Since I only had a gram I convinced myself that I should smoke it all in one night and buy some more off him tomorrow. I managed to roll two nice sized jays out of the sack.  I slipped them in my cigarette pack and waited patiently.  

That night around 10:30 I smoked both of the joints in a row taking enormous mind-blowing hits off of them.  After I finished the second joint I lit up a cigarette and stood on my back porch admiring the beauty of the woods, in fall colors, behind my house.  I walked back into my house and went on my computer, I tried to manage some conversations with my friends but this was extremely difficult to accomplish. Then out of nowhere I heard a very loud and persistent humming coming from the back of my head.  After a few minutes it felt like it was pushing my head towards the computer screen, and as I got closer to the screen it felt as if the computer was trying to 'eat my face'.  It was extremely odd and felt as if a gelatinous goo was clinging to my face and pulling, but it had an electrical feel to it as it pulled me in, it's hard to explain.  While this was going on I wasn't having any fear, this feeling that the computer was eating me was quite entertaining and I let out a chuckle every once in ahwile.

I decieded that I was too blown to be on my computer so I laid on my bed and stared at my shelf while laying on my side.  On my shelf I have one of those globes attached to the stand that generate electricity beams and they connect to your fingers when you touch the glass.  I stared at this object for about 5 minutes until it looked as if the black outline of the object was turning a glowing yellow.  A few more minutes passed and suddenly I was able to generate an exact copy of the outline filled in with vibrant colors directly next to it.  I was confused because I am a chronic marijuana user and have never tripped off of marijuana before.  

I wanted to see how far I could go with these visual hallucinations so I decided to see if I was going to have any CEV's.  There was complete darkness for about ten seconds then suddenly a simple object appeared.  It looks like a very wide, upside-down spike, and had a rectangle coming out of the side and another spike sticking out of the box pointing towards me.  Everything was yellow except for the spike on the box which was brown with a black and white tip.  I could see the dimensions of the object very well and tried to manipulate it, but to no avail. All during this time I was having muscle spasms all over my body, which were about three times stronger than I usually have them.  

I heard the Daily Show on Comedy Central come on so I sat up in my bed and started watching the TV.  Then suddenly something came over me.  The only way that I can explain this is that it felt like the top half of my vision was being blurred over my head (like my eyes were outside of my head and looking upwards, and the bottom half of my vision was trailing off to the lower-right.  It was by no means 'Scary' but it was annoying me because I couldn't see the TV.  After about 20 minutes of this going on (even while laying on my back staring at the ceiling) I eventually fell asleep and awoke the next day being somewhat groggy but happy with what I had experienced that night.  It was like a low-dose LSD or DXM trip without the sickness or the paranoia.

I apologize that the story was so long, but then again, my trip was very detailed as well.

The first time I tripped out on ganja was about 3 years ago when I smoked purple haze and thought a roundabout in a kids' playground was trying to eat me. This resulted in me crawling, commando-style, across the ground, in an attempt to escape said evil playing apparatus.   I didn't think anything like that would ever happen to me again. But it did. Not quite like that but with very bizarre trip-like elements that I wouldn't have expected from ganja.   

I've been smoking marijuana since I was 15/16, with a few-month hiatus this year. So I figured that I wouldn't experience anything like that again because my body had become accustomed to it. Maybe it's because it hasn't been that long since I wasn't smoking so my body hasn't got used to it again yet.  This day, I'd shared about 6 spliffs in total but it was the last 2 (we bonged the last one) that did it for me really.  I was lying on a bottom bunk bed. Above me was the wooden base of the higher bunk, with a large red star that I painted on there last year. I got lost in blowing a plume of smoke up to the middle of the star and watching it spread out across the surface.  There were fairy lights on at that point with a big candle so I couldn't see in extreme detail but enough to keep my attention completely.   I was smoking a small bong, staring at the cherry, which is what your eyes are drawn to as it's so close to them.  I passed the bong to john and watched him smoke it and then he started to really look like a goblin. Which freaked me out a bit. At first, cos I was worried about there being a goblin in the room and then because of the fact that I WAS worrying about the transformation of a good friend into a fictional creature. I reasoned with myself that this shouldn't happen cos I was only smoking skunk.  

So I looked away and lay back down and everything felt really slow and heavy then very fast, like everything was leaving a trail behind it. The speeds kept changing and my head was so heavy.  I wanted to move it but I couldnt lift it up without feeling like it was gonna roll off my head so I held onto my hair and physically lifted my head up.  I thought that maybe if I lay still and closed my eyes that it would stop, still being quite adamant that I wasn't on hallucinogenic so there was no reason for this to be happening.  Then I started seeing things flashing in my vision, really fast, like a really fast montage of shots in a film, slowly coming towards me and I felt like it'd swallow me up but I didn't care. And there were these patterns in the middle of it with these couple of shapes, predominantly pastel blues reds and yellows. I recognised the shapes, I think they were from a painting we used to have in our house ages ago.   Then I was thinking about moving my tongue and I can't remember why but I had to withdraw my tongue into my mouth because there was another tongue which was faster than mine and then there was this thing constricting my tongue, like a tiny lasso, or something.  

And then I started to imagine that I had lost whatever race it was that my tongue was having and that my tongue was being eaten.  I don't know what by, I got the impression of insects but at the time, it didn't matter and I was just watching my tongue being eaten. When I told john about it a while later, it seemed sickening, as it does now, but at the time, I was completely indifferent to it.  I was struck by a sense of vast importance. EVERYTHING took on a new level, I felt like I had so many things to say to people, like if I didn't something, terrible would happen. I decided to try and text someone because I needed to let them know how much I felt everything right there and then like I'd never felt anything before. I really wanted someone there and to totally immerse myself into them, actually lose the boundaries between us and be one. I was trying to use my phone and my head was heavy and I was transfixed by the trail of the green light in my phone. Then when I actually got to writing something I just couldn't find the words. I thought about trying to find a pen and paper but by then it had become unpleasant to move too much.   So I lay there, trying to remember if it used to feel like this when I got really mashed and I don't think it did. 

Gradually, I felt better. Even tho I didn't remember this being how I felt when stoned, it was a familiar feeling, without a doubt. I felt warm inside and there was the sensation of waves... Like when you've spent a lot of time in the sea and your body still feels like it's moving. I was listening to 'white pony' and noticing SO MUCH that I'd never heard before and it was the best thing I'd ever heard. I was lying there, crying because I was just feeling everything so much.   It started to wear off, I don't know how long the heavy bit lasted. Then I was just thinking like I usually do when stoned, my thought processes being diverted somewhat, my mind making strange links between things.  Here comes the humourous part of the evening.  I started to ponder burping being impolite.  You ask people why it's not very nice. They say just cos it's impolite and they were taught not to do it.  So then my mind starts going, ahhh, but no, as it does when it decides to have an argument with itself. It could be a completely invalid point but my mind will throw it up anyway just to make things more interesting.  So my mind is going no, you think it's impolite cos you were brought up to think that, you don't still think the same about everything you were brought up to believe so why keep it up about socially acceptable things?  

So then that pisses the rest of my mind off and it can't think of anything else to say. And then there's a silence and finally it goes,   because it smells.  And even the deviant bit can't argue with that.

It's a well known fact that during cannabis experience one feels connected to music, but that's not all, on my opinion! But first from the beginning. When I got a big amount of weed (medium quality i guess) - I was hoping to use it throughout the period from western christmas till New-Years-Eve-by-old-Eastern-Orthodox-calendar (24 Dec 2001 - 14 Jan 2002) - it's just the period of time everybody celebrates straight through, in my country (east of polland, south of belorus, SW of russia ;). I intended, and I did, to use it by myself - as I feel that weed is something personal. 

First I was rolling joints - but then I figured it was too meticulous job & since I didn't have anything else, I used a souvenir-intended ethnic-looking HUUUGE tobacco pipe. Nevertheless I stuffed it to the top (Equivalent of 2.5 well stuffed joints) ! I wanted to get fucked up - and I did. I smoked it all in a smallest possible period of time - to get a better result. I turned the music on - 200 Hrs of playlist music on PC on random was good enough - I figured!!! First I was disappointed bcs I didn't seem to be as fucked up as I wanted to - but as someone noted in another report - everyone who thinks he's not fucked up enough - gets ironically fucked up PROPERLY!! Just for you to imagine - I couldn't even open the door of my room properly - I think I was staring at it for 5 minutes before even touching the knob, I couldn't walk or hold anything - it took a great effort to move around the room. While my mind was still trying to analyze the received info that happened 1 minute ago - I was already doing something else - which was eventually partially processed another 1 min later !! And so on.

The interesting thing I noticed before and especially that time - is when I closed my eyes or imagined something - it was in cartoon form, and the trip always got more intense than with opened eyes! Damn weird! These imaginations happened and moved not by my will - as it should be - but by themselves - as if independent from me. I never really associated weed with visuals and serious stuff. But that time I saw such effects as in one of those graphic-editing programs - whirl-lense (the image whirls, as if through some lense in small circular or thread-like regions) in different parts of my visual field. Also sometimes I felt as if blood were coming up to the top of my head and I could feel the warmth and heaviness there. But all of it wasn't irritating or scary - but rather pleasant (if not VERY). MANY times I would lick my lip (you know, to wet the lips - sometimes when they get dry) and I could live through that 'lick' over and over for a minute - as if playing a stuck record. And more stuff like that.

Back to visuals - bcs my brain analysed 'pictures' too slowly I had a 'smaller frequency' of visual perception - as if looking at a set of slides - but bcs my brain still had to connect everything together - the time between the clear images sort of smeared-blurred if not disappeared altogether!!

Now to the SOUND part:
1) I could almost trace the path of movement of sound from speakers - usually medium-low frequencies. I think I was never really aware of the really-low frequencies AT ALL.
2) Being from Eastern Europe I mostly listen to cool electronic music (mostly jungle-kinda-step-up, d'n'b, and some weired new one- that's hard to describe or clasify like Amon Tobin, DANILKIN etc.)
I started noticing that my favourite songs sounded DAMN different - absolutely different melody (but mostly the melodies didn't make much sense - even random at times). THEN I noticed that some songs that I liked did sound DIFFERENT - but also made sense - as if absolutely different but with a nice melody in the same song I know under normal conditions. And the name of one of those songs was 'TRUE VISION'. Even stoned I realised that the composers intended it to sound different but nice when listened to stoned!!!!! I was shocked - how much effort and observations did those guys spent!!! Unbelievable.

3) If you think that it's complete BS get this:
I also had a song of MUSLIMGAUZE - 'Abu Zeid' - it's German-Arabic band - and I had this song just to add variety - besides it had ok percussions. Also under normal conditions I didn't really like some sounds in this song - like some distorted Iranian-like flute or something that sounds like a 'saw scratched on metal tube really fast'. Well, GET THIS - being really stoned - instead of those sounds I heard some Guy singing in Persian !!!!! I wasn't mistaken - I almost perfectly made out syllables and words!(I mean I don't know persian - but I know how it sounds). That's amazing - do those guys put all that effort into analysing how would a high person hear the sounds????? That sounds like an incredible job to me - if you like you can d/l the song on the net and check it yourself - unless you already know about these stonedguys-oriented music engineers - I can't call them anything else!!!

4) Even on the next day I usually cannot listen to music normally. Like sometimes I wake up, turn something on and all I hear is a random or weird collection of sounds - and I have to sort of shake it off - to perceive it normally again. That's some shit!

That's it for now! Have a nice trip - but don't get addicted, bcs it should work (hard :) for you, NOT the other way around ;( .

I live in a suburb of a major city and have been smoking cannabis for about two years.  Usually it is locally grown 'schwag', which is sometimes good, and sometimes isn't.  When I have the money, I buy locally grown hydroponic marijuana, but this is not very often.  I have not taken any prescription drugs or any other drugs except for Ibuprofen (Advil) in 3 or more years. I do not engage in any other drugs except for marijuana and alcohol. 

This expierence began when my friend was recently in the closest major city (about 90 miles away) and purchased a bag of very high grade hydroponically grown marijuana.  You could really tell the difference, just by looking at it, than our locally grown weed.  It was bright, almost neon green, with what looked like white crystals all over it (I assure you there was not any other substance mixed in).  At 7:00 PM, my friend and I smoked a bowl out of a pipe, then we also smoked another bowl right after that, in a bong with ice water in it.  The ice water makes the smoke almost flavorless and is highly recommened, especially if you do not smoke often or are worried about lung disease and the such.  After smoking we grabbed some snacks and walked to his guest house and sat down.  After about 2 minutes of silence, my friend asked 'Are you high?'  I could barely respond 'Yes' because it hit me so hard.  After smoking weed for two plus years I had never felt so 'high.'  I was somewhat worried about things that had happened earlier that day with another friend of mine, and these feelings completely vanished.  I was in a completely euphoric state of mind.  

After sitting around until about 7:30, we decided we would play a game of pool.  The game seemed to be endless and we were almost in tears laughing the whole time.  It would be completely quiet and we'd say something completely off the wall or make up some gibberish like 'Scahhshsawashy' and fall to the floor laughing every time.  The conversations we had are almost completely a blur. All I can remember from about 7:30 to 8:00 is laughing.  Finally somehow we managed to finish the game, and we decided to go for a ride.  [Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]   We decided it would be appropriate to listen to a reggae radio station, and there was an instrumental song that played.  Songs with no vocals have never  been a huge favorite of mine but this song envoked responses in us like 'Holy Shit!' and 'Oh my God!' but for no apparent reason, except for a new instrument being introduced or a change in tempo.  

All of the sudden, about 100 feet in front of us, I saw a 80 or so degree curve in the road.  As we approached I became very nervous and was afraid we were going too fast to negotiate the curve.  I looked at the speedometer and we were only going 5 miles per hour but for some reason I screamed at my friend 'SLOW DOWN!!!'  As I said this I ducked my head down into my lap and prepared for a crash.  Of course, there was no crash, and in retrospect, the situation wasn't dangerous at all, but feelings of fear swept over my body, and once it was over, it was like nothing in the world mattered anymore.  Seemingly, I thought that if I had just survived that, that I was invincible and could survive anything.  I laid back in my seat and smiled and began to focus on the music playing.  For some reason, we decided to listen to classical music, and it was really quite beautiful, and kept us quiet the whole ride home.  Being an avid guitar-player, I really enjoy listening to music after smoking weed anyway. 

It was about 8:25 by this time and we were at his house.  We smoked another bowl in the bong at 8:35 and decided to go swimming.  Normally, although I am a good swimmer, I have an irrational fear of deep water and swimming, but still feeling fearless, I had no problem.  I could have done anything at that moment.  There was not a single feeling of doubt inside of me, and I realized that I could be or do anything I want to be.  I got in the hot tub and began to relax.  I started thinking about life and what it means to be successful, and how success is so easily achieved.  I became very philosophical and decided I needed to record these thoughts, and after reviewing it the next day, some weird things were written.  I got up and found a paper and pen inside and went to work.  Here is what I wrote, it makes sense gramatically for the most part but I can't really figure out what I meant:

'Achieving success is easy.  Success is seen, visualized, and a desire for success is instilled in the mind.  After seeing success, one yearns for it, and will mentally prepare themself to do whatever it takes to achieve it.  This is how I feel, and I don't know if others feel the same way.  I feel that there is nothing I can't do, realistically, or unrealistically, and some people can't handle that.  I'm stupid in a sense, because I'm young, and I still go out doing stupid things.  I'm the punk kid who broke your mailbox.  I picture you going to get your paper in your robe and seeing your mailbox laying on the ground.  You begin cussing and this ruins your entire day, and after momentary guilt, I never think of it again, and I don't hesitate to break another one, or do anything else.  You curse whoever did this to your precious mailbox, and hope that something equally as terrible or worse will happen to me.  Maybe one day I'll go out to get my paper and see my mailbox broken, or maybe I'll go get my newspaper and someone will put a bullet in my head.  But life is like a ladder, you can't let anything unimportant like your precious trinkets get in the way, because you have to climb to the top.  This is how success is achieved.'

Well, I have broken peoples mailboxes before and never thought twice about it, but i guess that was guilt surfacing in the back of my mind, but also thoughts of how stupid the things we think are important really are.   It was about 9:10 or so and I decided I wanted to be alone for the rest of the night.  I told my friend goodbye and drove home.  Wanting to re-experience the joy that the classical music gave me earlier, I put my radio on the classical music station and fell into a deep sleep.  I woke up the next morning feeling refreshed, and everything was pretty vivid except for the pool game, all I can remember about it is laughing and making weird noises. I really enjoyed the feelings this weed gave me, and it seemed to me that hydroponic weed really is stronger and better than what is grown in my town.  Overall, this was a very unique and enjoyable expierence, and I hope to feel what I felt sometime again.

You say it's impossible, I say the human mind mixed with drugs has no limits. To me this looks like a trip...from marijuana. You be the judge.

A year or so ago, I invited several friends over for a couple drinks. Yet, at my house, a quiet get-together quickly turns into a raging drug binge. Also, two or three friends soon becomes every teenage inhabitant in the town. Where I live, the kids get quite cliquey...but on this very night...geeks, preps, even some random people I've never seen before have all joined together at my home, chatting and bonding peacefully, all in the name of intoxication. A beatiful thing, I dare say. Yet, another pro of this situation is the more people that show up, the more drugs that seem to find themselves being spread out and broken up on various surfaces in my house. After about 45 people have invited themselves in, the place begins to look like some sort of black market headquarters. An array of substances in baggies, containers, freesprawling over tables and countertops were being consumed and smoked in rediculous amounts. Beautiful stuff...yet, enough of my ranting.

So here's my experience of the night. The party was producing wonderful vibes...strange rotten looking smoke hovering around the ceiling... cottonmouthed faces... iris-less eyes... splendid stuff. Yet, they were soon disrupted...several unfortunate dudes had to go and start breaking things... this lead to a few bitchslaps and some painful knee-testicle contact... a beautiful advantage to being female. Although this problem was solved, it had set my spirits a bit low. Being a smart party host, I have learned that staying sober while crazed drugees rampage all over your property is the best thing to do. Yet, being in a bad mood at your own party is simply non-tolerable, in my opinion anyways.

I searched my house for a delightful drug to clam my nerves, and finally found a group of kids passing a blunt on my porch. It looked like a grand opportunity to step in, so I pulled up a chair and joined the rotation. After it was smoked to a roach, I felt the familiar euphoria which I had experienced many times previously. Company began to look even more friendly. Their spirits and actions seemed to be... well I suppose silly would be the word... and the environment in general took on intensifying qualities. The usual effects of pot. 

Well this wasn't enough for me. I wanted to see how intense things could get. As people joined and left the rotation, I stayed for another hour or so. Enjoying bowl after bowl after bowl, until I reached a certain brink where I felt my body was at its maximum capacity of THC. 

Now, I have smoked like this many many times before, but something was different about this experience. Normally the fuzzy silly funny feeling erupts and rises until a fit of laughter amongst all who are stoned creates an enjoyment climax, followed by an insightful period of wondering, which doesnt last long before the menacing frenzy for food breaks loose. After the stomach is full to the point of bloating, heavy fatigue sets in, and the body begs for sleep. This time, it was different.

At first, all was going as usual routine. I sat in my living room with several friends giggling at each others' hair. The mild snickering continued until I popped in the movie Kung Pow, a must-see for pot smokers, especially at the 'geeking out' stage. As the movie began, the quiet giggling exploded into gasping laughter, a joyful time for all of us. After the fit was calmed down, the movie was turned off and some random show on the discovery channel raided the screen. Surprisingly, most stayed and watched, seemingly entrigued by the mating cockroaches. I must admit, I was also taken. I couldn't stop staring at the TV. The way they squirmed about, the all-knowing documentary voice, it was all intensely fascinating. After the show was over, all except two who were on the couch with me dashed to the kitchen to satisfy their appetites. I expected the same to set in with me, but surprisingly sleepiness slowly took over. I found this strange, hense this didn't usually occur until after I stuffed my face with various junk foods. But anyhow, I proceeded to the floor to rest, too tired to make it all the way to my bed.

This is where the experience gets interesting. As soon as I shut my eyes, things began to get weird. Slow, swirling colors and checkered patters decorated the darkness- I was experiencing closed eye visuals. This boggled my mind because never before had I tripped on pot, nor did I think it was possible. Yet, the colors were as real as the sky is blue, and I knew I was not sleeping. I could still hear the goings-on of the party, and I had not fallen into the semi-concious stage you experience just before sleep. Although tired, I was fully there and awake. Suddenly the twisting nonsense on the back of my eyelids took form - a black frame around a white scene. The whiteness was in the form of a convex square, like the shape of a TV screen. Suddenly, this screen began to host images. As the images (they were moving, by the way, kind of like movies- changing every 30 seconds or so) played, they seemed to be quite farmiliar. I then recognized them to be clips from dreams. Dreams I had had long ago, mostly between the ages of 2 and 5. 

Never would I have remembered these in soberness. I had forgotten about them for years. It was as though this screen represented a vault deep within my subconcious which held my farthest, hardest to access memories. What confused me the most was that I thought these childhood experiences were long lost, forgotten memories. But this showed me that memories are never erased, just forgotten.

This went on for a decent 15 minutes or so. Suddenly, a change in pattern. On the screen appeared myself. Not a 3 year old or long forgotten form of myself, but me exactly how I was at that moment, lying on my living room floor. My eyes were closed, arms and hair sprawled out. After about 10 seconds, the black frame faded and disappeared. There I was, about two feet away and two feet off the ground, looking at my body lying helpless on the floor. The sensation was extreme. My mind could sense no physical form of myself. Then again, if I did have a body, I would be halfway thru the floor. I began to look at myself. I imagined the warmth and comfort my body was feeling, but shuddered at the cold I felt several feet away. I looked up at my two friends on the couch, chatting away. They had no idea I had left. They were happy and high in their bodies, oblivious to my state. If only they knew... they would miss me. They need me. 

What horrible emotions I began to feel... I had never felt this depressed in my life. My life was not over, I had so much more to live for... people needed me... I needed to complete my life. And my poor body, lying there lifeless. I had spent so much of my time caring for it, cleansing it daily, and now it was gone in wasted neglect. I began to cry. I felt the crying sensation, but I don't believe my bodyless form actually produced tears. I needed to go back, continue on with my life. I reached out with a non-existant arm, and began to glide back towards my body. Closer and closer, until finally I touched my own face, and at that instant, my eyes opened. Me, inside my body, opened my eyes. 

I was back, and grateful for life like never before. Now I'm not exactly sure how I generated an out-of-body experience on pot, but anything's possible in the drug kingdom. Not only this, but I also learned some interesting information on the power of the memory. This experience gave me a great appreciation for life and the human mind, and as depressing and painful as the actual event was, it taught me the values of both and to appreciate them while you still can. Plus, you have to admit....out-of-body experiences are pretty damn nifty ;o)

happy intoxication

July '01

Long story short, I was camping on an island with my sister and some friends that I only get to see once a year.  There were five of us: me, my sister Mary, my friend Fred, Freds sister Ann, and Anns friend Kate.  (Names have been changed.  Duh.)  Fred smokes, and my sister smokes (I got her started), but Ann and Kate, being a year or two younger than the rest of us, didnt smoke.  I had brought a big fat joint along (a gift from another friend), hoping there would be a chance when Fred and I could sneak off and smoke it, possibly with my sister.  Anyways, the night was rather eventless.  We all sat around the fire and made smores.  Soon, Fred got into a fight with his sister.  They bitched back and forth, and Fred eventually just gave up and announced he was simply going to go to sleep early in his tent (it was about 8:00 pm).  I saw my opportunity.  I followed Fred into his tent, and he mumbled for me to go away.  I whipped out the joint and shined my flashlight on it.  Freds face immidiately lit up.  He simply said Lets go look at the stars!  So off we went, to the opposite end of the island, away from the two non-smokers.  My sis cought on and followed quietly.

We lit that fatty up, and it burned slow because my friend had packed it so tightly.  We each had four long hits.  We watched the stars as we passed the joint around.  It was so relaxing, the air was cool and the sky was clear since we were so far away from any major ciries.  We could even see a few shooting stars.  Soon, Fred decided to go back to the fire so we wouldnt look too suspicious by staying over there so long.  I took two more hits, but my sister passed.  She was already starting to lose control.  I was feeling it too.  Man, was I feeling it.  I could tell pretty quickly that this weed was as good as my friend said it would be.  I pinched the cherry off to save the rest for later (we only smoked half a joint between the three of us!).  My sister and I began to walk back to the fire, which was probably 30 feet away.  Right about here, I got a strange sensation that I can only describe as tunnel vision.  The fire seemed to be at the end of a tunnel.  I laughed till I nearly fell over, because there was of course no such tunnel.  We stopped to regain control and decided to share a clove cigarette.  It tasted absolutely delicious.  After regaining our composure we continued, and when I was at the end of the tunnel, I started really tripping my balls off

I sat down by the fire and was immidiately enveloped by it.  It sent the most wonderful warm vibrations through my bodyI felt the warmth like Id felt nothing before.  It was almost like an constant orgasm.  I started talking to Fred, and it was pretty obvious that he was higher than a kite.  After fighting the giggles for a while, I managed to stand up and go get my bag of licorice.  I promptly ate the whole bag.  We talked, we laughed, we even talked about laughing.  Ann and Kate even joined in on our laughing, even though they werent high and didnt know we were high.  We sat around the fire for hours, at least until about 1 or 2 am.  I was reluctant to leave the fire, but eventually did and went to my tent.  After curling up in a sleeping bag, I began to think about all sorts of thingsreally weird things.  I tried to comprehend shit like how big the universe is and how no two people are alike.  It blew my mind.  I was still going really strong, which made it hard to sleep. I actually learned something very important while I was drifting off to sleep: human beings are lonely creatures.  If you think about it, life is nothing more than a continuous series of interactions with other people.  This is all we have in this world, so make sure you make the most out of it.  Be positive towards others, and you can probably find peace with yourself.

I eventually did go to sleep, and I slept for only six hours.  Even though I had little sleep, I woke up feeling fresh and newin short, I felt like a million bucks.  Well, that was probably the highest Ive ever gotten, especially considering the small amount I had smoked.  If you ever get the opportunity, go do something outdoors with your friends while high, like camping.  Theres nothing like it.  But if you do anything, try to use experiences like these to learn something about yourself.  You might be surprised at what youll find

This report details my second experience with pot cookies. Im writing this six days later, so the memory isnt as fresh as it could be.

Well, J. told me this new batch she had was way stronger than the last batch, and I felt my last trip (and first stoned experience) was too intense anyway, so I took what seemed to be a third of a cookie at about 9:30 in the morning. It was an hour and a half later that I started getting nervous and jittery. I figured the main effects were imminent, but nothing happened  just jitteriness for about half an hour. I played the piano for a while to calm myself down which seemed to work. I figured I had taken a sub-threshold dose. About two hours after the first dose, I took a second third. Nothing happened for another hour at which point I took the last third. Surely something will happen with this added to the mix, I thought. It was about three hours after my first dose.

I believe it was another half hour later that it hit me. I was downloading MP3s for J. on her computer (tracks from the soundtrack to Diva) when I started to notice the familiar effects: light headedness, warmth, a definite buzzing sensation (I finally understood what a buzz was!). But this time there was no panic, head rush, or sense of immanent passing out. I suspect that the dramatic reaction which signaled the onset of my first trip was fueled by anxiety at the novelty of it all  figures. I was now somewhat accustomed to the physical sensations, and able to roll with them. Soon after the effects began, J.s kids came home from school and the place became a little hectic, but I was left alone most of the time in the computer room.

Mentally, I was fucked up right from the start. Silly, rambling, less inhibition, suggestable, prone to irrational fears and crazy ideas, prone to mindless giggling fits  I laughed hysterically at Bruce McCullochs The Biggest Crouton I Ever Saw (well its pretty damn funny when sober, but HILARIOUS when stoned). The out-of-body analgesic effects and time dilation (which I believe are closely related, the former causing the latter) were strong from the start. I felt entirely out-of-control and that was a little disturbing. Jitteriness came and went. I spent the next hour alternating between lying on the couch and typing my rambling thoughts on J.s computer with a manic drive. I listened to some music: The Diva soundtrack, my own compositions from MP3.com, and some Liszt I downloaded from AudioGalaxy  I couldnt concentrate for very long, and it sounded tinny and distant (although that was probably because of the crappy speakers).

During my time on the couch I closed my eyes and watched for the visuals. It was much like my last time (and only reference for this experience)  visual and kinetic motifs were recapitulated and expanded on, although I believe that in this instance the daylight robbed them of a certain vividness. If I concentrated with eyes open, I could just barely visualize the moving patterns blending with the features of the room (and I mean JUST BARELY, this is not what I would call hallucination  the very low end of the visual spectrum if its on the spectrum at all.) J. was busy dealing with her kids so I didnt get much conversation in. I browsed the net a lot, going to familiar sites, reading Erowid and Plastic, downloading psychedelic screensavers and games.

J. took her kids to A&W; and she brought me back a Mozzaburger at my request. I wasnt particularly hungry and chewing the burger felt very strange, but it tasted good (no better than it ever does, but certainly no worse) and I eventually finished it. An hour or two after the trip began, all jitteriness had subsided and I was feeling remarkable calm and sedated (far more than Im ever accustomed to feeling while sober). I sat outside for a while just watching people move about in the yard, feeling perfectly comfortable and content  the cold and wind didnt bother me (although I dont know if they would have anyway, neither was particularly strong).

I started to become more lucid in the evening although I was far from crisp. I hung out with J. in her office for a while (she tried her hand at Tetripz). Two things of note here: One  television seemed not a surreal babbling idiot box but a gateway to sanity (with commercials that were just as annoying as when Im sober). Two  I noticed that even though somewhat sedated, feelings of depression, frustration, and jealousy would break through if provoked.

I smoked a joint outside with J. that night (Im still not sure if Ive got the knack for sucking in that smoke, but I did cough once, I think that means Im on the right track). Being as I was already fucked up, Im unsure how much it really affected me, but I seemed to lose my newfound lucidity a few minutes later and turn back into a rambling imbecile with poor motor control.

I left J.s house late that night  the walk was very nice  that floating feeling persisted, I was in high spirits. I would say, an artificial euphoria as opposed to my unpredictable natural euphorias, except there must have been some element of the natural in it, seeing as how Id had what I would call a good day. I got home and puttered around a bit before going to bed and listening to music on my brand-spankinnew headphones. Im not sure if the music really sounded any better than normal, and if it did, it may just be because Id been listening with broken headphones on my computer the day before and crappy speakers on J.s computer the day just completed  but I remember enjoying what I heard a lot. One of the MP3s that my randomized playlist selected was the fourth movement from Beethovens Ode to Joy symphony, and I remember feeling more appreciative of the piece than Id ever been before  at that moment, I would have agreed that it was the greatest masterpiece ever written (normally, Im not so sure). Every note sounded clean and perfect, all the counterpoint seemed to seep into my ears with autonomous perfection  but Im not sure if this is the ideal way to listen to music, as I felt a sense of unity within the structure was lost  or maybe Im just spouting pedantic bullshit here, since its been a while since the experience, and I cant really remember if a sense of unity was in fact lost. Anyway, I listened to a few more tunes, then went to sleep.

When I woke up, I felt the floaty effects still with me. When I began typing, I realized my body was numb  pretty much as numb as it had been throughout the peak of the trip. This feeling (or lack thereof) persisted throughout the day, along with a mild sedation. I went to an accursed social function that evening and spoke with the only person I knew there (wondering if I seemed slightly drunk). When this conversation was done, I resumed my status as an awkward, anti-social self-imposed exile and spent the next hour sitting on a chair in the corner of the room, forcefully deadpan, writhing in mental agony and recording my thoughts in a notebook in a pen scratching frenzy. I felt simultaneously sedated and energetic  apathetic and tormented. I saw J. there  she gave me some tic tacs. I ate a few, then started writing about the TIC TAC REGIME  a damn fine surrealist rant if I do say so myself. This triggered a glorious bout of cool ego-mania that I enjoyed and attempted to ride on the strength of. There came a point however when I refused to hang around anymore. I went home.

Next day, same story. The low-level anesthesia persisted. Light touches like scratching my face, adjusting my clothes, toweling off my hands, and typing on a keyboard were barely felt at all  pain was somewhat muted, but not significantly (so this aint no practical painkiller). Yes, it was kind of cool, but two fucking days of that shit was starting to annoy me. I never realized the worth of tactile stimuli until it was taken from me.

The next day I was unsurprised but disappointed to feel no ebb in the lingering physical effects. I just wanted to FEEL again  feel normally, you know? Not this pale, half-processed feedback. I wondered if I could have permanently fucked up one of my senses. I worried that Id get used to feeling this way and come to think of it as normal (and thus forget there was ever a vivid world of touch beyond this dullened haze  a world that was painful sometimes, but one I wouldnt want to forsake forever). I felt highly energetic that day (sedation didnt seem to be lingering), happily engaging in housework and the chores of personal hygiene I dont often undergo. 

Today (six days later)  Im pretty sure the anesthesia is fading (thank God). In this aftermath, I feel more in control of my altered states and eager to explore them again, but dosage and timing schemes still seem to have unpredictable results.

One hit of marijuana. This is my current dose. In the past (6 years ago) I would smoke quite copiously. Now one or two lungs of the stuff is most effective. I have always maintained marijuana is/can be one of the more potent and challenging drugs.

The effects seem to take about 15 minutes to come on and last 2.5-3+ hours, and they are varied: Visually most everything becomes potentially fascinating, thoughts race. At some point in the trip I usually experience vague audio paranoid hallucinations in distant speech. People saying things intimately related to what I am doing, which vanish when I 'tune in' on a snippet of the conversation. Physically I feel my dexterity is mildly impaired, I get thirsty for water, I like to brush my teeth. I may relax, but am often made anxious, akin to the 'butterflies in the stomach'. This spurs me to creative endeavors, exercise, or sex, my favorite three  ways of eliminating stress. 

This restless motivation is the primary reward for me, and is an effect I believe diminishes with habitual use, though in the past to combat 'stoner burn out' I have found a cocktail of choline, l-glutamine, and cranberry juice (called fiery wine) to be most helpful. I used liquid forms of both from twin labs in teaspoon quantity 1500-2000+ milligrams of each, and cranberry juice to mask the 'unusual' salty sweet tastes. Spiking this drink with ephedra extract gave it a mild amphetamine effect, superior to caffeine. 

Marijuana lifts my spirits. It feels like a strong medicine which is relatively benign. I believe it is a true entheogen. 

I have written a poem to help with audio schizophrenia.

FOR THE NERVOUS SET

Imaginary audiences,
Behind our backs.
We pay them to much mind.


Sincerely-
Agog

120 lb






i used to burn herb a few times a week.  It went up to every day plus for a month or two, then over the last year it's been a steady once a week just about every single week.

Looking for something a little different, i decided i would make herb cookies since i hadn't done that in a while.  i ordered a bag of delivery-service regular grade mediocre cooking herb and poured it into a half-stick of butter or so in a pan.  After cooking that for a half hour, i poured it directly into the cookie batter and made 2 really big cookies (1 for me, 1 for my friend Brian).

Saturday night at 5:00 we got all geared up and each ate a cookie.  They were, of course, delicious.  i realized that something was clearly amiss when at only T+30 min i noticed i was already high.  Very high.  And hungry despite having eaten a large large volume of cookie with high butter content.  For now i wait and have some of Brian's salad.  He is still eating his (remember i said they were large).

Another half-hour goes by of steady, steep climbing in height and i begin to get a little nervous.  To sort of snap myself out of the anxiety/worry phase, i make light of it and suggest we get pizza, though i am starting to fear the potentially scary world at this point.  We make it out and back with pizza, i eat some and soon have to go lay down because i'm too high.

i concentrated on not fighting the drug and riding it instead, and this helped a lot.  i managed to calm myself down enough to be receptive.  i began to get significant visuals as soon as i lay down, akin to the strength of my first time taking mushrooms (see report labeled 'Resurrection') but without the mental intensity.  i remember the open-eye and closed-eye visuals started to be essentially the same thing, so i couldn't always tell if my eyes were open or not.  Mostly a lot of geometric patterns and things being made of liquid and flowing.  Nothing event-oriented at this point.

Some time went by, and i eventually managed to tell Brian i was going to the bathroom.  i made it downstairs, but passed out on his bed instead of making it to the bathroom.  i had several vivid dreams in this period about differing versions of the end of the world (or at least of the world as i understood it).

At 11:30, Brian woke me up and had me sleep on his floor so he could have his bed.  i set an alarm for the next morning and succumbed to the herb again.
--------
Seconds later (real life : eight and a half hours later), i wake up to the alarm at 8:00 am.  i'm thinking about how weird i feel, but ascribe it to fatigue until i remember the cookies and the fact that i'm in New Jersey and not at home.  i realize i'm still high.  Still spun off my fucking wheels, in fact.  And that i have to go play piano at a church service, immediately.

i try to lace my shoes, fail, sit down and retrace my steps, and avoid freaking out.  'just relax' i tell myself as i fumble through an action i could do the last seventeen years or so with no trouble.  i mean, just because i can't tie my shoes shouldn't mean that i can't maintain order in public, play an instrument accompanying a whole congregation of people as well as a singer, and deal with the hierarchy of the catholic church, right?

i made it to church on time and awake if not aware.  i cut down on all human interaction, but there is some minimum.  i basically avoided talking as much as possible and tried to stay out of the way.  Putting on the robe for the mass gave me some trouble, but i got it together ok. The singer and i went upstairs to the main part of the church, and he asked me what i had done the night before.  i mumbled something (presumably) semi-coherent about staying out late playing a session, and he says 'You sure you didn't take acid or something?'

i told him i was sure.

Despite the fact that the music wasn't standing still, i managed to read through the hymns and solo ok and book it the hell out.  Came home, had an apple, passed out on my bed.  This was at about 12:30 pm the next day, now T+19 or so.  i was asleep until 12:00 am, T+31 or so, and i was still high when i woke up.  i ate some munchies and staggered back to bed again.  woke up at 8:30 am, 38 hours after ingestion, still a little dazed, a little depressed, but at least functional again.

i spent Monday in a semi-haze all day and didn't really feel normal until like 7:00 pm, or t+49 hours.  i got a lot more than i bargained for on this one.  i'm glad it turned out ok and that i didn't do something outlandish in the middle of a catholic church service or get lost in Jersey (or the city for that matter).  This was unfortunately not much a growth experience due to the fact that i was asleep for almost all of it.
However, lesson learned : two grams of herb is really rather too much for a recreational Saturday afternoon herb cookie.

After seeing a couple of my friends take this substance I finally decided to take it myself. I decided to take it on a Saturday even though I knew I had to work Sunday afternoon, because my friends told me that there was no hangover. 

I took about 8 milligrams of the powder, it tasted horrible and had a taste that was hard to get rid of. The first thing I noticed was a general restlessness and I started pacing around the room. I played a couple of CD's but didn't find them particularly appealing. 

Within 20 minutes of taking the compound my pulse was rising. I was expecting effects similar to MDMA, although as it turns out it is completely different from MDMA. 

As the body buzz grew more intense I started to feel incredibly cold and wrapped my self in a blanket even though the room was around 80- 85 degrees. 

Soon after the chills started the mental effects got rolling. My thoughts slowed down and I found it hard to keep up with the conversation that my friend, Rob, and my girlfriend, Marci, were having. Colors became intensified and my eyes became more sensitive to light even though there was relatively little pupil dilation. The mental effects bared some similarity to marijuana and also psilocybin but wasn't very visual. 

There were no closed eye patterns and my surrounding only seemed vaguely different in a way that was hard to explain. The mental effects of this compound had absolutely no similarities to MDMA although the physical component is more intense but similar. 

There was absolutely no mood elevation and the ever-increasing body effects were making me nauseous. I felt that I was going to throw up. I went into the bathroom and dry heaved for a few minutes then decided to go to the bathroom. I had diarrhea. 

After cleansing my bowels I felt better but was still cold. Rob asked me if I could feel the heat from a nearby candle. I put my hand by the candle and barely noticed the change in temperature. I lowered the palm of my hand to just a few centimeters away from the flame but still felt nothing. I held it there for a few minutes. 

Rob tried holding his hand there for a few seconds and got burned. I commented how in trance states some people can walk on fire and not get burned. I have been able to do a similar thing on MDMA but not on any other compound. 

As the trip wound down about 5 hours after dosing I felt normal but anxious and full of energy yet somehow lazy at the same time. I decided to smoke some Marijuana with Rob. This is very atypical for me as I normally find the stupefying effects of marijuana too be annoying. I thought the combination might be good. 

As it turned out, I was right it seems that 5-Meo-DIPT greatly reduces the mental slowing of marijuana and the marijuana decreased the agitation and stomach upset of the 5-Meo-DIPT. There was definitely some synergy between the two compounds. 

I meditated before sleeping and found that it was easier to reach a trance state than normal. I woke in the morning feeling unusually well rested even though I only slept for a few hours. I felt a pleasant mood elevation that lasted a couple of days. 


Another occasion I tried this compound I decided to up the dose to 15mg. 

The agitation was subsequently increased although the nausea was lessened because I had decided to fast that day. I felt pleasantly aroused although I was not as incredibly horny as my girlfriend became on the higher doses this compound. I had heard from my girlfriend that this chemical increased sexual pleasure significantly for her. I decided that it would be a good idea for us to have sex. 

Tactile sensation was definitely enhanced by the compound and the anxiety and nausea were temporarily gone during lovemaking. I wonder if this is because of some unknown synergy between the endorphins released during sex and the 5-MeO-DIPT. It also makes me wonder is opiates would show any synergy with this chemical. 

After sex I closed my eyes and was greeted by some very interesting closed eye visuals. Pictures of Snakes, DNA, and dendrites danced before my eyes. 

An hour after sex my nausea and agitation returned. I wished I had some marijuana as it is evident that for the last few hours of the trip the only significant effect is the bothersome agitated feeling and insomnia, which are easily cured by smoking pot. 

My girlfriend got drunk and reported some synergy with alcohol although I didn't want a hang over so I decided not to drink with her. 

I tossed and turned that night but eventually fell asleep. Even after the fitful night I felt a pleasant happiness throughout the next day just as I had on my previous experiences. 


SPECIAL NOTES: Many people have reported that 5-MeO-DIPT provides a smoother transition for the more powerful tryptamines such as DMT and 5-MeO-DIPT. 

DPT and 5-MeO-DIPT is a particularly intense combination and many people have reported religious experiences with this particular combination, as it seems to extend the duration of the DPT trip considerably. 

Some men find that taking 5-Meo-DIPT along with it can relieve the erection problems caused by MDMA. Taking 5-Meo-DIPT at the same time as psilocybin or LSD causes it's effects to become partially obscured behind the stronger psychedelic compound so that only it's erotic effects and body load are noticed. 

5-MeO-DIPT has proved to be useful to me in achieving deeper meditative trances than normally possible although mystical experiences are not as prevalent as with other substances and aren't normally achieved without at least some degree of practice. The body load of this substance stands in the way of this compounds potential for spiritual work involving concentration, as it is easy to end up concentrating on the body discomfort instead of the desired magickal task. 

Marijuana can be especially beneficial if one desires to do magickal work with this compound because it increases the visual aspect of the trip and decreases the body discomfort. Sexual pleasure and sex magick could be greatly enhanced by this compound. Visuals often increase after having sex and the nausea of the compound is decreased. 

Like MDMA, 5-MeO-DIPT increases tactile sensation. Unlike MDMA, however 5-MeO-DIPT will not cause any erection problem and even makes achieving an erection easier. This chemical may actually have some future in the treatment of male sexual dysfunction.

To me, marijuana should be used to enhance happiness.  I had recieved my report card and for the first time in my high school career, I was actually on the honor roll.  To celebrate this joyous occasion I purchased a 1/4oz of nugs, go figure.

I showed up at my friend's house with pipe in hand around 9 pm.  We climbed the stairs up to her room (the attic), lit some incense and got the party started.  We lounged on the couches and we just kept smoking like chimneys, pipe after pipe, joint after joint.

The first few puffs had gotten me pretty high and smoking more made my mind soar to new heights.  We were listening to Dark Side of the Moon over and over again.  The music was so enriching and thick I felt like I could have tasted it as the noise flowed from the speakers.  As I laid on the floor it felt as if someone was pulling me backwards through water.  I was suffering from severe cotton mouth, so I walked downstairs to get a drink.  The air was so much cleaner and crisp.  Entering the attic, it was as if I had been engulfed in a rich sweet white haze.  It was like a dream sequence on TV, everything was so clouded yet intense.

Continuing our smoke-a-thon, my friend's brother walks into the attic and asks to join us.  The three of us were laughing, reminiscing, pondering the meaning of life, our words just bumped into each other as one giant incoherent mess.  My friend and her brother were discussing memories of each other as children. Talk about a way to bring two family members together.

I knew we had smoked ourselves into oblivion once we were all rolling around on the floor mumbling to ourselves.  It was about 2am when we all drifted off to slumber land.  When I woke around 10am, I felt like I had just completed a whole lifetime of movement in a single night.  I just laid on the floor, lit a morning bowl, and reflected on my life as the sunlight streamed through the windows onto the floor.

I've been a moderate to heavy cheeva-choker for the past several months, and I seem to be more succeptible to the wonder weed's psychedelic effects than the average person. (If anything, my sensitivity to pot has increased since I began using it.) I often have hallucinations of a sort- although the visual 'hallucinations' are more like daydreams of such extreme potency that i actually see them overlaying reality. Yesterday, though, I had an experience which blew all previous highs away- and without a particularly large amount.

My friend and I were smoking up in the park with my beautiful technicolor bowl Kate. My mental state at the time is important- I had just previously gotten out of a state of extreme frustration and tension and had begun to release the pressure in a strange, aggressive torrent of energy. It was a Friday and I was finally feeling more or less relaxed and in a state of total abandon.

The hydro took effect MUCH faster than usual- mere seconds after the first toke. The characteristic hot-and-cold pins-and-needles feeling (yum) was especially intense. My friend and I began to wander aimlessly through the park and I took it upon myself to make him giggle inanely. Then a strange thing happened...

My vision isn't fantastic, and weed usually makes it more distorted than usual. But I saw, for a moment, a tree with INTENSE clarity. As I continued walking, the episodes became more and more frequent- I would see the grass or trees with a kind of pure pristine vision, and the color enhancement would be MUCH greater than that of a normal buzz... the greenness of the grass would become so overwhelming and so full of light and life that it was literally blinding. I had a powerful clear feeling during each of these occurences, which faded in and out in rhythm, that I was seeing the real world, as if reality were in a dimension slightly askew from our own and i was being granted the opportunity to gaze into it. The body buzz built, and the electric currents I felt moving through my torso became more powerful, until during each moment of superbright illumination it felt like I was being struck by lightning, and I felt shocks of extremely intense, almost sexual pleasure. (I realize that a near-orgasmic experience on a drug as mild as pot seems extremely bizarre. This was NOT a normal high.)

My friend and I also experienced a kind of telepathy greater than what we normally see on weed, and as we talked pseudo-buddhist philosophy (as we normally do when high, when not making fart jokes and giggling like morons) I KNEW the next word he was going to say before he was going to say it. 

I don't know what to say in conclusion, except that the way a drug effects me is based on my mindset at the time, a fact which is all too frequently overlooked.

I guess I should start with a quick psychoactive background.  I never did any drugs whatsoever until after my 21st when I got drunk the first time.  Later I decided to try weed with my best friend who had been smoking for quite a while.  Apparently with most people it's not this way, but that first time (it was decent bud at best but far from dank) I was totally ripped after about 3 puffs.  Obviously, I fell in love with it and after a 2 month dry spell began smoking twice or once a week.  We've got a regular little circle with my roommates and my best friend.

So a month or two after the circle was established my friend starts growing his own, and come final harvest time he has about half a pound of weed so he started selling the excess to friends at his job (a restaurant, so obviously he had plenty of contacts).

My dad has always been a better friend than father figure.  He's quite the character, and always a blast to hang out with.  We had his version of the drug talk when I was a younger guy and he told he that he had tried just about everything: meth, coke, heroin (once), shrooms, acid, and of course weed.  He then told me that all that was in the past and there's not all that much to it.  Later, when I got older and long after he and my mom had split up, he admitted that he still smoked weed occasionally, although that didn't really make me want to try it (I was very down on all drugs until that magical day I first got drunk).

So a few months ago I told him that I smoke weed.  At first he was a little flabbergasted, but then he just tried to fill his parental shoes as best he could by reminding me that it is illegal and telling me to be careful.  I of course told him I would and we left it at that.

The next time he came up for a visit, he asked me if I wanted to get high with him.  This time it was my turn to be speechless, but after a minute I just shook my head with a small laugh and said, 'I'll see if I can score.'

', ummm.. I know this is fucked up, but... umm... how would you feel about smoking with my dad?'

My friend was not at all opposed to the idea, as he also gets along well with my dad but unfortunately that time he was between harvests and we were currently out of smoke.  We didn't get to smoke that time, but the next time he was up was after the final harvest so when I told my dad how much bud my friend had he expressed some interest in buying from him.  He bought a 1/4oz and the three of us got high that entire day until the rest of the circle got off work and they all joined us for the rest of the evening.

I've got to say that that night was one of my best smoking experiences of all time.  My dad bought us all beverages, pizza, took us out for dinner for munchies (he's kinda loaded now).  He regaled us with stories from back in the day when you could score a lid (I had to ask him what a lid was, it's a full ounce) for $5 and if you spent $20 you got some super dank ass weed.  He made some awesome prank calls with me.  He started trying to fuck with our heads when we were really feeling it by talking in this gibberish and acting like it was a real conversation.  And every once in a while, I would look at him and think, 'My God.  He's been living for so much longer than I have, and yet here we are connecting in this complete and wonderful manner in a way we never have before.  This is so fucked up!  I'm blazing with my fucking dad!'

I haven't smoked with him since, but I'm looking forward to doing it again some other time.  I don't wanna get all mushy, but even though we sometimes fight and sometimes I really hate the guy, we really connected on that night and I think it's something that both of us will take with us for the rest of our lives.

Just a note on eating cannabis. I was in Benares, India, back in 1998. Benares the City of Death (it really is). Anyway. I drank a hearty glass of thick marijuana milk shake with a flamboyant Australian friend sometime in the evening. A little later the effects came on, and I found myself transported from a restaurant, where I should have been calmly eating my dindins to a dark nether world of panic and delusions of apocalypse. The usual effects of increased heart beat and paranoia that one experiences having taken on too much THC were the least of my troubles. The world spun, I could not focus, and I felt sick to my stomach. I could not breath, but not from my usual response to overindulgence (panic), but because my body was sucked so completely of energy that the muscles in my chest were not strong enough to lift my ribs and arms from my chest.

Making my way home, having parted from my companion who was happy and having a whale of a time making friends with the fry chef, I came as close to crawling as one can without actually touching the floor with one's hands. I had to walk, doubled up with exhaustion, using the narrow alley walls as crutches.

When I got back to my room, experiencing and having experienced horrors that are too dreary to list here, I lay down, waiting for the storm to pass, which did not happen for many hours. I was even unable to resort to my standard last ditch method of reclaiming normality after taking too much, masturbation, so locked out was I from my body.

Anyway, in light of this anecdote I would like to offer a few tips that have helped me, specifically concerning overindulgence in cannabis: 
#1. Remember that eating marijuana can lead to a really foul experience. Eating can be good, but less is always more when doing so. You can never lose buy eating too little, and, conversely, once you realize you have eaten too much, it is too late.

#2.When too stoned, focus on something that will really keep your attention. Best of all is a friend. Do not be afraid to tell them that you feel shitty, it really helps. This also usually sparks up an involved dialogue which makes you forget how terribly panicked you were.  

#3.When too stoned, the ancient remedy of the Hindu holy men is sugar melted in butter. It works pretty good.

#4. I do not recommend, as have others on this site, the concentration on one's breathing if it is your breathing that is bothering you. I, personally, am never satisfied with the state of my breathing when stoned to any degree. I find that ignoring what you think is wrong with you is the best way to get rid of such feelings, especially in light of the fact that those feelings are never real.

#5. As noted before, and with the hope of not sounding vulgar, having a wank, along with the old favourites of brushing the teeth or taking a shower, usually works too. 

I hope those who read this find it helpful if they are ever caught out.
Thanks

Oh, what a great night it was indeed.  My best friend and I decided to go out and by some weed and go for a car ride.  She was driving.  We packed a bowl (a glass one with a carb) and we were both so pumped up to smoke because we both had a stressful day studying for tests.  I packed the bowl and I gave it to her to spark it.  She did, and smiled at me, then let out all this smoke.  

She got a great hit as did I for the rest of the bowl.  By this time I was feeling great.  My head got light and right in around my eyes and nose got tight, and I kept scrunching my nose to release the tension.  Of course it didn't work, but it wasn't a bad feeling or anything so it didn't really bother me.  We were listening to some Phish and picked out Guyute especially.  All we could do was smile and dance as she drove 25 in a 45.  We tried to go the speed limit but it felt as though we were going 80 mph!!  I started to tell her to slow down and she looked at her speedometor and said 'Oh my God we're only going 25!'  I was like 'No we're not...we're going soo fast.'  But we weren't.  It felt like it though.  Everything was moving so fast and we were just stuck in the middle of it.  

Our reactions were slow and our sense of direction was totally gone.  My friend would stop and the green lights for 2 seconds before realizing they were green and not red.  Everything was funny to us, we laughed at eachother, and what we were doing.  We talked like there was no tomorrow it was great.  We also drank soo much water on the short car ride.  Well, it was supposed to be short, but we got lost for 2 hours.  What is funny about that is that we were in a part of town that we both knew like the back of our own hand.  It didn't matter, we were stupid and didn't know where we were.  So we drove around in circles for 2 hours and still we were high.  We got closer to school, and we both mutually decided to smoke another bowl!!  He he he, it was even better.  

She couldn't park her car, and I made up some joke to go along with it and everytime she does a bad job parking I bring it up and we laugh about it.  Anyway, so after she parked her car, we sat in the car for another half hour just chillin out to music.  People were walking by and we were just jammin out to Phish in her car like it was our job!!  Eventually we stumbled out of the car and I was laughing histerically!  We had a hard time walking, and I couldn't talk too well.  Basically, we were just a little slow.  We noticed that we would be in mid-sentence and lose all train of thought and couldn't continue on with our story!  

Everything just felt soo good to us as well.  We were always smiling, and I wanted to talk to everybody!  We were just so friendly to everybody and anybody!  It was like we were angels of happiness sent to spread happiness to everybody.  Our eyes were cashed of course and people noticed that but we didn't care at all.  We rode the elevator up to our rooms where we had a feast.  All we could do was drink and eat a lot of food!!  It wasn't hard to fall asleep either, I was watching a movie and fell right asleep at like 11pm, which is actually very early for me and her.  It was great.  

I have never had a bad experience with weed!!  I love it.  I would highly recommend trying it!  My grades have stayed the same since I have started to smoke, and I am still highly active in my sports.  Nothing about me and who I am changed.

A few days ago, three of my closest friends and I decided to get together and smoke marijuana. It wasn't a new experience for any of us, but the effects of the drug were.

I had paid my friend D $30 for some hydro and picked it up. My close friend B brought $20 of regs. First we sat in a clearing in the woods and loaded the bowls of hydro. This was the most powerful shit I ever took. I was warned that 2 hits would be adequate, but I decided to take around 5.

In about 10 minutes, it all started to kick in. I forgot where I was. I was in a sort of pseudo-reality. If I concentrated really hard, I could at times control my actions. But 95% of the time, I was moving and functioning without thinking, just letting my body flow.

This feeling was very odd. As it peaked, the effects became so strong that I thought I might be eternally doomed to this trance-like state. Everything I saw was in a freeze-frame. That frame would stay frozen for about 4 seconds and then I would see a new clip. This was my reality. Life was in frames, and I would see a new freeze-frame about every four seconds. If I let my mind go and tried to free it, I would be drawn in to whatever I was looking at. If I stared at the stars, I felt like I was being sucked into them. And when I stopped looking, everything became choppy and blurry for a few seconds.

I did not know where I was. All I remember is babbling to my friend G about how I had to get home before I would pass-out. He didn't pay attention to me and kept passing the bowl around. We were all very very high at that point. Normal yellow-white lights would appear red and blue. I was scared and wanted to go home and sleep it off. When I stood up, the effects were even stronger. I felt much more disoriented and afraid. 

After we returned home to my place, the effects were still strong, but beginning to wear off. I was very hungry and ate upon instinct. I couldn't control my body. I ate some cereal, and my body moved the spoon to my mouth with no thought involved. My brain was forcing me to do things. Half of the milk that went into my mouth ended up on the table or floor from my unintentional drooling habits (only because I was high).

I went upstairs to my room and was not scared anymore. I felt happy and funny. I began to do an Asian warrior dance. I thought I was a samurai! After I was done, I could barely remember doing it at all. It was probably because 'I' wasn't doing it; my brain was controlling my movements. And I couldn't control my brain.

Then I noticed that when I would touch anything, it would feel so so different. I could feel every nerve ending in my body. There was no such thing as pain. Pain is a feeling interpreted by your brain, and I couldn't control my brain! Everything I touched felt the same. There was really no such thing as texture; I just had the same intense feeling when I touched everything. So I started rubbing my body and my arms especially against everything around me: the walls, pillows, even my friends. This feeling lasted for hours, and I can still feel part of it now, a day later!

I could not control my speech. I would say things without thinking, and after I said them, I could have sworn I didn't! It was crazy! I would talk to people and never recall saying anything. 

My memory was affected greatly. After I witnessed certain things happen, I would be unsure if they actually ever occurred. I lived in the present moment. And after that moment passed, I could barely remember it.

Finally, my 3 friends and I went to bed after we smoked two more joints of the regs. In the morning, I still felt the odd 'touch-effect' strongly. So we all got up and went for a walk. We smoked 2 more joints of the regs and went to the mall. Being in the mall while high is unlike any other experience I can imagine. The regs didn't give me that scared feeling I had experienced with the dro. I felt happy yet mellow. The whole situation was indescribable. I couldn't control my mind, yet it functioned rationally on its own. When store clerks instructed me to pay, my mind understood. And without thinking (upon reflex or instinct), I would take out my wallet and pay the desired amount.

Then we decided to eat in the food court. The food tasted so great! Touch and taste were the 2 senses which were most amplified. That 'strobe/frame-by-frame' feeling I had from the dro returned. Only this time I had delayed reaction with taste instead of sight. When I would chew something, I would only taste it every few seconds. But when I did taste it, the taste was incredible.

Outside of the mall, I remember running across the parking lot with my friends B G and J. My legs were moving on their own; I couldn't control them. I only felt my upper body. It was like I was soaring across the empty parking lot. This was such an excellent feeling.

I should also mention my perception of time during this account. I could be lying on the bed watching a movie for what seemed like 30 minutes, yet only 2 minutes would have passed. This also worked conversely. I could have thought that only a minute went by, yet in reality almost a half hour could have passed.

So, this where my story ends. And this is the advice I would have given myself beforehand: If some one warns you that 2 hits is enough for the night, trust him/her. Also, don't speak a lot because you won't make sense to those listening. And don't keep on smoking just because you aren't 'feeling it'. It takes a few minutes to get high. It's better that you take a little at a time and wait for the effects. Then, if desired, you may increase the amount accordingly. Otherwise, it will all kick in at once. Finally, I just want to mention that hydro is much much more powerful than regs, so you should always know what you are smoking and trust the people you are smoking with.

There had been a couple times where i had smoked weed and never caught off of it.  I always questioned why people did it and spoke so highly of it.  I never quite understood this.  Then one time, after school one day, my friend came up to me and told me he was high, and i asked him to describe it.  He told me that things seemed to go very slow, and different things seemed a lot more alarming.  I just passed it off and though nothing of it.

Then about 2 months later, a friend of mine ended up picking up 2 grams just for the night, and ended up getting a very nice count.  Now there were about a dozen people with us, but only about 5-6 who were smoking.  Everything went into different assorted pipes.

The setting was a park, one which i had been to many times. So the experience began with all of us being like kids with candy, taking as much as we could, not knowing what we'd feel like afterward.  As we were smoking, i think about after the 5th hit, i finally started to notice something.  Sure enough, it was just the onsets, and i was happy that i was finally high and could now start to relate to people about what being high was about. 

Then after everything was smoked, everyone was being extremely loud in the park and i could hear every conversation which everyone was having, regardless if i was 2 feet from the person telling the story or 10 feet.  I could hear everything.  I could hear the wind, and also the city night.  I never understood this in my life, how to hear everything at once like this.  Normally my brain just concentrated on what i wanted to listen to, or everything would be bundled up.

At this point that's when it finally hit me.  My vision became intensely like a strobe light, on a slow setting.  I can duplicate the same effect by opening my eyes for a brief second and then closing them and doing this over and over.  Images of everything were being captured, and i was trying to talk to my friend about me relating to what he had said to me at school, but he was so fucked up that he was too busy laughing at everyone =).  This didn't really help out my experience at all because i felt like i was alone.

As the night progressed i started on the exploration of my inner self, learning about things which i had experienced, and who i was.  Putting together thoughts, and travelling on the brain waves of thought to understand how things are connected.  As i dug myself deeper and deeper into my mind i slowly noticed paranoia creeping up on me.  I was alarmed with many things and proceeded to act somewhat like a cat, quick and very attentive.  My friends thought this was all funny and just couldn't get enough of it.

Then when things started to calm down, i ended up saying to myself 'something else, something else.' The first something else would be louder than the second one.  Thus, throwing me into a trance.  The two different levels of sound i was now exploring became my whole reality.  Kaleidescope vision would happen when i would close my eyes, and i would continue to repeat this while wandering around the park closing my eyes.  For most of the night, everyone just laughed.  But because it was my first time of exploring myself, i was more entertained by things which i was doing, rather than what people had said.

Three years later, i'm now very experienced with marijuana.  And from this great plant, i uncovered different secrets about music, thinking, art, and other mind entertaining subjects. I wonder to this day what i would be like if my mind had never been exposed to this insight.  I think i would be a lot more of a dull person, and ignore things which meant a great deal to personal exploration.

I first smoked weed as a sophomore in high school. I felt nothing the first time. Fast foward to this year. I recently got a friend to hook me up with a twenty sack. I had no idea how much this really was, and it wasn't until I was twenty dollars lighter and at home with my ziplock baggie that I could examine it.

At the bottom of the bag were about 7 or 8 'nugs.' I had done some research and from what I saw it didn't look like 'schwag' but rather some semi decent stuff. I proceeded to break off the stems and take out the seeds. I didn't know whether I had to do this or not, but it seemed logical as seeds don't contain THC and the stems are supposed to produce harsh smoke. That night I went outside and smoked a bowl. I didn't feel any high. That night I went outside and smoked a bowl. I didn't feel any high. I was disheartened but determined to try again the next day.

The next day I made sure my parents were going to be gone all day. I also stuffed a toilet paper roll with dryer sheets and rubber banded an additional sheet at the end opposite the one I was going to blow the smoke through to cut down on the smell.

I sat down on the carpet in my room and slowly lit up a bowl packed with a fairly good sized bud (I had broken up and de-seeded the nugs mind you). I inhaled deeply and held it in. I repeated this twice more, making for 3 fully smoked bowls (with each piece as big as the thimble-sized bowl would hold and smoked until it was mostly black ash).

After I was done with the third bowl, I felt a little off balance. I quickly removed all traces of evidence from the area and decided to wait and see what happened.

After a few minutes my head started spinning and I was scared. I felt almost like I had taken some good knocks to the head and was about to faint. Soon my hips started spinning and I stood in front of a full length mirror and laughed as I realized that I looked like I was trying to hula dance without a grass skirt (pardon the pun).

The funny thing about this was that not only did the hip swiveling come from nowhere, but it was as if I could not control it. It seemed like invisible puppet strings were making me move and I could see it happening but couldn't stop it. I felt almost detached from my head...almost the feeling I would imagine the coyote feels when the roadrunner drops an anvil on him...stars.

When I sat down and started typing on the computer, my hips could no longer move and my head took over the spinning. Over and over my head spun like a hula hoop and like my hips, always in one direction.

Soon I felt very hungry for something starchy. I found myself eating several bowls of Rice Chex and questioning whether I had been sold some very potent shit or if the potency of high was directly related to how many times you had done it in the past.

I felt some mild paranoia that I think prevented me from getting the most out of my high, but I think it was due more to my worry of my parents walking in than it was the pot.

I laid down and listened to Cynic (a technical jazz-metal band) for a while and while I noticed no real changes in the music, I did find my limbs relaxing and staying in any spot I put them in. I had no desire to move, but instead I just lay there, more relaxed than I had ever felt in my life.

I eventually took a shower and went back to sleep. The sleep was the best I had had in years. Like a newborn infant.

The next morning I took what was left and threw the raw, seedless nugs into a mug of very hot water. I had read that THC is not water-soluble but fat-soluble but when you make tea like that the THC floats in the water much like oil molecules do since THC is (supposedly) an oil.

After about ten minutes I took the nugs out. The water had a light brownish color and miniscule bubbles that looked like oil molecules were in the liquid. I drank the whole thing down and felt a mild, sleepy-like high for about two hours. Smoking is definately a better alternative than tea if I can do it without getting caught.

My final verdict: The 3 thimble sized bowls I smoked didn't even seem like a lot at all but they kept me high for at least 5 hours. I felt like there were sparkles of glitter flying around my head for most of the time and the hula/starry head thing was fun. I felt immensely relaxed, but it was easy to stay awake and enjoy the sensation. When I did go to sleep after the high had worn off, I felt almost like I was a corpse I slept so heavily.

Pot isn't the worst of drugs by a long shot.  I know I'll be doing some more when I can hook up another twenty, that's for sure!

My First High: A Trip I Will Never Forget

Here's some background before I narrate my first decent high. I live in University dorms. Many indulge in smoking pot and it's hard to get caught as long as the staff doesn't come to know. That being the case, I decided to try weed for the first time. My first time smoking cannabis by taking a few drags from a joint was disappointing, as the effects were minimal and very short lived. I didn't get quite high; what I experienced was shivering, a shaky, slow voice and laughter for half a minute. Later on, I felt disappointed. I wanted to get baked.

That night, I was listening to psychedelic music with a friend and it made me eager to try again. Later in the night, there was an unexpected hostel meeting and room checking of all students because of someone's report of losing a very valuable laptop. That put me off; I thought that there would be no chance for the holy thing to happen- there was too much of a commotion in the hostel, and the usual chilled and relaxed nocturnal vibe was missing. 

After some more wild moments of hanging out and listening to music with friends, I decided that then would be the perfect time. After confirming with a friend, I went to Room A after midnight. 

Many of my friends were in the room. The joint was being rolled. We started puffing and passing. I took a few drags from the freshly rolled joint. I didn't feel much, again to my disappointment, except a tingly feeling of static on my face.

Someone suggested that we consume some by means of a bong, which was available in Room B, several floors above. Some of us including me went there in pairs, in order to evade attention considering we were the only ones moving about inside the building at these hours.

Entering Room B, to my surprise, I found my roomie, spaced out, with another person. One by one, we started taking hits from an improvised bong. I took multiple hits, thinking that I wouldn't get high unless I consumed the most I could. I started to feel nauseated. I waited for 5-10 minutes. Everything felt wobbly, like waves, subtly swaying and making my body resonate. My vision was ever so slightly warping and I felt giddy, and safety was in being seated. When the nausea was back to being bearable, I took a few more hits from the improvised bong. My memory of what happened thereon is slightly faded.

We returned to Room A and I lied down on the bed in the dim light. It strangely felt like I was in control of a camera. Moving in front of nearby objects felt like a cinematic experience. It strangely felt like I was in control of a camera. Moving in front of nearby objects felt like a cinematic experience. I was sure that at that point, I had started feeling the effects. I was the most stoned person in the group. Everything felt like a dream slow and wavy. Talking complete, coherent sentences was a challenge and my voice and tone of speaking were all over the place. Whenever I would close my eyes, I would visualize various patterns and motifs (CEVs) and slip into a trance. Opening my eyes felt like waking up from a long sleep session. At times, there was a delay between events, comparable to looking at a slideshow. Movement was taxing and laggy, but certain actions, like rubbing my face with my palms, moving my body a certain way and feeling different objects was pleasurable and I would repeatedly do it at times with vigour. My entire body felt like the ticklish feeling I get when I want to pop my knuckles or stretch my body. I was very talkative, often forgetting what I was saying halfway through a sentence. I had the memory of a goldfish. Whenever I would open my eyes, I would feel like the drug was wearing off, only to be sucked back into the trip.  At times, I felt pain in my chest and I thought that I was forgetting to breathe, and if I were to fall asleep, I would die. The nausea persisted for long (maybe because the weed was cheap and of poor quality). This new experience made me shiver, like I was having a mini panic attack, throughout the trip. Music felt like a distraction at times. I partly was in control of what I wanted to say, but it ended up sounding weird and funny, making those around me crack up. I felt like hugging people around me. I was kind of there in this state, exploring the effects, watching the people in the room do different activities, and verbally interacting with them, until I fell asleep.

I woke up. It was Dawn. My roomie and I were on the bed with one occupant of the room. I had slept like a baby and was satisfied with my sleep after all those days of interrupted sleep. I stood up, feeling wobbly and calm. The effects had mostly faded. I went back to my room and begun the day. As I type this, I continue to feel an afterglow, a very subtle feeling of being high and disoriented, a fraction of what it was. I guess I'll be back to normal in the next couple of days.

I hope every high is as good as this, or maybe better. I enjoyed the experience and wish to try it again. Good people, good vibes, and a good setting feels like a must. I feel more connected to those who were with me on my trip.

CBD Flower Experience

I have not seen any reports on CBD flower, more specifically with concentrations of 0.03% THC. So I decided to share my experience with it.

Background: I use to be a avid user of cannabis, but quit due to some things in my life that were happening at the time. At the time of this experience I had not smoked cannabis for 2 years and my tolerance was zero. Even when I smoked daily I was still fairly sensitive to THC.

Report: I purchased a 1/8th of CBD flower from a headshop in my town. The area that I live in still seems marijuana illegal both recreationally and medicinally. But CBD products are allowed. The box stated that it contained 0.03 percent THC and 476 mg of CBD. Upon inspection the flower looked identical to high grade cannabis and smelt skunky but the smell did not fill up the room as normal bud would. I could also see crystals and the bud was very sticky. I decided to use a gravity bong as in my experience it provides the strongest high for me. I smoked 10 gravity bongs which equaled to over a gram of the CBD flower. As I was pulling the GBs I noticed I was getting higher and higher after the 6th one or so. After the 10th I was definitely high. My eyes were reddened and glassy and it felt as if I had smoked 2 or 3 GBs of some mids. I was shocked that I could buy this legally in my highly illegal state much less get high off of it. It was definitely a THC high that lasted around 4 hours. It was definitely a THC high that lasted around 4 hours. After I had sobered up I had a splitting headache (which could be due to the GBs, they always have given me headaches). The next morning I gave myself a at home drug test that exclusively tests for THC and I failed it miserably. I tested myself 3 days later and I was clean.

Conclusion: CBD flower can get me high  if I smoke alot of it, and it can cause me to fail a drug test. My theory is that they under report the THC content by accident or on purpose. Either way a interesting experience.

Subtle, Gentle First High Experience

Ive smoked weed before, but I never really felt anything until last Wednesday. 

The first time I smoked was when I brought home a little souvenir from a coffeeshop (Im from Amsterdam). I had my expectations, which made me very nervous. I only took about four tokes because I didnt like how it tasted. My heart was beating really fast, my mouth got really dry, I got really cold and my body was shaking. But I didnt feel like I was high. 

The second time I smoked was on Queens Day and I was drunk. A friend had the joint and I took a toke or two. Again, I didnt feel anything. Another friend told me that my eyes were really red and tiny. She even asked: Are you sure you dont feel anything?. Yup. Are you sure you dont feel anything?. Yup. 

My curiosity wasnt satisfiedso last Wednesday I decided that I was going to smoke a whole joint by myself. I went to the only coffeeshop Im familiar with, purchased a pure indica pre-rolled joint and went home.

My room was a little messy; bags of clothing everywhere because I went shopping the day before. I put those away and lighted up.

If Im not mistaken I took two to three tokes and then put the joint down to see what happens. It didnt take much before I felt it. I felt how my brains cooled off. It didnt take much before I felt it. I felt how my brains cooled off. Like, under my skull my brains got cooler. I remember I was standing in front of my desk, searching for music on my laptop and I suddenly got this feeling like I really wanted to sit down. So I did.

After 20 minutes or so I stood up, took a few more tokes and decided that I was going to do some homework. The music in the background didnt sound any different, but it was harder to sing along with the songs. Even though I knew the lyrics, it took a little more focus to actually sing. Like my mouth wasnt automatically doing what I wanted to do.

I also had a little trouble typing and searching for stuff on the internet. I wanted to search for something specific, but ended up somewhere else and then I would ask myself: WTF? What am I doing here?. I found this quite annoying. 

After a while of doing my homework and smoking, I felt my eyes getting heavy. It felt like I had squinty eyes, but when I looked in the mirror I looked normal. 

Halfway the joint I started coughing. My mouth was slightly open and my eyes felt heavier, but I had no trouble keeping them open. I also felt like I was staring at my laptop, but Im not sure of this. 

I had dinner, finished the joint, ate popcorn and at some point I fell asleep. At around midnight I woke up and called my mum on Skype (totally forgot). She told me that she couldn't understand a thing I was saying and that I should go back to sleep because I looked tired. Little did she know...

Amazing Brownie Experience

My boyfriend and I bought two weed brownies from a friend of ours for $10 each. I have eaten one of their brownies before and had a pretty average experience that one would have under the influence of cannabis. We both smoke weed a lot so this was just a normal night for us. We planned on just chilling in his room and watching a movie. So we went to his room and ate them around 9:00 pm.

We both started feeling pretty high at around 9:45ish. After this point, everything seems like a dream and I really have no idea what time things happened. We were lying in bed and just hugging and whatever and we started having sex. It felt nothing like sex normally feels. It was like our bodies were melting into each other and we were just kind of floating and merging into one person. I couldn't even feel the bed beneath us. This was the moment when it really started to get very intense and I began to experience things that I have never felt while I was high. I started to feel like my soul or my consciousness was kind of outside of my body, and was traveling to all of these different places. I started to feel like my soul or my consciousness was kind of outside of my body, and was traveling to all of these different places. Each place felt different, but the feeling of 'traveling' was the same. It was very intense like I was on a roller coaster sort of. Some of the places I ended up were scary and almost familiar, like some dark section of my brain where I store all of the bad things that have happened to me. I felt like I visited that place, but only briefly. I kind of acknowledged that it was there and then discarded it. Some other places were like memories sort of, good memories from my childhood. I felt like I was inside my friend's house that I haven't been in since like, 3rd grade. I felt like I was flying through all of the rooms and I kept remembering different things we did there. I started telling my boyfriend weird stories from my childhood that I had no idea I still remembered. I honestly wasn't paying any attention to my surroundings up until this point because I was completely absorbed in myself. 

Then I brought my attention back to my boyfriend's room, and everything looked different. Everything I saw was moving like it was a wave or something. Then the TV, his roommate's bed, the dresser, and the walls all got way huge and out of proportion so like it looked like there was no floor space. Everything just kind of squished together, it looked like a cartoon. Then after that the opposite happened; everything got all skinny and super stretched out so the room looked HUGE. 

A lot of things happened that I don't remember, it all feels like a dream. I just remember saying like 'When I come to this place, I like to take a little piece of earth with me'. I think I meant that I was so completely far away from reality but sometimes I like to remind myself that I'm still just sitting on a bed. It wasn't like, bad, it was just very overpowering and tiring. I really had no control over my body and I really have no idea what I was saying the whole night. I also felt like my boyfriend was on the same wavelength as me, like we were traveling in a car together. Every time I thought I had hit the peak of the high, it just kept getting more intense. My boyfriend also was convinced he peed himself (he didn't), which was hilarious. I think we tried to watch a show or something but I don't know what it was. We went to bed around like 11:30 I think. 

Today is the day after, and I feel really really drained and foggy. Overall, definitely the highest I have ever ever been and probably ever will be on cannabis. It was a very spiritual experience and it really just opened my eyes to the infinite possibilities and expanse of human consciousness. I don't really want to be that high again ever, but I am very glad that it happened. Never underestimate the power of a good brownie!

Side by Side Experience of Weed Brownies

The first time I tried a weed brownie, I bought one off of one of my friends who had previously eaten some from the same batch. As he had not experienced any negative symptoms, I thought it would be safe to have one. I had been smoking herb in bowls or blunts for about a year. I expected the high to have the same effects as a blunt or a few bowls I expected the high to have the same effects as a blunt or a few bowls, ie. good mood, euphoria, munchies, laughter, sleepiness. 

The brownie was larger than average and had no distinct weed smell or taste. At home, I ingested half with a full meal and the rest after the meal. (Basically making up my protocol as I went.) About thirty minutes after I began to feel the effects of the brownie. I was in the backseat of my boyfriend's car when I felt as if everything I touched was moving. The fabric of the car felt amazing, like I was experiencing each thread individually. When I closed my eyes, I felt like I was shooting off of the earth into space. I laughed at everything, but could not form a cohesive sentence. It was as if something had taken my voice away. (Like Ariel from the little mermaid.) 

These are the only things I remember, until I began to feel extremely anxious because my boyfriend wanted to go to a party, which I felt too stoned to go to. After that, I threw up for a long while, it seemed like an eternity but it was only about 5 min. I felt so sick at the time that I wanted to swear off weed altogether, and looking back I think the experience might have been worse if I hadnt had someone watching over me.  I went home and showered and came down a little, felt really horny (sorry!), and spent the rest of the night in my bed watching tv. To this day I have never been so high. With the knowledge I have now, I would have eaten a quarter of what I did. With the knowledge I have now, I would have eaten a quarter of what I did. 

The second time I tried a weed brownie I made them myself. To fully explain it would be too long but my friends and I followed a recipe for weed infused butter which you add to the brownies. We used about 3 grams of Maui Wowie, but didnt verify the strain. I cautiously ate half a much smaller, ~.4 oz piece and smoked half a blunt. I felt pretty high (see above listed effects) and the high lasted a good 4 hours, peaking at about 2.5. No big deal, Ive definitely been higher. 

Maybe the potency was low, however, it was a more positive experience.

I hadnt known anything about the effects of cannabis (or any altered consciousness states) at age 16, but I was still curious, having seen a friend so easily amused by the world under its influence.  Expecting psychedelic effects, I decided to indulge.

Setting:  A friends birthday party.  Smoking outside, food and video games inside.
Mindset:  Unprepared.  No research done on the drug.  Generally happy, having a good time with friends.

My friends and I began the smoking circle outdoors late at night.  I had previously tried cannabis multiple times to no avail, but on this night I consumed enough for the effects to be present I had previously tried cannabis multiple times to no avail, but on this night I consumed enough for the effects to be present; I would approximate 10-20 hits (which I would consider a lot, especially for a newcomer).  The effects consumed me as we all ended the session and came indoors.

Hour 0:  The first wave hit me like a brick wall and I fell to my knees.  A caring friend of mine helped me sit down so I could enjoy the disorientation I was experiencing.  Another friend who was dancing to music got my attention and I inexplicably called him beautifuleverything was glowing.

Hour 1:  I noticed a friend sneaking around the house with his hand shaped like a gun.  This sparked some sort of nostalgic wonder in meplaying pretend as a child.  I followed suit and we had an all too real feeling matrix gun battle in the kitchen.  The imagination becomes greatly enhanced under these influences.

Hour 2:  Another friend new to smoking took off his pants and ate an entire batch of cookies.  Inhibitions decreased and appetite increased.

Hour 3:  Watched Speed Racer and Horton Hears a Who and cannot recall a single thing from either of these movies.  Short-term memory is terrible under a high dose, and time is very distorted.  This 3-hour estimate I have listed is completely unreliable.

Hour 4:  Fell asleep.

There were no spiritual or philosophical realizations during this trip, but it brought me closer to my friends for a night.  I am three years older then I was at the time of this account. I now only smoke cannabis 1-3 hits per session to avoid physical discomfort/ mental anxiety I now only smoke cannabis 1-3 hits per session to avoid physical discomfort/ mental anxiety that I started to experience what seemed randomly and inexplicably.  Cannabis can assist with creativity, abstract thinking, sleep, and sometimes anxiety/stress.  It seems to invariably increase sexual desire, appetite, and internal dialogue.  With me, mild closed eye visuals can usually be manifested with music and meditation. Addiction to the drug seems impossible, in fact, I have used it to nullify the negative effects of nicotine withdrawal multiple times.

As far back as I remember I have been brainwashed by mainstream media to have the anti drug mindset. It wasn't until I turned 18 that I started experimenting with substances.

I hadn't smoked a single puff of tobacco, marijuana or any other herb. I hadn't drank more than a sip of beer. So when I say this was my first time, I really mean it.

I'm going to exclude the first three times I smoked, as I didn't really 'feel' it. 

My first time consisted of me and a few friends deciding to try out my friends new 2 foot multi chambered bong. I would say the quality of the marijuana was low grade nug/high mids. All I remember of the beginning was it was my first time using a bong, so I needed help getting it working. I sucked as hard as possible for as long as possible to get as much smoke in the bong as possible. I then pulled the choke and sucked in a huge glob of smoke, it didn't feel like much since it was cooled. But when I exhaled I shot out more smoke than I had ever seen anyone exhale. 

The next part of it was weird, it was almost as if I suddenly woke up. Almost as if 15 minutes of my day was just erased from my consciousness, but I could mildly remember what had happened during that time. I had taken two more hits from the bong in that fifteen minutes. 

The sensation was unfamiliar at first, but extremely noticeable. Everything was extremely detailed, as if the world had turned HD. The world around seemed to have slowed down, and was almost having trouble keeping up with my head movements. The world around seemed to have slowed down, and was almost having trouble keeping up with my head movements. I felt like the world was a separate entity. I really wasn't aware of what was going on around me, and I always felt as if I was 'coming to', and forgot where I was.

I felt somewhat unbalanced and was being pulled towards one direction. People were talking but no words were being processed, and I really couldn't say much besides 'I am really high.' I could hear my heartbeat as if it was a drum playing in my ear, my actions seemed to coincide with the rhythm of my heartbeat. I also had a mild headache.

This feeling seemed to last around two hours, and rapidly weakened after that. The feeling afterwards was strange as well. The night seemed like a blur in my memory. 

Since then I have been high about thirty times and I would say none but one matched the intensity of the first, but all felt like mild versions of it. But I have to say, after doing it it made me wonder what the big deal about it is. I have been drunk and it is much more manageable and controllable than alcohol.

My First Experience

I was sitting in a park, at a spring celebration known for its subversive tendencies by those who care to look deeper than the concession stands and may pole. It was mid-afternoon on an overcast spring day in the South, warm but not too hot yet.

I had had a busy morning at work (it was a Saturday but I work weekends), but had been looking forward to this outdoor excursion and an afternoon/evening of fun with my lover, so I was in good spirits. I may have been a tad dehydrated, but was enjoying the breeze and the general merriment of the crowd, including the drum circles and fun costumes.

My lover smokes regularly, and I had tried cookies and candies in the past when an old back injury was acting up, but this was my first time smoking. I hadn't planned to try cannabis that day, but he offered me the pipe, and I said yes. We were far into the park, and plenty of other people were smoking, so I wasn't worried about getting caught. First, I tried to take a hit but kept sucking ashes onto my tongue, and I don't think I managed to really ingest much of anything. 

I waited until the bowl was loaded again to try. I inhaled once on the pipe while my lover lit it, and then breathed in more air to try to get the smoke into my lungs. I ended up having a coughing fit for the next few minutes, but he said that is normal.

At first, nothing happened. Some people were leaving already since the event had started at noon. We helped the person we were sitting with move his blanket and other belongings over across the hill to sit with some other friends. My lover and I were going to wander the park some more, but then I got dizzy. 

I had to sit down and close my eyes. Leaning against my lover with my eyes closed, I realized that I felt a little bit like I was floating on air. I felt a little bit like I was floating on air. (Standing on a hill but feeling as if I was floating is probably why I got dizzy.) Also, the music in the background started to sound louder and brighter. It was a little harder to concentrate on or understand the conversations happening around me.

When I could open my eyes again and not feel dizzy, it felt like I was in a 3-D movie. It still felt like someone had turned up the sound, and also like everything I was looking at was sharper and more three-dimensional than usual. We walked around the park, then realized we'd been sitting for longer than we thought by the time someone checked a watch. Perhaps time felt like it was passing more slowly than it really was?

The effects tapered off, but lingered in some form for a while. I felt as if I was talking loudly and more slowly than normal, though I'm not sure if it was just my perception. Within a few hours I was feeling back to normal, and well before we left the park at dusk.

I had been refraining from cannabis for more than a decade. I smoked some in college but had moved on when I entered the workforce, and had children. Over the past few years I had expressed an interest in trying it again, purely recreationally.

I visited a local meet-up of cannabis friendly and like minded persons and obtained a selection of edible treats baked with cannabutter. I had never experienced edible marijuana products before. I did not take them at the meet up, instead decided to wait for a more appropriate time and venue. Several weeks later my curiosity got the better of me and I prepared one morning to try it out. 

After a casual morning around the house and an average breakfast (cereal, milk, and fruit) I ate a 2-inch-square chocolate-flavored cupcake. I ate a 2-inch-square chocolate-flavored cupcake. About 30 minutes after ingesting the cupcake, I was browsing the web, and came upon the erowid website, I read with interest the L.E.S.S. method article for determining potency of edible marijuana. I was mildly concerned by the article that I had just eaten the whole cupcake without being a bit more cautious about the quantity I was ingesting. I wasn't feeling anything yet, and proceeded about my day. 

Two hours passed and I was convinced that I had been sold some bogus edibles. No sensations or euphoria whatsoever. However about three hours after ingesting the cupcake I started noticing a little something, a tingling of the senses particularly in the extremities, I wondered if this was the beginning of something, over the next half hour the sensations grew more intense, interestingly especially in my genitalia, a pretty strong tingling sensation. By this point I realized that I was once again, high. It was a pretty euphoric feeling, I moved about the house still doing little tasks and enjoying the overall bliss of each moment. It was a pretty euphoric feeling, I moved about the house still doing little tasks and enjoying the overall bliss of each moment. Occasionally I would have a bit of confusion, similar to the situation where you walk into a room and can't remember why you went in there. I caught myself in this situation several times and found it so hilarious I would laugh out loud. I listened to some music, I found the sounds to be heightened, as if I could hear parts of the mix I had not heard before or was insensitive enough before to not hear them. 

As the day progressed the high got more and more intense. At a point I started to worry that this wasn't going to quit. I was really out of it, about 4-5 hours after first experiencing the buzz it was powerfully intense, continuing to increase, and I was having difficulty controlling some motor functions, stumbling and fumbling with things as if I was drunk. I was very paranoid that I was going to get caught by someone. Or that I would end up having to call in sick to work the next day because it would not subside. I decided to lay down and see if it would go away, I also rationalized to myself that being in bed would reduce the likelihood that I would get busted by these unknown 'people that bust you if you are high'. Hours later I awoke, I had to go to the bathroom, but was still feeling the effects. I went back to sleep. 

The next morning I woke up feeling much better, a little dizzy, but certainly on the mend. I made it to work no problem. 

In hindsight, I wish, I wish I had read the Erowid article BEFORE I ate the whole cupcake! I have since experienced edibles in a more controlled and cautious way and have found them to be very pleasurable, relaxing, and manageable.

I am an experienced user.  I have been smoking for a good four years now with realatively no problems.  Weed is not a new substance to me and generally is a very euphoric and healing experience. This is actually the second time I have experienced such negative effects of Cannabis, but many factors went into this particular trip.

I was over at my friend Matt's for the first time.  We decided we were just going to watch some television and hang out.  It was a peaceful atmosphere with extremely good vibes. He has a few kittens and a very cute dog. I was in the perfect mindset for a nice sesh.  He looks at me and asks if I would like to try out his new bong.  I have a crush on the kid, so why not? I usually smoke out of a small bubbler or vaporizer...but I felt as though I could handle this piece.

Matt packs a small bowl. I looked at what he was packing and realized it was ALL shake. In my mind I was still assuming I could handle it.  He passes me the bong and the lighter and I REALLY light this baby up..for a good four to five seconds.  It's nice and milky and I'm so excited to take this hit. It's nice and milky and I'm so excited to take this hit. I unplug it and breathe it all in.....thats when the trip started almost instantly.

As soon as I am done breathing it in...I start coughing uncontrollably.  I feel as though I am coughing up a lung. I can't stop no matter how hard I try. I ask Matt for some water and can't even swallow it. I open my eyes and everything around me is pixelated.  A million bouncing squares in the dimly lit room.  Everything around me is in slow motion.  My senses are so heightened that the sound of the T.V made me want to tear my ears off.

I start getting very afraid.  I grabbed onto matt and blabbed something that didn't make any sense.  I decided in my mind that hiding would be the best idea. I curled up into a fetal position and lay on his lap. As soon as I closed my eyes I lost complete control.

I saw the oval shape of my eye in black.  All of a sudden I could not control ANY thoughts I had or any movement. My mind went into a universe of color and sound I didn't know existed. I tried to look at my arm, but instead of my arm I saw these colors of yellows, greens and reds in little strands take the place of my arm. After that it switched over to me seeing the word 'SOMETHING' and the letters slowly leaving the word and turning into different shapes and bright colors.  It felt as if I was speeding through a new and alternate universe.  I tried to open my eyes, but my visions wouldn't allow me.  I felt as if I had a new destiny and this was what the rest of my life was going to feel like. I WANTED to die.

Flash again.  I decided to leave the fetal position.  I'm still extremely confused about the state I am in.  I look at matt and he is still pixelated.  I am feeling extremely nauseous still, but regained my ability to control some of my bodily functions.

I saw the brightness of the T.V and felt as though that might snap me out of my horrible consciousness.  Matt got up and followed me.  I started walking in circles. I thought I was now a ghost of my former self now floating.  I was convinced I had died.  He had a big love seat in front of this huge TV so I figured I should be able to rest better on top of it.  I lay down in my fetal position again and started stroking the love seat. I felt its softness and it helped me realize I would be back on 'normal' earth as soon as this trip was over.  The TV made me even more nauseous. The TV made me even more nauseous. 

I decided I would walk into the bathroom. As I was walking I could not specify which room was what. Luckily Matt held my hand and led me to the bathroom. I started throwing up violently. I flushed the toilet and was amazed at what I saw. As disgusting as it sounds, the toilet water looked like a million crystals. I smiled to myself thinking that beautiful water fairies must have a secret heaven and palace in that disgusting toilet bowl. After a few more times of throwing up... the twitching really set it.

I felt like I had no control over any of my ligaments. My toes, fingers, arms...everything just felt like it was twitching out of control.  I thought that's how a seizure must feel. I got into a fetal position again and let the twitching run its course.  My heart was beating out of my chest.  My dry mouth was so bad I couldn't stop swallowing.  I thought I was destined to choke to death.

At this point Matt somehow gets me into his room. I can't even lift my head or I feel as if I'm going to puke all over again.  I opt to sleep on the floor.  He turned out all of the lights thinking it would help. The visions came back after he turned out the lights. They were not as harsh, it was more as if I was in a spiraling universe in space.  Thank god I somehow made it onto the bed and fell asleep. Escaping the internal hell I smoked myself into.

I woke up the next morning next to Matt feeling quite happy.  I still felt like I was going to throw up and I couldn't watch TV.  The smell of weed still makes me nauseous.  I think if I ever do smoke again, it won't be with my friend's crappy shake of death.  I have a new appreciation of being able to control my thoughts, feelings and movements.  It was a great wake-up call and definitely scared the shit out of me. As they say, be careful what you smoke.

Earlier in my prime as a pot smoker, there was one night in particular that no matter how much weed I'll smoke, I won't forget.

It was around christmas time and I was at a friends birthday party. A buddy of mine had brought over some mildly potent marijuana, and we proceeded to smoke a decent 3-4 grams of it in the form of joints, while we used an old dragon-shaped pipe for the roaches. I have a somewhat high tolerance to weed, so I experienced nothing more than a respectable high after approximately 10 minutes after inhalation.

We proceeded to chill in my friends basement when we had decided to watch a show called, 'Scariest Places on Earth'. This show which I had seen while not under the influence and was really a joke when it came down to being scary, had happened to trigger some sort of fear. First the fear started out as an idea that there were ghosts watching me at that very moment. I started to become paranoid about the supernatural, fearing I would die soon, to one day haunt the living for all of eternity. I had quickly dismissed it as a stupid idea, and I had decided to strike up a conversation with a friend of mine who had extremely low self esteem. As the conversation proceeded, I found myself analyzing her as a human being, and her lifestyle. Quickly another fear had come over me, this time being the realization that millions of people were dying of starvation in third world countries. The more I thought about it, I realized that the girl I was speaking with was facing similar mental struggles as a starving child would confront. Her parents weren't providing for her, and she was leading a life of unhappiness and emotional and physical abuse. She herself was forced to used heavy drugs for her own escape from reality. The more I thought about it, the more I reflected upon myself. I looked around to realize that many of the people who I was with were in their right state of mind, which made me question why I was doing what I was doing. I started to hate myself and my environment. At that moment another friend had arrived, and I told him that I was having a bad trip. He assured me that it wasn't possible with herb, and that I was only doing it to myself. It slowly but surely subsided, and I enjoyed the rest of my night still thinking in the back of my head that what I was doing was wrong.

Since then I have become much more experienced with marijuana, and continue to use it to this day. That night was my only real encounter with a terrible uneasiness, and even though for an instant weed had turned its back on me, it still remains as a sure method for me to enjoy myself, despite my surroundings.

I was never really one for weed. I'd smoked it a couple times in high school and maybe I romanticized it too much in my head, because it never quite lived up to my expectations. I was not a fan of the taste, and I didn't find the effects to be worth it, so after a handful of times I never tried it again. Until last night.

I found myself in what I could only describe as a transitional period in my life. My boyfriend and I new we were meant to be together for life. But we'd been fighting a lot more than we used to. I'd just quit my job, coming to the realization that I'd grown stagnant. That, along with it being the end of February, and being somewhat affected by seasonal depression my whole life, put me in a very difficult mindset. I'd begun to feel like I didn't want to do anything. Like there was nothing TO DO in life. I knew it wasn't true, it was just depression, and I'd had experience dealing with this sort of thing in the past with LSD. Yesterday however, I didn't have LSD nor did I know where to easily get it. I'd moved last summer and working 50 or more hours a week didn't exactly help me make friends. 

But my boyfriend was a pretty regular pot user, nothing crazy but very experienced. Still smart and successful with a good job. He knew I was depressed and bored and had 'clutter' in my brain. So he suggested maybe I take a couple 'candies' and it would help me relax and sort through everything in my head. And boy, did it ever. 

6pm I'd taken one a while and felt no effect whatsoever. I wanted this to work, so I grabbed a whole pack of maybe 5 or 6 little hard candies and ate them all.

6:30 I texted my boyfriend that I'd taken a couple and because he knew I wasn't a heavy user, he called to check on me. I told him I felt nothing. He said usually 2 or 3 would do it for him and if he finished a pack, he would be asleep. I figured if the worst that happened was I fell asleep, it didn't hurt to take a few more.

7:00 I grabbed another pack. This one was open and had 3 left so I finished it up. I wasn't expecting immediate results, but I expected something by now. 

7:30 I began to feel very tired. Not just tired like I was going to sleep, but tired like I'd just been given a large dose of a sedative. The room was slowly spinning and I tried to keep my eyes open but it was so difficult. I wanted to lay in bed but was too tired to get off the couch.

7:35 I woke up in bed without knowing how I got there. I felt like I'd slept for hours but it had only been a few minutes. Again I wanted to sleep, but I had a fear that if I did I'd never wake up. I suddenly became aware that our apartment was a little messy and it bothered me. I was going to clean, but I was very unsteady and suddenly very forgetful. I walked into the kitchen and immediately forgot why I was there. I decided not to clean, worrying that I would hurt myself. So I went back to the bed. Again, minutes felt like a long time. 

7:45 I'd woke up several times without remembering falling asleep. I didn't think I could fight it anymore. I resigned myself to the fact I was going to fall asleep, and maybe or maybe not wake up. I set an alarm for 45 minutes. My boyfriend wouldn't be home yet for another hour and a half and I desperately wanted this to end before he got home. I got up and went to the bathroom. It felt like I was in there for an hour. I kept forgetting what I was doing as I was doing it. I came out expecting it to be 10 but it was only 7:58.

8:00 I laid in bed but this time I wasn't sleeping. Or I couldn't tell. My eyes were closed but I thought I was awake, yet I was dreaming. My eyes were closed but I thought I was awake, yet I was dreaming. My boyfriend was sitting on the bed and we were talking. I told him 'I'm sorry, but I don't know you, or I don't remember you, so I can't love you. Don't be sad, I don't dislike you, I just don't love you.' This went on for a while. Periodically I would realize he wasn't there, I wasn't speaking at all, this was all in my head. It scared me a little, but I had an overwhelming sense of calm. I didn't FEEL okay, but I knew that I was. Everything felt dream like. I heard music that I knew wasn't real. Everything seemed very bright, and yet I could hardly see. I laid there crying. Not sobbing, not feeling sad about anything, just tears constantly streaming from my eyes. It seemed to go on and on. We were having deep conversations. I was riding a bicycle. My heart was pounding, I could hear it in my ears. I could feel it in my chest and every so often it felt like it was about to burst out of my chest. Am I having a heart attack? No. Everything was going to be fine. Everything felt very familiar, like I'd been through it before, a long time ago. I already knew the ending. It was reminiscent of an acid trip, yet different. 

8:30 My alarm did wake me up. I was safe. I slipped back into my previous state.

9:00 My boyfriend told me he was leaving work. I got very scared. Not for me but for him. I didn't want him to see me like this. I didn't know why but I had an overwhelming concern for him. I loved him with all my heart and I would do anything for him. Our fighting was my fault. Little things didn't matter anymore as long as we were together. 

9:20 I feel like I've been waiting for him for an eternity. I call him and he says he decided to stay somewhere else that night. Because I was so fucked up and we'd been fighting, maybe we just needed time apart. I couldn't stand the thought. I pleaded with him to come home. I didn't even want to be near him, I just wanted to know that he was in the other room. Finally he did come home. He was upset and didn't want to believe I hadn't taken anything besides the weed. He says we had an argument after that, but for better or worse I don't remember it. I fell into a semi-sleep. I was extremely tired and sedated but I never felt truly asleep.

8:30am I woke up not feeling rested at all. My mouth was dry and sticky. I felt hung over. How could just weed do all this? I felt hung over. How could just weed do all this? Part of it was, I'm sure, because I ate it instead of smoking. I also think my emotional state played a huge role. Much like on acid, I felt a clash between my soul, who I truly am, and all the outside influences including my own mind. Negative thoughts tried to get in my way, things I'd been suppressing could no longer be suppressed. I feel like my mind cleansed and reorganized itself. I realized I'd been dwelling on trivial nonsense instead of seeing the whole world, my whole life. 

I don't feel that the process is complete. I think it will take time, but I don't need to trip again. I feel childlike, as if the influences of society have been stripped away.

 I wouldn't call the experience fun. Not in the least. But it was amazing and necessary. Mentally I feel much clearer.   I feel like even at its worst, life is okay. It will always be okay.

I bought these high CBD flowers from a vape shop as I gave up smoking regular cannabis a year ago after 14 years of smoking 3grams of top shelf weed from waking up to going to bed everyday. My body one day decided anough is anough and THC made me anxious paranoid and made me feel I was having a stroke or a heart attack every time I smoked. 

From my hard use of cannabis (THC) products for a prolonged period of time I have developed anxiety and panic attack syndrome as a result of this I done some research into CBD as I have heard it is good for anxiety and I do miss the flavour and practise of smoking regular cannabis. Here is my trip report from CBD cannabidiol flower. 

16.00 I just got home from work after a 10 hour shift and decided to roll up a 3 skin of orange bud CBD. I rolled it with tobacco and grinded up roughly a gram and put it all in the joint. I smoked CBD the day previous but with no negative effects so I thought I would pack the joint out heavly just for the flavour. I smoked it in roughly 5 to 10 mins as the bud was dry so the burn time wasnt that good. After the joint I felt very relaxed and had a small sense of well being. I wasnt expecting any other effects as CBD I have read is 100percent non psychoactive. 

16.45 I was laying on my bed watching tv and all of a sudden I felt a euphoric feeling in the pit of my stomach normally I would welcome this feeling if I were smoking THC rich bud but I felt slightly alarmed at the fact this stuff was actually legal in the uk and it was CBD so I shouldnt be feeling this what so eve.r I shot of the bed to look in the mirror to see if my eyes were red or pupils dilated but they werent. With my hands on the wall I felt my hands and feet tingle with a mild burning sensation and my palms dripping with sweat my heart started racing and I got a strange pins and needle effect through out my body with a burning sensation across my face. I started pacing around the room as I was afraid and not sure what was happening. My thoughts turned to nothing I felt detached from the world around me and my whole body was shaking uncontrollably. I felt detached from the world around me and my whole body was shaking uncontrollably. I thought something was seriously wrong which is when the panic set in. It went as quick as I came on so feeling relitivly normaI decided to take a shower. As I was shower the wave of euphoria kicked in again this time with a vengence. My left arm suddenly felt tingly and felt as is it was vibrating then started to go numb I tried clenching my left fist and bending my arm and there was a weakness there. My heart started racing  and I started to get very light headed and dizzy panic set in again as I thought I was having a heart attack. I shot out the shower soaking wet and started pacing around the room worried and afraid of what I had done to myself and that I was going to die. 

I sat on the edge of the bed for a while watching tv trying to take my mind off the way I was feeling like before it subsided. And I felt ok so I decide to get back in the shower as I had cut it short beforehand. I got out the shower and once again It kicked in again. I knew by now that it was coming on in waves and that I had to ride it out no matter what but things got worse and worse. As time went on my left leg started feeling weak and numb as well as my left arm. I then thought I was having a stroke so I got my shit together and went downstairs to where my partner and her mum were sitting and told them what I had done and that I thought something had seriously gone wrong. But even by telling them I still felt distant and anxious and that I was going to die so I was told to sit with them while it wore off but it didnt. The effect got stronger I felt that I was being pulled through the sofa and that I had no legs as I could not feel them touching the floor. My left arm started again as with my heart. 

This is now 3 hours after smoking the CBD-rich flower. With all these feelings I asked them to phone for an ambulance as I was in fear of my life. They arrived and according to all my checks I was fine apart from there being weakness in my left arm which they couldnt understand. After they left and I started coming back to earth I felt drained tired and relieved that I survived this trip. 

CBD is to be respected even if it is legal and is supposedly not psychoactive I smoked too much in too little time and I felt that I nearly paid the consequences from this experience. Its true you can have too much of a good thing I'm not so sure that it was only CBD on these flowers as the high felt psychoactive very much so but without lab testing I would never know.

I'd gotten a gram of some good trees from a friend. Lemon Haze, he'd called them. Sure smelt like it. This is an account of the two trips, on consecutive days, that I had while smoking these. The trees themselves came in an almost compressed form, although still as green as they should be. They had the "green with hints of brown" colouring typical of the strain.

Viima - Icy Wind

I waited a while after getting the stuff, intending to smoke it at Christmas while catching a certain stream I'd been waiting for. Sure enough, the stream came around. I carefully cut about half of the gram away. I'd smoked small parts of it earlier, one part scattered in a small "pinner" joint and one part in the pipe to prevent nausea from alcohol, but I still had most of the gram left.

The effects were immediate, as trees usually are. I felt a strong bodily high this time, though. Everything was buzzing, and I could track every small movement of my body. Everything was buzzing, and I could track every small movement of my body. My face felt like a strong icy wind was blowing, it felt numb and at the same time oversensitive, it was all I could focus on. My dark room felt out of focus. I never thought to watch the stream, I was too caught up in the trip. At one point, I had to fart, but the feeling was strengthened. I could have sworn I had shit myself, but in actuality there was nothing but gas. The trees amplified everything I felt, even the worse things.

At some point I went to bed and simply lay there, listening to the stream's music for a hour? Two hours? Three? I couldn't tell. They were strong trees. Eventually I awoke from the dreamworld, looked at the clock and realised it was 05:42, and went to bed shortly afterwards.

The hangover the day after was what I might term a grey reaction - I couldn't get the thought out of my head that I had wasted the trees somehow.

Paljo on Koskessa Kiviä - The Rapids Have Many Rocks

The next night I smoked up again, determined to get something better out of the next half gram. This was a bigger piece than I had smoked the last time, the remains of my stash. I had high hopes. I smoked up as before, and suddenly I felt the icy wind again.

It was all I could do to concentrate enough to say something in the chat I had open, so I closed it and again tried to watch the stream, but an all-consuming bodily high took all of my attention. I tried to relax, to get comfortable on my sheepskin rug, and I closed my eyes.

It was intense, the icy wind had turned into a raging river battering me back and forth. Yet I tried to keep my eyes closed, tried to see what the spirit of the trees had for me. I saw a circular gate and a path to it, made only of white light. On either side were many orbs of white light, and all around me were the stars. I passed through this gate and went onwards, to a green gate that was the same, but by this time the bodily high became too strong and suddenly, all motion stopped. A moment afterwards, the gate disappeared, and I was back to baseline, more or less.

I definitely intend to try to find that gate again, and see what's on the other side. Were I to make a conjecture, there will be more gates - likely blue, purple, gold, and past that only the spirit of the trees knows what. But whatever it is, I intend to find it and experience it.

Before I write my experience I would like to say that I am unsure if the E liquid was THC or some other substance like a synthetic cannaboid but having used the liquid since the high is remarkably similar to a standard Cannabis high.

My experience started in the college smoking area. At this point I had smoked weed around 5-6 times and had only just managed to understand how it effected me and to enjoy it. 

I was with friends smoking my vape waiting for a class in 5 minutes when a person from our course walks up and starts to talk with us. We knew this person frequently had THC in his vape and would come into class mostly stoned. I was told by my friends to try it so as any 16 year old does I agree wholeheartedly. I didnt prepare myself mentally I was in a smoking area filled with not only college students but multiple staff. I then took 5 large drags holding each breath in for 5-10 seconds. 

The onset was almost immediate as I hand back the vape and suddenly I feel the beggining of a high. My legs begin to tingle and I begin to feel like my body and mind was falling downwards. My friends notice immediately and begin to laugh at my discomfort but I held together for the few minutes before class. As we walked up towards class I realised I couldnt go in my eyes were bright red I could barely walk or talk comprehensively so I excuse myself to go to a toilet cubicle and sit down.

The high is getting ever stronger being around +0:05 since taking the substance. As I sit on the toilet I go to grab my bag to get some water but my vision begins to go slowly black around the edges and I remember thinking of the name of the girl I loved before suddenly there was nothing.

Trying to remember what happened was hard but the best description was that I felt nothing but the intense tingles I felt earlier. That was my everything, and a bright ball of millions of colours I couldnt understand or comprehend or even remember now. I felt nothing but the intense tingles I felt earlier. That was my everything, and a bright ball of millions of colours I couldnt understand or comprehend or even remember now. I forgot who I was what everything was all I was, was the colours and the feeling. It felt like forever in this form when suddenly the edges of the vision I had went yellow and I suddenly felt my body again gagging twice stopping myself somehow before throwing up. I sunk back into my nothingness but I started to understand things again. I had deep thought of what I was and eventually I started to wonder when I would return to life. Suddenly the person in the cubicle next to me flushed and my eyes opened I dropped my bag. I was still intensely high but not unconscious.

I check my phone and that entire experience I thought must have taken at least 15-20 minutes was in fact 2 minutes. I remained in the toilet for the next 20 mins completely stoned listening to music and calming down before leaving for class. I make my excuses and sit down trying not to giggle from my friends laughing at my obvious still high state. 

The comedown felt like it lasted all day. I didnt feel high I felt wrong like something had messed with my head and it wasnt mine anymore. Fortunately the next day I returned to normal.

Since then I have used this thc liquid extensively and look back at this experience as a lesson not to try new substances unless I am at home and in a good mindset.

I am an 18 year old, healthy and fit individual. I exercise 5-6 times a week, I'm a straight A student in school, and I have no family history of drug addiction, or any serious health matters for that fact. I am from a upper-middle class family and I live in a stereotypical suburban neighborhood. I am not prescribed to any drugs, and I like it that way. I have had no major traumas, physically or mentally, but I am extremely clumsy and consider myself lucky that I am not dead or severely maimed from some of the stupid shit I have almost done (I.e, putting an electric razor in a sink, sticking my hand in the garbage disposal, falling off of tall buildings, etc.)

I have been using alcohol and marijuana since I was 12. Not daily, but I'd say about 2-3 times a week over that 6 year span. More recently, I have started to smoke about 2-4 grams of marijuana a day. I consider myself an obsessive person, but I have a very strong will and I am positive I can resist addiction, and have tested that by abstaining from drugs for random and long periods of times. I have only had a handful of 'out of the norm' experiences when high, including hallucinations and extreme paranoia. I consider these to be 'out of the norm' because my surroundings where a direct effect on my high. I have experimented very briefly with other drugs such as xanex (alprazolam) and cocaine. 

Anyway, here is my story:

It was like any other day. Sunny, beautiful, around 70-80 degrees. I was with some of my closet friends and we decided to smoke before we went to work out (smart idea, right?). So we smoked as we always do: We picked up a Dutch Master (blunt) and rolled about 2-3 grams of what my friend described as 'purple haze'. I'm still not sure if the marijuana was bonified 'purple haze', but I have smoked many many many different types of marijuana from around the WORLD (yes, I've smoked local herb from different countries and almost every state in the union), so I feel like I am capable of handling anything in 2-3 gram doses. I have no reason to believe that it was laced with anything toxic, since we smoked more of the bud after I had my 'experience'. 

I had eaten little all day, and had drank more than enough water to be hydrated. So about 10 minutes after we were done with the blunt, we headed to the gym. Now, I am a FIRM believer that your high is directly related to your surroundings. From the minute I stepped in the gym I felt uncomfortable and out of place. On top of that,there were alot of people there I knew and felt uncomfortable being high around (old classmates, parents friends, ). 

20 minutes into it: I'm pretty high. Enjoying working out. I'm not REALLY working out, I'm just kinda rotating between the different upper body machines. My friends and I are much more interested in who can lift the most rather than getting a good workout. 

30 minutes into it: Still high. One of my friends dad was there at the gym, making the situation completely awkward and adding to my anxiety. By this point, I have come to accept that anxiety is sometimes a bi-product of getting high, so I'm trying to enjoy myself...

40 minutes: This is the last interval that I am normal. Still, kinda, high, I can feel that I'm coming down a bit.I remember being on a machine by myself, finishing, and then being alone. My friends had left me, and gone to the other side of the gym, innocently enough. I don't know if this triggered my experience or if it was the combination of working out and not eating, but what happened next was one of the most terrifying moments of my life. 

42 minutes: I can't see anything. I'm not exaggerating. I see shapes, I see lights, that's it. My stomach feels like it flips upside down. I feel the need to throw up. The bathroom is nearby, so I suck it up, and get there. I still can't see shit.I sit on the toilet to try and feel better, no luck. I try to make myself puke, nothing. I am rendered completely motionless on the bathroom floor.I can't move any part of my body without feeling extreme pain (note that I only briefly lifted weights, that was my only activity in the past 30 minutes and it was not intense).

52 minutes: I am in agony. I can describe it as feeling like I was dying. I drag myself out to a chair near a water fountain, take a drink and wait for my friends to find me. 

55 minutes: Static. I see spots of static first. Not TV static, but static like right before I'm going to pass out. I make a commitment to not passing out in the gym. I get an overwhelming feeling that I need to leave this place. 

60 minutes: Static is all I see. I hear a very high pitched sound, nothing I've ever heard before. My friends find me. I remember saying ' I am having an extremely terrifying moment, give me a second and let's go'. My friends get scared. They are perfectly normal and, by this time, moderately sober. 

70 minutes: Nothing is better. I am in the most pain I've ever been in, and I've been through some painful stuff (voluntarily branding myself,amazing horrible drunk moments, being stabbed, etc.). The weirdest thing about this: I can control myself perfectly normal. I can talk, walk and interact with people. My friends convince me to leave. Getting down the stairs and to where I need to go takes concentration, but it is relatively easy. I have pretty good motor skills and I even am able to give the gym attendant a smile when she takes my towel. 

75 minutes: Outside. Perfectly fine. My stomach aches a little, but my vision is perfect and I have no static vision or high pitched noises. We leave the gym and spark another blunt. 

Conclusion: I believe this was a completely mental episode. Even though I felt physical pain, it stopped the moment I left the gym, where I had felt uncomfortable in the first place. I'm also open to the possibility that my endorphins released from working out might have clashed with the chemicals in the marijuana we smoked right before we got in there. Either way, this was the most terrifying experience I've ever had, and it goes to show that I never know what I'm getting into. Marijuana is considered harmless (especially by me) but sometimes, in the right conditions, it can really throw me for a loop.

My secret is that I don't particularly like cannabis. Part of that is disdain for the puerile pot culture, but mostly it's just that I have a very high natural tolerance to THC. When I used it previously, the effect was mild-to-nonexistent, and what I did feel was more confusing than pleasant. Nevertheless, I have had some interest in oral THC, widely reputed to have psychedelic-like effects. I just wasn't curious enough to actually try to find any cannabis and test it out.

Then, suddenly, a big bag of weed landed in my lap. One of my new coworkers was experimenting with cannabis cultivation and accidentally grew a huge plant and offered me some of the harvest. Of course I said yes. The timing was actually perfect - the personal problems I mentioned in some of my other trip reports never quite went away, and I found myself in need of a good trip to gain some perspective. I assumed that I'd get about a dime bag's worth, so imagine my surprise when (after the world whitest hand-to-hand with another coworker) I found myself in possession of a half-ounce. Oh my.

My ability to cook here is limited, so I settled on green dragon - an ethanol-based THC tincture - as the best way to experience it. Green dragon takes a long time to reach full potency, so in the interim I experimented with the rest of my stash.

-Smoking: I have no clue where to buy papers here, but a local convenient shop sells small cigars so I tried my hand at blunt rolling, succeeding on my second attempt. The smoke from the blunt was harsh and it had very little effect by itself. Smoking a bit with a few beers created an effect that was subjectively different and better than the alcohol alone.

-Edibles: I used Oreos to make very crude edibles - three of them, which I ate at 90-minute intervals. This confirmed two things: THC does indeed have psychedelic-like effects, and those effects at the high end are terrifying. There was a brief period in which I felt as if time had stopped and I wanted very badly for it to start moving again.

-Tea: THC is not known to be water-soluble but some other cannabinoids are, so I tried mixing a tiny amount (<0.5g) of ganja in with my usual green tea, choosing a mild local strain that can withstand steeping for a long time without becoming bitter. The resulting beverage was foul but it did the trick - an hour after consuming the first cup, I was ready for bed and slept very well. Too well, in fact - I was groggy for a solid hour after waking up.

Now as to the green dragon itself:

COMPONENT #1: THE CANNABIS - This is a black box, as I don't know the strain. I'm assuming that it's some kind of sativa strain with an average THC content (5-8%).

COMPONENT #2: THE ALCOHOL - I can't get Everclear, so the next best thing is a Chinese specialty called baijiu. It's foul stuff, but a lot of fun if it doesn't kill you. I used the strongest I could find (~52% ABV), which is a little low but strong enough to work.

PREPARATION: Three weeks of mixing and it's ready to go. Given what I'm working with, this is closer to an infused spirit than a true tincture, so I can drink a little bit more than normal. Based on previous experience, I'm somewhat arbitrarily assuming that this contains something like 150-250mcg/ml, so 20-30ml is a standard midrange dose.

SET AND SETTING: My apartment in central China, a cool Autumn weekday evening, my day off.

+0:00 - I pour out ~30ml of the green dragon, slam it down and - in the first of several dubious decisions of the evening - head out to take care of an errand. I've just realized that my cell phone service has been cut off, which (somehow) disconnects my home internet as well, so I have to find an unsecured hot spot to send a few messages. The plan is to get back to my apartment before the brew fully kicks in.

+0:10 - I'm already feeling something, and it's definitely not the alcohol. My headspace is definitely altered - no euphoria or confusion, just a bit of wooziness. This is pretty much what smoking cannabis does to me, and it's not particularly pleasant. My headspace is definitely altered - no euphoria or confusion, just a bit of wooziness. This is pretty much what smoking cannabis does to me, and it's not particularly pleasant. 

+0:20 - Back in my apartment, having failed to fix my phone/internet. In the second dubious choice of the evening, I opt to pour out another ~15ml of the green dragon. I should mention that while many green dragon users report that it has an herbal flavor, the pungent taste of the baijiu is so strong that it overpowers whatever earthy taste it might have absorbed.

+0:30 - With little to do, I crack open a beer - a citrusy Belgian that I somehow found in a nearby convenience store - and put on some music.

+0:45 - I'm talking to myself a LOT right now. It's lonely here by myself and I'm feeling it in a big way. The first of the psychedelic-like effects - time dilation - is kicking in now. Every song I hear feels like it's been playing for some very long yet indistinct period of time. Inside my head, my thoughts are turning backward - I'm amazingly nostalgic, even for things that are only blurry memories now. It's not like I was a teenaged pothead or anything so this isn't some sensory trigger but an effect of the chemicals themselves.

+1:00 - I always handwrite trip journals, and the writing is always a bit skewed, but my handwriting looks flat-out different. Even through the THC fog, I can sense that I'm holding the pen differently, making swifter strokes that allow the letters to flow together. I guess it's so I can write faster - if I slow down, I might forget what I'm writing before I finish.

+1:15 - Somehow, I completely forgot that I bought snack cakes this evening. My short-term memory is vapor right now. I'm feeling a body load that's quickly ramping up in intensity.

+1:20 - With the effects peaking, I turn off the lights for an impromptu meditation/visualization setting. I hadn't planned on doing this since previous attempts were so disappointing, but the time is right for it.

I actually remember very little from this session. Overall, it was much closer to an episode with tryptamines (with their parallel lines of thought) than with lysergamides (with their immersive, spontaneous imagery). There are no visuals to speak of but tactile hallucinations are rampant. The feeling is like a fuzzy corona enveloping different parts of my body, but at other times I dissociate and can feel very little. Early on, I have a disconcerting feeling of motion that makes me nauseous, but I quickly regain control. For the rest of the session, I drift back through a line of nostalgic images which quickly swirl into an indistinct smudge of memory.

+2:25 - I finally manage to conjure enough willpower to stand up. I maintained enough rationality to remember a few things, which I write down in a manic flurry of activity that, in retrospect, makes little sense. I slug down a cup of lukewarm ganja tea that I forgot I was making and pop in 10mg of melatonin, hoping that I can get some sleep soon.

+2:45 - I kill the music and try to get some sleep. The psychedelic effects are gone; clearly I'm coming down, though as high as I got that might take a while. I do fall asleep, but awake a few times during the night, each time still feeling rather intoxicated. I don't fully shake off the effects until the following morning, some eleven hours after taking the first dose.

AFTERMATH - It's a good thing I don't have to work, because I am nonfunctional for most of the following day. I'm sleepwalking all day, robotically going through my usual weekend routine. While I don't feel sick, this is still the longest hangover of any kind I've ever experienced and I don't like it at all.

CONCLUSIONS - It's obvious that THC is not going to do the same job as classic psychedelics, despite some similarities in the effects. There are two problems. First, THC is unpredictable. I've since experimented with the green dragon a bit more, and the line between a good time and a scary time (or a good time and nothing) is one huge biological blur. Second, the experience is shallow. A dose of tryptamines can yield a rough experience, but there's a catharsis when the primary effects wear off; THC just makes me feel high.

I still have the green dragon, though, and I plan on using it, but in a much different way. Subsequently, I tried a much smaller dose (15-20ml) along with a few drinks and found that they mingled quite well - the alcohol buzz hits first, then neatly fades into the THC high, leaving no hangover since I only consumed a modest amount of each. This is, however, a recreational experience, which is a lot less interesting to me. It might also blend well with some of China's legal psychoactives (of which there are a surprising number), but that will have to wait for another time.

The first time I smoked Marijuanna was both an amazing and traumatic experience.  It started out great. I was laughing my head off and marvelling at the amazing effect pot has on increasing the appreciation of music.  It was like this for about 30 mins.  Then suddenly a sharp explosive pain erupted about an inch under my scalp around the right-back area of my head. Panic set in.  In this paranoid state I was positive that the weed had expanded my blood vessels so much that my brain was expanding in the right-back area of my head and soon my I would have a stroke or my head would explode.  It was like something was inside my head with a pick-axe trying to tunnel it's way out.  The extreme pain lasted for about 10 mins, but what happened after this is what really freaked me out.

For the next 3 hours it felt as though I could feel tainted blood (or something) moving through my brain to the different sections stampeding through brain materials and leaving them numb.  This was accompanied by a bleeding sensation coming from the place in the right-back part of my head where the original pain occurred.

The bleeding sensation was like streams of warm water being pipetted onto the right-back area and flowing down the side of my scalp in several directions.  It was a random bleeding and wasn't in synchronisation with my pulse so it might not have been blood, instead it might have been sinus fluid or something to do with my nervous system. This experience was september 2001.  It is now Jan 31 2002 and I still get the bleeding sensation to a lesser extent in the time between lying down and sleeping.  
I have had a CAT scan and been to multiple doctors but there doesn't seem to be any problems with my head.

I have smoke marijuana about 5 times since then and have never gone over 3 hits because of fear, until this afternoon.  I smoked 6 hits and got the terrible pain again.  I don't know whether it'll worsen the bleeding or not, I'll have to wait until I finally decide to try to sleep.

Some backround information; I'm 16 and have been smoking for over a year now. Mike and Josh were both a year older then me and have been smoking weed for longer. We've all done enough of it to be considered experienced smokers and have smoked together before.

On Halloween, I was planning on going to a friend's party, but I wanted to have some fun beforehand. After school that day, me and 2 friends (let's just call them Mike and Josh) came over to my house supplied with some lovely weed. While they packed our bowls, I rolled a few joints.

So we stationed ourselves on my bed next to the window, each with our own joint and bowl ready. I turned on a Mars Volta CD. Simutaneously, we lit up our joints and inhaled. 2 seconds later, all 3 of us were coughing like crazy. It was a while before any of us could speak and when we did, the words that came out were 'holy shit this stuff is fucking strong'. The weed was simply INSANE.

We sat and smoked our joints, giving the occasional shottie and such. After the joints were finished, we started on our bowls. I knew the second I picked up the pipe that I was already high. Still, I smoked the bowl. 

After the first bowl was done, we looked at each other. Without saying anything, we began packing another bowl. A silent language of the stoner, told in bloodshot eyes and stupid grins. When the 2nd round of bowls had been finished, we thought we were done. But then Mike saw that we still had weed left and said we had to finish it. So we all smoked another bowl each.

I was the highest I had ever been in my life at that point. I couldnt feel my face and my body was doing 10000 things at once. I looked down at my feet and saw them moving but I wasn't doing anything to them. It was like they walked automaticlly, even when I wasn't even though I KNEW that was impossible. I was so confused. And thirsty.

As I approached the staircase, I looked down and screamed. It seemed to wind around and around and go on forever even though it was only one flight of stairs. I was so scared and started to cry. I grabbed onto the railing and sat down on the floor and told my friends I couldn't go down those stairs.

It took Josh about 5 minuites to calm me down. He picked me up and carried me down the stairs while I clung on to his neck and shut my eyes.

Later we were in the kitchen and I was sitting on the counter playing with a spoon. I drank 2 bottles of water. We went out to the back porch and sat around a table smoking cigarettes for a while, talking and laughing about tons of diffrent things.

Some time afterwards, I don't remember, we had to leave to go to the party. It was about 5pm at the time. I went to my room to brush my hair and redo my makeup which was running down my cheeks. Josh came in just as I was done and leaned against the door, obviously stoned off his ass. He was talking but I couldn't see or hear him straight. I'm not sure how, but we ended up on my bed making out. We heard Mike's voice yelling at us to come so we left.

Somehow we got to a bus stop and found our way. This whole time was a big blur for me. I spent most of it closing my eyes and seeing strange images, thinking of crazy ideas for books and singing in my head.

At the party, there were tons of people there, most of which were my friends. Of course, I didn't know who was who. I was still as high as I had been back at my house smoking. I just lit a cigarette and sat on a couch listening to music. Then I passed out.

I woke up at 1am in a bed somewhere in some dark room. I panicked and looked around and saw Josh sleeping next to me. I woke him up and asked him what happened. He said that a friend had found me passed out and brought me up to a bedroom to sleep. He promised me we hadn't had sex or anything. The party was still going on downstairs. He called a cab to bring us home and after a short ride back to my house, I said goodbye to Josh and dragged myself into my room. 

Without changing or brushing my teeth or even taking my socks off, I collapsed into bed. 19 hours later, I woke up. My stomach was hurting because I hadn't eaten anything in about 2 days. I was dehydrated and immedietly brought myself to the kitchen and drank a liter of water. After I showered and got dressed I closed the curtains and drank tea till I felt better.

It was a crazy night and I still don't remember what happened that day. But I know I had fun and that's all that matters, right?

amazing first time.

My girlfriend had been harassing me for months to smoke mota with her, and on her birthday I acquiesced. I had tried it once before and I had not gotten high, but in fact had spent the rest of the night vomiting, so I was not too excited about this. 

First things first. 
Oh god, it burned. I had never even smoked a cigarette before, let alone cannabis. It reminded me of the time I had been hit in the chest with a soccer ball, and had the wind knocked out of me. I was desperate for water, a coke, anything, and for a moment even the swimming pool water looked good, thankfully my girlfriend stopped me before I gulped down pool water. 

For about 4-5 minutes, nothing happened. I started whining to my girlfriend that it wasn't working, and that's when it hit me. At first it felt like my hands and feet were asleep.

It was beautiful. As the high progressed and peaked (after about half an hour) I felt a beautiful peace come over me, a happiness with myself and my life I haven't had since I was a child. That feeling you get when you remember good things long since past, I felt as if I were back there, living in my beautiful memories again. 

One hour. Christmases, Halloweens, birthdays when you still got presents. Climbing trees and carnival rides. When you were happy with your body, your hair, the simple things that made up your world. Sounds became louder, I become obsessed with the noise my nails make as I scratch the bedsheet, and I waste at least twenty minutes just engrossed in the sounds I can make scratching various surfaces. 

Two hours. One of the strange things is how after a while, I become utterly convinced that my high has worn off, when it totally hasn't. 

Three hours. The high is starting to mellow into a sleepy feeling, like downing a few glasses of wine. My coordination is shot, and I stumble around, when I do get up and move. My girlfriend laughs at me, and accuses me of being a lightweight. At this point I would describe the feeling as being lost in my own skin, as if I am watching everything and everyone from a safe place where nobody can get to me.

Despite my complete lack of physical coordination, my mind feels as if it's sped up. Words come out of my mouth before I can think them, and my mind seems to be making up for my lack of reflexes and balance. I hear my girlfriend laughing about jokes that I do not remember thinking up, they just came from my mouth, and it disturbs me a little, but not so much that I want the feeling to end. I feel smart, beautiful, clever.

Four hours. With the best of the high past, I curl up in bed and fall asleep easily, knowing that in the morning, it will all be over and I will return to my everyday life. I don't really worry about it, however. Still drugged and sleepy, all I can think about is how good now feels, and how wonderful making love is when you're not worried about what your body looks like. My body feels heavy, and my mind wanders. I fall asleep as if I am sinking into warm, dark water.

Reflections after the fact. If this were a review on epinions or ebay, I would say A++ would do business again. But it isn't, and everyone's experience is obviously different. I will however, extol the virtues for ME, of the drug mota, cannabis, mary-jane. Whatever you want to call it. Nothing will ever match my first time, and in subsequent tries, I just fall asleep, which is disappointing. But that first time will always stick with me as one beautiful night by the pool.

Now that delta-9-thc is legal up to 1000mgs in California I decided to try the edible capsule that was filled with precisely 30mg of the plant, including some crystals from the bud.  I have prior experience with 4-Methylethcathinone when it was legal as well as experience with Kratom and alcohol.  I drank a bottle of delta-9-thc infused blanc wine, but that was only 20mgs and the effects were barely noticable... I am 6'3' and 300lbs so that may have contributed to my not feeling much of anything.

I was able to legally purchase the 30mg pills, which come 12-to-a-bottle at the end of a long work week and am ready to hopefully get to experience being stoned on this new edible.  I opened the childsafe bottle, took one pill out and downed with with a little diet dr.pepper on a stomach that last had a meal in it 6-hours ago.  I have read the stories of people eating edibles and getting frustrated with the effects not starting after 30-minutes and then eating another dose only to have the first dose hit a few minutes later and then find it's too strong.  I started the stopwatch immediately after downing the edible pill.

0h:00m:00s took the pill and  started typing this report
0:17:20 have typed all the above and still do not feel anything / am still at baseline

0:18:01 my terrier mutt started barking on the other side of my house, noticed the sound of his bark seems louder and clearer than normal.
0:19:30 had to standup and go see what the barking dummy was getting so excited over... Noticed legs feel just a tick heavier than normal but am absolutely clear headed.  Turn on the TV.  Nothing good on so turned it back off.
0:24:28 not sure, maybe feel head getting lighter or it's just the dog barking again.  Dog's bark definitely sounds like it's being broadcast in ultraclear high definition.
0:27:59 am maybe feeling like I'm slowing down but head is clear.

0:30:55 I am feeling the same frustration of not really feeling much of anything that others eating edibles report and the desire to take another pill is strong but I am going to wait until at least a full 60-mins have past. the desire to take another pill is strong but I am going to wait until at least a full 60-mins have past. 
0:32:58 heartburn feeling just started in my tummy, it feels about the same burn as eating a taco with tapatio hot sauce on it.
0:34:09 annoying heartburn feeling getting intenser and I have to go pee.
0:37:00 pain went away but am suddenly thirsty, got up to get water, legs still have that same heaviness sensation and noticed my forehead ever so slightly feels like it's getting thicker like when sinus pressure builds up but my nostrils are all-clear.
0:38:55 the thick / heavy sensations feel like a second layer was added to the weights.  Am hoping the edible is about to really hit.

0:40:08 false alarm, was just my getting an erection at the thought of feeling something I cannot control taking over to make me high.
0:41:10 I think I may be slowing down and might be getting closer to having the real effects of the edible start to take hold.
0:42:30 the desire to take another pill is intense, I think I feel something and want to feel more of it / want it to come up faster like when 4-MEC starts to hit.  But I am sticking to the rule and waiting for the full hour to come.
0:45:00 stood up to get more water and had the very mild sensation I might be wanting to throw-up a few minutes from now.  Body felt lighter this time but the thicker feeling on my forehead is increasing now.
0:47:15 just looked at the stopwatch hoping it was closer to being one hour than it actually is, I really really really want to take one more pill.
0:48:08 definitely am feeling slower all over, really like this feeling, legs feeling heavier again.
0:49:15 just got another erection thinking I might be starting to get high.

0:50:11 FINALLY DEFINITELY FEELING SOMETHING MORE THAN BASELINE SOBER.  Body and head are feeling heavy.  It is harder to type now, slowing down.
0:51:41 am worrying this is a plateau
0:52:40 feel lighter and faster, no longer feel slowed down
0:54:00 feeling like want to go to sleep
0:57:20 am feeling something but am worried the dose is not strong enough for me
0:59:05 forehead feels warm from the drug

1:00:00 I want to feel more this but more intensely and am going to take another pill soon if this continues for much longer
1:02:00 downed 30mg pill and hope this really hits makes me truly stoned.  This one smelled strongly of the weed inside
1:04:46 a new layer of slowness heavy sensation has hit.  Hope more of this comes
1:07:19 definitely feeling slower all over, head is tingly
1:08:48 want to lay down on my sofa, laying down now
1:12:00 laying on side feels like rested afterglow feeling from sex
1:23:00 feeling heavier all over now, hope to be stoned soon
1:36:00 really want to take 2 more pills, stone feeling wearing off
1:39:00 took two more 30mg pills
1:41:00 stone feeling coming back! Laying down now
2:11:00 very stone feeling now
2:19:00 new heavier feeling in forehead and stoned
2:44:00 very stoned and tingly
3:08:00 going to bed

15:12:00 just got up, feel dehydrated and have headache in my forehead.  The stoned sensation while sleeping was fantastic.

First Time Edible Gummy Report

I am a very occasional cannabis smoker (maybe twice a year) but have only have tried oral cannabis once before. That was a home-baked cookie back in the last century. I remember getting the giggles. Great fun but never had the chance to repeat the experience until now when a kind friend gave me a packet of gummies to experiment with. Otherwise my only previous experiences were with psychedelics: San Pedro earlier this year and my first introduction to LSD in the summer. 

The great advantage of 10 mg gummies is that you can precisely calibrate the dose. The setting was our house and garden over a series of warm summer evenings.

Id read a lot about starting doses for newbies and there is a startling lack of consensus. Depending what I read, a sensible initial dose is anything between 2.5 mg and 25 mg, so I began cautiously...

Day 1:   5mg (half a gummy) at 1.30 pm followed by another 5mg two hours later. Both sublingual. Result: nada. Nothing. If I really imagined then I guess there was a tiny trace of something. But basically no effect. So 10 mg did nothing which then got me worried that perhaps I dont have the right enzyme ...

Day 2: 15 mg at 4.30 pm topped up two hours later with another 5mg. So total 20 mg. Again sublingual. That did something. I do have the right enzyme :-) It took a bit over an hour to get any effect. It took a bit over an hour to get any effect. The first  sign of onset was a pleasant tingling on my scalp and face. Then a fairly rapid peak which lasted about two hours followed by a three or four hour come down and back to normal by midnight. Max 3 or 4/10 on the stoned scale. I was fully able to function, walk, talk etc but still definitely albeit lightly stoned. One notable feature was some slight LSD type visuals. Nothing hallucinatory but a definite visual element.  There was also a brief but intensely joyous feeling whilst listening to music. 

Day 3.  25 mg in one go at 2020 after a light meal. I didnt bother with sublingual but just sucked them like sweets (which they are). This dose hit the sweet spot. The onset was quicker. Within the hour. By soon after 9pm I felt the scalp and face prickle as before. Again the peak was about two hours but this time stronger - a definite 5/10 on the stoned-ness scale. I was still functional but it was more marginal. I could have maintained a conversation but it would have been a challenge. The most notable feature was significantly stronger visuals including tracers in the half light as I moved my hands, and pronounced faces in all clouds. Delightful. The come down took about three hours though I was still slightly stoned at 1 am (1/10). I then slept soundly and woke up with no hangover of any kind. The only adverse effect I could detect was a dry mouth during the peak of the experience which meant I had to sip water quite frequently. Otherwise I felt entirely well throughout. 

Overall a very positive experience which I plan to repeat when the conditions are right.  I might even consider 30mg next time though I suspect that might put me a bit too far up the scale.

For the most part my voyages on weed have been very favorable, I can recall only two intances out of hundreds and hundreds that resulted in a bad trip. I usually smoke free homegrown from my friend which is not to bad, however sometimes I find myself other varieties. I am very curious as to what triggered both of these experiences, I think it may have something to do with the quality of the grass. I usually prefer weed with somewhat of a citrus aroma,I find that these types usually give me an up-beat high. On  both the bad occasions I can recall the weed smelling not just spicy, but somewhat sweet like honey. From now on I will never again smoke weed with that particular aroma.

My smoking buddy and I went to A house I was sitting, flipped on the TV, and immediatly started taking hits off of a fairly large blunt. I can remember waiting abnormaly long for the buzz to kick in, but when it hit I immediatly knew it was'nt going to be a good one. My heart rate escalated and my knees began to feel week. It came on so fast and I knew it was only begining. My thought began to race and I decide get a drink of water and try to eat something, but on the way to the kitchen (which was about 20') I felt another wave of panic and disorientation and collapsed. I was definitly caught off gaurd.

I spent the next 45 minutes or so on the floor with my mind racing at speeds that scared the absolute shit out of me. My head was like drum to my heart beat and it felt like somewhat was cooking breakfast in the back of my head. It was like a flood gate for all of my bad emotions and thoughts had been unleashed and I was drowning in them. My friend was kind of worried and told me to move and get my mind out of deep thought. I remember his words and I tried to follow them, and it started to help. It was'nt long though before the trip doubled in intensity. At least it felt that way. Everything was spining out of control and I felt more depressed than I had ever felt in my life. Then I noticed poping sounds in the back of my head at the base of my neck. I laid there and tried to figure out if I they were real 'pops' or somthing the weed was making me imagine. 'What if they were brain cells I thought? Am I going to die? Oh Fuck! Fuck!' I could definitely feel and hear them but what really got me was that they were to a musical pattern. My friend tried to tell me that this was rediculas but I could no longer communicate with him after this point. 'I tried to mumble to him to tell my mom that I was sorry' and 'why? Do I have to be the first to die from a weed overdose?'. I do not remember much more except that I crawled under a pool table and rode out the rest of the storm. After that I felt totally tranquil and fine.

I was bodybuilding all summer so I hadn't smoked herb in roughly 3 months, then I started missing sweet mj. I went over to a good friend of mine's house, J. Well J informed me he had 3.5 grams of drank. I informed J that he wouldnt have it for long. 

Anyhow, we popped into his closet with another buddy of mine, E. We started smoking bowls, and having been sober for 3 months I was really happy and excited to be getting back into it. This was by far the most intense high I ever had off mj. Around the third bowl between the 3 of us I started laughing hysterically was barley able to get any words out. I was on my back I was laughing so hard, shouting out how I had found god in a plant and things like that. J and E decided I had had enough, I didn't agree.

After another bowl between the 3 of us something very very interesting which I had never experieced before and havnt experienced agian happened. I started melting into things, if my hand or any other part of my body hovered a couple of inches away from an object I would feel like I was melting into it. I tryed to demostrate my new found power on my friend J, and explained to him how if I touched him I would stop melting into him, and only if I hovered over his arm did I melt into it. He was just like Ok, were shutting you down. Then I noticed the walls were no longer made of plaster, but of spinning triangles, circles, and cubes. It was great. All of the sudden I was alone in the closet, the smoke had settled, and it felt like it was 10 degrees cooler. I was wondering where the hell J and E were, becuase they were just there a second ago. I walked out of the closet and saw J asleep on his bed and I have no idea where E was but I assume he was asleep downstairs. Once again, this is the only time I have ever passed out from smoking pot. I then just fell asleep on the other bed he had in his room and slept long and hard. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.

Psychedelic Visuals

With many drugs, I am a lightweight  when I ingest any drugs, I tend to consume a fraction of that which my male friends do. Cannabis is no exception  I will smoke a very small bowl (one that I would complete in half a breath) and that would be sufficient. The hazy feeling I experience when I smoke Cannabis averts me to smoking heavily in the presence of friends, as I tend to become socially paranoid. However, I did realize that this is a powerful drug  an especially psychedelic one, in spite of what some may claim  and it deserved to be treated with the same respect and analysis as other drugs Ive experimented with, like LSD and mushrooms. So, with this in mind, I decided to have a high-dose Cannabis trip in a safe, comfortable environment: my home at about 8pm, with just myself and my boyfriend.

My boyfriend, S, rolled me a joint containing about half a gram. He had his own to smoke. We left my house to take a walk around the neighbourhood while we smoked them. At about halfway through the walk, things shifted from hazy to surreal. It felt strange to move my legs; as if my strides were exceedingly short. My surroundings seemed somehow foreign. Eventually, I decided I was too high to continue smoking my joint to myself and I shared the last bit of mine. Upon arrival back at my house, I noticed that my sight seemed to be clearer: when I leaned in to kiss my boyfriend, I saw a sort of sharpening of detail, as with MDMA. In addition to this, colours seemed brighter and his eyes seemed to grow larger.

We sat down for dinner at this point  I was very grateful that I had prepared our meal before smoking, because I didnt feel capable enough to do much of anything. Lots of eating  as you might expect, I was quite hungry  and much laughter and silliness, as can be expected with weed. After this, we cleaned up my kitchen and went up to bed.

My ceiling in my room is textured, not smooth, and this served as an origin point for my most intense visuals. Lights on, lying on my back, my ceiling blossomed into a wave of shifting patterns, which grew quite intense at times. I would compare this to a low dose of psilocybin mushrooms. I also saw small pinpoints of bright, neon-coloured lights within the patterns. Upon turning my gaze to my walls and artwork on them, the patterns spread to there too, with similar intensity. In fact, things seemed to actually move slightly. With effort, I found that I could concentrate and make my visuals dissipate for a few moments. After about an hour of this and idle discussion, we eventually decided to sleep.

My reason for posting this is because I feel the very psychedelic qualities of Cannabis are often ignored. Since it seems to be such a commonplace drug, rarely do people treat it as what it truly is: a powerful intoxicant and psychedelic and capable of creating very interesting experiences.

I have tried to explain to my friends before what I went through and it is hard to put into words, so this doesnt do complete justice, but it is the best I can do.

I was up in Missoula Montana for thanksgiving at a friends house. It was an interesting trip. Nevertheless, one party at the house made it all the more interesting. People started smoking pot and on impulse, I figured I would try a bit of it. Thinking that I didnt want that much of a reaction, I only had a few hits off the bubbler. Afterwards I nearly hacked up a lung because of my sensitivity to smoke. Everyone else around me started to feel the effects while I didnt really feel anything. 

I didnt really know anyone at the party and being of the introverted type; I just sat in my chair and listened on. A few people asked me if I was feeling anything yet, and I replied I didnt notice a difference. Soon after that though I did, things just seemed off. I completely lost the will to talk. I replied to everyones sentences in my head. Thats when it got weird. I started to feel lingering physical sensations. If I were to poke part of my arm, I would feel like it would pulse where I pushed it several times. I was also had a hat on, which I could feel pulsing at a regular rate with all the other sensations I had. This kept intensifying. 

I said to a few people I wanted my music, so they got it for me. I put on my favorite song by Laika and began to listen. It sounded really different, I could still recognize it. However, different instruments were amplified. It was bizarre and very disorienting. When I closed my eyes, it felt like everything began to move in erratic directions, and I was getting very rapid visualizations in my head. I would randomly think of something, and I would zoom in on this and it would flow to the next thing with in seconds and just keep going. I was feeling anxious. 

When I stood up I felt really dizzy, but I knew this was all in my head and could still walk. I went to my room to lie on my bed away from everyone. As I lied there, the physical sensations got even stronger. It felt like everything was moving (mostly the stuff I was lying on and myself) in a semi circle motion at 4 cycles a second. I tried to ignore it but it would not go away. I was very out of it and just wanted to go to sleep at this point, switching to Boards of Canada to try to zone out enough to drift off didnt help. My mind kept drifting to many different images like those that I said earlier. Eventually I fell asleep although I dont remember, and I did not sleep well. 

The day after I reflected on it and realized I did not like what I experienced. However, weeks later I realized I did like it. I want to experience that again. It was so different, albeit disorienting. I will defiantly smoke again. People keep telling me though that Im hypersensitive though because all I had was two hits and it did this much. So Im hesitant to use a lot. I can only imagine what harder drugs would do to me.

Cannabis Contributes to Panic Attack

By my calculation, Ive been high on cannabis at least 10,500 times.

More than thirty years of getting high and knowing exactly what to expect from a few hits of average weed didnt make any difference on Friday, January 10th, 2003 when I felt like I going berserk or having a massive coronary.

To help set the stage, I need to tell you that on January 23rd, 2002, approximately one year earlier, I suffered a cardiac arrest. Fortunately I was in the ER at the time. I was there due to heart attack symptoms. I was on a gurney in the cardiac care center talking with an EMT and my wife while waiting for blood work results. All of a sudden, I felt very light headed, became disoriented and died. I was shock paddle zapped, chest pounded and CPRd back to life. Within three hours I was recuperating in the ICU with a stent in a heart artery.

Back to the present. 

Six days ago, an average Friday, around 5:30P, I took my two Jack Russell terriers out for the typical afternoon walk and to catch a quick buzz. I fire up freshly rolled J from stash of average Carolina Roadside and took a few (4-6) decent hits and headed back to the house. I popped open a beer and ask my wife what the evening agenda was. We decided to take a short ride to scout out Saturday yard sale locations.

About a mile from the house, I start getting disoriented. Like when I'm high and I kinda forget exactly what road I'm on, momentarily forget where I'm going and why. In my mind, I was thinking the effects were a little severe for the small amount of dope I had just smoked, and tried to remain cool.

After a couple left and right turns, I was totally disoriented. My heart was pounding like a jack hammer and I was beginning to wonder if I was having a heart attack. (Remember, I had a cardiac arrest almost exactly one year earlier  so I know what it feels like.) When I pulled over and asked my wife if she wouldnt mind driving (which I have never done before), it accelerated my fears and pulled her into the scenario. She asked if I was all right. I told her the pot was better than I expected and I was catching a major buzz. But inside, I was worried. Well, worried.. And scared shitless.

We switched out and she drove. Within five minutes we were home. I was flippin. It felt like a total freak out. For lack of better description, I told my wife I was buggin. And I was - severely. I struggled to get out of the car. As I made it towards the house, I could barely walk. My heart was thumping like a Maserati. I thought it might be a heart attack and it took all my wits not to pass out.

When we got into the house, I staggered into the shower. As hard as I tried, I couldnt get my shit together. It took all my mental skills and the experiences from decades of getting high (weed and booze), tripping and the occasional freak-out just to keep myself from passing out (or, as I though.dying).

Without drying my hair, I waddled into the kitchen, gray as a ghost and disclosed to my wife that I was bugging to the point of freaking out and that I thought I may be having a heart attack. I continued to nurse my beer and tried to chill out.

Oh, she was cooking dinner at the time  but my appetite had completely, absolutely vanished. Further evidence (or so I thought) that I was having a heart attack.

I went into my home office and took my blood pressure and pulse with a gadget left over from the episode a year earlier. Sitting still as can be, my heart rate (and it was already beginning to subside) was 127 BPM. Not too cool.

We both started to panic and evaluated the wisdom of calling a doctor or going to the emergency room. All this hysteria fed the problem.

We went online and started researching the correlation between cannabis use and panic attacks. Sure enough, it happens. There is plenty of documentation on the subject.

I began getting a grip and the symptoms began to wane.

The whole episode lasted 20-40 minutes.

I didnt get high on Saturday (scared to). 

By Sunday I was back on the weed and booze.

Like I said, I have freaked (on A) in the past. This panic attack was exactly like freaking. 

Once, about ten years ago I had a panic attack  under similar conditions. 

I guess its something to think about.

My experience happened in my sophomore year of high school. Since then I've smoked plenty of weed and never had even a similar experience. 

A friend of mine called 'A' and I wanted to get some weed for the weekend at her house. So I got my other friend 'S' to hook me up with just a bud which is all she had. 'A' and I didn't expect to get anything out of it so we didn't have our hopes up much. She had smoked plenty of times before, I however was a newbie. I had tried to smoke a couple times but only burned my throat or coughed like a rookie, but never felt any high. 

So that night we grabbed a pop can and fashioned a 'pipe'. She and I smoked about half of it and she was almost instantly messed up. I was pretty disappointed thinking I was immune or something. I distinctly remember her getting up off the bed and watching her stumble out the door mumbling about getting an apple. Next thing I remember was standing behind her at the fridge smiling. When I came to realize that I couldn't remember how I got there I told 'A' that something odd was happening. She just laughed at me and proclaimed that I was 'in the void!'. 

For the next 30 minutes or so I kept going in and out with I guess I would call a blackout. But to me it felt more like overlapping time. I still can't remember the moments lost, but I vividly remember when I came to and freaked out to 'A'. She was giggly and enjoying peeling and eating her apple while I was shaking and discovering a blanket wrapped around me out of nowhere and sitting at the counter.

I kept insisting to 'A' that I didn't like what this shit was doing to me and how freaked I was. My heart was racing and I actually asked her to call my mother. She reminded me how horrible that would turn out and told me to chill out. eventually I stopped blacking out, relaxed, and felt the normal goofy high from smoking weed that I'm now familiar with. Since then I've wondered if it was laced with something but it probably wasn't since 'A' wasn't affected at all. Others also say that first time highs can be very strange and intense.

The whole weird, scary trip lasted about an hour but felt like 5 hours.

My most amazing high happened around the first times I did it.  My third time was the greatest.  I was going to a concert with my couzin.  On our way there we smoked some hits on the little hitter thingy.  I was a little buzzed.  

When we got there (4hours before the concert) it was raining, and we were second in line!  To pass the time we took turns smoking the bowl in the car.  I had brought my own weed (about 1 1/2 grams), which was supposed to be special cuz it was from canada ( I dont know, I was persuaded)           . 

When I got in the car and smoked my share, there was like nothing left.  I dont even remember how many hits I got.  I just kept them coming, cuz I wanted to get sooooo high.  

I remember my last hit, cuz it HURT.  I sucked in sooo much smoke. I started to cough really bad for about 10 minutes straight.  The worst part was, this is the point where my high started kicking in.  So everything was slow.  Every time I coughed. The pain was four times as long and noticably detailed.  It felt like someone was brushing my esophagus with a toothbrush made of knifes. I needed water quick! 

I needed water quick. Everytime I tried to say absolutley anything I would cough and my eyes got soooo watery it looked like I was baawling.  I was absolutley high as an airplane at this time. I was sitting still the whole time. Everytime I would slightly move, it was like I had just entered realitly again. And then wen I stopped moving, I was in a dream.

This is wen I started getting taken advantage of.  The couple that was with me (my cousins friends) in the car noticed I was extrmely high.  And they asked if I wanted to have a 3some with them, to see if since I was high I would have a different answer.  I said no, cuz I was thinking too much.

Then my cousin and her boyfriend came in the car and everyone else.  They all noticed I was high and kept asking me questions and laughing at me.  

My cousin said she was hungry.  And for some odd apparent reason I offered to go get her something from the coffee shop.  So here I am, high as a kite, not knowing wat is going on, a little girl walking the streets of chicago in the rain, about a block down the street (where I am out of site of my friends) getting some food.

So while I was walking I could feel my legs go sooo fast. I was a speedy walker.  Wen I crossed the street I hardly looked both ways. And finally made it to the shop.  After I picked out a brownie and this wierd cranberries crumble thing, I realized that while I was paying the cashier I had the umbrella over my head the whole time.  I just forgot to take it down wen I went in.  So it was too late.  I didnt even bother taking it down by this time.

Wen I got back I gave my cousin her food and then got back in line for the concert.  While I was waiting I couldnt tell if time was going by fast or slow.  I didnt say a word the whole time.  I just stared  in the same place the whole time.  But while I was waiting I was listening to this guy (who was clearly drunk) keep saying the same thing over and over again.  It was like 'your the greatest man' or something like that.  And it was getting annoying.  So I found myself bursting out 'shut up!' and he did.  Wow that was random from the girl who doesnt say anything. 

Finally it was time to go in.  I found myself getting pushed and I almost fell into this 1 foot puddle.  So we got in and I was checked.  My cousin told me to run to the front row.  And I ran. I felt so stupid. Cuz I didnt really know wut I was doing. And the guard yelled at me for running.  So I started walking awkwardly fast.  But I made it! My cousin and her friends were ever so proud! Lol

During the music of keller and umphrey's, I found myself dancing so blissfully.  My fore arms resting on the gate. My head waving back and forth in the air.  I couldnt stop my self.  For a while I had closed my eyes. And everything was just going on and I was just there and it was magical music flowing through my head.  I couldnt make myself stop dancing.  I noticed that even wen the songs were done I was still swaying.  It looked kind of wierd (I noticed after a wehile)

Finally wen the concert was over my cousin gave me 20 bucks to get a cd.  But she forgot to tell me where u get them!  So I am still fricking high at this time! And I'm walking around aimlessly asking random peolpe and guards where u get the cd's.  It was pointless, cuz I didnt understand wat any of them said so I just said ok thanks! And asked someone else.  Wen I actually got to the counter I didnt know wut to ask them for. Ii almost accidently bought a shirt.

But we got the cd. Drove home. Got some mcdees. I had a french fry.  And fell asleep int he car.  I got home finally.  But I REEKED!  I just told my dad that people were dropping their cigarettes on my jacket.  That was useless, because he later found out I smoked pot. And I continued to. The end

My main principle was to try hash cookies out, my girlfriend got a couple from the head chef at work. A reliable source, I tried half a cookie one night and felt nothing.. so I thought, while I was home alone at her house for the day, try a full one.
Note: This cookie had been in my drawer for 2 weeks.. so maybe some kind of fermentation could have played a part in this.

I ate it, sat online and chatted to some friends. 40 minutes later I was washed over with this intense awesome high. It was a standard, relaxing, super grinning experience. Everything was going to plan. My sense of gravity was heightened, so was my sense of touch. Pretty soon the relaxation begun to wave, eventually the waving became really intense.. and turned into an alternating Sober/dream.

This is when it got uncomfortable. I would sober up every 5 seconds not remembering what had just happened. It was like sleeping and waking continuously.. memory loss was a big factor. It would take me  half an hour just to type one message.

Then my senses began to change. This is when it got scary. The waving kinda stopped.. but my sense of touch began to delay. It was cool for a second, but the delay got longer and longer. Eventually it felt like I was stuck in a 'touch lock' where everything i touched.. the sensations stayed that way.

I freaked out and layed down on the ground. I remained calm.. my heart was racing.. I knew the best thing to do was to remain calm. The sense of touch-lock went away and was replaced with a very fast twirling. It was not the kind of sickly drunk twirl.. I couldn't feel it in my stomach, but it felt like my senses were spinning. I got up, put on some relaxing music and layed down and relaxed again. It worked for a while. I started going through cycles in my mind and body. My sense of touch first, then visuals, then sense of time.

The whole time I felt this cold wind pushing me down, my eyes were coming out of their socket too. I remember Badly Drawn Boy - River-sea-ocean came on, I was gliding on a rainbow in space.

Cold forehead and skin. It felt like my nose was bleeding, but it wasn't. I also felt rushing colours and other visuals I can't remember. I sketched some of them, but I have no recollection of actually drawing them.

1 hr later.
I panicked some more, the first hour of mental and physical fucking went on for  much longer than it felt.. so I took some procedures. I made myself puke, went to the toilet. Ate more food. Drank coffee. Nothing improved.

Time was going so slow, the clock lost its rhythm. Things were flickering and strobing, like slowing down a video with a low frame rate. I got panic attacks that I'd stay locked in time forever.

I begun getting visuals, memories, a thousand images that passed through in one blink. The images made no sense.. but somehow they were linked to me. It was like I was seeing myself in one second. Life flashing before my eyes. I watched myself over and over. that was terrifying.

2 hrs later
my girlfriend's dad had came home, I decided to tell him, and maybe get me an ambulance. He got me to lie down outside. He doesn't have a way with words.. but even his awkward 'You'll be ok' comforted me.. and that got me through the next half an hour.

I was sobering up, and some guests had come over, so I went to my girlfriend's room and lyed in bed. I swear I could hear them talking and shouting angrily about marijuana. Turns out they were laughing and didn't even know I was there, but it was the most odd thing.

I concluded that lying down outside was the best thing to do. Relaxation and reassurance was the only things that got me through the trip.

I came out of the trip with a real depression and shock. To feel like that really shook me up. Now I can't even listen to the Music that I had put on, I get depressed about the whole experience. 

Seeing as though I have had a history of a racing heart for no reason (happens every couple of months) I was most fearful of my heart beat most of the time.

It was the last day before April Vacation at my school and I was ready to do some celebrating.  At lunch that day I had gone out with a friend of mine and smoked a bowl between the two of us.  I chilled in school for the rest of the day no prob.  It was a friday and I was very excited to leave school.  

After school I went to a friends house, with a group of kids and naturally we decided to smoke.  Me and a couple other kids threw down for a huge bowl.  We made a waterfall bong (draining water out of a 2 liter bottle while lighting bowl on top, then taking bowl off and inhalling after water is drained completely).  Since, I threw down a decent amount I got first rip.  

Now I was a pretty avid smoker.  I didn't smoke too regularly, but taking a bong rip was nothing that I wasn't accustomed too.  Yet, I had never taken a waterfall bong rip before in my life.

We went outside to my friends back yard and we set everything up and lit the bowl.  The water in the bottle sank as a huge amount of smoke replaced it, pouring in seamlessly from the bowl.  By the time the water was finished draining the smoke within the two liter was GREEN.  Almost a pure coat of green.  My friends, who were in amazement, cautiosly handed the bottle to me.  And I uncovered the top and took a rip.

I only took one rip, one very large rip, and moments after exhaling I was overcome with a painful cough.  Like none I have ever had before.  My friends looked at me in amazement, then before thinking twice hit the bong.  I coughed for a while and I managed not to boot.

I felt pretty normal suprisingly, I was still a little high from the bowl I smoked at lunch, but other then that I felt nothing weird.   I passed on any other hits, and I decided to go inside to get a drink of water.  

As I got up and walked around I felt very weird.  It wasn't like being high, but more like being very shitfaced.  With every step I took this sensation got stronger and stronger, until things were spinning pretty well.  I couldn't drink the water, for the simple fact that by the time I filled a glass I wasn't able to.  I sat there just being really high for a while, then my friends came in and started eating.

Time passed and I sat at the table not knowing what was going on.  I knew my mom wanted me home for dinner, and for that reason I was feeling not too good, cause I was way to high to even think of going home.  I tried to communicate this to the others, but I wasn't really able to speak.  Soon they noticed how messed up I was and decided to go into the basement so I could lay on the couch.  

In the basement I was having trouble.  As I lay down, not able to move, the lights flashed infront of me, with trails of light coming off of them.  My eyes started to roll uncontrollably into the back of my head, and I heard my friends freak out when I started going into mini seizures.  I couldn't move, and all I could think in my mind, was that I hoped that my friends would be smart and call a hospital.  This wasn't gonna happen though.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

An hour passed and I was still in really bad shape.  I couldn't act stright even if I wanted to, so I couldn't go anywhere around other people.  Thus, they decided to just take me for a drive in one of my friends car.  I got the energy to get upstairs, then I preceded to vomit in the sink for a while.  Then, I remember going outside and watching my friends play hackey sack for a while.  Then, we got into the car and started to drive.

I could barely hold my head up anymore so I let it fall back against the top of the seat.  As I looked up at the ceiling, I saw waves across the browness of the ceiling.  I was shocked.  Then, I looked outside, and for a second everything seemed normal.  Soon though, I realized that everything was underwater, and trees were tying themselves in knots.

My friends still didn't know what to do with me, but they knew that they had to get me outta public.  But I had no house to go to.  So with their genius they decided to leave me behind the shed of the place where I smoked, so I could chill out, because his parents were home.  So relunctantly, I sat back there, not able to walk or talk I had little way out of it.  One kid stayed out there with me for a little while, but after 1/2 hour or so he saw it hopeless.  I wasn't coming down.  For the next few hours I sat there, drifting in and out of consciousness, and tripping my balls off.  At about 7 or 8 o'clock (I smoked at 3) I finally got the energy to get up and walk home.  

I got home and just passed out in my bed.  When I woke up the next morning, surprise, surprise, I was still high as a kite.  I had a trip to go on to NY with my temple, so I did that, spending the next few days in a haze.  Wow, I tweeked out.

This is by-far not my first experience on marijuana, but it is one of my fondest ones.

I was just getting ready to go to CCD (a catholic sunday school, except during the week) at about 4:30 right after school on a Wednesday.

I grabbed my bowl that I had packed the night before (I always pack it in advance when I want to smoke the next day really quickly and not have to go through the process of de-seeding the weed and packing it) and took about 4 fair sized hits.

I grabbed my books and was off to CCD.

When I got there (after a 10 minute ride) I still wasn't feeling anything, which is unusual for me because I usual feel the effects while exhaling my first hit. So, I went into the tiny little classroom and sat next to one of my friends, let's call her 'K.'
K isn't really first-hand experienced with pot (she never ACTUALLY smoked it herself) but her uncle uses it for medical reasons (out in Cali.) and she helps him pack his bowl and trim his pot plants whenever she goes over there. But, since her uncle was always high she immediantly knew I was once it started to hit.

Now, this wasn't the best quality bud, just some mids that I got because my friend didn't have any of the good stuff, and I was out myself. But, just as I sat down it started to hit me. K knew of this by my silly grin that spred across my face.

Usually when I smoke I smoke a little of the GOOD shit and I'm so totally wasted that I don't sit and giggle like I've heard about, so I thought that whole giggling bullshit was just something that only certain people experienced...but now, after more experiences with smoking less of the GOOD stuff and laughing more (instead of smoking more and being in such a HIGH state of euphoria that I can't move or anything) I believe that it depends on the type I smoke and how much of it.

Anyway, about 20 minutes into the class we all had to make a family tree to show our ancestry (I don't see why we did this, because we were all 14 years old and should be learning more about God than our family history, which I kept thinking while I was high) and all I managed to do was draw a line with my name on it. The class was really talkative today and the teacher was sort-of out of it, so we could all talk as we pleased.

I sat there and K said something to me that just seemed sort of funny and I started to giggle, which didn't stop. It just kept going and going and going, and slowly but surely the rest of the poeple sitting around me (besides K) realized I was high, but everyone around me smoked weed themselves, so it was no need for concern about someone narcing on me. At times I would try to muster up all the strength I had to stop laughing but that just ended with me turning red in the face and breaking out into even louder laughter. At times I would try to muster up all the strength I had to stop laughing but that just ended with me turning red in the face and breaking out into even louder laughter. 

K was just sitting there chuckling at how messed up I was at the time, and I was lauging at how funny her laughing sounded. Then I was laughing at how funny people's faces looked, then how weird my paper looked...everything was just so funny looking that I couldn't stand it.

After awhile I came back down right before we left and passed out once I got home.

Looking back it was very amusing and taught me how to laugh a lot while on weed. I may not have had the usual insight that I usually feel after lighting up, but it was just so damn fun.

 I am glad I finally got the experience the giggles after I tried smoking less instead of more - good things come in small packages.

Cannabis (1) : General (1), Glowing Experiences (4), School (35)




 




DOSE:
  
vaporized
Cannabis





BODY WEIGHT:
170 lb





Cannabis Experience:
Dose: .2-.3g Indica Cannabis 
Potentiators: Turmeric
Note: I have previously used today Turmeric, Ephedra Sinica, and Caffeine. 
Method of delivery: Vaporization

5:03 Just took one 10 second hit off the vaporizer about 1 minute ago. The effects havent kicked in yet. Am currently listening to music in my bed.
5:05 Colors in the room becoming more vibrant and unique, heart is beating faster (probably due to adrenaline)
5:06 Vision is going side to side and my peripheral vision is becoming less and less. Feeling a body tingling sensation and head is feeling squished. 
5:07 Eyes are feeling more bloodshot, nostrils are clearing and asthma is being relieved (bronchodilation). Im going to meditate.

5:09 Feeling a distinct buzzing in the eyes, nose and face. Sounds are becoming louder and clearer.
5:10 Feeling lighter, fuzzy, and muscle relaxation is setting in, I must also note I feel like Im leaning backward even when Im not I feel like Im leaning backward even when Im not at this stage.
5:11 The visual field is starting to flash and swirl, almost as if everything is slowing down. Feeling a detachment from the body that is getting heavier and heavier.
5:12 Feeling lighter and starting to have a body buzz, almost like a soft blanket is being rubbed against my skin.
5:14 Im feeling more relaxed, the music is feeling much more real my pain is fading away and I do feel happier (mood enhancement) 
5:15 Logical and scientific thinking is starting to become impaired, I want to think more deeply and less structured. 

5:16 I feel a sense of being connected with my subconscious, and that which my subconscious knows and understands are being brought to my mind and perception.
5:17 More lightness, eyes feel bloodshot, head does feel more squished, I notice the fuzzy feeling on my arms and legs now. Pain is more manageable. And Im seeing some sort of imaginary circles in my eyes, kind of like when you look at the sun for too long.
5:18 Mouth is dry and I am noticing that my ears feel plugged up, yet my hearing is better. 
5:19 I feel very relaxed, and ready to do the tasks at hand! (Mowing the lawn)

5:20 I must note I am using cannabis for a number of health reasons, as an anti-inflammatory, of course for all of the known and researched health benefits, bronchodilation, the feeling, the mood enhancement, pain relief, chronic hive relief, and for allergy relief.
5:42 Just got done mowing the lawn, some sniffles from the pollen, but not bad at all. Laying down and drinking some fruit juice and taking a steroid nasal spray (Fluticasone Proprianate) to relieve the sniffles. Im feeling quite happy, more creative and imaginative. I have tunnel vision, a warm fuzzy and airy body high, pain relief, and pleasant sedation. 
5:44 Ive definitely plateaued so I will be ending my report here. Since I never feel any bad effects from coming down, I just only return to baseline. 

Side note: I have a very low tolerance as I never exceed one 10-15 second hit from a vaporizer, once every other day or so.  I'm in no way stoned, and wouldn't even call this feeling being high, but just lifted and relaxed. Peace

First a few words about myself. I'm 17 years old, living in the Northeastern U.S., and have only been smoking weed since early this year. However, I've smoked on numerous different occasions, maybe once or twice a week, sometimes less often than that, and have enjoyed it alot. However, I had never had any kind of psychedelic experience on marijuana before.

Yesterday I had just bought an 8th of an ounce of some really good quality nugs from a friend for about 40 bucks. That night, I called up a friend and asked if he wanted to smoke some of it. He agreed, so at 8, I went over to his house. I hadn't smoked in about 2 weeks, so I was expecting to get pretty baked. 

My friend had this really nice bubbler with a huge bowl that could fit like four regular sized bowls in it. So, we packed it tightly and full to the top with the weed, and then went to the woods behind his house to smoke it. I had never smoked from a bubbler or a bong before, so the fact that the smoke was cooled by the water was a nice change. We both got quite a few hits out of it, including one monster 20 second rip I took. Smoked it until we had completely cashed all of what was in the bowl. The effects were starting to kick in, and we were both really mellow and laughing, so we stumbled up out of the woods back into his house. We climbed the stairs slowly, turned off the lights, put in a cd we had made for the occasion, and just sat and chilled at the computer. 

About fifteen or twenty minutes after we had finished smoking, I noticed that I was quite incredibly baked. Probably more baked than I had ever been before. Much more body high than I had ever felt before, too. My legs were warm and tingling very comfortably, and there was a nice sensation all throughout my body. We laughed at some stuff on the computer, and had some weird conversations, including a discussion on the effects of warm or cold water on guitar playing ability. *shrug*

I was also noticing that the music was incredible. The first few songs on our cd were Phish songs. I had never listened to Phish while high before, so this was different for me. I noticed things in the music that I had never noticed before I noticed things in the music that I had never noticed before. And there were, of course, the funny little breaks Phish puts into their music for all the stoners out there. 

We went on chilling out like this for a while. Then 'High Hopes', by Pink Floyd, came on. As the bells chimed in the beginning, me and my friend exchanged a quick, 'Oh, hell yes,' and then I walked over to the stereo, turned it up, and laid down on the floor. I tuned myself completely to the music, allowing it to draw me in more and more. The buzzing in my body grew stronger, and almost seemed to pulse with the beat of the music. I also think this was when I had my first closed eye visual of this experience. The silhoutte of a dog came into my field of vision, turned into a lion, and walked away. As the song drew to it's beautiful climax, I felt as if I was spinning around, just a vessel of the life in this big universe we live in. 

Then came Pink Floyd's 23 minute masterpiece, 'Echoes'. As the pulsing blips began, I felt as if my entire body was pulsing with these blips. As the organ and the guitar came in, the spinning feeling in my body continued, and I began to see some dim fractal patterns behind my closed eyes, flowing and lightly shimmering. Then the music really kicked in. With this musical perfection, I felt as though I was being drawn upward out of my physical body, my spirit spinning slowly up through the air and pulsing with the steady beat of the music of Floyd. I felt completley at peace, and there was nothing but me (or my consciousness, I guess I should say) and the music. It was musical nirvana. There were some closed eye visuals again, just of some swirls of color, but these were not too strong.

When the song ended, I opened up my eyes, stretched, licked my dry lips, and stood up. I told my friend about what I had just experienced, and with a smile, a nod, and a 'Far out, man.' from my friend, I sat down and just listened to some more music. I think what came on next was The Expendables' 'Bowl for Two.'

About an hour and a half after we had first smoked that night, I noticed the effects were significantly coming down. We sprayed cologne on ourselves to cover up whatever was left of the smoke smell, then went down to get food and water, since we both had the munchies and some pretty bad cottonmouth. At about 10:45, my mom picked me up, and, feeling a very mellow after-glow, I went home, ready to go to bed. 

All in all, it was probably the most intense marijuana experience I've ever had. I was really interested in the effects during the Pink Floyd songs. I had never really had any really psychedelic effects from marijuana, but it seemed as if the beautiful, mellow psychedelica that is Pink Floyd triggered a mild psychedelic experience. I think it was a very positive experience, having allowed me to feel, for those fleeting moments, complete and utter peace, without the fetters of the physical world and consensus reality. It has also caused me to have an even greater respect for and understanding of Pink Floyd's music, and a greater respect for this wonderful plant.

I live where Marijuana is now legal, and had been dabbling with purchasing in stores. I had quite a stash of different strains, and was waiting for the right setting to fully allow a good ol 70's buzz. I had not smoked for.....well, a long time if you check my age. Back in the day I would tear it up, but had not used as I got older. Now was my chance! 

I told the guy behind the counter I wanted something to give me a head high buzz. Baddaboom I have an ounce of Purplekush. Sounded pretty and organic. I had a one-hit pipe and loaded it up. I took what I was told later, was an old school hit, immediately loaded again, sucked in and held it. I was good for about one minute. My hands went kinda numb and my body just s l o w l y went away from me. I told my boyfriend I was going to pass out and he laughed ...until I hit the floor. I was not unconscious, but damn close. Then the panic attack hit, and I had him help me up and walk me around like a first timer at a Dead concert. Once I got my heart rate down, I was done for. Couch locked, I am told they call it nowadays. 

The moral to this story: you're never too old to have a good time, but do your research. Went back to the store and some nice kid talked to me about dose, potency, cbds and thc. It's gonna be fun to check out all the new stuff!

First Times to Current Experiences

Heres my story on my current situation with marijuana. All my life I have been somewhat afraid of it, but also curious. Growing up, I didn't think I would grow up to smoke weed or anything.  

I first found when I was like 13 or 14 that my mom smoked weed. At this point in my life I only thought bad of it, as I had only heard of the bad sides that it was real bad for you, it's highly addictive, blah blah blah youre gonna die if you smoke it. Ever. Youll wake up a coke head, shit like that.

I also had no clue what it would feel like to be high. I had promised myself never to start because I knew I probably would like it and would never stop. But luckily I think that being afraid of addiction has kept me from it. 

Here's my first experience: my best friend one night is all excited; he wants to smoke weed with me. I wasnt excited, but he told me it would be fine, he just did it earlier that day for his first time. He didnt give me any low down on how it would feel, etc. 

I'm in a bad set; in the back of a huge dirt mound in the back of a new subdivision; I'm afraid of getting caught; I always tweak out, I always fear the worst. 

But we had a nice piece; I smoked with him. I think it was good stuff, I cant remember as I had no experience beforehand of telling the quality. All I know is I had like 4 or 5 hits, which still is surprisingly the amount it takes to get me super blazed. 

I was expecting: 
1: to feel it right away, like the buzz with cigarettes.
2: to see shit, like hallucinate (even then, just see, not like seriously trip)
3: just feel chill, nothing physically different. 

A few minutes after I smoked, I realized something. I felt like I had just woke up, like I was out of the scene for a second. I looked around. I asked how long it had been since we smoked. I looked around. I asked how long it had been since we smoked. One minute, maybe. It happened again. It was like I felt that I had just left the scene. I wasnt tripping, nothing really looked different. Everything felt the same. I was expecting to see a pink elephant walk around or feel my hands melt, like the people from schools tell you. 

This continued for another couple minutes. I really was just freaking out about this, I just wanted it to stop. Then I got the buzz. Not like a cigarette buzz, but a really (now I love this but not then) strong sensation all over my body. It kind of makes me feel quivery, like my muscles are lightly tickled, it's great. But then I hated it. I got out of the car and walked around to meet my two friends who were blazing. I started to talk, and again, as I talk I kind of feel everything slip away for a second, and then I realize it just felt like I was doing whatever it was for HOURS. In one second. Then for a minute I feel normal. It kind of surged in and out. Then as it started to sink in and I felt more accustomed to it, I was in the backseat (we were cruising around now, it's nighttime) I'm just feeling myself, rubbing my hands all over my body kind of tranced out... it did feel different. I had no clue where we were going. It felt like no one was listening to me. People tried to tell me fake shit; I knew right from wrong, but I played along mischievously. I still wasnt really enjoying it.

Later on a few months later, I tried it again. I still felt pretty uneasy about it, and the effects still werent too much different, only this time I experienced more subtle effects. Moving around, playing with people, I got funny sensations. 

When it comes to hallucinating, on weed, it's not that I see different colors, or different things. I just get different sensations about what I see. Like for instance. When I'm really blazed lately, it feels kind of like everything is huge. Like the distance from my head to the screen is across a football field. It just kind of feels that way, like I'm a small guy inside my eyes looking out. It's better when it's dark. 

Lately I have grown to smoke weed maybe once a week or so, and wouldnt prefer it any other way. When I smoke too often, the effects are less. I enjoy kind of tripping out, and definitely listening to music like in bed, right after I blaze.  Songs Ive know for years just trip me out. It will sound kind of different, but I'll notice different instruments or stuff. Ill be tranced in it and just get my groove on. With my eyes closed I can see shit, like all sorts of random scenery, some patterns colors, old memories. I can come up with great ideas. 

When  I get high I remember what it feels like to be high. I can list the effects, but I realize what it really means when I'm actually high. I'll be like, oh yea, I can imagine different shit; I feel like I can see my head, or that everything I say shows up like a caption in my peripheral. 

The effects have gone from intense surging in and out to long, enjoyable effects that spread out much easier and it's a lot more fun. My setting affects my high.

This experience was definitely one of the funniest, if not the most memorable one. Ill try to put every detail as I remember it here, because everythings a little fuzzy. Oh well.
Here we go...

---------------

Im a good student, make good grades, have never had any trouble with law enforcement (Theyre on my mind a lot now) and am just overall chilling through life. I got into weed late November of senior year and I loved it. I had seen colors and heard music in ways I never thought I could. So here I was, in June, a kid trying to smoke, but I needed friends to do it with. I overheard my friend J (well refer to people as initials) talking about how he can smoke every morning in his garage since his parents dont get home until the late afternoon. The chance to smoke with him, every day, and doing crazy stuff attracted me, so I asked him if I could.

Sure dude.

I texted him and asked if I could show up as early as 8 and he said that was perfect, so I made plans for that time. Even though it was summer, I didnt care about waking up early if it meant that I could chill with him. The next morning I gathered my supply box, which consisted of a lighter and some bud copped from the local premium dealer. I drove over and parked my car on the other side of the road near Js house, so if I had to run, I could make a smooth transition to driving.

As soon as I walked up to the door, his dog started barking ferociously, I mean it was loud and definitely scared me. Js brother P held back his dog and told me,
 Sorry dude, he doesnt like black people. 

Oh.

We made our way to the garage where I saw J was preparing the gravity bongs for us, with a socket that he had saved in his room from some old toolbox or something. He set it up and then I took out my bud. I never charge my friends and I love smoking fellow bros up. He lit it and we took big hits off of it; I would say about 4 or 5 I had. We only used about .3 of weed, so it wasnt that bad. 

A little less than 10 seconds after I inhaled, I tried to stand up and I felt like I was one of those York Peppermint Patty commercials, where the guys on the mountain and screaming. I was then thrown into a trance where I gathered around the water bottle on the ground and began making shouting noises at it, while dancing like a tribal warrior. I saw J step back but at that time I thought it was just because he was scared of fire.

What the...

It was then in one fluid motion that I saw J and P get up and take towels to wipe off the water from the bong, then change clothes and spray the garage. They were so much more experienced than I was, I thought. This was amazing to me. They had such an organized and efficient method to hiding the evidence from their parents, and I was just sitting there, not contributing.  It was almost like they were robots being controlled by some kind of remote, because their movements were so in tune with what they were doing. I saw very mild trails of their arms and I realized that I probably looked like a freak for staring at their arms for so long, but I didnt care. It was beautiful.

As we made our way into the kitchen for snacks, almost immediately, it turned into a cooking show set, where everything looked so perfect and in place. I just stopped and stared, like I was nervous to be going onto a professionals set. J was the host of the show and he was showing me around with the spices and the drinks. Funny. He then ran onto his couch and put on the Fresh Prince, a show that is highly recommended for anyone thats new to smoking. We all sat down with cereal and as we were watching, an event occurred that I will never forget. 

From the corner of my eye, I noticed a black and yellow figure by the window. I turned my head to the tv, but then I looked again.

Thats what I saw...

Holy shit, dude! Its the cops!! I aggressively whispered.

I then made my way upstairs, kind of like power walking and I ducked under the railings of the stairs because I thought I could pretend to be asleep, then wake up. I saw the figures head moving from side to side and I for sure thought that the house was about to be broken into and swarmed by SWAT officers.  Dozens of thoughts went through my head:

I cant have a criminal record, now, anytime but now!

Why is this happening to me? Im a good kid!

They said they were experts how did the cops find us??

I thought it was over. I thought my time of smoking had come to an end. I thought I was going to be booked and my parents would bail me out, and then leave me on the street. Id be kicked out for sure. Why did I choose this life? Is this what smokers have to deal with every day? 

I peeked downstairs to see if P and J had started running, but they hadnt even moved. They looked at me with some kind of perplexed look and I slowly made my way downstairs. I tiptoed to the door and realized that the only things in the window were balloons. Black and yellow fucking balloons. I ran upstairs and freaked out and contemplated the rest of my life over balloons. 

...Dude, you are such a fucking idiot.

Then we heard a noise, a phone ringing. It was Js dad! 

J picked up and answered his phone. I whispered to P, How does he talk to his dad like that? 

I was terrible talking to my dad baked, and I had no idea how he did it.
It turns out that he got off work early so he was on his way home. We decided not to stay and headed over to the neighborhood pool. I laid back on the pool chair, and was about to put my headphones in when I saw a cleaning salesman go from house to house. 

For some reason I got really pissed at him, not because he was selling shitty cleaning supplies but because of something else. He was walking across the peoples grasses and going to their doors. I mean, he didnt have any respect for them, well enough, for that matter, to use the driveway.

I thought he was pathetic and I hated his face. Kind of a drastic thought, but it just popped in my head.

The rest of the day I just drifted away into a sea of sounds by Chance the Rappers Acid Rap and some Morcheeba. I couldnt feel anything in my body and was entranced by the synths and vocals. Pretty good.

Overall, now that I think about it, it was one of my funniest experiences. I told P and J about it and they laughed, probably thinking I made everything up. Haha... ha.. yeah.

I think for this trip report to be fully understood, a little background info on myself is necessary. If you dont wish to read, feel free to skip to the text after the broken line. 

I grew up thinking drugs were bad. I had a terrible experience that I associated with cigarettes at a young age, which manifested in a fear of nicotine. I took this aversion and applied it to all illicit substances. I didnt start consuming alcohol until I was 18, and thought Id never smoke the EVIL marijuana. 

Ha. 

My freshman year of college, I had the privilege of living and learning with several tribes of American Indians. I was allowed to participate in a traditional sweat lodge, and was given a spirit name by a medicine man. This experience, to date, has been one of the most profound and meaningful events of my life. Not only did it cure me of my intense, almost allergic phobia of nicotine (though I still refuse to smoke cigarettes out of respect for tobacco as a plant), it taught me one simple truth: mind altering plants were put on this earth as teachers to mankind. 


This, in turn, prompted me to try cannabis some six months later, after I had done my own research and come to my own conclusions. It took me a little to fully grasp what an important teacher, and friend, marijuana was. Once I did, though, I realized the potential uses of this wonderful plant. Not only that, but I realized how much I wanted to try other substances.

------------------------------------------

Skip to a little over a year later. Junior year of college. Ill be leaving on a journey across the country soon, and after that, Ill be out of the country. Ive been preoccupied with this whirlwind of experiences heading my way. 


Ive also been itching to experience my first trip. Ive had several profound experiences with cannabis, the most recent alerting me that I had been overusing it. I had caught a cold, so decided to call it quits on the smoking for a brief period of time. 


My friend, L, had shown interest in hanging out that night. I still had a bit of a cold, so I told him I didnt want to smoke. I asked if he could find some shrooms, knowing that he had the necessary connections. Ive read tripping with just a stuffy nose isnt terrible, and can sometimes help relieve the symptoms. 


Our babysitter told me that itd probably be good to get a little high for a shroom trip, seeing as you can get nauseous. Still not wanting to smoke, I make myself a small firecracker. I eat this approx. 45 minutes before we trip to ensure that itll hit right as I initiate. 


Now, my policy is to research every single substance I put into my body. Read trip reports so I know what to expect, look up the chemistry involved, double check short and long term side effects, and basically be as comfortable as humanly possible before administering any sort of substance. So when he told me he couldnt find shrooms, but instead found 2c-i, I had a momentary lapse of judgement. I knew that this would be the last chance before I leave the country to trip. I had done a little bit of research on 2c-i, and for some reason that sufficed for what had been, up to that point, my moral code of drugs. 

Mistake 1: L picked up seven doses of 2c-i. His dealer had told him, One is ok, two is a good time, and three puts you into space. Seeing as I had a cold, I decided I would do one dose and L would do two, leaving four doses for our friends who had pitched in. The mistake being we didnt actually know how much this dealer had defined as one dose. 

Mistake 2: L had done 2c-i three times before. One time, he had snorted it, and the other, he had eaten it. Another time he had tried to snort it, but blew his nose and apparently didnt have anything happen. He told me that the snorting was, and I quote, kinda shitty, but worth it. The mistake being that he had never measured out his own snorted dose, or described just how shitty kinda shitty really was. You see, L is a tank. I am not. 

Mistake 3: We didnt have a scale accurate in mg, so we just threw the entire thing on a scale and subtracted the bag, just to see how much we had. Seeing as I had never done research on the drug past skimming a wiki page, and L had never measured out his own dose, we were content with the fact that it appeared we had .175 grams of material. We didnt even bother to figure out what that equated to in 7 doses. Not an intelligent thing to do. 

Mistake 3.5: Seeing as we didnt have a good scale, we eyeballed out doses out. I was incredibly critical through this process, but even so... [Erowid Note: 
Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.
See this article on The Importance of Measured Doses.] 

My other friend, G, was our babysitter. He had experience with plenty of drugs, including hallucinogens, but had never snorted 2c-i, though he had heard what happens when people do. I trusted his judgement, and in retrospect, Im incredibly glad it was him babysitting us. We were at my apartment, and it was quite a comfortable atmosphere. I was excited, and not really too nervous. I definitely didnt think anything bad would happen. 

So now we have our lines laid out. L looks down at his (keep in mind hes doing a double dose) and has a nervous laugh. I ask him whats up, and he replies (not wanting to freak me out) that he doesnt think hes ever done quite this much before. In L speak, that means it was a lot more than he had ever even thought about snorting. Maintaining his composure, though, he leans down and takes his line. Theres a pause, I look at his calm face slowly contort into a half amused, half miserable expression. He mutters something about how lovely it was, and goes into the bathroom to start coughing, gagging, and making some other lovely noises that are pretty impossible to describe. 

And now I was a little nervous. Determined to follow through with the nights plan, I snorted the powder and took the proverbial dive into the world of hallucinogens. It turned out to be more of a belly flop. 

Even though Im sure common sense should scream this loud enough, I am telling you right now: Do not insufflate 2c-i, or really anything, when you have a headcold. Ever. Dont do it.

10:33 pm

t-00:00- If youve ever been splashed by hot oil, thats what it felt like at first. I almost believed that I had just snorted acid and my nose was dissolving. And that was the first ten seconds. By 30 seconds, my nose had closed completely on the side which had taken the hit. Were talking 100% blocked. When I wiped it with a tissue (I had been advised not to blow my nose, lest the whole experience be for nothing), it come away with trace amounts of blood. Wonderful, I thought sarcastically. I called out to L with a hoarse voice that my nose was bleeding, and he responded with confusion. Even better. 

t-00:05- Five minutes in, the pain still hadnt subsided for me. L said straight up that this was the worst it had ever hurt for him. This frightened me, and I started to wonder if this random white powder I had gotten was safe. I decided it was important to remain cool. Then I looked in the mirror. The entire right side of my face was swelling up. It got a little bit harder to remain cool. I finally blew my nose, and it didnt help at all. If anything, it agitated my already raw sinuses to the point of tears. I gagged, and almost threw up. I took off my glasses and retreated to the couch. G was sitting calmly, watching us both carefully. 

t-00:07- I ask G to put on some classical music. Not knowing much about classical music, he puts on a deep, dramatic and ominous set. Unknowingly to me, the trip had already started, and the music frightened me to death. I shouted out something to the tune of, DIFFERENT FUCKING CLASSICAL MUSIC and told myself that as long as L is ok, I knew I was fine. 

t-00:08- L calmly gets up off the couch, walks to the bathroom, and starts vomiting. This is just after G had put on what may have been a version of Mozarts Requiem. Im not 100% sure, but I remember the music was almost like a beautiful agony. Something that Id find emotional in a normal state of mind, maybe even uplifting. However, in my mind, it had become the tragic soundtrack to my life crashing down around me. If youve ever seen Requiem for a Dream, my life had become the ending montage. 

t-00:09- I tell G I am not digging the classical music. He asks what I want, and I respond in an annoyed, frightened tone, something simple and happy. I dont remember many details of this point, only that at some time in the next four minutes I look over at him and state that 911 was not off the table for me that night. G, knowing that I was going to be fine, calmly said it wouldnt be necessary. On second thought, he looked over to me and said genuinely, but ok, I hear you. I relax a little. At some point, I find my way into my bed, which is a bunk bed. The black bottom of the bunk over me makes me feel like Im in a capsule. This illusion is supported by the blankets I curled up in. I was safe at this point. I close my eyes as G puts on a trance-ish version of Adagio for Strings. In my mind, I am trying to find my center. Ive dealt with being too high before by meditating my way through it, and start to do the same with this. I can feel the firecracker kicking in, and I thank it for the friendship and companionship it gives me. The familiar feeling of the high held my hand through the difficult entry, and to this day I cannot express how grateful I am that marijuana was there to help me. 

My heart beat becomes the music. I can still feel that my face and respiratory tract are miserable, but its bearable now. Ive accepted that Im ok at this point, and that Im likely not going to die from this, which let me surrender myself to the experience. 

Then I hear L from the bathroom simply say, shiiiiit. I quickly come back to the room and tell G to go check on L in the bathroom. He gets up, walks to the door, and asks if hes ok. L responds, Im fine. Just trippin balls, but Im fine and goes back to what he was doing. I found out later that he was staring at his vomit, seeing it forming back into food within the toilet bowl. 

Content that hes also going to survive the night just fine, I focus back on trying to get my trip on the right track. My heart beat once again synchronizes with the music, and within my mind I am taken to some sort of an amusement park. It was in black space, but I was flying around huge, brightly colored twisting structures that resembled the tracks to roller coasters. I realized that the feeling my body was going through felt incredibly familiar, though I had trouble placing what exactly that feeling was. I am still uneasy with the trip, and I can feel the 2c-i trying to push further into my consciousness. As much as I want a profound realization about depression, friends, etc., I realize that I need to grow up within this state of mind before I do any deep soul searching. I have the realization that, under the influence of cannabis, I am an adult to the drug. However, I have much to learn about the state of tripping before I turn my focus to the serious side of things. 

At this point I opened my eyes, and L is sitting on the couch. I ask him if hes doing ok, still thinking that he was going through the panic and pain that I was. He responds enthusiastically that hes doing great. At this point, which I think was anywhere between 30 and 40 minutes into the experience, I get my first real positive vibe. Content, I take a sip of water and find it refreshing, albeit hard to swallow, and go back into my mind. 

I realize that the familiarity Im feeling is that of when I was still in my infancy. My bed has become my crib (though Im still very aware of where I am), L has become my best friend from childhood, and bizarrely, G is my father. 

I decide that its time to have a little fun, seeing as Im allowed to be a child again. I focus my vision on the wall above Ls head. I am nearly blind without my glasses on, but I can still make out the profiles of several drawings L had done at my place when we had been smoking together several weeks earlier. I had chosen to tape them onto my wall, and now, with the edges curling, it appeared as if they were wiggling like hanging pieces of jelly on the wall. I giggle a little. I giggle even more when I look down at L and realize how ridiculous he looks, in the awkward position on the couch, mouth open in a grin I can barely make out, and with his hand in the air playing a piano that doesnt exist. 

I decide to try out a tripping cliche, and pull my hand from under the blanket, and simply watch it as I slowly pull my fingers into a fist, and then spread them wide out again. Its a fabulous act, and I realize just how complicated the human body is, and how incredible it is that we, as physical beings, exist in such a harsh environment with such fragile and precise mechanics. 

Over the course of the next two hours or so, I slowly grow up, both metaphorically and almost in a physical sense. 2c-i cycles me through my entire life, giving me familiar replays from every segment of my short existence. I finally am able to leave my bed around my teenage years, and catch up with myself around 2:00am. At this point, I am capable of walking around the room, but am still physically drained from my rough entry. 

L suggest we go for a walk, but I tell him I dont think itd be a good idea. G had to go take care of something for a brief time, but at that point I was stable minded enough that it was ok, and I enjoyed the personal time spent with L. When G returned, he brought friend A, who found my glasses finally. I put them on, look at G, and realize there are 4 different colored Gs floating around the original one. This is a little too much, and I slowly take the glasses off and enjoy my natural vision, which includes light checker patterns floating on the walls, but with warping holes occasionally appearing and flowing across the room. I discover I can create these wormholes by moving my hands over them. I look at L, and find his face to be incredibly exaggerated, to the point where he looked like a caricature of himself. G, after being assured by L and I that were quite set, leaves for the night. L and I settle in. 

Around 4:00, I am finally able to put my glasses back on. I am feeling drained, but still stimulated by the drug. L and I set up a playlist intended to last for the next five hours. With the music taken care of, we have fun just talking about life, drugs, and what were experiencing. Around 5:00, we decide that its time to simply get comfortable, and enjoy the comedown. 

t-08:49- I remember regaining the concept of time at 7:12, because that was the first time since I started the trip that I looked at my watch and was able to deter what the numbers actually meant. This was blurry, though, as I was falling asleep. If I remember, I was feeling a little bit of the psychoactive effects, but at this point the trip was mostly over.  

L and I woke up feeling pretty ok around 1:00pm that day. Well, L woke up feeling pretty ok. I woke up to what had gone from a simple head cold to terrible head cold, an illness I would not be able to rid myself of for the next two and a half weeks. 

Overall, the experience was a positive one. Even though we made many, MANY idiotic mistakes, we were lucky enough to end up with, what I believe, is the best case scenario for all of said missteps. I learned the hard way to never take any substance lightly, and to always do my research beforehand. 

I guess if anyone actually took the time to read this entire entry, the only other advice I can give you is to use common sense. If something feel wrong, double check, triple check, and then have failsafes in place if things go wrong. 

2C-I was for me a wonderful substance that works best off of subtlety and introspection, without overwhelming sensory feedback. I did not feel complete disconnect from reality. 

After the fact, we realized how ridiculous the doses we had taken were. I had snorted 25mg, and L had taken on a mind numbing 50mg.

My first hit of marijuana ever was when I was 14. I didn't feel much of anything except for the fact I was a little giggly. 

My next experience with pot was when I was 15. I'd smoke it every now and then depending on who I was hanging out with. I'd feel slight effects like feeling blood run through my veins or seeing real objects as something completely different.

But it wasn't till my first 4/20 that I was truly introduced to the wonders of weed. It was April 20th and nearly everyone was celebrating it. I drove my boyfriend, at the time, and his friend out of the city limits to the top of a hill in the country. I was still 15 and didn't even have a learner's permit yet so it was pretty risky. There, my boyfriend rolled a nice fat blunt for us to smoke.

Now one thing you should know, I hadn't smoked in about 3 months for school purposes, so I was extremely excited.

We all got out of the car and passed it among each other. After my first hit I said, 'I haven't done that in 3 long months.' My boyfriend said 'then go ahead and hit it some more. We've got plenty more.'

So I did as he said and kept the whole blunt to myself basically. I took a few small hits. Then a few big hits. I sat there by a bush smoking it and watching the two guys chillin there in front of me. 

I don't really know how much time passed before I started noticing some incredible things. I remember looking at the bush and then looking over at my car. It was as if my vision lagged or something. It was like watching a slideshow. It was simply amazing. I got up to walk and couldn't really tell if my feet were touching the ground or not because my legs felt light. Like a feather.

I managed to walk over to the guys and I handed one of them the blunt and told them they could have some turns. My boyfriend's friend said, 'Damn look at her eyes! They're fuckin red!' I turned to look at my boyfriend and he laughed and said 'Baby are you stoned?'. I laughed and nodded. This made them laugh like crazy. My boyfriend told me he'd drive back to town since I probably wasn't able to. I agreed and after a while we all piled into my car.  [Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

The CD player blasted one of my heavy metal CDs as we took off. It was so loud that it made me laugh again. The music sounded like it never had before. I could hear every instrument and the base echoed for a longer time than it should have. 

As we drove down the hill back into the city, I could see my boyfriend from the corner of my eye. But it wasn't him. What I saw kind of disturbed me in a way. It was him driving, but as a cartoon or something pretty close. I didn't want to look at him directly so I kept looking from the corner of my eye. This cartoon like hallucination tripped me out like crazy.

Once we got back into the city limits he said, 'Wasn't that fast?' I turned to look at him, directly, and he looked normal. I started laughing. 

I don't really remember driving through town but I do remember going to Sonic. There we saw his mom who came up to the window to talk to him. I didn't really want her to know I was stoned so I looked the other way. But when she said hi to me, I had to turn and say hi. I tried to do it as quickly as possible although I guess she still noticed because she asked my boyfriend if he had gotten me high and he laughed and said yeah. She scolded him for it then left. I turned to him and laughed and he said, 'Baby you are so fuckin high.'

It was getting late and I had to be home. So my boyfriend drove to his house where he and his friend would stay. I was afraid about driving home but I knew I had to. I didn't live too far but I still felt nervous. I kept thinking I saw cats in the road. Then it got to where I thought I saw babies. I was scaring myself pretty bad.

I finally got home and went straight to my room. I looked at myself in the mirror. My reflection looked distored. My skin tone seemed gray and my eyes really were bloodshot. I decided to lay down. I pulled my blankets and covers over me. The softness of it all felt so fantastic on my skin. I rubbed my leg up and down and laughed to myself about the incredible feeling. As I closed my eyes I began seeing visuals. I kept thinking something was trying to get in my room and began feeling extremely paranoid. Around that time I fell asleep.

Though some points of that day were scary, it was overall an amazing high.

I want to share this experience for two reasons.  I think it can be valuable as a description of my success with a simple recipe for marijuana brownies as well as an account of my own experience.   Ive written the preparation first and described my encounter afterwards.  For reference, at the time of this experience I am 17 years old with drug history of mainly cannabis and alcohol with some pharmaceutical use and a single mushroom trip.

It was a very nice November afternoon when I cooked my first batch of marijuana brownies.  I came home from school with my friend/dealer and we weighed out a quarter ounce (7g) of good hydroponic weed.  Broke this up pretty well, not grinded but finer than normal for a blunt or bowl.  I made sure to keep the stems; although they arent good for smoking they do have some THC content and are worthwhile for cooking.

The box of brownie mix (Duncan Hines) called for 2/3 cup of vegetable oil; this is where the weed entered the recipe.  I heated the oil in a plain cooking pot to an easy boil and put the weed in.  Let it stay in for about 10 minutes, during which I periodically pressed it with a spatula just to ensure that the full spectrum of cannabinoids was dissolving well.  This step here made the house REEK of weed.  After this I poured the oil with weed through a strainer back into the measuring glass, letting it sit for a while to make sure every precious drop got through.  Now I had 2/3 cup of oil with a quarter ounce worth of good weed dissolved inside.

After this, just cook as normal following the boxs directions.  I was able to cut the tray into 12 potent brownies, slightly more than a half gram in each.  Worked well for everyone who had them, even very experienced smokers felt the effects for about 6 hours.  They tasted good too, just like normal brownies.  (Best eaten within a few days, I saved one and ate a little over a week later, it tasted terrible).  I personally felt them very strongly, my own experience follows.

I first consumed during the cooking process at about 3 pm.  After mixing the batter together in a bowl and pouring it into the tray, I ate the remaining batter with a spoon.  Why let anything go to waste?  I then put the tray in the oven and let it start cooking.  I was in a great mood, very excited about the brownies and was with a good group of people who I like a lot.  

While waiting for the brownies to cook (this took somewhere around a half hour), my friend and I took a quick trip to 7-11 to buy some chips.  I was very surprised to realize, on my way into the store, that I was already high just from the batter I ate!  I was feeling the early signs: bright colors, different thought process, giddiness, etc.  Sometimes I find this stage the most enjoyable.  Once we got back and the brownies finished I took them out and cut the tray up into 12.  Then 3 of us, me, my brother, and my friend, each ate one of ours.  This was at 3:30, and I was still feeling the high from before, and it was actually still building.

About 20 minutes later I felt what I believe was the onset of the brownie (it was somewhat unclear since I was already high).  I have a quick stomach, and it was pretty much empty so I knew it would come quickly. It was a little longer for the other two I was with.  Once it started coming on it built pretty quickly and strongly.  We hung out in my kitchen and just talked and joked around for a while, conversation flowed pretty easily.  At about 4:30 we headed to the basement to watch TV, which was hilarious.  We watched for a little over an hour and laughed a lot.  Had a few of those precious rounds of laughing where we would laugh at something and then maintain it by looking at each other and laughing about how we were laughing.  Gotta love those.

By this point I was feeling pretty good, like after smoking a sizeable amount, but more of a body-high than I feel when smoking marijuana.  The sensations were still building too; it would still be over an hour until I peaked.  I did not experience any amount of shaking and unsteadiness that I sometimes get when smoking.  I was glad about this; I dont really like that shaky feeling.  One surprise was that I did still experience cottonmouth.  Less so than after smoking, but definitely noticeable.  Did I get the munchies?  Im not sure.  The sensation of eating was very nice, but I wasnt drawn to munch face like I sometimes am after smoking.  This was probably because eating marijuana can be kind of tough on the stomach.

Overall it was very pleasant for a while, but it started to build a little bit too much.  This happens sometimes with me, I get too out of it and internally withdrawn into my own thoughts.  I was feeling like this when my friend left to go home and my brother went upstairs.  Im not exactly sure how much time passed, but Im guessing it was about 6:30, 3 hours since eating, when the most profound part of my trip (and I do consider this a trip) occurred.

I was reclined and day dreaming pretty deeply, probably fading in and out, when I suddenly rose, raised my hands towards the ceiling and began chanting GOD! GOD! GOD!  I dont know where it came from or how I started doing it.  I believe I said it 6 times, and I swear I felt better after each time.  Up until this point I was not very religious.  I was unsure about my beliefs, didnt know whether to believe in God or not.  It was clear to me that organized religion was not my thing, and I still feel the same about that.  However, I truly consider this a deep religious experience and I now strongly believe in God.  In reflection, I think it makes perfect sense that the revelation occurred at this time.  My life was somewhat messy at the time, with a lot of loose ends and the like.  Since then I have done my best to clean it up and feel a better sense of direction and purpose, and feel good about being part of something greater.

I was pretty drained by this point, but I felt great spiritually after the aforementioned outburst.  I headed straight to my room and took about a 6 hour nap, which contained some strange and interesting dreams.  I awoke at around 1:00 am and still felt a little bit high, but refreshed from the nap.

In conclusion, this was clearly a good experience.  Although stronger than I would usually prefer, I know I probably would not have had such a deep spiritual eruption with a smaller dose.  I believe I ate close to a gram that day, if you include the batter I had beforehand.  I have made brownies since, but prefer to eat somewhat less, especially in a social situation.  If I had a free day however, I would not rule out taking a very strong dose and seeing where it takes me.

Thanks for reading, God bless and enjoy yourselves!  Reverend Roach

Last night a pal of mine and I decided to partake in some brownies and for the 3rd time I witnessed someone get their ass handed to them.

I had a bad trip about three years ago that left me pacing my hallway in a panic for 3 hrs trying to avoid any rays of sunlight on the floor. So since then Ive practiced extreme moderation with brownies and cautioned everyone else to do the same. But most people insist that because I have a low threshold for weed and liquor, I simply have no idea what harsh really is. Or to quote something a friend said once, I dont think you understand the point of weed.

Well, last night I discovered why those sentiments are often the precursor to that person holding their head between their knees and asking me if theyre going to die for four hours straight. Often times theres a prolonged gestation period when one starts out feeling absolutely nothing or only a very light sense of awesome. The problem is that at that point hubris kicks in and they either get disappointed (which may lead to a negative mindset), or god forbid demand to eat more. And then in about an hour or two the other shoe drops. Mary Janes shoe. And she drops that shoe on that ass for the rest of the night.

The feeling is similar to a moderate panic attack for people who dont know what severe panic attacks feel like. For a long time I thought my three hour hallway track meet was awful until a very pot savvy friend got so convinced he was going to die he threw all his pr0n away so his family wouldnt find it posthumously. Then on another occasion a girlfriend of mine ate waaaaaay too much. After being certain she was 'going into the light' for three hours she started speaking in the most annoying accent and couldnt shake it. It was like a horrible combination of German and babytalk. That was probably MY worst experience of all time because my high died instantly.

My tip for talking people down from bad brownie incidents is to tell them the feeling IS eventually going to end. That seems to be the most common concern. And don't let them get obsessed with things like the time and how long they've been feeling panicked.

However, other helpful tips for people in that condish include:

 No one in the history of weed has ever died of weed and you arent going to claim first.*

 No, youre not going to forget to breathe.*

 Yes, you exist.*

 I can see why you might think that but no, you should not call your [out-of-town sleeping family member] at this time.*

 And in answer to the query am I just acting out what I think its like to be high because Ive started to slip back to reality or away from what I was suppose to follow:  Nope.*

*particularly in my fucking house.

It was noon in Karauli, India, after a walking of the town, palace and temple, when our guide pointed out the street stall selling bhang.  As a firm believer in the salutary effects of ganja (having been a regular user-smoking- since the late 60's- I'm now 65) and not wanting to miss the opportunity of a cultural experience, I thought it would be worth trying.  After all, ganja is a holy sacrament in the Hindu religion, the favorite food of Shiva, the Lord of Bhang.  Plus, one portion costs only 5 rupees, or a dime (in Varanasi a portion of bhang was only one rupee!).

Within 20 minutes I consumed the bhang back at the hotel (bhang is made fresh I should be consumed within an hour of purchase).  I then went to the dining patio to join the rest of the travel group (about 12 other people for lunch).  I was the only person in the group to try bhang at that time, but I was glad that the others knew that I had partaken- there is nothing worse than being stoned and trying to hide it.

Within minutes of sitting down I felt this intense omniscience. There were multiple conversations going on in the table and I was locked into each one.  I was having a difficult time ascertaining social cues. The conversation across the table, was it ok to interrupt.  A murmur of Hindi emanated from the adjacent kitchen, a most comforting sound.  Other sounds of India (barking dogs, car horns, the call to prayer from the local mosque) invaded my consciousness.

The experience was quite intense, almost to the edge. I am sure one more bhang portion would have put me into a negative situation. Perhaps my reaction was adulterated by the 22 oz bottle of Kingfisher beer I had (180 rupees- guess what the stimulus of choice is in Rajhastan). The intense period lasted until 5 pm. I could not  nap- ganja, orally taken, definitely had an opposite effect on me from that of smoking. I was fortunate to able to have access to an Indian music channel on the small tv in the room and for the first time I really 'grooved to', as well as the beautiful estate grounds of the hotel, which were tranquil and free of the cacophony and crowds outside the hotel grounds.

By  7 pm in the evening and after a marvelous afternoon I was feeling incredibly relaxed and serene.  An English travel group on the dining patio group inquired about the results of the U.S. presidential election, and there was an explosion of joy when they heard the news.

I slept well that evening.

I meet Ani at the club. The music, minimalist techno in one room and anthemic electronica in the other, is pumping out of a state of the art sound system. I am bathed in texture. I haven't been out dancing in months, and I've come properly equipped. Many molecules have been burning a hole in my pocket all night, and now, a little past midnight, I am ready to dive in. I find Ani on the dancefloor and we navigate closer to where Donato Dozzy is spinning records, dancing as we watch him.

'So, do you want anything?'

Ani considers and calls into my ear over the loud music. 'What do you have?'

'Well...I brought options. You could take eighteen milligrams of 2c-b, or fifteen milligrams of 4-AcO-DMT, or 25 milligrams of one of my personal favorites - 4-HO-MiPT. I also brought some speed.'

A wealth of options. Ani seems a bit dazzled as to which direction to choose. Singular experiences, combinations, the warmth of tryptamine consciousness or the neural electricity that phenethylamines bring. Or, just an upper to keep going. The party goes until six AM - at least, so we think for now.

Ani decides to wait before taking anything, and because I don't really feel like tripping alone, I decide to wait too. The speed is burning hard through my pocket, because I did not sleep well the night before and I feel lethargic. Still, I opt for sobriety. We bounce from one room to the other and then Ani suggests we go out to her car to smoke.

We talk about Krishnamurti and Joseph Cambell while she rolls a joint. I've missed her. I fumble through the two small containers in my pocket and fish out a 15mg capsule of 4-AcO-DMT. That's my choice for the night. We get out of the car and walk around the block to smoke the joint. I'm holding the capsule the whole time. Back in the club, I slip it back into my pocket and continue dancing.

Every once in a while, I get an itch to take something. But the itch is really the most interesting aspect of the thoughts in which it swims. I parse through the thoughts. I attack the itch, and then I embrace it. This is kind of awkward, being in a dark room filled with bodies and attitudes and everybody dancing. There is a lot of raw sexuality, attractive men behaving like boys and rubbing against one another, sensuous women carrying themselves with an air of erotic unattainability, a lot of people on cocaine or ketamine, their stern faces looking at me with a lot of judgment in their eyes. I am dressed in lighter colors, have a smile plastered on my face - always, drugs are not at all necessary - and my hair is wild and fuzzy and free. They have an idea of what dancing to techno should be, and I am sure I do not fit in.

But of course, though there is an 'in' crowd here, I am failing at life by turning myself and Ani into 'us' and everyone else into 'them.' God, but this is awkward, and psychedelic drugs would really help me deal with that. I would perceive the oneness that suffuses all life, it would render these aggressive and combative tendencies in others laughable in the face of the unity that permeates all things. It seems attractive to take something. It also seems too easy.

Sometimes, I get lazy about dancing. Which is a shame - dancing is sweet release for me, and I dance hard on drugs and have ecstatic spiritual experiences of oneness with my body. Tonight? I'm just kind of tired. I dance, or I watch. I'm horny. Many different bodies are bumping up against me here and there. We step outside and we smoke another joint. I get insanely high this time, and when we get back it is actually a bit too much. It is then that we find out the party does not end at six AM.

We receive wristbands to an afterparty in the upstairs loft where a DJ I absolutely love, Derek Plaslaiko, is spinning until noon. This changes everything. What to take?

The 2c-b?
Or 4-AcO-DMT, my first instinct?
Or...4-HO-MiPT dancing through the sunrise through a kaleidoscope of raw rainbow sexuality. That does sound lovely.
And of course, whichever, with about 40mg of racemic amphetamine paste, some speed, is going to just really carry me all lovely-like.

We get upstairs to the loft, see friends we haven't seen for hours. They are tripping hilariously hard on LSD and channeling Hunter S. Thompson caricatures through their warm selves and cartoon glasses. It is great to see them and I am eager to join them in their construct of reality.

Ani turns to me. 'You know,' she says. 'I do have a lot to do tomorrow. Would you want to just go home now?'

It really doesn't take more than a split second to make a decision. It's 6:30 AM and I have plans later that night for dinner with a girl I am very excited to get to know. I don't want to be a zombie when I see her.

'Sure, let's go.'

At the exit, our coats half-zipped, Ani pauses.

'Aaahhh. I don't know. I think I could totally go back in there and take something right now and dance my ass off til noon. What do you think?'

Though we have been at the club together all night, in a way I have remained passive and let Ani drive. I want her to drive now. Her car. To my house.

'I think I'd rather go home, actually.'

Because we are spirit brother and spirit sister til we die, whatever I say I decide is fine, and Ani is totally cool with going home. I pinch some pot off of her, and when I get home I smoke a bit before even taking off my coat. Then I undress. I empty out my pocket full of molecules, my simple but dazzling array of opportunities for neurochemical enhancement. Outside, the sun is rising and orange-yellow rays are searing through my window-blinds. I feel pretty fantastic.

I looked at the clock, and felt that it was time to go. I made a final check to make sure my friend's parents were snug in their beds. Sure enough, I was in the clear. As I climbed out the window, I knew that climbing back in wasn't going to be so easy. My friend and I made it out to the car and drove to a less populated area. Once there, we rolled down the back windows and turned on the cab light. I then spent a good 10 minutes packing the finest bowl that I could. I'm a very easy bake, so 3 good hits is normally all I take before I stop. Tonight, however, I was going to finish this bowl with my friend and I made that pledge to myself. I had a new policy. If I have to ask if I need more, the answer is Yes.

I put the pipe to my lips, the smell of the herb sending a chill down my spine...I lived for this feeling. I then proceeded to light up and before I knew it, the bowl was half gone, my lungs burning from the preceding hits. How long had we been smoking? I looked around the car, noticing it was filled with smoke. This caught me as funny, and the next thing I knew, I was in a silent laughing fit. We cashed the bowl, sprayed some ozium, and made a quick check to make sure everything was cleaned up. We then drove into town just to kill some time and listen to a little bit of music.  [Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

As I drove, I felt captivated by the music as I usually do. This time was a bit different, though. I was no longer driving the car, but the car was pulling me through space. Yes. That was it. I was moving through space. Not driving on a road, but moving through space. I was no more a part of the earth, than the earth is a part of our solar system. I was an object, independent from those around me. I had felt like this before, but never so strongly. It was upon realizing this, that I felt the force of gravity pulling me down. It was a pleasant feeling...The next thing I knew, we were back at my friend's house. Feeling slightly disappointed, I sprayed one more spray of ozium and told my friend to get ready. We both knew that upon exiting the car, we were going to have to face the world. The moment was as epic as they come. Unfortunately, from the outside world, we were just feeling around for the door handles. We finally managed to get out of the car, and walked back over to the window. Damn window. How did I know that this was going to be a hassle?

My friend made it inside with apparent ease, giving me hope for myself. I put my hands on the base of the window and used what little strength I had in my wobbly arms to pull myself in. I ended up scraping a few layers of skin off my thumb, which seemed to bleed forever. Damn window. My friend then got on his computer and was lost to Counterstrike, so I needed to entertain myself. What better way to entertain myself than to play the original Super Mario Bros.

As expected, I kicked ass. In fact, I was kicking so much ass that, unfortunately, I died on the first level because time ran out. Man, and I thought I was going too quickly. Level 1-2 must have been a breeze, seeing as I don't remember playing it. I then warped to 4-1, and rather than killing everything in my path, I realized that these creatures meant me no harm, and I just stuck to avoiding them through the rest of the level. I then found myself at 8-1. What is it with me and having no recollection of playing the underground levels? I stumbled through 8-1 and 8-2 and got to 8-3. In 8-3, I engaged in several epic battles with the hammer brothers...and got my ass kicked. I stared at the 'game over' screen for about 30 seconds and then realized that I didn't know where I was. I looked around and realized I was still at my friend's house.

I watched him play counterstrike for a few moments, and made a mental note of how damn good he was. I saw his brain shifting through gears, monitoring every pixel on the screen. I saw his reflexes fly off the charts. I saw how dumb I looked staring, transfixed on the computer screen and snapped out of it. Wait....I snapped out of it? I needed more, I told myself. I climbed out of the window once more, packed another bowl, and smoked it myself. Oh, the sweet sensation. I went back inside, and used some Rhoto V for my eyes. It was the best sensation my eyes have ever felt. I could see my eyes dancing beneath the coat of ice that the eye drops had put over them. Wait, I could see my own eyes?

This threw me into another laughing fit. Where did this come from? I'm not this high am I? Did I just smoke again? Oh well, nothing matters now. Then I felt it....the rumbling. Shit, I had the munchies. I went to his kitchen, found a bag of tortilla chips, brought them back in the room and munched away. My friend started playing DJ Shadow in the background and, once again, I was entranced by the beauty of music. I saw all sorts of closed eye visuals that can only be described as abstract art and nothing more. Once I opened my eyes, they caught a hold of something. The case for 'Requiem for a Dream' glistened from across the room. I had never seen it before, and figured that now was the time. By far one of my top movies of all time now, and if you haven't seen it then I suggest you scroll down past a few of the spoilers I'm about to comment on.

-----start spoilers-----

When the guy's dealer got shot, and he got busted by the police, one thing went through my mind. If these drugs weren't illegal, then the black market would have never been created, meaning that the dealer would have never been shot, nor would he even be selling drugs because it isn't profitable. Making a substance illegal only creates a black market for that substance and makes it more dangerous for people to obtain it.

Then later when the grandson has to get his arm amputated, I thought to myself that if it weren't illegal and so discouraged to be a user of that drug, he would have/could have sought help long ago.

Who were these kids to go to, when the government isn't concerned about protecting their citizens, but rather prosecuting them? It was so illogical. All in all the movie really captured me and left me with a gaping feeling in my heart. Addiction really is a tragedy.

-----end spoilers----

If you had to skip the spoilers, I suggest you go watch the movie and come back to read my comments on it. The movie ended with me still coming down from my high. I looked at the clock and noticed that the numbers were illegible. The numbers just seemed to dance around, unable to be read. I was dreaming. For those of you who have seen waking life, you'll understand this reference. I then figured that the best way to wake up, would be to go to sleep in my dream. I pulled a blanket over myself and drifted into unconsciousness.

About two years ago, I had a very interesting experience with Marijuana.  It was different, but certainly not enjoyable.  Unfortunately because of this experience I have a hard time smoking up without getting a little bit anxious.  This experience has manifested into a bad association that has been difficult to shake off.

I was about eighteen at the time, and my friend had invited me to smoke up with her and a couple of her friends.  I agreed wholheartledy, seeing that I had smoked a few times before and had some generally good experiences. The person I was with had only smoked one other time before, so naturally she was a bit anxious.  I told her it would be alright, even though I was not too familiar with her friends or the person she had gotten her stuff from. (Always make sure you know the person you get your stuff from, I cannot stress that enough!)  

After school my friend and I went to her house, and then far off into a wooded area where all the potheads would gather secretly and quietly.  When I had arrived, the group consisted of my friend and I, as well as three other guys.  Even though I did not know the guys too well, they were nice and seemed to fit in with my kind of crowd.  My doubt had vanished when one of them complimented the Beatles t-shirt I had been wearing at the time.  

I began casually talking to the group, not really paying attention to the person rolling the blunt.  (I am not blaming the person who rolled the blunt, nor am I blaming any of the other people in the group for giving me funny stuff, but I think it would have been better if I was familiar with the dealer this particular herb came from). After a few minutes of waiting one of the guys held up the blunt and grinned, indicating that it was time to smoke up and have fun.  I sighed deeply, feeling the same nervous feeling I always felt whenever I smoked weed.  It was a feeling that pestered me and first but would always go away within minutes of smoking.  I am a small girl, weighing 105 pounds and standing at a whopping height of five feet and two inches, so I figured about five hits would do me good.  

After a few minutes, I felt the THC flood into my brain.  As usual, my feet went slightly numb and I began to feel that familiar warm sensation in my body.  After my body was warm, I began to feel things that were not too familiar, or too pleasant.  

As I walked out of the woods the plants around me seemed to mix together; as if I had been walking through a giant green painting.  I walked out of the woods and saw the concrete parking lot around me.  My vision was hazy and weird, sort of like a TV channel with very poor reception.  I had a hard time figuring out exactly where I was, and felt as if I had entered into a lucid dream.  

Suddenly, my friend gasps loudly and begins to take offrunning.  She yells out 'My dad is here! My dad is here!' So in a frenzy I took off running after her.  I suddenly felt as if  I had been running in slow motion, with time and the images around me moving at a very slow pace.  I could still see the giant green blot of trees next to me along with the sickenly gray concrete.  Next thing I knew my friend and I were inside of the bathroom of a nearby restaurant.  At this point my entire body had gone numb, including my mouth and my hands.  I was a bit confused as to how I had gotten into the bathroom; wondering how much time had gone by between the panicked run and now.     

I looked over and saw my friend hyperventilating next to me.  I asked her to please calm down, feeling as though I was on the verge of freaking out myself.  As we walked out of the bathroom, I heard my friend say to me 'I feel as if I'm in a dream, and my alarm clock is about to go off any second.'

I sat in the booth next to one of the guys I had smoked with, and I noticed that it was not just my friend and I who had felt the effects.  One of the guys was staring intently at a spot on the ground, with a sickening look in his eye.  Another guy sitting across from me was laughing, commenting on the fact that everyone in the room seemed like a cartoon character.  

I grabbed my cell phone and began dialing my friend's number.  It took me a few moments to dial the number right, but I felt I really needed to speak to her.  
She finally answered the phone and as I began to speak , she knew something was wrong.  I told her that I really wanted her to come pick me up and take me home, because I was feeling numb, and this dream-like state of mind was turning quickly into a nightmare.  She simply said to me 'Ok, I will be there in a minute.' I hung up my cell phone and looked across the booth.  One of the guys looked at me, and I began to hear him talking in my female friend's voice.  He was saying that he would give me a ride home, and strangely called me 'baby.' He began calling the guy next to him 'baby'  

'What?' I said to him in a disoriented manner.  All of these words mashing together in a strangely feminine voice were making me even more anxious.  His face looked confused and in his regular masculine voice said 'I wasn't saying anything.' Suddenly I remembered that at times my female friend used the word 'baby', and my slow brain finally realized that I had been hallucinating, hearing everyone speak in her voice  

I did not have the patience to wait for my friend, so I went up to the person I originally wanted to smoke with and told her I had to get the hell out of here.  We wandered around for a few moments, finally arriving at her house which was not too far away.  I felt the same slow-motion feeling I felt earlier, seeing more and more incoherent blobs of color as I walked. Thankfully her parents were not home, so we were allowed to relax a little bit. 

She had brought some crackers and green tea.  I stuck one of the crackers in my mouth and tried to chew.  I felt as if my mouth had fallen off, and was completely unable to chew or even swallow any of the food that felt to be floating in front of my face.  I sat on the couch feeling completely disconnected from my body.  I felt like I was gradually slipping in and out of consciousness, while my numb body attempted to jerk me back into reality.   

After about five hours I felt my high come down; I was able to feel all of my body parts again, and I no longer felt as if I had been floating around in a dream.  But this feeling of soberness did not last long. 

The next day I walked to school, and felt the same high feeling by the time I had reached my school's double doors. I wandered around the halls until I eventually found my classroom, and ended up failing the math test I had to take that morning. I did not understand the math problems, and I had accidentally written off the paper and onto the desk a few times.  Naturally, I got about a 15% on the test. I found my friend who I had smoked with, and saw my handwriting all over her binder. Apparently I had written some incoherent words on her binder with a pen, and did not remember doing it.    

I am not sure what it was I smoked that day, but I know for a fact it was not just straight herb.  When I tell people this story many of them say it was most likely PCP. I cant be 100% sure since I have never done PCP. All I know is that it is not something I would like to experience again.

On a day in December of 2007, I had made plans with my friend, whom Ill refer to as S, to hang out early in the day. Many times in the past, S and I have gotten together and 'Dexed out' because it was a lot of fun. I got up at about 7 oclock, getting ready to leave, as the walk to her house would take 2 hours. I got ready, and walked all the way over to her house so we could hang out. When I got there, I got rid of the extra stuff I had been carrying with me, and left it at her house as we left to go to the store.

We went to the store, and we had already formulated a plan for acquiring some Coricidin Cold & Cough (or Triple Cs as we called it often). We stole 2 boxes of the Triple Cs (which I don't recommend, they  should be purchased legally if possible), regardless of their Chloropheniramine Maleate content, which I wasnt worried about because we weren't taking overly large doses.  We left the store, and I immediately took 11 of the pills, and S took 9 of them, I kept the remainder of them in my pocket. 

We decided to go to a taco place to wait for them to kick in. We sat there, and I ate a quesadilla and a half, and she ate the other half of my unfinished quesadilla, and two soft tacos. We both began to feel the DXM kick in, and we were talking about how we couldnt get the smiles off of our faces. I then remembered that I had my mp3 player, so we started listening to music, which sounded far better, as the DXM was beginning to kick in. Then, she said that she wanted to go outside and walk around. 

Almost as soon as she got outside, she began to throw up. At the time, it didnt occur to me that it was very disgusting, but both of us were laughing, even her as she continued to throw up in the parking lot. We both marveled at the fact that she didnt seem to care about the fact she was puking.

We decided to walk to her neighborhood, and by now, we were both feeling the Dex. Movement felt interesting, so I was jumping around a lot, and just enjoying myself. We walked to her neighborhood, and we saw this group of little kids we knew in the street. They started running at us, and for a moment I kinda freaked because I didnt know what was up, and they asked us what we were doing. We explained the days activities thus far, and then we left the kids alone to do whatever they were doing. 

We decided to go to Ss friend Rs house to hang out, and so we walked there. I then marveled over the fact that I could run as much as I want and never get tired (which I dont recommend, because overexertion is very easy) and we soon got to Rs house. 
We sat in his room listening to music, and just were having fun. I was extremely content, just sitting on the bed with S and R. Next, we started smoking some marijuana, with the exception of S, who doesnt smoke. 

After taking about 3 hits off of a blunt, I was the most gone I had been in a long time. I was experiencing heavy flanging, to the extent that I could go downstairs, eat something, and then come back upstairs to find that it felt as if I had never went downstairs in the first place. I was perfectly happy, even to the point that I found Rap Music desirable, even though I normally detest it. The rest of the night was a mesh of smoking, listening to music, and trying to get reception on my phone to talk to people.

At about 8 oclock, it was almost time for me to get picked up by my mom, so me and S went back to her house. I then made plans to go see my girlfriend, who lived nearby, before I went home. I showed up at her house about 8:30, I was coming down quite a bit, and I could now concentrate pretty well on what I was doing. I got to her house, spent a few minutes with her, and then had to go back to Ss house. Almost as soon as I got there, my mom arrived, so I gathered my things from S, and got in my moms car. We talked about random things on the way home, I had no problem with conversation at all, and any deviation from normal behavior wasnt noticed, because I often act strangely when Im sober. I got back to my house, and spent a couple hours on my computer, talking to S, and recapping the days events. I went to bed, feeling perfectly content. All in all, it had been an extremely fun day, and one of many good DXM experiences Ive had. It just goes to show that responsible and educated use of DXM can yield amazing results.

Apart from the MDMA which I consumed at about 1:15 AM, I had been smoking a steady stream of marijuana since about 7. I have IBS and am on 100mg tabs of Amitriptyline every night (Amitriptyline is Elavil, a tricyclic antidepressant. The effects of MDMA with tricyclics has not been extensively researched, so I wanted to post this as an account of my experience.

After taking the pill, my first instinct was to take a shower. It felt great, but I wasn't really feeling the pill yet by the time I was done (about 20 minutes). I dried off, threw some clothes on, grabbed my trusty MP3 player, tossed on my boots, and walked out into the late spring night.

It felt great to be walking, like it took no energy at all, or maybe like I just had plenty of energy to spare. I don't get out much, so normally I get sore before long. The 'pain' in my hips that was slowly rising after a few hours of walking actually felt kind of good. This could have been some sort of interaction with the amitriptyline, as another use for it is a low to medium strength pain killer and CNS depressant.

I walked down by the old lighthouse near the Yacht club and walked out almost all the way. There was what I believe to be a skunk that I noticed scurrying away ahead of me. It didn't bother me, and I kept walking. After a while, I saw the small dark figure coming back toward me, and it kind of freaked me out. Instead of let it get to me, I just turned around and walked back toward the bike path.

Whenever I encountered a single pedestrian (there was a festival going on so there are drunks out for most of the night), I was OK, but I got nervous around multiple strangers. It felt like they knew, even though I knew they didn't.

I was expecting the usual sensory craziness associated with shrooms and other psychoactives, but instead of feeling fucked up, I felt great!

I walked all the way around downtown, eventually purely in the interest of finding something to drink. I found nothing, but it didn't bother me until I was about 3 blocks from home. I felt dehydrated, my throat was dry, and I felt like if I did anything else without drinking something I would throw up, or maybe collapse. The feeling did not worsen, and I got home and let the dogs out with no problem.

As I had a thin layer of sweat covering my body, I grabbed a cold Mountain Dew and cranked the central air. I then sat down here at about 4:45 to start writing this. I am most assuredly still under the influence of all three drugs ingested (one being the amitriptyline which doesn't seem to affect me in the 'fun' way anymore). I think if anything the CNS depressant effects enhanced the MDMA high and they combined for a great experience.

I feel the overwhelming urge to go pet the dogs now, so I will end this log. Thanks!

I was sitting in my friends basement at about 3 o'clock pm with my bong which we packed up with a vial of wet i had bought earlier that day.  The vial was equivalent to a nick or a 5 bag of grass.  The bong was smoked between only my brother and I, and before we were even half finished I felt the effects.  At first, I noticed that my hearing was different and I believed I could hear everything except for what I was saying.  In only a couple minutes the rest of it kicked in.

I tried to walk around the room and realized that it was extremely hard to do.  I could barely see anything but I could hear almost every single noise that anyone made.  Mentally, I thought that there wasn't a yesterday or a tomorrow, and that it was the end of the world. The effects lasted well until 10 o'clock pm.

I know that people would react to these feelings in different ways.  Honestly, I'm a fan of dark feelings and I loved it, but I also know that these feelings could cause some people to 'bug out'. Take my word that if you're a person that enjoys happy highs, you shouldn't even think of tryin wet or any other kind of PCP.  If you would enjoy this kind of stuff, I'm not trying to persuade or dissuade you to try it, but I must warn that you shouldn't do too much of it in a little amount of time.  Thats how one of my friends ended up in a mental institution.  So be careful with wet and PCP.

I had first tried weed almost a year before this night and was smoking regularly for about 5 months before this night. I thought I was very knowledgeable about the drug but this night really showed me otherwise.

We smoked through my friend's bubbler and the weed tasted of pine. Shortly after the first hit I could feel the muscles in my face and eyes completely relax. I was at a point where I very well knew I wasn't normal, but not quite high yet. 3 of us went through about 3 bowls at first. Now, we had already ordered the pizzas so it was only a matter of waiting. Quickly, paranoia set in. The phone rang and none of us answered it. As we ran into the room with the answering machine all we heard was, '...so I'll be there in a few minutes K.' 

We flipped out. My friend's parents were gone and no one was supposed to be there so we just flipped. None of us even attempted to listen to the entire message; we just left the place with pizzas on the way. As we drove around my friend's neighborhood time was so stretched out. Minutes felt like hours and I was shocked to find out how only 5 or so minutes had passed since we left the house. We passed the pizza guy, who was parked in the neighborhood, 3 times! As it turned out they simply couldn't find the house and were calling for some help. I think this is a great example of the paranoia that weed can sometimes cause.

My appetite became larger and larger. My stomach was like a never-ending pit. I ate 6 pieces of pizza, some mini ice cream sandwiches, and a hot pocket. I was still hungry. After feeding our gluttonous selves we smoked more. At this point (about 1-2 hours after the initial smoke) I started feeling an extremely painful headache. Stupid high me thought, 'Well it will go away if I get more high.' Well, it did go away, for about an hour. After that the headache just got worse and worse throughout the night. My skull was pounding, I was hungry, tired, yet I couldn't sleep because of my headache. This is the first time I've experienced an extreme headache of this sort with weed. Before we smoked my friend said it would be the most potent weed I've smoked and I COMPLETELY underestimated his warning. My brain throbbed and the coming down process seemed like it took days. Nearly 12 hours after the initial smoke the headache finally ceased yet my mind still felt very fuzzy.

All I can say is never over-indulge in weed you're not sure about. That night my mind felt like it ceased to function. Every word that rolled off my friend's tongues sounded beautiful. Every morsel of food tasted more delicious than I can remember. But an incredibly painful headache ruined my night and I will always be wary of how much I smoke from now on.

Mary Jane, the substance I have tried a good number of times but never felt too terribly amazing or anything drastically intense off of. One day, after I get my drug screening I decided I have a good two weeks therefore I can 'smoke up.' 

I called my friend and we picked up a couple of grams and got dropped off at a park for a couple of hours while my other friend had to take his GED test. We decided to smoke in the small wooded area next to the park. Now usually, the stuff I get, or have gotten in the past, with a few exceptions, makes me get a nice 'hazy' feeling and calms me. I do not know if the profound experience I achieved was because of the THC potency perhaps, or if it was because I just smoked too damn much for myself personally. After a good three hits I feel the normal 'high'. The woods seemed bigger, everything was nice and hazy, the feeling of some random asshole just happening to catch us from somewhere, the usual. After about five, it was cashed.

My friend then packed more. Now knowing I was completely getting fucked soon after about number 7, I decided to take 'smaller' hits. Why did I continue? Hell, I wanted to finish those damn two grams. It has been a month at least since I smoked last and I wanted as much as I could get. After the tenth, all I know is I felt like I had to fucking sit down. Smoking anymore just did not happen. He proceeded to finish what was left. Not only was I sitting down however, it appeared to me that I laid between two logs in an oddly uncomfortable position that at the time was like a bed. I looked up into the tree tops from down below, everything had a cartoony outline to it. Almost as if I expected to see fucking Bambi running through the forest. Apparantly I lost all my inhibitions and I was talking and stating the first things that came to my mind leaving my friend laughing his ass off on the ground. 'I've never been this high before!' 'Woo Wee!!!' 'Dude that bee just flew by me!' 'WOO WEE!' 'I'm Great!' Shit like that.

After I tried to recollect and not let myself talk out of my ass I sat up and decided I did not feel 'great' at all. I was beyond 'high'. I usually never get cotton mouth to begin with but this was the worst I have ever gotten in any circumstance. The forest had turned into a jungle. I had this goofy pain running from my head moving down to where my chest was, then starting over again at my head and repeating itself. Internally I began to panick. I told my friend I had to lay down and laid on the dirt on the 'jungle' floor. He kept reminding me that I was laying on the fucking ground and that I should try standing, that took a good minute.

I had never heard of anyone 'overdosing' from marijuana before and I kept telling myself that but the 'pain' thing did not subside. Heart rate check, seemed to be normal but I could not keep count as I would forget what the hell number I was on. I got a phone call. My short term memory was so damn bad that I forgot what I was saying or what we were talking about almost every single sentence. The person on the phone knew I was fucked because he asked me if I wanted to buy amphetamines and I told him no, under any other circumstance I would not have said that, but that's another story. My friend and I decided to walk to the park from the wooded area. We both agreed that we were going to get lost in the ten foot by forty foot little blotch of land. 

Once at the park, probably about thirty minutes later, it was no better. If you were to look at a 'Microsoft PowerPoint' slideshow (just anything that has changing slides) that's how I was viewing everything. Seriously I was watching the damn park in moving 'slides'. Even my friend complimented that to the sound of birds, which at this time seemed overwhelming, and the look of those woods about twenty feet away, it was a 'jungle'. The park slide was an elephant. We were waiting for my friend to come pick us back up and I could not wait because I needed some damn water for my mouth. Needless to say, I still thought I was going to die. When I did get some spit in my mouth I felt it come on really fast right before I spit it out. I thought my throat 'exploded' and I was about to spit blood. I almost saw it before it happened. I was reassured when I saw the white spit of nothingness. 

We kept hearing cars coming and as we both commented, we were both excited when we heard each car, in fact so excited, before we realized it was not our ride. We would SEE the fucking car (A little red 97' Eclipse) until we realized it was not him. We believed it was a conspiracy and that the same people were driving in circles just messing with us. A family with kids came to the park. I mean it was not obvious at all, NO WAY, I mean, you have two kids, blasted out of their own reality staring off into nothing sitting on a park bench. I'm willing to bet any money that this family thought we were heroin addicts and that they were telling their kids to stay away from people like us. This 'high' at this point was frightening and not too much fun. The car came.

Riding in the back, it felt like a roller coaster. My stomach turned. I was honestly scared. So scared in fact that not only we were going to crash but that I was going to die anyways. I kept checking my heart rate, seemed normal to myself anyways. I forgot where we were going and where we were two seconds after we turned onto any given street. We were going to my friend 'Ian's'. When we got there all I did was sit on the swinging bench staring off. I think there were five people packed on it. My original friend I was with went to smoke more. Soon I considerably started feeling good. The 'dissociation-fuckedupness-trippy' part was at least gone. And yes I am serious about that dissociation part, I was in my own world for the first hour, thinking about how my heart was going to explode. 

I was still staring off, everything still looked 'Cartoony', and I was not right, however it was all funny as hell now. Soon after we left, not knowing where the hell we went, we went to my other friend's work. They had food, and I was incredibly hungry. It was beyond any 'munchies' I have ever experienced, I loved it. My friend that smoked again claimed he in fact this time 'had never been this high before' as he proceeded to lay down not really talking. I was in the normal 'high' state now as I usually would be. My short term memory was fucked though. On the ride home, my friend turned up his bass incredibly. I could almost 'see' the fucking bass. Don't ask. When I arrived home about three hours later, I had to do a PreCalc assignment. Ha... Fuck that. That was not happening. I forgot how to do any of it and one problem would take me five minutes. Three and a half hours after 'ingestion' if you will, I tried talking on the phone. My girlfriend stated that I was not talking at all and I was just sitting there staring off blankly, not making sense, and on top of that not remembering what she was saying to me. I decided to go to bed.

The next morning I woke up and I was normal again thank God. All day however I would just gaze off. This whole experience makes me realize that it is not 'just weed'. Looking back though, I loved it. Even though I was scared shitless at first, I want to do it again right now! I have smoked prior to that but not to get fucked out of my mind. I took enough and stopped when I knew I would be 'high'. I have gained a lot of respect for the psychoactive I have smoked many times but never really given a shit about. I previously felt that there are better things out there that will 'mess you up' more. Not anymore. Marijuana has easily been shifted up to one of my favorites now as it did not use to be before. I think it just takes getting a little too much one time to realize the beauty of something fully, and that is what happened. I feel as though I have never truly been high before, as if there is a new damn meaning to 'weed'. 

On another note, I keep having dreams about the entire experience pretty much on a weekly basis and I love it.

My current girlfriend, C, and I have smoked weed together several times before this particular experience (and after), but this is the only time I actually got really 'stoned.' At the time of this experience, I was 20 and in college. Prior to this experience, I had smoked at least 10 times in my life, with only one other time that affected me at all. C was a much more experienced smoker in high school, however since then, she barely smoked at all. I was a late bloomer, I only drank a handful of times in high school, and smoked maybe 3 or 4 times.

This prior time a few months earlier, my girlfriend and I had smoked a bowl of hydro on my porch at home, and soon after I got back inside I felt waves of warm numbness come over me, and my vision began to shift and blur, and I got nauseous and ended up lying on the bathroom floor ready to puke for 10-15 minutes. However, I ended up not puking, and was able to force myself to return to baseline very quickly, and became extremely tired for the next hour and a half.

The recent time is a much different, and much better story. It was the middle of the fall semester, 2004, sometime during the week. Around 9pm-ish, my girlfriend rolled up a rather large joint of what her brother (our source, at the time) said was 'high quality mids.' We went out back behind my dorm, and walked along a path around a small lake on campus. There are several benches, bushes, trees, etc all along the path; however it isn't the best of spots considering the campus police station is on the campus side of the lake. This caused a little bit of paranoia, but not enough for me to freak out.

9:15pm:
We sat at the first bench we came to, which had a bush between us and the police station. We lit up, and passed the joint several times. I felt an overwhelming urge to stand up and walk, so we got up and walked down the path a bit, still smoking the joint. We got a huge amount of hits from this joint, it was packed very well. We sat down at a bench farther down the path, but then I immediately wanted to get up again. I decided I didn't want to smoke anymore, so I told her she could finish it.

9:30:
Just as we stood up, it hit us. Instantly, it was like a 'WHOOSH' and my head felt so clear, like a cool, calming breeze went through my brain, and my vision clouded for just a second, with colorful dots all over everything. C said her vision turned blocky, for just a moment, and said that she never had the come up happen as fast as this did. We tossed what was left of the joint, deciding against bringing it back by the police station and into the dorm, and began the seemingly long trek back to the back doors. My legs were so heavy, it was incredibly difficult to walk, and my voice took on that stereotypical stoner pitch, and I thought how odd it was that my voice would change just from smoking.

9:40:
We return to the back doors of the dorm, and go inside. We entered at the basement level, and had to go up 4 flights of stairs to get to my floor (3rd). I put a mint in my mouth, and we started going up. We got to the second floor and looked at the door, thinking it should say 3. Confusion ensued, but we were alright, and continued up to the next floor. Climbing this set of stairs seemed to take FOREVER. As I neared my floor, my mouth, while sucking on the mint, felt like it was floating around inside my head, sliding up and down and side to side.

We entered my suite (3 rooms of 2 people), and then went into my room. My suitemates don't smoke (they hate smoking) and I dislike my roommate, so I was very uncomfortable, and I felt my incredible high dissipating because I didn't want to be there. I told C, and we got up and decided to go to her room (she has a single) on the other side of campus. The walk over was refreshing, my legs weren't too bad.

10:00-12:00:
We sat in her room chilling, watching tv, surfing the internet, and getting so much uncontrollable laughter, it was so much fun, and incredibly relaxing. I didn't get the munchies at all, and neither did she. I can't remember everything that we found funny, there was just too much of it. However, there was one that I remember very well: at one point, I started concentrating on nothing in particular, and my head started to feel numb-like. I suddenly felt something around my head, and I said 'It feels like there's something on my head.' I reached up, and felt something. I got scared for just a moment, and realized it was my hat. Hilarity ensued, good times were had. Nearing midnight, we started to come down, but we were definitely still high, but more chill. It would come in 10-15 minute waves; nearing baseline, the high would intensify again, and then relax several minutes later, then intensify. It wasn't uncomfortable in any way.

This was my first time being stoned, and so far only time I've ever been that high (time of writing is in May, 2005). I've smoked several times since then, but I guess not near the amount that we smoked that night. I love weed, and plan on continuing experimenting with it.

The first time I really ever got high off of marijuana was back in high school. I can remember it quite well to this day, as getting high for the first time is as big a mile marker of my life as the day I lost my virginity. It was my sophomore year during a school day. However school was not in session on this day, for whatever reason (PTA conferences?) and my friend John had spent the night before at my house. My parents were out of town for the day but were to return that evening. 

Early in the afternoon, John and I were at my other friend's house (Mike's house). Mike had a large stash of marijuana, and was my supplier from that point on throughout high school. His parents were at work, so it was just the three of us getting into whatever trouble we possibly could. He packed a bowl, and we headed out to the back yard. Each of us took deep hits, held it in, and ran around the yard to get the heart pumping while the smoke was still in our lungs. We did this several times through until two bowls were completely cached. Holy crap, here come the vibrations.....

Immediately I had lost all sense of what time it was and where the hell we were. What felt like hours was only minutes. We were no longer in our hometown. We were at a cabin up in some dense forest out of the sight of others. We sat around staring into space, quite incompacitated. Then John shrieks 'Holy shit dude, I got to get to your house really quick, my mom's supposed to pick me up!' I had stolen my father's truck for the day, and what would have been an easy 6 mile drive home to any sober person was a perilous journey across countries for two young stoned high school students who had no experience driving while innebriated.  [Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  I was completely terrified, nearly to the point that John had to threaten physical injury on me if I didn't get myself together. So we left. Slowly.

I had to turn the stereo off so that I could keep every ounce of focus that I had left on the road. I drove at the 10 and 2 positions, going no faster than 20 miles an hour and taking every residential detour possible that could get us to where we needed to be. I was seeing nothing but frames, like watching a slow movie projector. My sense of depth and coordination were completely out on vacation. God it felt like we were driving for hours, and I had no idea where the hell we were but it wasn't our town. Finally we somehow reached my area and John had me pull over at the neighborhood convenience store so that he could get something to drink and some gum to conceal the crime we committed. 

While he was in the store, I seemed to have passed out, or at least gone into a very deep stoned trance. Was I asleep? Had I died? The next thing I knew, I heard him tapping on the window to let him in. I snapped up and yelled 'Holy jesus, where the hell are we?' 

'We're by your house, you moron.'

'How long were you in there? Fuck man, it felt like you were gone for hours!'

'Dude, I was in there for 3 minutes.'

So he climbs in and I'm trying to shake the webs out of my head. Clearly I had become a victim of a wormhole or some time warp. I knew that somehow I had been zoned into a very bad movie, where we were isolated in the middle of nowhere, stopped at a solitary convenience store with no bearing. Tumble weeds blew across a unpaved path that stretched into oblivion. And its just us, in my dad's old chevy pickup, driving with no insurance coverage.

By god's grace we made it home in time for us to park the truck in the driveway, go inside and pretend that we hadn't left. John's mom came shortly to pick him up for wrestling practice and I stumbled with my back pack to get my homework ready for attempted completion. The sun was receding under the horizon and I scrambled to get my chores done in time before my folks showed up. For some reason I kept hearing voices, like as if a tv was on. Every time I looked in the den, the tv was off. Paranoia was sinking in, as I was fearing that I was never going to come down from this and my parents were going walk in at any minute and find me warbling in madness. Thankfully, by the time they showed up, I was coherent enough to carry a conversation, but my mother was raging pissed about something she found in a pocket of a jacket I had left in the car they took. Also my dad confronted me about using the truck, as it was apparent that I had moved it from its original location.

My first time getting high off Cannabis was a rainy afternoon in April. I had tried it once before with no result. The night before I had tried to hook up with a friend who had a few grams, unsucessfully. On this day however I caught up with him and he asked me to meet him down at a local coffee shop. I brought another friend with me, who did not wish to smoke. He informed me that we would be smoking in the of car of one of his friends, I consented and we got in the car. We started driving around. The driver took wout a very crude bong made from a plastic bottle, a bic pen and a piece of aluminum foil.

The friend who we had met began packing the bowl with some unscrupulous looking brown schwag. I pulled out my lighter and we started. I got maybe 3 hits off of it. I didn't feel a thing. At this point it was decided that the piece sucked and we would have to call someone else. He tried calling 3-4 people, none of which were available, but then he called an old friend of mine who I had not seen in years. We went and picked him up. 

He was packing a very nice glass blown pipe, a lighter and a very nice bag of weed that garnished ooo's and ahhh's from everyone in the car. After a couple hellos and the packing of a bowl, we began to smoke again. This time it hit me like a ton of bricks. All of a sudden I felt pressure behind my eyes and the world began to flash and swirl. Everything was flashing black and white, but at the same time everything was swirling like lava with crazy psychedelic colors. We kept driving, I got a couple more hits from this very nice little pipe. By this time I couldn't move very coherently, nor talk or understand what anyone was saying. 

After a little while, my non-smoking friend and I were dropped off back where we had been picked up. We stumbled back to the coffee shop where I asked him to get me a coffee, as I could hardly stand up straight now. We stayed there for a while, I stared off into space, everything was all crazy colors and the ground was moving. The sky ad turned pink and I was very confused. We went and got some pizza and then headed to his house which was quite a walk. On the way I started having some crazy hallucinations, so before long we had to stop at a park by a pond and sit down. The pond was amazing, the whole thing was glowing, even at night and there were all these glowing things shooting up from the surface. I looked away from the pond momentarily where my attention was fixated on three nearby puddles which seemed to form a series of numbers, 098. I thought it was a sign from god because they were all glowing a floating and moving. I tried to point them out to my friend which proved difficult, but after about five minutes he said he saw them. He could have been lying, but its okay.

At this point we once again set out to his house. By this point I was seeing things all over the place. I'm not really sure how we got there, but along the way all of the leaves looked like floating butterflies and I thought I saw little animals (rats?) running in the street. The pavement was forming crazy glowing patterns and the rain sounded like techno. In my peripheral vision there were glowing black and white dots that danced around. When we were nearing his house (I think?) I started seeing this person wearing a pink shirt and long white socks following us. I told my friend, but he said no one was there, we kept walking and I kept looking, but the person kept walking behind us. At this point I think my friend was getting kinda freaked out by what I was telling him. We started walking faster until we reached his house, thankfully no one was home. I sat down on his couch as I came down.

All in all the hallucinations lasted about 3 hours, and the regular effects lasted maybe 6 hours, tapering off at the end. I still feel this every time I smoke. I don't know if this is normal or not, but what I have read here makes it seem abnormal. I don't know what to think.

I would consider myself an avid smoker. I had been getting high since I was 14 and had never stopped for more than a period of a few months. At the time of the instance in question, I was 19 and I had been smoking quite frequently - almost a gram/day - and had also been drinking as well as experimenting with other substances. I had never really endured a seriously bad trip with any drugs, be it alcohol, hash, speed, etc. and I had definitely never imagined that weed of all things would be the drug to push me over the edge.

A couple years ago, I had considerably my only 'bad' experience with weed. It wasn't very severe, nor did it last never long. I had smoked a session with a couple of my girl friends and we had began to walk to my other friend's house. On the walk there I immediately felt the effects kick in, however it was much more intense then anything before. I felt I was slipping in and out of a dream state. Like one minute I would feel as if everything happening around me was just a dream, and the next I would 'wake up' and feel momentarily 'sober'. This cycled for about 2 hours. It wasn't necessarily unpleasant, just very unusual. I had a mild panic attack, fearing I couldn't distinguish reality from this dream state. But I never acted out or even said anything to my friends. This was the only strange experience I'd had with weed up to date.

Last night however, I had gone out to meet a friend and smoke a J before going to bed. This was a typical habit as I had been meeting up with him and smoking several times a week now. He had already rolled the weed (about a gram I'd say) and we began smoking it in the cold, outside an old school. Everything seemed normal, and I had smoked about 1/2 the joint, which was usual. I felt disappointed at first as my friend was clearly feeling the effects, while I hadn't been hit with any of the high. I guess my first mistake was underestimating this feeling. I took a few more hard tokes and decided that I just wasn't in any condition to feel the high (this sometimes happens to me, I just plain don't get high even off of good weed and a good amount). My second mistake was probably my decision to smoke at all that night. I had been nursing a bad hangover all day as well as feeling the after effects of some hash smoked the night before as well as some seriously laced weed. My body had been weak and my stomach and head felt upset most of the day. However by the time I had met up with my friend I felt normal and figured smoking would merely put me to sleep.

About 30 minutes after smoking I began to feel a really strong high. It was a fun high, nothing out of the ordinary. My buddy and I always have really awesome highs and trips and I trust him more than anyone, especially when it comes to drugs. We were talking about philosophy when I suddenly felt a rush throughout my body. It was like a wave of cold starting from my feet and becoming growingly more intense as it reached my head. Everything felt weird. I started feeling a bit dizzy and my balance started to weaken. Its odd though: the conversation continued completely normal and my speech as well as my mental processing weren't affected while this body rush was happening. The last thing I remember was this feeling overwhelming my entire body.

I woke up a few seconds later on the ground. My friend was shaking me and was extremely worried. The only thing I could feel was a sharp pain as I had hit my head against the side of the building as I had fallen. I didn't remember falling over or blacking out what-so-ever and when I opened my eyes my brain scrambled to figure out why the hell I was lying on the ground. My friend helped me up and asked what was going on. He started tripping out a bit because he didn't understand what had just happened. I was still high, but my body felt really weird. It was weak and I didn't know why I had just blacked out. My friend carried me on his back to my house where I crawled into bed. I couldn't fall asleep and everything seemed like it was in slow motion. I couldn't tell how fast or slow time was moving and I couldn't feel my body at all. It wasn't scary or anything, just really strange.

I woke up the next morning feeling completely fine, as usual after a night of smoking. I guess the reason I blacked out was my body's overall state. I guess I hadn't recovered well enough from the night before and smoking that joint had been a breaking point almost. For now I think I am going to slow down on my smoking and even try to quit for a couple months. My body has been in bad remission since the summer and I owe it a break from drugs in general.

First of all I would like to state that I am an amazing light weight when it comes to pot, 2 joints of good pot and ill be at the puking stage.

I brought 1/8oz of pot off my dealer and I was told it was 'very trippy stuff'. I smoked 1 joint and a couple of bowls of this stuff with my mate R and got very high, my girlfriend then called up to tell me that a bloke called J had a free house and if we brought pot we could stay round his. On the way to his house I kept hearing arguments and fights on the streets I was walking past, I also heard my family calling me and got very paranoid. I kept repeating 'You're just tripping, it's not real, if it was someone  they would have come over to you, voices can't hurt.' 

After this first experience I realized the awesome power of this particular strain, it seemed to be something like white rhino. The next night I went to bed early and smoked about 1/4 of a bowl full. I put on the chillies on my headphones and examined the artwork on the green day 'insomniac' album. I then began to stare at a psychedelics poster I have on my door, this is where it started to get really strange.

The poster grew to fill my entire vision and became black and white. The pattern then began to circle itself and make smaller more detailed patterns, I laid back and shut my eyes. The pattern faded to blackness but this blackness seemed to morph in some kind of way to the music, it was as if I was aware of it morphing but could not see it. After thinking about this for a long time (15 seconds?) I realised that I must be moving around a shape so I perceived it to be morphing. As soon as I realised this I began moving in empty 3D space to the music. This has happened to me when tripping before. I then tried to move myself in this 3D space. This was the turning point in the trip.

I managed to move myself but I also moved to the music so that every point of myself that I was aware of became a line (Kinda hard to explain but I basicly stretched every part of me) I then panicked slightly but realised I could undo it. For the next 10 seconds or so I played with this new trick (Stretching arms - legs - penis etc) The bizare thing is that I could actually feel these things changing. I then realised that if I can do this with my perceived physical body then I can do it with my mental self. The first thing that occurred to me is how much of a huge cock I could have if I played with this kind of auto hypnosis (is it?). I then told my head to make some kind of backup of my old self which I could go back to. I have no idea if this worked or not. I then tried to mess with my personality and make myself nicer. I actually felt the change and a kind of warm feeling in my chest, I also suddenly thought of all the loop holes in this change and how I could get walked all over etc. I then spent a while thinking and then realised the best thing to do was to repeat 'I wish everything and everyone was great and I was great to my self and to everyone else' I must have repeated this loads of times and I definatly felt my self change.

I then have a blank spot and I can't remember what personality attributes I assumed. But I seem to remember that what I was repeating changed to 'I wish me and L (my girlfriend) will be happy for ever.' Since I can't influence what L thinks I believe that I must have thought I had formed some kind of psychics link or had a transcendental moment in which those kind of things were within my grasp(!).

The music then changed to the next track which didn't feel so great so I opened my eyes and had one of those moments I often have on mushrooms or sometimes acid where the ceiling seems layered and doesn't make any sense, I then turned off my music and drifted off to sleep. The whole experience seemed to last anywhere between 5 and 15 mins, although I have a huge blank spot.

Since this trip I think I have noticed some subtle changes in my personality (mostly positive). I have also noticed that now if I trip alone I get very conscious of and paranoid about my own body and have thoughts like 'Have I cracked my teath?' or 'Have I pissed my self?' etc.

I don't smoke very often, I'll get weed maybe once every 2 months at most. Well, I was kinda craving it one day, because I hadn't had it in a while. So I this black guy told me he had some 'bomb hydro', so I'm like, 'alright.' I paid 10 bucks for a nug of this stuff and I was excited to smoke it. My parents were out of town, but my crazy, Romanian aunt was staying with me. So I told her I was going to a friends house or something. 

There is this little hill by my house that has a wonderful view of the Las Vegas valley. I decided to go smoke up there and enjoy the sunset, but when I got there I decided not to for fear of being seen by some people that were at the bottom. 

My little section of my neighborhood is on like the edge of the desert, so I decided to go south to the end of the last street where there was some construction. I smoked a bowl of the stuff and at first it was just the usual high, but it got pretty intense later on. 

I decided to take my CD player to listen to some music while walking around the neighborhood, but I had forgotten to bring this adapter that lets me plug my headphones in. Anyways, I got up to walk down the street. At first I was planning on walking around the whole loop that is my entire neighborhood which is about 3 miles or so, but I'm not sure, it's big though. It was completely night by now, and I started getting paranoid so I decided to stay in my little area and just walk in a circle. 

Well, I walked down the street, made a left, then another left and walked back the other way. This is when it started to get good, I was looking at the shadows that the bushes were leaving. I could see all sorts of things in the shadows and the bushes themselves. I walked some more and by now I was on the same street  that I started on, but on the other side. I walked down some big boulders and sat down. I looked out across the construction site and saw this flat field, and I can see the star light covering an area that I decided was about the shape and size of a football field. Then I looked to the left of it and I saw what I decided were Aztec Ruins. Then there was this statue in front of it, and I it was 'beckoning' me to enter, but I told myself, 'never trust a statue, they are sneaky.' Then I saw what appeared to be a 'two-story dump-truck' coming down this hill, and I freaked out and scrambled up the rocks like 'Spider Man' but then I realised that I left my CD player at the bottom, so I ran back down, and the truck was gone. 

So I got my CD player and went back to where I started, I was really freaking out now, I went into this house that was still being built, I went into where the laundry room would be and just sat there hugging my knees for I don't know how long. I started getting so scared, I kept thinking of 'the cop flashing the flashlight in my face.' And I kept thinking of what I would say if someone found me in there. After a period of time (not sure how long) started to see things run across the ground. I thought they were lizards, but there were so many that I decided they weren't even there. Then when I stood up I saw a piece of metal on the ground, about one foot long. But, it was moving, so I wasn't sure if it was another lizard or not, but in my mind I knew it wasn't. 

I then decided that 'a wanted man cannot stay in one place for to long,' so I headed for home, 'like a thief in the dark, I went back to my halls.' I still out of when I got home and it was hard acting straight in front of my aunt because she kept talking to me. 

I never reacted that way on weed before, and I've gotten so stoned in my days that all I could was sit there and try not to look like I was passing out. I think the reason I had a bad trip like that is because ever since my best friend moved away I haven't enjoyed any high. Me and him, we were best buds, we got high for the first time together, and we never smoked with anyone else. We were pretty close and ever since he left all my drug experiences have not been that good. I didn't actually not enjoy the trip, I was just scared. It was like a roller coaster, its scary, but fun.

All in all, it was a learning experience I suppose, next time I will be more calm and not be so paranoid.

Okay this is a good one. I used to smoke alot, it was summer, there was nothing to do, so my friend and I took up smoking. Well after a few months of smoking every weekend and some weekdays we tried something new. We wanted to get as messed up as we ever had in our entire lives so we each bought a quarter and rolled 3 joints. We went out in his back yard at around 11 PM, each with our own joint. We finished with that bout 15 min. later. We then went inside to watch TV. About 10 min. after we smoked, we started feeling moderately high, so we broke out the third joint and shared it. After the third joint we were stoned, very stoned.

So my friend gets the idea to pack a bowl, we smoked it, and it didnt have any immediate effects, so we did another, and then another. We reached a point that we had never been to, it was near insanity, and then we did one more bowl. Now that you know how much is in us, I can tell you what happened to me, or at least what I can remember. 

We were flipping through tv channels, and too me it seemed like the channels were parallel dimensions, on one channel there was a cowboy, he lived on cowboy world, on another there was a cartoon. We watched that after 10 min of that, I got so developed in the story that I started crying when the main character lost his pencil, I stood up and ran to my friends room, flew to his bed, because by this time I had flying powers but didnt feel like using them much.

On his bed I started crying and I closed my eyes for what had to be no more than 10 seconds but what I saw was incredible to say the least. Its hard to explain, but I relived my entire life, I was seeing things that I had completely forgotten about in my sober state, and I wasnt just remembering them, I was actually living them! 

Upon opening my eyes, I see my friend in the corner of the room, staring at me, while on all fours. Before I could tell him what I saw, he pounced on me like a tiger, and I screamed at the top of my lungs, which was bad, seeing as it was 12:30-1 o clock at night. He started hitting me as hard as he could, like he was trying to kill me. Well I could only feel the sensations of the blows, but not the pain, so I started hitting back, we fought for an eternity and while we were we were laughing so hard. When we got done, we laid on the ground and passed out from exaustion.

This was incredibly fun.

It wasn't until about 8 months ago that I started smoking weed. It was never really anything that I didn't want to do, or thought was wrong, it just wasn't something that was high on my list of priorities. The first few times I got high, I did enjoy myself, but I didn't really get to thoroughly enjoy myself because it just so happens that I become very antisocial while high, and those times I smoked, I was around a lot of people, which made me nervous and paranoid. This was especially intensified by the fact that it doesn't take much at all to get me very high.

However, when a friend of mine gave me some weed as a gift, I had the opportunity to get high in the comfort of my own home. I smoked 5 hits in a period of 5-10 minutes, and a few minutes later I was stoned as hell. The reason I become antisocial is because I feel like a completely different person while high, and the way I process thoughts becomes so vastly different, I am unsure how I'm supposed to behave around other people, even if they're high as well. I had never been this high before, and instead of simply exploring different ideas and thoughts, my imagination ran wild. I had minor visuals around the corner of my eyes, which seemed to be different colored shapes, geometric but not in any real pattern.

I decided to turn on some music, so I got online and asked a friend to recommend me a song to download. He's a major fan of techno, so he sent me Ferry Corsten - Rock Your Body, Rock. Listening to this song later while sober, I still like the song quite a bit, but not nearly as much as when I listened to it the first time while high. Most people I talked with who have heard it hate the song. 

So I put my headphones on, hit the play button and closed my eyes. As soon as the first beat started, it immediately hit me. I wouldn't say that it was a total hallucination, but it's like the weed had heightened my imagination and my perception to such a great extent that I was visually seeing the music in my head. The whole song was linear in that it was happening along some kind of track, with a black background. It's like it was one long and skinny wave that changed as the music changed. It started off as some kind of rod with all sorts of black pistons driving out of it, and then the true melody of the song hit. This ribbon was born out of the pistons, it had tons of tiny little spikes driving out of it, making it look fuzzy. Each spike was a different color, and it was also striped different colors along it's length. When the song's melody would change, the ribbon would pulse while flowing along from the beginning to the end. As the music would die down a bit, the ribbon would as well, and then slowly the energy would start building up, climaxing, the ribbon just hit some kind of crazy peak and exploded, going faster and bursting with more energy than ever. 

Every note, every beat, every part of the song was somehow in my head, contributing to this strange hallucination. I know that it was partially my imagination creating a lot of it, but at the same time I had no control over it, the song was presenting itself to me the way my mind interpreted it. The song has two parts which build up into the explosion of energy and both are fairly similar to each other. The second part of the song, it became so intense that my eyes started fluttering up and down, and I was seeing flashes of white light, so I was forced to open my eyes and gather myself for fear I would go into a convulsion.

I will never forget this experience. The way the song looked and felt is still extremely clear in my mind when I recall the memory. I often play the song while high to this day, though I don't let myself get too carried away, because the intensity of what happened wasn't in any way unpleasant, but probably too intense for me to handle. I have had similar experiences with a few other songs (mostly techno), though they haven't been as intense. I tried to draw a picture of what it looked like, but unfortunately it proved difficult to give it the proper detail without showing how it moved.

Last night I got a good 4-5 grams of new weed. It had little blonde hairs, but they were nothing special, they were short and generic. Amazingly, this was the most stunning weed experience I'd ever had. I took 5 long hits out of a water bong a friend made for me. I wasn't expecting anything new -- but boy did I get a surprise. My memory went extremely bad during this experience, so I might leave out a lot.

First of all, I noticed all the regular feelings: smiling, giggles, confusion, and as usual I couldn't remember where I put my bag of weed and my lighter. Once I found them, I went inside to use my computer, but walking around in my house seemed uncomfortable because it reminded me too much of being sober. Because of that, we decided to go for a walk outside on a bikepath. I brought along 2 cherry cigars for all of us so we could have a good time. At this point people's voices had already begun to get messed up, I was having the whole tin-can effect. Anyway, we proceeded with walking along the pathway, and about 1/2 of the way down this bike-path, everything got slightly blurry and a little harder to focus on. We stopped to rest at a large tree by the ditch, and I noticed a repeating pattern in front of my eyes, like a sheet of this pattern was layed over my field of vision. To put it simple, it was like looking at something thats 99% transparent, so I could barely make this pattern out. At this point I assumed we had some extremely good weed.

Anyway, my 2 friends told me to close my eyes. I had heard of people seeing 'closed eye visuals' on shrooms, so I thought 'why not?' So I closed my eyes. For the first 5 seconds I saw nothing, but then I saw little rainbow zig-zags, 4 of them, then 8, then they shot out in every direction making a geometric pattern, then they filled my vision and disappeared. Next came squares made out of rainbow, and they did the same thing. I was getting sick of things made out of rainbow color patterns so I tried to make something else appear, and startlingly, I could visualize anything I wanted to like it was right in front of me, though I could still tell it wasn't real.

Next I thought of icebergs, and they doubled everywhere and waved up and down then zoomed away. So we kept walking along the path, and at this point I think im qualified to say that I was tripping. The more I closed my eyes, the more vivid the hallucinations were. If I wasn't trying to see what I was thinking, my mind would usually generate some pattern that you might see on a stone-tile floor, like a blue flower carved into a grey tile (this is the floor at my grandparent's house, but I still can't see the connection). It was like my mind designated a certain pattern to be repeated. I also learned that I could visualize whatever I wanted without it turning into a pattern, but it was more fun to visualize patterns so that's what I did.

Probably the most stunning part of the whole trip was when I visualized a splash of water very small and far away from me, then suddenly it zoomed up and slapped me in the face. Basically the whole way home I had my eyes closed, and I was just pissing off my 2 friends who had both had less hits than me. I sat down for about 10 minutes and just 'watched' the amazing fireworks display. After that the visions were fading so I decided just to keep my eyes open. We went to burger king and got some food, then we went home and pretty much fell asleep. 

All in all, this was the best high I've ever had.

First of all, I'm glad to know I'm not the only one this has happened to.

I'd smoked cannabis off and on for years recreationally.  It has never taken very much to satisfy me.  A 10 dollar bag could easily last me 3 months.  My favorite pastime was to 'light up' and watch silly science fiction movies.  I always had a good time.

Then out of the blue, everything changed.  I enjoyed a few hits with some friends and went home to watch movies.  Within minutes I was overwhelmed with pure terror.  I spent a good hour on the phone with my mom bawling hysterically.  By the way, did I mention I was 30 at the time?  I'd smoked since I was 16.  I managed to conceal the fact I was stoned, just very upset.  That experience was enough to scare me away for a few months.

A few months later I lit up with the same friends.  Two hits.  I felt the panic set in within 10 minutes.  The only thing that kept me going was making them laugh as much as possible with my horrid impersonation of Biggie Smalls.  Somehow I managed.

Six months later I enjoyed two hits with my roomate and his girlfriend.  The panic slammed into me again.  I felt as if my heart rate had broken 200 beats per minute.  I felt cold, dislocated, and petrified.  I was afraid to go to sleep thinking my heart or breathing would stop.  Nothing happened of course, and my roommate and his girlfriend were very supportive and kind to me.

A month later I tried one in a very social setting.  I could feel the panic rising but managed to keep myself distracted enough to maintain composure.  How unenjoyable it is to go 'under the influence', and then not be able to wait for it to end.  A week ago I did the tiniest hit you could imagine.  Jerry Garcia would be laughing at me.  Sure enough, here come the panics again but at an extremely subdued level.

Folks, I don't understand this at all.  I have taken some extremely potent substances in my time and nothing has had the same devastating effect.  I have no theories, ideas, or anything to give a remote hint.  I've thought maybe it's a chemical change that happens when you grow older.  Maybe it's something used in the cultivation of marijuana now.  Maybe it's a potency issue.

I know quite a few people who've had to deal with this happening to them, and it's scared most of them permanently sober.  I've even heard of people mixing tranquilizers like Xanax in with their cannabis experience, which seems kind of self-defeating as THC is supposed to RELAX you.

I sure hope someone has some ideas.  I'm completely baffled and haven't smoked it since.

Well at this time I was 14 and I had smoked here and there and know what it was like to get decently stoned.  I didn't buy it with my own money.  I just did it when one of my friends asked if I wanted to or just to pitch in a few dollars and did it.

At this time it was new years eve and for once I decided to buy a bag for myself so I called up one of my smoker friends.  For x-mas I recived around $200 and told my friend I don't plan on spending much.  Well there were some good mids going around for $25 and thats just was I was looking for.  I went over to his house and from there we went over to the house of who was hooking me up.  I entered the house and to my suprise there were 4 people in there that I all knew but one.  I previously knew that they were potheads.  The whole room was cheeched out so bad if I would have waved my hand I could have seen smoke being pushed around.  I sat down, looked at the bag and confirmed the purchase.  Then one of them said 'Have you used the zong before?!'  I just replied no with a blank face.  After I said that everyone in the room went crazy.

They whiped out this 3 foot high bong with the mouth piece theat zig-zaged up.  They packed in half of there 'Titan nugg' and half of my mids.  The bowl piece was so huge that it could fit a dime in it and be somewhat loose, but he packed it so tight we had to poke it about 4 times.  Well I started it off and holy shiza this thing kicked my ass. The thing was so huge it took me 3 times to clear it out.  On my second hit it was torched by the person before me.  This hit was so big it took me about 4 times to clear out. Then got one more equaly big as the first.

Well I hadn't smoked in almost a month before this.  I was just sitting there and felt a decent buzz.  It started to kickin within 5 min.  I started to feel sick cause it was so smokey inside so I said I'm going outside for some fresh air.  Here is where it hit me...hard.  I leaned against the side of the house breathing in the fresh air and it started to creep on me.  I looked down at my feet and BAM it hit me.  It seemed as if my feet were serouisly ten stories down.  It felt as if my vision was going higher and higher into the sky but my head wasn't moving.  It felt as if I was being lifted out of my body.  When I felt this I didn't want to leave so I snapped out of it and then bam I would be right back in normal vision, completely in my body.  I did this a few times and when snapping back into my body it startled me.  Then my whole legs went numb.  My legs and the trashcan next to me started to flash violently like a strobe light going very fast.  My friend and the other smoker I knew best and was sorta cool with came out.  We started to just chill and talk. My friend asked if he could drop us off downtown.  He didn't mind so off we were.

It was very cold out so after about five minutes me and my friend decided to go back to his house. On the way back is where it hit me harder.  We were skating back and while I wasn't pushing I would zone out.  I had my hand over my mouth and nose so when I breathed it helped heat up my face.  This made my hand in the bottom of my vision.  It seemed my vision was given another dimension.  Like it was just a well draw 2d picture so it looked 3d, but then my hand became the 3rd dimension of depth.  It started to stretch out towards me.  This happened to me about three times and snapped out of it after about ten seconds.  This happened to me several other times but with objects with a color that stuck out.  Like the white road in between the grass.

We got to my friends house (this was probably about 45 min after we smoked) and went straight downstairs because his mom was home and we didn't wanna walk around the house doing what we wanted all stoned.  He put in bad boys II and lit up some insence.    When I was just sitting there watching it I experienced two more mind boggling effects.  The room was dark and the TV was the only thing on.  I got 'tunnel vision', or so it seemed, but different.  My whole outside vision around the TV turned a deeper black.  You know when you stare at something bright then look away you see bright spots where the light source was in your vision?  Well, where the deeper shade of black was around my vision of the TV those same spots showed up, but there were about 20 of them.  They danced around and turned in circles.  This kind of freaked me out so I blinked and everything turned back to normal.

The next thing that was very intense, the light of the TV was on my legs, and my legs started to violently flash again like a fast strobe light.  My legs seemed to get a 2d, flat like a piece of paper look.  Then the 2d shape of my legs started to stack on top of each other with a small gap.  They stacked up in an instant.  They stacked up to what seemed to be right under my eyes.  While this happened each layer was still flashing rapidly.  I zoned out like this for about 5 seconds then snapped out of it.

After all of this I started to come down.  I stayed at my friends house and later smoked 2 Js with the same smokers cept the one I didn't know when they came over.  This was just a normal high.

I am a professional singer with repertoire ranging from Oasis to opera, Mozart to musicals. I have been performing for nearly ten years, starring in numerous productions, as well as being the recipient of many prizes, awards, and scholarships from a plethora of competitions. I currently study classical singing with the recognized best teacher in the city where I reside. I also smoke marijuana approximately once a week, and have been doing this for almost three years. I would like to comment on the relationship between these two activities, in an attempt to allow other singers to understand some of the pros and cons of the effects of smoking marijuana on their vocal abilities. If I use any technical jargon which confuses a reader, I apologize in advance and suggest that the viewer use a reputable voice site to seek a definition.

First, to dispel a common myth that successful singers do not smoke marijuana, I would like to point out that one of the more successful male Broadway performers today spent about five years fighting an addiction to marijuana and still managed to be the star of an incredibly successful musical. He has gone on to star in other hit shows, as well as produce some of his own. 

Now, to more specific comments. During the actual high, I have found that while my singing ability may be slightly diminished, due, I suspect, to the damage done to my throat by the harsh smoke. My sense of pitch is augmented, and comments have been made by professional singers (who were unaware of my state) to the effect that my tuning is improved. Second, certain concepts critical to good singing, including relaxed jaw, open throat, and breathing into the diaphragm, seem easier to apply when stoned. The vocal range also seems to expand, so I who normally have a little more than two octaves in my comfort range can easily hit notes when stoned that present difficulty when not. I also find that vibrato in the voice is increased, probably due to the relaxing effect of marijuana on the body. 

This is not to say that I endorse or recommend performing while high, particularly not classical music, primarily because the lovely, languid, eased out feeling of being blazed can interfere with focus, concentration, and memory. Personally, I have rarely performed while stoned, though I know many successful opera singers who frequently go on stage while stoned.

The day after smoking, the voice is almost completely returned to normal. While an open throat is still much easier to achieve, the cells in the throat which were killed by the smoke have yet to completely regenerate, so singing can be slightly painful and some singers complain of excessive mucus on their vocal cords the next day. As to long term effects of smoking marijuana on the voice, the primary one is the damage inflicted on the cilia which are responsible for clearing mucus from the throat. Apparently, it is very easy to identify a smoker by examining their vocal cords, and while cigarettes are not as damaging (because they are filtered) there is clear evidence of damage from pot smoke after only a few uses. Personally, I find that after 36 hours at most, the effects of marijuana on my voice have completely disappeared. For this reason I try not to smoke for approximately 36 hours before a performance. 

Singers should remember that the aforementioned is only my personal experience, and should not be treated as gospel. I know singers who abstain from smoking because they claim that it detrimentally affects their performance, just as I know singers who smoke upwards of one gram a day and still have beautiful voices.

Okay, this is about my 5th time trying weed, and this was by far the strongest trip I have had. It started out with me and a few friends going to a high-school football game, and looking for some liqour or weed. We just needed something to get high on. After being at the game doing nothing for an hour or so, we decided to leave. We ended up going to my friends house (P), where they were drinking and smoking. I have no fucking clue where he gets this shit but P always seems to have the best weed ever. We bought a dime bag of Kronic for about 15 dollars, since I was friends with him, and he was already stoned off his ass.

I was sleeping over with two friends at their house (brothers). Now his parents are home and we weren't allowed to leave, and we were determined to get high that night, so we decided on equally splitting the dime and then eating it. I did not think that this would work at all. I just swallowed my portion in one bite and it was over. I waited while we were all watching T.V. on the couch. It was about a half hour later and I couldn't really feel anything, so me and my friend went out on the trampoline to try and feel the effects. At that time I didn't feel high at all just weird. After we were jumping we came inside and sat back down and watched T.V. after about an hour or so, I remembered that usually when it hits me it is because I do something to notice like change what I'm doing or something. So I get up and if fucking hits me like a ton of bricks.

I casually but confusingly walk over to his kitchen and then circle back around the house and end up back at the couch. At this time I had no clue what I just did or how I got back to the couch. I had no clue it would affect me like this. I wasn't even peaking yet and I was fucking gone. I would sit on the couch for a minute or so and then just snap out of it, and try to think back at what just happened or what I was thinking as I was on the couch a minute ago, and I remember being there, but my mind was totally blank. No thoughts or anything I just sat there staring at the wall until I would snap out of it. I would do that on and off and it would kind of scare me because I wouldn't know when I would go back into it again, but I just said 'fuck it' and sat there feeling blazed.

After about ten minutes of doing that I realized where I was and that there is a trampoline outside. I ended up going out side to get on the trampoline, but all I remember is coming straight back in. I know I was out there jump on it because my back was wet because it had rained earlier. So I am wearing a wife-beater and I go to take it off because it is soaked. I take it off and put it down then sit there begging my friend to get me a shirt to wear so his mom doesn't come down and see me half naked, and would then know what was going on. After attempting to hit, raise my voice, and repeat myself he simply turns around reaches at the table and hands me that shirt that I took off a few hours ago so I could wear my wife-beater because it was too hot. I sit there fucking stunned, how the hell could I forget that I had a shirt right there behind me the whole time.

At this point I realized how truly gone I was. I little later I raid his kitchen eating anything I can find and it added up to be, 3 donuts, 3 slim jims, a moon pie, a cinnimon bun, a brownie, some glasses of soda, and a few pop tarts. After that we are fucking laughing at each other for no reason. He is not nearly as high as I am and his brother doesn't feel anything at all. We ended up having a fucking marshmello fight taking turns hiding and pitching them at each other. I can't really remember what happens after that, but I remember his brother going upstairs and then me sitting down and seriously thinking about where he had just gone to. Me and my friend attempted to get some milk and donuts but I ended up laying on the floor not being able to breath from laughing so hard, because he took the last donut. 

The next thing I remember is me going upstairs waiting for him then greeting him asking him if he got anything for me, then realizing his brother was pissed because I was waking his parents up, so I tried to play it off by asking if we were going to go back down stairs, instead of asking him for a donut like an idiot. After that I realized I was yelling instead of talking but I only because I couldn't even hear myself think. So I get to his room and lay down and watch T.V. It was Jack Blacks mtv diary. Throughout the whole thing his face kept warping around and he was looking and acting like a fucking cartoon. The whole thing freaked me out because since it was T.V. I couldn't tell if it was really doing that or not. After turning away I was looking at a picture of a car on the wall where I saw the coolest and most creative visual yet. It just warped into somthing from Van Go (I think) or Picaso, the car just turned into a person with their mouth open and a house in their stomach. I was really tripping.

I realized that earlier I had to go to the bathroom but forgot about it. Now I just acted purely on instinct and went to go take a piss. I pissed for like a minute straight but felt no bladder pain or anything which really scared me. I thought I might just not realized it and hold it in until it burst. Then for about an hour I just sat there and visualized a whole bunch of shit which seemed so real to me at the time. I ended up falling asleep at like 4 o'clock and waking up the next morning still fucking high. Not anywhere near what I felt that night before but I defiantly could tell there was some weed affecting me still.

I sat there and reflected the whole night which was pretty amazing as to happen from just swallowing not even a dime of weed. The effects of eating it were much more intense and lasted much longer than any other time. Except for maybe my first time getting high.

It makes me think about what getting high really is. It seemed that night that all it does is, for the time being, make you incredibly stupid and lowers your IQ to the point that you can count it on your fingers, only you constantly forget how to count. I couldn't make my own decisions they had to help to get upstairs and find my way around the house which I kid normally walk through blind-folded. I had a 3 minute memory span, I couldn't control my walking or actions, and I couldn't think or process information. It was like I was mentally retarded for a few hours. I think that is all that weed does to you which in a sense is a very powerful thing. Overall I think that eating the weed will bring a much more intense and a longer trip then smoking. I would do this again only I would get my own weed to eat and take it a few hours before my friends would smoke their weed because smoking just works better for them.

I want to share an interesting experience I had the other day with Cannabis.  I am a somewhat experienced drug psychonaut.  I have only tried weed, opium, acid, e, shrooms, and salvia, and a number of pharamaceuticals.  The other day I had some high quality buddha and was smoking to myself, because all my friends were either asleep or busy.  So as the night came to an end, I was lying in bed, still pretty damn fried from the smoking I had been doing all day.  I was home alone, so I sparked a bowl while still in bed.  It got me extremely stoned, because this was the last of my bud, so I packed an extra large bowl.

I noticed the room was cooler than usual.  I stared at the string hanging from my overhead fan that controls the light.  It was totally motionless because the fan was not on, and my room has no draft, however it seemed to be moving very far away, and then coming very close to my face.  I stared at this for a while, then started looking around my room.  Letters on boxes seemed to dance around, gyrating and pulsating on the box.  I closed my eyes because I was getting tired, and I noticed I had CEVs.

Now normally when I close my eyes, I either see total darkness or blobs of shape that I suppose are normal when everyone closes their eyes, these blobs have a somewhat dark purple tone to them, I believe.  Anyways when I closed my eyes, I didn't see any purple blobs, I saw different 'levels of red.'  What I mean by that is the colors of red were placed differently as to give depth.  These 'levels of red' morphed into what seemed to be a videogame being played right in front of my eyes.  The shapes were moving around very fast, and I soon realized that I was playing a Sonic The Hedgehog game in my head.

I thought this was cool, but once I started focusing on it, it seemed to fade away.  I let myself go, and the CEV of the video game returned.  I found that if I let myself go, but payed attention to what I saw, I could control the video game character running around.  It jumped, ran, and did all the other stuff at my will.  I opened my eyes and I could still see a faint image of the video game character right in front of my eyes for a couple seconds before it disappeared.  Whenever I opened my eyes and closed them again, the video game character would return, but at what appeared to be a different level in the game.

This went on for about 10 minutes or so, when I had a Kool cigarette that made me a little more stoned, but the CEVs went away.  It was interesting that Cannabis can produce CEVs, I didn't know that until now.

I have been a light Marijuana user for a modest amount of time, but nothing even came close to this experience.  I was at home alone and I decided to smoke a little of the Marijuana I had bought from a friend earlier in the day to help me relax.  I smoked what couldnt have been more than ½ gram.  Within five minutes I knew something was off, I had intended to take a shower afterwards so I was in the bathroom and the shower was running.  After smoking I could barely clean up.  I began feeling like I was daydreaming; only whatever I dreamed up became real.

About ten minutes into the experience I was swept out into what seemed like space.  I was floating and I had completely lost connection with my physical body.  Then I came back, instead of floating in space I was floating in my bathroom.  I knew I had to clean up so I stuck my head under the shower, which seemed to partially ground me for about a minute.  I cleaned up my stuff and went back into my room.

I started feeling like I could hear ever ligament and nerve and bone in my body move and click as I moved any part of my body.  I felt as if I was a robot, when I moved my head I felt like It was being moved by gears.  Eventually I had almost convinced myself that I was a robot.  I moved downstairs by my TV, a change of environment seemed to ground me for a minute or two.  Once the effects were back I realized since my head was on gears I could move it to any part of my body.  I could move my head down my sides and see all different perspectives.

Then I was sucked into another all enveloping hallucination.  I was being roasted rotisserie style over an open fire by African Natives.  Where the fire should have been burning me, I felt only warmth, like an extreme concentration of body energy.  Eventually the feeling had enveloped my entire body, I felt as if I was in space again, only this time I was floating with warmth and body energy flowing through my body.

I came back to reality and realized that 28 days later, that zombie movie, was on TV.  I felt like my eyes were bouncy balls bouncing around my sockets.  I couldnt move my eyes straight to something, if I tried to move them to the left, they would zigzag up and down until they got there.  I felt hungry all the sudden, I started eating crackers since they were right next to me.  All the sudden I felt almost like an attachment to a cracker and I started licking it uncontrollably.  I licked it and then took a bite, which felt like the ultimate ecstasy.  After that I dont remember much, I think that Phone both came on TV and I began to come down.  I woke up this morning on my couch with the TV still on.  I dont know why this happened but if given the choice I would repeat an experience like it without hesitation.

Now when I first ever smoked marijuana I did not get all that high. I had nearly 10 pipes with no effect! I smoked out of nothing but pipes for the first 3-4 months of my 'stoner' period. So I used marijuana nearly daily for 3-4 months then suddenly stopped smoking it for 8 months. This one particular day my friend urged me to come smoke some dope, because I hadn't had the buzz in a long while I agreed. I really was anticipating getting stoned, the whole walk back to his place I couldn't stop thinking about it.

We got there (this is the same place I had been getting stoned previously) and I sat down on his couch. My friend went into his bedroom, 5 minutes later he comes back with a big grin on his face and about half an ounce of weed. We sit down (Im shaking by this point, I really want to get stoned!) and I grab a little bit for myself, enough for 2-3 hits, and place it in a bowl and proceed to letting my friend cut it up.

My friend went and got his bong, it was a 600mL glass juice bottle, but made a nice bong. He gave it to me along with a lighter, and taught me how to smoke it. I packed the bowel full, and sucked it all into my lungs. I got a nice lung-full of smoke, a lot more than I could ever handle from a pipe. As I exhaled I coughed a lot, it messed me up. Trying not to let my friend know I was already stoned, I packed another bowl full, bigger than the last one. I sucked it down like the last one, this one messed me up. I coughed and coughed. I had a sip of someones water, just a glass that was left on the table. It felt like it had put a fire out in my throat! I closed my eyes and all I could see was dope leaves with rectangles around them, hundreds of them. They were like bright metallic green.

I felt that was enough for me. We got up and moved into his kitchen. We sat down on either side of this circular table. I remember sitting down, I was looking straight ahead of me, slightly towards the ceiling. All of a sudden I had this feeling of complete blankness, it felt like being on heroin, like noddin off. I forgot everything, I didnt know where I was, who I was, who my friend was. I thought that I was in another world, and I was trying to get back to my home world. I kept telling myself things like, Okay, this is home, remember this. Then I would forget and think Im in another world again.

Apparently I was tripping like that for about 30 minutes, it felt like 5, 10 minutes max. My time perception was totally messed up. I looked over at my friend, he was eating some donuts and taking no particular notice of me, so I just tried to make sense of the situation. I couldnt think. My thoughts are just one big dopey haze. It felt like I was just floating, like looking at my self from a different body. Until my friend got my attention and suggested we go get some fresh air. 

I got up and looked down the hallway. It looked like it was really narrow and long. I started walking and his sister came out of her bedroom. She looked at me, with a weird expression on her face. I couldnt work out who she was. She was looking at me like something was terribly wrong. I kept walking on back into the lounge room. I know I had to go out the door, but my mind like shutdown, and I dont know why but I went and sat down. But it felt like I had walked out, my second out of body experience. I ended up getting up and following my friend outside.

As I walked through the yard I just got a rush of pleasure, I felt so happy to be alive and tripping so well, all the colours were bright and vibrant. I suddenly yelled out at the top of my lungs, MAN IM TRIPPIN HARDCORE!! and I started laughing uncontrollably. My friend yelled at me, I felt as if I had killed someone, I felt really guilty, my mood changed right away. Walking down the street it seemed as though my head was detached and bouncing on my neck.

We walked right down to this football pitch. We sat down on a bench and I started tripping again, same as before but this time when I closed my eyes I saw 3 big circles suspended in a black mist. They were worlds as I was calling them. Some how I start getting this feeling of looking at my friend and me though my mind, we were in one of these worlds that I was looking at. We decided to walk around the oval. I was fascinated by everything, it seemed as though it was the first time I was doing anything. My friend start joking about how trashed I was. He instructed me to pickup a pinecone, I picked it up, I started walking towards him and he ran away. I was confused, apparently I picked up a piece of dog shit, I swear I thought it was a pinecone.

From there me and my friend went our separate ways, I got home ate some food and crashed out on my couch. My peak came pretty early on, about 15-20 minutes after the last hit. Lasted a good 2 and a half hours, I was pretty much down before falling asleep. One of the nicest trips Ive ever had.

Im lucky when it comes to substances. I can take benadryl and not feel sleepy, caffeine or sugar and then go right to bed. But also when I take either weed or alcohol (the only substances I've tried), I need only the slightest amount to become stoned out of my mind or drunk and I never get very paranoid or have a huge hangover. And I always seem to remember everything that happened as well, though that's not always good.

One day, me and three friends decided to share just one gram of weed between three of us (one friend didnt feel like it, and he would become useful later). We made no preparations and out decision was totally spontaneous. We went out behind the garage of a car repair shop and used a bottle to smoke out of. It was a dark night in early december, and it was freezing out. After about two hits, I felt a buzz coming on. On my third or fourth hit, I was feeling the weed very strongly. This high was different from my usual ones. Instead of being hyper and apparently hilarious to all non-high people around me, I felt mellow and peaceful. At this point I usually would've stopped and enjoyed what I had already, but there was so much more left. We went through about two more bowls before we decided to stop (I have no idea how a single gram lasted that long) but there was still more left after we were done.

As I waited there with my friends, I could feel my mind jumping higher and higher into space. I began to talk to my friend about how I loved him and he told me about how much he loved me. We hugged. Soon, my mind had jumped so high that I stopped thinking. Literally I stopped thinking about anything and stared at nothing in particular for what must've been five minutes. Out of the corner of my eye I could see a street light. Instead of being a tangible light fixture, it was a giant glowing ball of energy. It was the size of two beachballs. Although this seems wierd, at the time I didn'y really care and just respected the ball of energy for what it was. After standing there for a good period of time, we finally decided to go to my friends house at the urging of our non-stoned friend. It was still below freezing out, but we didn't notice.

When we arrived at our friend's house, we for some reason didn't go inside, but instead just stood in the middle of the road. This is when I think I peaked. I suddenly closed my eyes, and there before me were flashing psychadelic colors. My body began swaying back and fourth in place. I felt like I was a roller coaster cart going along a random track. I stood there, swaying back and fourth in all directions for many minutes with my eyes closed the entire time, colors flashing before me. I felt like I could see the roller coaster track I was following with my eyes closed. It was a chalky golden beam that shone in front of the colors in my head. I'd never heard of closed-eye visuals on just cannabis before.

Now the munchies hit us. We went to a Quiznos store near us and ordered some sub sandwiches. I shared mine with a friend who didn't have any money, but regretted it because I was still hungry after. While in the store, You Can't Always Get What You Want came on the radio and I yelled to my friend, 'This is such a GREAT SONG!' He humored me, but soon hurried me away from all the people who were staring at the three of us. That night I ate: 1/2 of a sub sandwich, numerous Lindt Chocolates, a large bowl of soup, and two orders of french fries. My stomach would hurt after I sobered up.

Later that night, we smoked again and watched Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius on TV, tho this experience seemed toned down and less exciting. I was over-saturated with weed.

If I tried to give the entire background to both experiences, I would be here all night.  Instead, Ill give you a general idea and a few essential details.  This is the story of two experiences that changed my ideas about marijuana so drastically and in such short time that I still do not know what to think of it.  

My cousin, Dru, and I had been planning a smoke session for about 5 or 6 months before I finally went with a few friends to meet him.  We met and me and my friend went with Dru out into the woods of Michigan State to smoke a joint and a bowl or two.  I had smoked a few times before but never had a real high; the last time I smoked was 3 months prior.  As we arrived at the designated spot in the forest, Dru took out his joint of average weed and lit it.  I could take hits fairly well so I took advantage of that.  My first hit sent me coughing so that I couldnt participate in the next round.  I finished off the joint in my next hit and we took out the bowl.  I took 2 more hits off of that and it was cashed.  Dru had more weed but we all decided that we had had enough.  As we were walking back, I wasnt feeling very high except I was hallucinating small things, mostly thinking that certain shadows had depth and could have been small animals.  

We walked a different way than we had come and I still cannot fully recall which way we walked because I was concentrating on what was happening to me.  I decided it was probably going to be a dud of a trip again because the effects seemed to be taking quite a while to really come on.  Then it hit me.  I cant remember any transition at all, other than, seriously, a blink of an eye.  It seemed as though I had tunnel vision except I didnt have any blind spots, almost as though my eyes were focusing binocularly.  Hearing became quite a trip: when I spoke, it almost seemed to come out of my head as a whole rather than from my mouth; other peoples voices became closer and clearer but I could only concentrate on a few things at a time.

Hallucinations seemed to really take hold because my glasses had fallen off and I put them in my pocket. My cousin had to take them away later when I was trying to bend them like a twist tie in my pocket.  I dont have too bad of vision, but things really started to distort, especially in the darker backstreets of the campus.  Somehow, 2 full-size oaks became 2 scale-size statues of people, a garbage can became an old lady on a bench; Alfred Hitchcocks silhouette momentarily appeared in the shadow of a tree.   

I remembered things from earlier in the day except I thought they were part of a dream I had recently.  I got back to my cousins dorm and I bid him adieu and drove off with my friends.  As we approached my friends dorm, where we were staying, I said, You guys, I remember this dream I had last night.  We were driving towards this hotel or something and on top of the roof were these two huge nutcrackers and they said something like happy new year.  My friend had the decency to point out two enormous nutcrackers holding a Merry Christmas banner on top of my other friends dorm as I was saying this, upon seeing them I TOTALLY freaked out.  I thought I was in a dream for a short while.  

On the whole, this was a very positive experience.  I definitely had a new outlook on marijuana.  Before, I thought it wasnt worth the coughing and didnt see what the big deal was, but now I understood the power of its psychoactivity.  This is why when I went home the next weekend, I was not apprehensive when my friend Dan offered to have me come smoke with him and a few of his friends.  I thought it was a little too soon to smoke again but I hadnt smoked with Dan in about a year.  I met Dan at his house and we waited for some 3 people to come by (all MUCH more experienced smokers).  Somehow I was coerced into sitting bitch.  Im no short guy so it was that much less enjoyable.  They had some shit weed from Detroit and Dan had some hydro that he forgot at his house.  Dan broke up the weed very finely and placed it into a small glass bowl.  We clammed out mikes car to get an enhanced effect.

I took my first hit and held it way too far past my bounds, causing me to swallow part of the hit.  I took another hit after burping profusely.  This one I let myself cough out.  I passed the next round and hit the next bowl once.  At this point I became very irritated, not in an angry way, just I did not like anything about my present situation.  I started to complain about how smoky it was: I could barely catch my breath.  They courteously rolled down the windows because by this time, they were pretty much done.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

They started driving to somewhere; I do not recall where.  Every turn was an ordeal.  I did not want to lean with the turns but I also didnt want to take the effort it required to prevent leaning.  They stopped at a gas station to get some smokes and I asked the person going in if he could get me something to drink because I was obviously not coherent enough to get up and do it myself.  The next hour, or what seemed like it, was mostly spent concentrating on rhythmically drinking my 7up.  I heard them mention my name once or twice but I could not interject myself into the conversation to ascertain what they were talking about.  

Dan then went home and got his dro.  I can barely remember what happened then.  He explained, Dude, that other stuff was shit weed.  All you need is one hit of my hydro and youll feel better.  I was convinced because I dont think I had the logic in my present state to refuse.  I dont remember what we smoked it out of, either a joint or a bowl but after that I could barely stay conscious.  Contrary to what I was lead to believe, this hit did not make me feel better.  I sat in the car not aware of my surroundings with my eyes shut tightly supporting my head with my hands with my arms resting on my lap.

I cannot accurately describe what I saw most of the time with my eyes shut.  I was hallucinating I suppose, what could only remotely be described as a kaleidoscope.  Then I felt like I was a roller coaster that was constantly angling down.  I felt like if I let my arms out from under my head, my head would fly down through my lap onto the road below.  I heard someone say my name and everyone laughed but I could not muster the energy to counter.  We all decided to go back to Dans house to chill.  I have been friends with Dan for a long time and I know his parents quite well.  I realized that they were there but I couldnt acknowledge them without feeling like I was making a total ass out of myself.  I was SO thirsty by this time.  Under normal conditions, I would have been parched because I hadnt drank anything in many hours but I NEEDED something to drink or I felt like I would pass out.  Dan fed me some Tostito chips and two lukewarm Pepsis.  I fell asleep sometime before 2 AM about 5 or 6 hours after I started smoking.

The next morning was almost a disaster.  My mom called me at 9:30 and reminded me that we were going shopping that morning.  It took every ounce of effort in my body to not look and sound high at that point.  I went shopping for 3 hours and it was some of the longest and least decisive hours of shopping I have ever experienced.  I still dont know if my mom thought I was high.  

Im willing to give weed a chance again though.  Its been about 5 weeks since those two weekends and I think Ive calmed down enough to try it again.  I now realize that even weed is not necessarily a fun-loving drug, no matter how benign it may seem.

I've been a pretty heavy cannabis user for the past 6 months, usually smoking either every day or every other day.  At one point or another I had gone 4 nights without smoking and was questioning when I would be smoking again.  That same night my friend calls me for a session at his house.  It was going to be my most usual smoking buddies joining me at one of their houses so I thought it would be a nice fun, not too out of control, evening as usual when I smoke with my friends.

We started the first bowl at about 10 pm, my friend had told me that this was 'really strong stuff'.  As soon as I took my first hit I knew this stuff was stronger than usual as I was coughing as I had never done before.  We finished the first bowl and I was feeling good, I was really high and in a friendly surrounding.  The effects of the first bowl had not even reached their peak when one of my friends started packing the 2nd bowl.  I wasn't sure if I was ready for it but decided to go for it anyways.  

It was at this time that I started feeling different than I ever had before.  As my friend passed me the pipe I noticed that I had lost all sense of feeling in my mouth, and that my sense of death was very off.  As my friend passed my the pipe in my eyes I could not tell if I had ever grabbed the pipe from his hand, and most of all I could not feel the pipe in my mouth!!  All I could do was try to concentrate to make sure I was breathing in some but I could not feel a thing.  It felt as if the pipe was coming towards me and then backing away, and it repeated this pattern 7 - 8 times. All the while the pipe was really in my mouth and I had been breathing in for what was probably 30+ seconds.  I had trouble passing the pipe as well seeing as my sense of depth was shot.

At this point all I could tell my friends was that 'I'm sooo high' and I probably repeated this line 6-7 times.  As soon as we finished the bowl (I don't remember it being finished) we started watching a movie, and at this point is when I felt a sense of numbness around my upperbody.  I could control my arms, but I could not feel them moving, it is something I have never experienced before.  I had no idea how I was doing it, but it was occuring in front of me.  It felt as if I was waving my arms through the mystical ether that earlier scientists had described, and no matter how hard I tried to take away this feeling I could not.

Feeling a little scared at these sensations I had never experienced before I decided to just stay still  and not risk any movement.  I'm not sure whetehr to describe this as an unpleasant or pleasant experience, all I can do is  describe it as something new.  This cannabis was a strain I had never tried before, and I'm not sure whether it was the fact that I had not smoked for 5 days or the fact that the weed was that potent, but it was definetly a new experience.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

I drove home later that night 2 hours later and the although I could see fine and actually feel my limbs at this point, the ride which normally takes 25 minutes seemed to take 5.  This night surpasses the 'highest I've ever been' as I can not even fully describe what was going in my mind when I was at my peak, all my friend could say to describe it was that 'you were gone'.  Once again I'm not sure if it was the weed or the days that had gone by since I had smoked, but that night was one of the most intense experiences I have ever had, and if I had a choice to repeat it I probably would.

I'm often alone among my peers in that I experience much more intense effects from smoking marijuana than they do.  I often trip from smoking pot, and recently I experienced a very intense trip which was not all pleasurable.  

I went to a friend's house, and smoked maybe six large hits from a blunt.  I began getting extremely high, and stopped smoking after that.  I started feeling very anxious, my heart was pounding and I could feel my muscles spasming irregularly, although not violently.  I went home and tried to relax, but I found it impossible.  

I began to see straight up hallucinations, like a multicolored wave in from of my eyes just morphing and shifting, then neon psychedelic ribbons and spirals.  I felt like I'd eaten a ten-strip of acid.  I'm not sure what happened next but I seemed to be going deeper and deeper into this altered state, and I had trouble fighting it.  Even when I put on some music I found it a little frightening, as well as when I tried to placate myself with a movie; it was as if I didn't understand what these things were anymore.  I kept getting horrible shivers as well, that wracked my entire body, as if I were cold.  I ended up just going to sleep after some struggle, and felt fine in the morning.

I think some people are hyper-sensitive to weed and maybe should just smoke enough to get a mild buzz, unless they are intending to trip.  I know I'm going to limit my smoking from here on out, and when I feel like tripping, I'll smoke like my friends do, which is without restraint.

This is a humbling experience that changed my perception of Cannabis power to change the way a human body functions.

I, being a teenager, feel that to be well respected from my peers you need to be taking part in the activities that are deemed by parents to be dangerous, this is not true and a stupid view of teenage life. Parents have most probably been, at one point in their life, dope smokers, whether it is punk or hash. I was a late starter when it came to doing drugs when compared to my friends. I was told stories about first timers who throw violent reactions to Cannabis. I never experienced any bad effects until one Saturday round my good Friend PiCs house.

There were four of us: Me, Meat, PiC and Bous were all going to get stoned for the hell of it! It had the potential to be a relaxing evening. Not for me.

I started off the day by meeting another friend in the towns park and had a couple of joints from the 1/8 I had bought. Everything was fine until I started to feel a bit off. I wasnt feeling comfortable in my stomach, however much food and drink I filled it with it, the feeling didnt pass. I was stoned and was already mongin (going into my own quiet world). The bus ride was particularly unpleasant because I was sure that by the time I was off the bus I wouldve vomited over the woman sitting in front of me. No puke yet. When PiC and me had arrived at his, Bous was already skinning up. Meat turned up little later. 

We had all skinned up and sparked up. All was well in my mind, I was feeling happy, I was laughing, I was comfortable and I was even more wasted. We must have had nearly 20 spliffs and that was too much for my body to handle. I wasnt actually sure what time it was when I had disgusting waves of nausea sweeping over my body from head to toe. I knew that if I were sick I wouldnt feel as bad so I made my way to the toilet. I used it for what its made for and then hesitated on leaving the bathroom. My head was switching from hot to cold in waves. My hands were shacking more than I have ever seen and my face was as white as fresh virgin snow. I resumed the stance of Doggy so I could vomit and actually hit the water of the toilet. I started heaving; nothing was being ejected from my body. I continued to heave almost to the point of vomiting but absolutely nothing came out. I was frustrated that I had spoiled my own night from over indulging. The ironic thing was that the bathroom is next to PiCs mums room she was watching a programme about pot smokers and the legal status of Cannabis in the UK. I found it funny because I was stoned while listening to a well-spoken man talk about the effects that I was experiencing. I had to laugh at least in my head at that. I was interrupted in my face to face with the toilet bowl by PiCs uncle. I dragged myself into his room and had to lie on the floor. I was expressing my situation to the rest of the guys who were nothing but as sympathetic as one could be when stoned. 

It wasnt long before I made another trip into the bathroom to reacquaint myself with the toilet bowl! I tried to spew but couldnt and it was making me very uncomfortable. I gave up and headed back to the smoke filled room to lie on PiCs sofa bed. I was too annoyed to really take note of what I was feeling like other than extreme nausea. All I was thinking about was falling to sleep, which took its time!! While I was lying on the bed I felt I was falling down to earth from a higher place. I wasnt sure which was I was pointing or facing once my eyes were closed. All I could think about was how this plant had me at its mercy, I was nearly crying from the pain and discomfort that I was experiencing. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF CANNABIS.

So after an unpleasant night I wake up to a boiling hot humid room and more spliffs!! My mum picked me up soon after I awoke and that was one of the happiest moments in my life, no sh*t!! I was so relieved! That night was gone and my home and a shower were waiting for me at home.

After that weekend I stayed clear of draw for about a week before I started creeping back into the habit. A little note for anyone who might read this: take what you can, not what you want.

Smoking pot has always intrigued me. I'm currently a full-time student at an art college in Boston, and we usually only smoke in our room, rarely leaving the dorm building while high. However, on one soft and warm spring night, myself and four others decided to walk over to a park half a mile away to smoke and take in our surroundings. Here is that story.

We sat underneath some trees in the park as two bowls rotated around our small group - one, a glass sherlock, was very nice on the lungs, and its over-sized bowl had been packed with a large, full bud. The other piece, a corn-cob pipe, was filled half-way with the same type of pot. The smoke was clean and smooth as it filled our lungs. The moonlight and scattered street lamps along the park walkway caught the smoke as it drifted towards the trees.

I began to get high while the pipes were still going around. By the time the last hit was taken from Alice, the sherlock, all five of us had entered a different state of mind brought on by this beautiful green plant. Everyone had been good about passing the pipe after taking a hit, and this calmed me  nothing to think about except this simple rhythm.

Being in such an environment while stoned was incredible - the trees and plants had bloomed forth with flowers and green leaves, and the street lamps cast a soft gold glaze over the earth. I began to smile as I realized that this gold color was not something I saw every day in central Boston. It was something different, and I think my friends realized the same thing. Nonetheless, I began talking about what I saw. The more I talked, the further I was pulled into this utopia of green and gold. I began to realize this, and I stopped talking. Wow, I thought... and I made a note in my head about where pot can take you when you allow yourself to be pulled into something by talking or thinking about it. That same softly overwhelming feeling came back later...

We decided to lay down in the middle of a dimly-lit basketball court on the edge of the park. No one else was around, and this helped to keep our group of five focused on each other and nature around us. I rested in the exact center of the court, laying with my feet half a foot apart and my arms straight out to the side. The few clouds overhead were moving slowly to the right, and I began to imagine the earth as an eye. I was in the center of the pupil, and the clouds were small tears moving across the surface. I began to allow my imagination to pull me further into that realm, and ideas started to soar out of my brain - I was in the center of an eye looking at molecules [the stars]. My hands and feet felt like they were comfortably rooted into the ground, and I could control every movement of the eye by paying attention to a certain part of my body. Imagining my left hand rotating the eye to the left caused me to see the stars differently than if I imagined my right arm doing the rotating. I told my nearby friends about this as I lay still on the ground, and I could hear them agreeing with me as I was pulled even further into this world I was imagining. Once again, talking about my current experience drew me farther and farther into my imagination, and my thoughts became more complex. I imagined myself falling backward toward the earth and entering the atmosphere [I had done this on a previous high]. I was not afraid at all as I actually felt warm tongues of smooth fire wrap around my arms, pull through my toes and groin, past my skull, and through my back. This is not something I usually experienced while stoned, and it felt incredible to have the ability to bring my physical existence into a totally different realm.

I was also surprised at the fire's temperature. Normally, fire burns flesh and does harm to the skin and body - but this was different. I imagined the fire as a neutral element, one that could move across and past my body with no effect other than my skin feeling warm. It was unbelievable. And again, as I told my friends what I was feeling, that feeling became stronger.

Time passed, and we eventually explored a few more places in the park before heading back to the dorm. Along the way we climbed 20 feet up into a huge tree at the edge of the park. I was a bit frightened coming back dowm from that height, but I felt that the tree had left a sort of imprint in my mind. It was related, in a way, to the pot we had allowed to enter our bodies. And, in fact, everything about our bodies, the marijuana, the tree, and the sky was related somehow, and this comforted me all the way back to our dorm.

The experience we shared is something I won't forget. The planets aligned for us that night, and we took our minds to a new dimension, with the kind help of a friendly plant.

[as a side note, I don't use any other drugs besides marijuana - I don't drink, I don't take shrooms, I don't even smoke cigarettes - I've only smoked hash once]

[Erowid Note: Some authors report suspicions that their cannabis has been 'laced' (adulterated), in some cases presumably with PCP. While this is possible, readers should be aware that idiosyncratic response to the effects of cannabis (usually higher doses) can lead some users to presume their cannabis has been 'laced'. There is no way to know if the cannabis in the report below was adulterated or not.]


It was just another night...

I was an average Smoker (pot) and what else was there to do on a Friday night? we all gathered at our usual spot and heard about this little get together our friend was having.  We all krept into the room and looked at the bags of grass in front of us.  


Our friend R had rolled a significantly large joint...he passed it to me and said 'dont put your lips on it, just pull right by the end'. I ignored him and took what was one of the harshest hits ever.  I sat there blowing out smoke for what seemed like an hour.  We packed 2 bowls which went around until they were done, and then repacked.  All of a sudden I feel uneasy, I'm observing people, and it seems im the only one who is affected so strangely.


My friend rises up and sits back down rather quickly...'what the fuck is going on?', I answered with a shrug thinking my little bug out would end soon.  I then started to feel the cold air entering my lungs and hot air rushing out, I sat there noticing the rapid heartbeat which made me more uneasy, my friend was having the same experience, gripping his seat he said 'I have to leave now'.  I looked at R and noticed that his NIN emblem just floated off his shirt...I grabbed P and we went upstairs, this girl had mirrors all over the fucking place, I didnt think we'd make it out.  


I decided to take a walk, as we were walking I notice the sidewalk seems to be melting away with every step, as if it's avoiding my feet, now faces seem to be appearing in the grooves of the sidewalk...I'm fucked!  I look straight ahead and reassure myself that if I act in control, I will be...We get to the store on the corner and everything around me is insignificant, I can't feel I think I said to myself.  We take a shortcut to my house and the trees and train tracks left an erie feeling in the air. 


The wierdest thing was...I dont know WHY we went to my house. It was a destination, and I didn't want to pass out in a strangers house.  I was stupid for smoking in the first place, since my steroid inhaler probably hurt me more than it did good earlier that day.  As my mother is lecturing me and my friend on our stupidity, all I see is object hovering, I look over at my lamp, and then over at my mother again, but the image of my mother isn't there, its still the image of the side of the room.  


We decide to hit the sack, but everytime I'd fall asleep I'd wake up short of breath, as if I was running in my sleep. The next thing I know, I woke up, happy to be alive and quite stoned, I stumble to my feet to get food.


This was the start of the end of my days with drugs. To this day, it is a very vivid memory.

Just the other night I had my most unusual experience with smoking bud.  A friend of mine, Matt, came to hang out with me the other night, and brought a joint of some fairly potent hydro. We went to a small building behind my house to smoke at approximately 6:30 pm.  We smoke about half the joint, and things were going good, I knew I'd be pretty stoned (ok, really stoned..) in about 5 minutes, as we've smoked this weed often and thats about the time it takes for the high to peak.  We finished smoking the joint about 45% into it, and I sat down on a box, while Matt starts to smoke a cig.  Then.. things got weird.  I was zoning out like I do when I'm high, and realized I had been holding my breath for as long as I had been sitting down (approx. 20-30 seconds) and take a deep breath, then stand up, and blood rushed to my head from standing quickly/breathing deeply simultaneously (I think..). 

After this point.. things are fuzzy.  My head starts pounding.. I can't think straight at all. Its like my brain was shutting down and I was fighting it.  I could hear a buzzing, and it sounded (I know this sounds crazy, but its true..)like it was coming from Matt's cigarette.  Then the buzzing turned into a ringing.. And my head felt like it was going to burst.  I looked at Matt and told him I felt weird, and he asked if I was ok. I told him yes, and then I closed my eyes.  I dont think I've ever felt a high so intense.  I zoned out again, and remember falling down, and Matt saying.. 'Dude.. you didnt just do that.' He grabbed my arm and helped me up, and asked if I was ok, and I told him I needed to sit.  We walked back inside, and things are getting weirder for me.  My brain felt like it was in complete overload.. I went to get a glass of water and fell down again.. and laid on my kitchen floor for about 30 seconds untill Matt pulled me back up.  I got some water, I think, and we both went into my bedroom.  Matt turneed on my GameCube, and I sat infront of my computer.  The intensity slowly started to wear off.. It had only been about 5 minutes, but it felt like hours.  My brain was numb.  

About 20 minutes later I felt pretty normal, just stoned.. But I felt burnt.  I acted dumb for the rest of the night, and wasn't completely sure what had happened.  I had that headrush from sitting up, and taking a deep breath, apparently, I was so stoned for 5 minutes that I passed out! Twice! Crazy, huh? The coolest thing about it was smoking the rest of the joint later.. It was one of the best feelings I've had.. Kinda like that overload opened my mind up to feel the high more. I was able to produce slight colorful closed eye visuals... I don't know if anyone else has ever had that kind of experience.. the passing out or the visuals, but they were both crazy as hell.

I've been smoking for about two years, with varying degrees of regularity. I have an overall positive view of cannabis, but if there's one truth about smoking I've found, it's that more is less, on a small scale and large scale. 

Let me explain: in a given 'session', I've found smoking one or two bowls far more effective than three or four. Others may have a different level of sensitivity, but in my experience, once I feel 'really high', smoking more will ONLY make me more tired and out of it. It's not like alchohol where ten drinks get's me ripped and two drinks gets me a little buzzed. Actually the most important factor in how high I get is the initial delivery system (one bong hit will get me higher than two pipe hits), the potency of the weed, and the setting/mindset before smoking and what I do when I'm high. 

On the large scale, smoking every night (or every day, or every morning) will, in my opinion, greatly reduce the quality of each experience; being high becomes too familiar to be a striking experience after five days straight of smoking. Smoking every other day, or better yet, once a week, is a lot easier on my body and healthier for the mind. After all, the point of a mind-altering drug is to create contrast with 'everyday life', so I need to experience enough everyday life to give definition to being high.

If nothing else, moderation will keep my tolerance low, and will cost me a lot less money and lung problems.

For a while I've been trying to quit using pot and have been instead using meditation to 'get high' which for me works pretty well considering my experience on the practice. (I've been practicing meditation longer than I've been smoking as a matter of fact.) Anyway I gave in about a week ago after going a few days without mary jane which isn't too bad considering I used to get stoned 24/7. I had entered the void through meditation earlier that day (Not easily done!) and I think the following state of mind I was in that day actually enhanced the high. 

So heres what happened. I was walking along the beach and I spotted my friend L underneath the pier smoking a blunt. Like I mentioned earlier I had gone a while without pot and figured one more time wouldnt kill me with guilt! Anyway we smoked, got stoned, and got up and left after while. I walked around for about an hour before I decided to go home and munch. By this time the high was starting to wear off, but almost as soon as I had turned on to 21st the creeper hit me. For those of you unfamiliar with the term 'creeper', it's a high that for no reason suddenly intensifies dramatically without the user boosting. What followed was the most lovely experience I have ever had on pot. I was'nt a whole lot 'higher' than before but I noticed colors were becoming extremely intense to the point of changing. The grey, dismal sky took on a purple tone, the street shone sapphire blue, and every green plant around me pulsed with an intense glow, as if I could actually see the life flowing through them. Altogether, I felt as though I was walking inside a living painting.

I have never done any hard trips like acid or shrooms and I wondered if the blunt had been laced, which was unlikely since these effects took over an hour to manifest themselves. It could'nt have been from my few days abstinence because I have gone weeks without smoking before and never experienced what I did in the space of those five minutes but hey, it might have just been some good ass weed. Who knows? This was without a doubt the best creeper I had ever had. Normally my heart starts pounding and I get paranoid as hell, thinking I'm going to die and what not when I have creepers. I still believe meditating had enhanced this high.

I have never got anything out of smoking hash or weed and much prefer baking with hash. I've had mostly good experiences and only one very scary trip. I'll talk about that one first.

I'd made a batch of almond and lemon biscuits with a fairly large chunk of hash ground up and chucked in (about a tenner's worth in the UK). I had so many I froze most and kept one bag in my room. I hadn't gotten the hang of how many I should take for a good experience and was just experimenting with 2, then three... Later that week one evening I took 6 biscuits at about 7pm. As usual I expected a few hours before it kicked in so went to bed. After I'd read a book for about an hour things started to happen and I was feeling great. I was euphoric and my mind felt the size of the world. Then I became very jittery and I fet very very thirsty and dehydrated. I thought I was controlling my heart beat but the horrid thing was that I thought I was slowing it down to the point where I was sure I was going to stop it completely. It was like the plants had taken over my mind and were trying to kill me. I felt like the plants were the gods of the earth and I needed to worship them to stop them from killing me. I could see in my mind towering forests of green staring down at me. My body was felt like it wasn't there, not the nice relaxed muscle feeling but like it'd dissolved.

I looked in the mirror and my face was terrible. My skin was so dry and the whites of my eyes were red and sore. My pupils were almost non-existant. My head felt so heavy and although the rest of me felt weightless. I eventually managed to sleep and in the morning I felt much better although up until mid-day I was feeling lethargic and a bit 'not with it'.

I now bake hash into fairy cakes and I know to take about two-three for a good trip. It is trips I seem to get rather than feeling stoned. I do get hallucinations, visual but mostly audible. I hear things miles away like a dog barking but then I completely block out other closer sounds. Once I was lying in bed which is above my garden and I could hear the slugs and snails munching very loudly on my plants and flowers, that made me laugh. Watching Button Moon and playing Santana records is the most enjoyable ways to spend a trip.

A few months ago I read about an Indian drink containing Marijuana called Bhang Lassi.  I was talking to a friend from Bombay about it, and he got very excited and told me a recipe for it.

It was rather time consuming, but one night at around 8.00 I made it.  I used half an ounce of Marijuana and was on an empty stomach.  Before I drank it, I prepared my room for it.  I consider Marijuana to be a spiritual thing for me, so I made it very comfortable on the floor and I put the radio on so it was white noise at a low sound.  

It didn't taste too good, but I downed the large drink in no time.  I had read and heard about very intense trips on Bhang Lassi, some horrible.  I have been smoking and baking with Marijuana for about 3 years, but I have found that when it comes to eating it, the results are almost always intense and I can't expect the same thing.

Usually when I eat Marijuana, I know that after 20-40 minutes I will feel an increasing drymouth then after 15 minutes I will feel an intense high coming on.  With the Bhang Lassi, it may have been 20 minutes, and it just hit me like a wave.

I was sitting up on my floor and just fell down.  The white noise seemed much louder, and I could hear different sounds.  It soon became a melody that I could slowly change when I concentrated on it.  I tried to say something, and my mouth opened up and felt like it kept opening until it was about to swallow my head.  I was a little nervous at first.

Things got even more intense after this.  I was stuck to my floor and couldn't open my eyes.  I felt totally paralyzed.  Suddenly, it hit me.  I hadn't been doing what I normally do when I trip out: I lost my discipline.  I usually try to focus on my mind and ride it out, this time I was too freaked out to.

All of a sudden, I saw what was going on - literally.  My body was like a rock, and I saw something floating like a balloon.  My instincts told me that this balloon was my mind attached to my body.  I discarded my body and cut the string.

Keep in mind this is all going on inside my mind, but I FELT as if I saw it.  In fact until the trip was over I knew I was seeing it.

WOOSH.  I felt my body sink down and my mind shoot forward.  I was flying around everywhere - and I mean everywhere.  I was thinking about how my mind is faster than the speed of light because I can think of being somewhere else and I am instantly there.  I was flying around the cosmos and it was awesome!

Whenever I thought of my body, I was instantly shot back and felt very uncomfortable, like I was being smothered.

Soon these feelings drifted off and I passed out.  The next morning I saw some writings in my notebook that were almost totally illegible.

I learned a lot from that trip and I hope everyone experiments with what I am about to say: RIDE THE WAVE WHEN YOU ARE HIGH.  If you are scared it is because you are resisting.  Forget about worries.  A huge oak will fall from winds, but a reed won't because it bends with it.  Do this, and every high will be an interesting and pleasurable trip!

Earlier today I bought a gram (sativa-domintant strain) half/half with a friend, B. This was the start of one of the most intense cannabis experiences I have ever had it would be my first time hitting a gravity bong, i was very excited, and prepared to cough my lungs out...

B stuffs a tiny snap into the bowl, and lights the bowl while pulling the bottle up. I push down on the bottle and feel my lungs fill up with the thick smoke
* cough *
I blow the huge hit out, not holding it in more than 2 seconds because it was so bigI sat back and waited for B to take his hitthe effects were already noticeable , and quite strongafter B took his hit he loaded a bowl for me, and I hit itthis time it took 2 hits to clear it, and I could hold it in a bit longer. I blew out the smoke.

I see out of the corner of my eye that B is loading up his second hit, but I cant move. Some sort of emptiness came over my body, like my muscles werent there. I couldnt feel anything but empty space I kept saying to myself snap out of it, if I dont, I wont be able to moveit was really hard but I finally moved, and realized that I had to keep moving around or Id get stuck again. Keep in mind this was only 3 hits

B loads my third (and final) bowl, and it takes me 3 big hits to clear it, holding each for about 5 seconds. I sit down, my lungs aching from all the smoke.

Okeverythings ok here, Im finemy head is hollow, where did my brain go? There it is, behind my eyesare my eyes burning? Its because there are so many colors in this roomeverything keeps bending, and movingbetter stand up, I have to get homewait, I cant stand up, I cant movemy limbs are now a part of the surroundings, and I am a part of his bedroom. Wait, oh yeah, I just smoked some bud, Im just high, thats right, just high.... 

I say bye to my friend and am on my way home.

Half-way up the hill I feel my legs burning, like they are about to fall off. I try to just ignore it and keep walking. suddenly I am locked in a repeating motion, over and over againleft foot forward, right foot forward, arms swing, cant stop, im going too fast now The feeling of helplessness grows; I can do nothing but walk, faster and fasterI never slow down, I couldnt if I wanted toI cant feel my legs anymore, but I can feel my feetwhere did the ground go? Im floating now, nothing around me.

Faster, faster, I kept walking till I was practically joggingI stop for a secondor was it 5 minutes, I dont know

ok, time to walk again walkingits hard to keep up a steady pace; Ill walk fast then slow, then fast again, then nearly stop Finally I approach my house, but right as I get to the front yard, my mom is backing out of the garage she says she is going to the store and asks if I want to come. I somehow mumble the words no thanks and go inside. I lock my door behind me and sit down at the computer

my vision is meltingthe computer screen is the only thing that is real, everything else is just a hologramthe computer screen is popping out, coming closer to my face Ok Ill lay down insteadsinking into bed? No wait, there is no bed, I am floating, higher and higher

This goes on for an hour, very intense, before I start to come down a bit. By 2 hours later, I was in an average high, and 4 hours later, I was basically back to baseline however, some lingering effects stuck around. I am writing this 6 hours after I smoked, and I still feel minor effects.
This has been by far the most high I have ever been off such a small amount of cannabis3 small bowls, and I felt like I was on acid or something.

At some points you could say I was too high, though I usually dont think there is such a thing hehe

I find gravity bongs are the best way to get really high off very little weed.

Peace

(cookie / food)

It's Valentine's Day and I'm spending time with my boyfriend. He gives me a small chunk of a 'special' cookie. It tastes all right and very, well, special. But I forget about it, because it's such an insignificant amount and weed is not a big thing with me. 

We sit down to watch The Original Kings of Comedy, and I'm having a good time for a while. It's when Steve Harvey launches into his bit about how much rap shows suck do I suddenly realize that I have lost the ability to *think*. I'm trying to track Steve Harvey's joke, but I can't remember what he said. I try to hold onto a couple of sentences, but I can't connect them together into order to get a sense of the joke. My short-term memory has ceased to exist. My sense of time becomes dead-locked. I don't remember what just happened to me, I can't put together information, my mind is looped on thoughts of 'What the fuck is wrong with me?' I think I've gone insane; I've discovered what separates the insane from the normal. Maybe I should kill myself, to stop this. I climb up onto my boyfriend (whom I just realized is still there) and lie on top of him. The candle I'm staring at has a brilliant glow around it, and I feel myself drifting off. I can't think, I can't imagine things, my mind is degenerating, my body as well--all along my spinal cord it's warm, almost burning, and tingling--I must be dying. 

Maybe my boyfriend should call the hospital, I'm dying.  When I'm about to surrender to God or oblivion, somehow I connect unconsciously (certainly not consciously) the fucking cookie to my present state. I manage to confirm this with my boyfriend, who laughs at what I've been feeling. He's had far more experience with drugs than me, so it's reassuring that I'm not dying or have gone insane, but it doesn't change the fact that *I can't think*. Cedric the Entertainer is beyond my facilities at this point. The hair in my face is too much for me, but bringing my hand up to my face feels like an awesome task because I can't imagine the shape and structure of my face. Eyes are up here, nose is around here--but where's the rest? Where would my hair fall? Only when my hand is actually touching my face do I realize where everything is. 

This goes on until the end of the movie. There are periods where I feel like I'm suffocating, where getting up is an elaborate coordination of mind and body, where my boyfriend and myself feel so unreal that I gotta poke them and hurt them to comprehend that they're there.... I'm not able to wait for things to go away because I can't perceive time.

Thankfully I fall asleep and feel relatively normal when I wake up. The unreality is still residual--hugging my boyfriend, whom I love, good-bye for the day feels like I'm holding a stranger. My memory is still a little shot--two college lectures go by me with only some notes written verbatim to show for it. Hopefully, the weed will leave my system quick. 

Smoking weed has never really registered with me, until now. And all I have to say is, fuck this shit.

My twin brother and I were visiting the house of my friend Nat and her roommate Jess.  We had been hanging out, talking and watching movies, singing, and generally having a good time.  When 1AM rolled around and everyone admitted that the party better wind down -- we all had work in the morning.  On a whim, Nat and Jess suggested that we smoke a little, since we hadn't earlier.  My twin and I agreed enthusiastically, and we went up to Nat's room while Jess got her weed.

We smoked what little was left in the bowl in one round, and Jess repacked tightly.  After a few passes I started to feel the effects, and as a seasoned smoker I could tell it was going to be a very physical high.  Nat and Jess didn't smoke all that often, but they continued to keep up with me and my twin, who can smoke all day long.  I started to get the giggles like crazy and everything was hilarious to me.  I was having trouble keeping up with a story that Jess was telling us, and enjoyed the nonsense that I shot back at her when she tried to explain.

Around this time we stopped smoking, and I was really coming up fast.  Nat asked if Jess was high, because she felt self-conscious that she was the only one.  Nat takes insulin for diabetes, and also is on medication for her thyroid.  As I said, the weed was very physical and I felt increased sensation in my arms and chest, and knew my heart was pounding.  My twin and I were accustomed to weed of this kind and we weren't bothered by it, and knew it would pass; we were still having fun.  Jess seemed to be fairly into her high, but she seemed to be having fun also.

Nat, however, was visibly shaken and looked up.  I could see her heart racing in the hollow of her neck and could tell that she was worried by it.  When asked what was wrong, she said that she felt sick to her stomach.  I turned to talk to my brother and I felt a jab in my ribs.  Nat had fallen onto the bed and her elbow was poking me pretty hard.  'That kinda hurts,' I said, and she mumbled an apology and stared off with a glazed look in her eye.  She made a face as though she would vomit, so I sat her up and she protested mildly that she didn't want to hurt me.  I was worried that she was going to have a bad time so I tried to rub her shoulders and give her a kiss, but she turned away and declined.

Jess and my twin had left, and Nat started to shift and sway while sitting against the wall.  After a few moments, she leaned against me and said that she was sorry for not kissing me earlier.  We then started making out passionately, and it felt wonderful.  The effects of the weed were at its peak, and every touch felt electric.  I felt like I was soft and floating over the bed, and her kisses were delecious.  I totally forgot that she had been feeling bad.  We started to get into heavy petting and neck biting, and we both ended up with our shirts off.  I stopped to take a breath and asked how she was feeling, and she admitted that she was starting to feel sick to her stomach again.

Uh oh, I thought, and she told me that the only other time she had made out with somebody when she was high ended badly, and she said that it made her have bad flashbacks.  'Flashbacks to what?'  Bad stuff, she said.  I felt like a total jackass, and I put my shirt back on and she did the same.  I started crying, overwhelmed with emotion.  I apologized for anything anyone ever did to hurt her, that she didn't deserve it.  She said that nothing I did was wrong, but I felt terrible.

She was still way out of it until 3AM, and we were both upset.  I think that if she had a higher tolerance for weed, the whole night would have been more fun and nothing would have gone wrong.  I also contribute part of the experience to the medication she is on.  I would have had more fun myself if I hadn't felt so bad for her and empathized so deeply with her pain.  I genuinely felt like everything was wrong.

We ended up sleeping over, with me holding her through the night and rubbing her back.  I don't know how much she remembered the next morning, because she still seemed a little out of it.

I've gotten high on weed several times in my life. It took me awhile to get rid of the paranoia that comes with it, but I think Im now pretty comfortable around other people while Im stoned - and by myself.  I was taking an electrical course and living on my own for the first time.  I bought a small $20 chunk off a guy in my class.  Very potent.  I was in a basement suite so I didnt want to make a stink (the landlady was upstairs), so I was thinking of ways I could injest it.

I boiled up some milk, and chopped up a few small chunks of the bud into finer smaller bits and threw it in.  I kept it boiling for well over half an hour, thinking that it might take quite abit of heat to release the THC properly.  Well it was definately not as 'smell-free' as I thought it would be.  Oh well, I thought.. weed had just recently been decriminilized where I live so I didnt have to worry much.  I drank the milk/weed.  Didn't feel anything for half an hour, so I brought out the blades... 

I broke up 2 fair sized chunks and just about burned my lungs (ive never done blades by myself before, Im used to someone else serving me up).  

I went to the bathroom, took a shit, and as I was washing my hands it was starting to hit me.  My tv was off.  No music was playing.  The lack of sound made me lose sense of time.  I couldn't tell if I was actually moving in slow motion, or if I was just perceiving it that way.  There was such an akward stillness in the air.  Sooooooo slllloooooow.

I sat on the couch and turned on the tv.  The transition was amazing.  The very second the picture came on the screen (simpsons), I all of a sudden grasped my sense of time back.  My heart (which seemed to beat very slow before) had all of a sudden seemed 'real-time' which was actually quite fast.  It was very intersting how my perception of everything changed with the click of a button.

My mind was really starting to wander, something I avoided when I've been high with other people around me.  Thats what I liked about doing it alone.  I could explore my own ideas without the worries of looking like a burnout.  I layed down on the couch.  

I've always been interested in philosophy's of time+space in the universe.  I started to really think about it..and the most unexplainable feeling came over me.  I want you all to think for a minute of what 'Infinite' actually means.  If theres any word in the english language that's extremely hard to grasp/imagine, it's that one.  Try to imagine an infinite number of universes - and the GIGANTIC size of our own that reaches out billions and billions of light years, and no matter how hard you try to imagine, the concept of 'infinite' is the biggest mindfuck I've ever come across. 

For about 10 minutes, as I layed there on the couch staring up at the ceiling, I actually grasped what 'infinite' actually meant.  An infinite number of stars and life forms all of a sudden shot through my head.  Infinite possibilities of absolutely everything.  Everything existed at once, and forever.. infinately.  If our own universe has a boundary, there must be others beyond it.  There has to be.  It was an intuitive knowing because I FELT IT.  I felt like I finally understood.  I kept repeating to myself softly 'so this is what infinite means'.  

I fell asleep unintentionally, still in the peak of my trip.. so I actually had some really trippy dreams that night, waking up once in awhile still admiring the beauty of 'infinite'.  I still do, to this day...  

Ever since that trip I have shown an interest in the stars.  I download Hubble Space Telescope pictures and cant help but admire the absolute vastness of space.

Today, we sat down to smoke a bowl or two out of my friends new piece.  After 2 bowls between the four of us, I felt as though I was about to throw up.  This is just a temporary effect if you smoke way to big bowls.  Anyways, so after about 30 seconds the regular everything is funny, kinda chill feeling sets in.  But after that was the crazyest trip I ever had.  

First it was a subtle feeling of woah where am I, but over a course of about 30 or 40 minutes i started to feel reaaaaaly trippy.  It felt like I was in a room, and the floor was ice, but I didnt feel my body.  My friends head started to glow as he took on a meditative position and he looked like a genuine buddhist monk (even though he is caucasian).  Every once in a while I felt like I was sinking into my body again, and would not be able to concentrate while in my body, so I'd leave again.  

It was really cold all of a sudden and I was in my friend, I could feel his thoughts and movements.  It took about 3-4 hours till the last parts of the high were gone.  Looking back on it, it was pretty cool, but at the time it was scary.  We think it was either realllly dank or it was laced.

Cannabis - Hash





BODY WEIGHT:
200 lb




This happened a long time ago, back in my 'crazy' college days but may be of interest because it involves an experience I had from eating hash (something I have read little about from others). I tried this only one other time and had a great experience. That involved a ski trip I went on where I did not know anyone on the trip and therefore wanted to be secretive about getting high, but definitely wanted to experience snow skiing while stoned. Why?

Anyway, I took a small piece of hash (maybe the size of a pea but probably a little larger) and swallowed it just as a bus was leaving the hotel at 7:30 AM for the drive to the slopes. I think I ate breakfast AFTER swallowing the hash 'time bomb' and thought 'What a way to start the day' as I waited for any results. This seems like a very wasteful way to indulge on hash (which I have not even heard about in years, being pretty far removed form the drug scene now) but hey, I was a college student and had money and time to do such things.

After about an hour or so, I was incredibly stoned. I had sort of a sleepy, dreamlike sensation going though my head, NOT ideal for something as physically demanding (or dangerous) as snow skiing. I remember the best part being leaving the slopes after only one poor outing on the beginner's slope and finding a restaurant where I restarted the day with coffee and breakfast. I met a couple on their honeymoon who were friendly and talkative. They had no idea I was zonked out of my mind and feeling like each sentence was only babble. Well, I got recharged and skied my heart out making the most out of a unique opportunity and after the success of this 'experiment' a friend and I each ate a much LARGER amount of hash on the plane ride TO Amsterdam later in the spring of '87!

Why would I be wasting my hash when I could supposedly be 'almost' legally buying it on any street corner within twenty-four hours? Again, there were my 'crazy' college days and it 'seemed' like a good idea at the time. We planned to swallow the hash balls (I think it was A LOT of hash-- maybe the size of the ball used in pinball machines) in the bathroom at the airport right before entering security area where carry on bags are checked. What a weird plan! This was going to be my third trip to Europe from Atlanta and I wanted to make the most of it, I guess.

Again, like the time I swallowed hash and went skiing, it took an hour or so before the effects started to be felt. This time, however, it took longer and longer to really feel what was going on because of the larger amount consumed. It wasn't until well into the flight I not only felt super-stoned, I felt like I had taken a hit of acid! The constant noise of being in an airplane was intense and scary for the most part throughout the LONG night. Of course, sleep was out of the question and I was so wasted, I could barely communicate with my friend or even hear what he was saying. He seemed to be as uncomfortable as me and we both seemed to realize this was a mistake probably because of the large amount eaten.

Two particular things stand out on memory, 1) getting a dizzy feeling almost making me fall down when in the restroom which seemed half the size of a phone booth and scary because it didn't provide relief from the constant 'airplane noise' that was powerful and 2) talking with a beautiful Dutch flight attendant (I mean the MOST beautiful woman) who convinced me to try taking a sip of cognac after my meal because it was a custom on this KLM flight. I had just started to relax a little after eating (which seems to happen when tripping) and when I swallowed (a BIG sip - stupid) of this strong brandy or whatever it was, my head felt like it exploded! The pretty woman just smiled at me and probably thought how silly I looked and was for digesting so much hash and having to suffer on this airplane trip.

I FINALLY fell asleep and came down enough to stop freaking out. My poor friend remained awake the whole 'trip' and got less relief. We were both very much stoned throughout the day when getting settled in Amsterdam and this 'event' set the stage for a wild week of much smoking of hash and pot; fun times mixed with paranoia and unexplainable encounters which I can only imagine seemed as out of the ordinary because of the strong psychoactive substances and good beer being almost constantly consumed. Oh, the good ole days! Oh, eating hash - don't do it. Smoke it since it goes so much further. Its a 'no-brainer' which I felt like on that flight!

I finally did something I'd wondered about for years.  For quite a while I'd been a fan of the wake and bake, loving to lay snug in bed on a saturday morning and wrap myself in the comfort of a nice buzz.  Being sooo lazy, I would sometimes be annoyed that I would have to simply move my body from whatever perfect position my unconscious mind had established and expose myself to what on some days was the cold air in my room in order to light up, and of course not fall back to sleep with some burning object in my bed!

Vacation time!  I was at the end of a large bag of BC Hydro, and I was getting annoyed at how dry it was becoming as in my laziness I didn't take care of the bag too well.  I had the bright idea of mashing the whole thing up into powder and making cookies so as to enjoy my vacation days with the sustained intoxication produced by orally ingesting marijuana.  I baked the cookies, using what ended up being about 1/8th ounce of finely powered bud.  I ended up with about 9 cookies, and figured they would be very potent based on the quality and quantity of plant material I had used.  Well, I ate one my first day, and it barely did squat!  I was shocked and of course disappointed.  I figured I must not have cooked them long enough to really cause the THC to be activated, and in my frustration I mashed 'em up into gravel-y bits, spread them on a cookie sheet and cooked the crap out of them.  

Then I was struck with this brilliant idea- what if at some point that night, if I had to get up to pee, I ate some cookie gravel so when I woke up I would already be stoned?  This was my genius solution to that ever-present wake and bake inconvenience.

That night I went out and got pretty drunk.  I got home late and half drunk, grabbed a kitchen bowl, poured the gravel into it, grabbed a spoon, and went to pass out with this at my bedside.  Morning came and I woke up around 8:00am having to take a raging piss, really foggy from the night before...but time for the experiment to commence.  I 'eased nature' and kinda half awake, grabbed the spoon and dug in.  Unfortunately I can't tell you exactly how much I ate, there were 9 cookies, I had already eaten 1, and I would say I ate maybe about 1/2 of what was in the bowl...my dumb ass was just stitting there in a hung over daze, munching away thinking 'well, I want to make sure I don't suffer an underdose.'  Then I fell back to sleep.

The next thing that happened was me waking up suddenly, I semi remember that I was having a nightmare and I forced my way out of it.  I was up, and decided to put the radio on.  But something didn't seem quite right.  Something was different.  I couldn't figure it out, but hmm this seems familiar...then I remembered eating the cookiegravel.  Yes know I know what's wrong- I am unbelievably high!  I was actually beginning to get that feeling where your perception is like a drowning person and normality, or the surface of the water, is just out of reach.  And I was definitely reaching out for it - I was beginning to dissociate slightly.  I looked at the clock- it was 8:45.  It had only been 45 minutes since I had munched; my general experience with eating marijuana is that I reach a peak 3 or 4 hours after I ingest it.  I did the math and started to get a little concerned.  My first reaction was to make myself puke to purge what remained in my stomach.  That didn't really help me out- marijuana is an anti-emetic, and I shit you not when I say I was fingering the lining of my food tube and getting zero results.  This failure only worked to make the situation feel more out of control.  I was not happy- I had ingested a quite possibly heroic dose of THC on an empty stomach and come to the experience directly out of unconsciousness with zero transition.  

I was beginning to experience a kind of 'perception strobe' effect where, if this makes any sense, the entirety of my conscious perception (all my human senses, perception of time, thoughts, you name it) was trailing, like the visual trails you get from taking LSD but applied to every point of consciousness.  Luckily my roommate was home- let's call him Mr. Level Head, and his calm presence was quite reassuring.  I felt more reassured for my safety (goodbye paranoia!) and more willing to accept my fate- which was pretty interesting, albeit uncomfortable.  By 9:30am I was resigned to laying on a couch, walking was too difficult.  As I lay there, I was experiencing a feeling, a sensation, that was kind of 'superphysical'- I was experiencing the feeling of the boudaries of my body as an aura, expanding outward like ripples.  I never actually dissociated.  Even looking at myself I could see where I was and how I was laying, but what I felt was my 'being' radiating outward in ripples, coupled with the crazy perceptual strobe i mentioned.  As I got higher, the farther out I radiated and the stronger the strobe.  It was interesting, but not so pleasant ...waaay beyond stoned.  I lay there for pretty much the rest of the day, totally incapacitated.  Around noon I would say I was the highest I've ever been. 

In retrospect the quantity of THC that I had ingested was probably quite high, but the fact that I had gone from unconsciousness directly into a potentially overwhelming high without any transition made the experience even more difficult to get control of.  What may have added to the initial panic I felt was the fact that I awoke from what I think was a nightmare- but was the nightmare natural or my brain's reaction to the flood of THC it was experiencing?  In any case, my curiosity was satisfied.

Well, I must say that even if 2 years have passed, I still feel weird about that event. An event that changed my life in the years to come. In the summer of 2001, I was working on holiday in a camping park. I´m from Portugal by the way :)

So, it was an early morning, I entered work at 8:00 am. I have been for the last hour listening to new age music, and I was indeed relaxed. At 10:00 am I had the idea of eating some of the hachish I had buy from a friend. I had been smoking previously, a few weeks before but not too often, so I ngested about 1/4 gram, didnt chew, just swallowed it with water. The effects were taking a bit longer to appear than I expected, I thought that about 40 min would do, since I didnt eat breakfast. Well, it passed one hour and 30 min when the effects started to appear. It was very smooth, just a sense of deep relaxation and a little heaviness on the entire body. I started doing Yoga techniques like pranayama, and thats when things got weirder...

But, nice at the same time... I began to have visual distortions: I looked at the summer sky, and there was little clouds, like sheep, and I started wondering about sheep races :D and the clouds did start to run one after each other. Then I got my atention on my physical body, I sense a feeling of tightness on my back, like there was some force pushing against my spine. I was eye closed (someone could have entered the gate without me knowing) and I saw the interior of my body when I looked down with eyes closed.

there was a pink color ball of fire in the base of my spine, and blue sparks entering the inside from the sides of my body (below ribs) when the energy got so intense and bright, it all exploded and I felt like expanding to the limits of the universe, merging with everything... Deep Expansion. When I calmed down, I heard a song from a radio nearby, it was a rock song, but as I listened to it I saw it change... to a christmas song ( deck the halls with bowls of jolly, palalalala etc...) =) and I became confused but the music soon turned again to the rock music I had been listening. It all quieted down after few more minutes. I went home to lunch, still feeling extremely relaxed, and on the afternoon I went to sleep at 15:00 pm... awakening the next day at 17:00 pm! I slept for 27 hours. I was perplexed.

After this experience, I have been suffering from a few illness. I got apendicitis that evolved to a very dangerous condition, I had to be operated 2 times. I have been suffering from pains in the body, that appear from nowhere and disapear again without a trace.

I have been experiencing also subtle effects on my life, psychic abilities have been developing and a deep religious sense on my interior, I am now more inside my beliefs, buddhism. 
Thats all

Ok well I'd first like to start off saying that I was an expeirenced cannabis user for about 2 years, everyday or every second day smoking cannabis for about 2 years steady. I used to love the 'highs' I got from smoking cannabis, it used to make me feel good, and I could hold my tokes in and get really high, but a nice high and comfortable and never usually 'too' high.

The problems all started after 1 summer, when I was smoking this one strain of bud that I got off the same person I used to always get, when it started giving me anxiety, things just didn't feel right anymore and I was getting 'sketchy type' highs. I didn't even feel relaxed at all. I started having a few episodes where I would go into a case of extreme panic just off of a few hits, and my heart felt like it was going to explode and I couldn't seem to control it, I couldn't even stand still. I would have to powerwalk, or keep moving, no matter how hard I tryed to relax. Even with different strains, from different people, same thing would happen. I sort of cut back a lot on smoking cannabis, and only did it occasionally, but it was really hard considering that so many people smoke it now recreationally. Just about all of my friends were pot heads too. 

The day came that changed my life forever... It was after school on a wednesday, I picked up an eighth from the same buddy that I always used to pick off, he told me that I would like it and that it was good chrons. Me my friend and another friend walked into a field and rolled up about a 1 gram joint. I was the one who hit the joint the hardest and was holding in my hoots, and could always take huge tokes from marijuana cause it didn't bother me too much, and for some reason today I felt like getting ripped, but it was a bad move. I had about 7 or 8 huge tokes off the joint and I have never coughed so hard in my life. After we smoked it, we started walking in the direction of the store. Thats when it started to creep up on me. I turned to my friends and said 'I don't feel good' I wasn't feeling sick to my stomach at all, I just said that because my heart just started pounding, and I kept touching my face, and then I would turn to my friends and say 'Quit makin fun of me' they looked and said 'what are you talking about?' and just laughed at me. 

It started getting worse and worse, I was tripping out so bad it felt like something next level, like I just smoked crack or PCP or something. My heart beat was so fast, I thought it was going to literally beat out of my chest. I couldn't stand still at all, I had to keep walking. I told one of my buddies to go run in the store and buy me a drink and something to eat, he bought me a 7up and a chocolate bar. I took 1 bite out of the chocolate bar and I dropped it on the ground and my pop on the ground. This high wasn't going down, instead it kept going up and up.. and wouldn't level off. I have never been so fucked in my life, not even off booze. I saw my brother at the store, and my friends both ditched me because they didn't want to hang out with me or try and help me out when I was like that. They weren't really good friends anyway, and after that, I refuse to have anything to do with them. They seemed fine off that joint and I thought I was going to die any second. They just ditched me, and I ran into my brother and things started getting even worse, my brother and his friend would talk and it would seem like they were talking in slow motion but really fast, I can't explain it. 

This even felt like some sort of hallucinogenic trip mixed with a crack trip or something. I was sweating, and my heart felt like it was going to explode it was beating soo fast. After about what seemed like 6 hours, ended up only being about 2-3 hours. The trip finally started to level off, and my heart rate gradually slowed down and I continued to walk around and chill out until I went back home. When I came home that night, I felt weird and really sketchy. I just laid in my bed and fell asleep eventually. (I had school the next morning). I have never smoked pot again after this, and I don't think I ever will, unless maybe I could find an anti-anxiety type strain.

A lot of people don't understand, and just think marijuana is so safe. Well it is safe if you USE it right as with any drug. I'm from Western Canada, and we get some really strong marijuana up here, I used to be able to handle really well. I'm not sure if after awhile of smoking strong Cannabis that eventually there is a 'TURN' with some people, and they totally react to it eventually and they just can't handle it. I have read other people having similar experiences as me. Marijuana can be a potent drug, extremely potent, it can feel like a next level stimulant or hallucinogen. All depends on the strain you smoke, how potent it is, and how used to smoking cannabis you are. My main message in this is just for people to KNOW your body, KNOW how much you can handle, and DO NOT Misjudge Marijuana!

I smoked the half joint slowly. About the third toke I always start coughing uncontrollably. I find it helps to sip on iced water in between. I love the first draw the fragrance and the taste of the pot.

I laid on the sofa and listened to Vivaldi's four seasons. I couldn't believe how the music was filling my head and running down to my toes. My head was filled with images wrought by the music. I was in a garden filled with flowers of every colour. I was there reaching out to them, in the bright sun, marvelling at the green grass. I wanted to stay in the garden forever. I felt so relaxed, so peaceful. There was nothing else. No everyday worries. I looked at myself out of the garden. I laughed at me, laying there on the sofa.

I walked along looking up at trees moving softly in the breeze. The music was playing on. The trees were trembling to Vivaldi's violin. I saw a large mushroom and sitting on the cap was a plump, laughing, fairy child.

Then I was out of the garden, spinning in a coloured vortex. The music took over and I was in a giant cathedral looking up between vast gothic arches. The stone walls and floor made me shiver, so I pulled a blanket over myself. I keep it right there on the sofa, as I often feel chilled when I'm high. Then I was sailing out the stained glass windows, trailing the red, yellows and blues behind me in a vapour trail. I floated to the moon and dripped tears onto the world beneath.

I'd like to tell 2 experiences I've had with cannabis, that weren't very usual (in my opinion). The first one is a mental experience, the second is physical.

First experience : march or april 1999.

On a warm friday night, I and a couple of buddies decided to go out. We knew there was a good party, organized by a friend of ours, who would give us free beer. So the 3 of us went there by bike, since none of us had a car. The place of the party was about 15 kilometers away, so we were pretty tired when we got there. At the party, we first went to meet a friend of ours, who treated us to a beer or 2. A little later, we went outside, and one of my friends, L, told me he had brought a joint loaded with hashish. We were both experienced with cannabis, but he had never had a decent high (my diagnosis was that he mentally, subconsciously refused to get high, or something to that extent). About 15 minutes after we smoked the joint, we both started laughing like madmen. We sat outside for a while, simply laughing.

Then we went inside, and decided to go sit in some couches. In the mean time, L was extremely stoned. Unfortunately it was the kind where you simply sit, look blankly into space and dont say anything. Every once in a while, he would say 'wooow man, I'm so stoned', but nothing more. I on the other hand was babbling away with a couple of other friends that came to sit with us. At this time, about an hour after we smoked the joint, I began to experience strange things. I was having deja-vus, and I was having them every 10 seconds for about half an hour. I would be talking, going 'blabla...wow! again !...blablabla...wow ! again !' for half an hour.

I suppose you may know the feeling of a deja-vu, and I personally find it a somewhat creepy feeling. At the time tho, I was pleasantly high, and you could say that I was enjoying it, since it had never happened to me before. I dont know how I got those deja-vus, I guess the cannabis affected some area in my brain where the deja-vus are 'made'. But it was a nice experience nonetheless.

On a second occasion, I again went to a party with a couple of friends. This time, there were couches in the dancehall itself, which was nice. I was extremely stoned, and sat in one of the couches, watching the people dance. At a certain point however, I noticed that I couldnt move my neck anymore. No matter how hard I tried, it wouldnt move. I could only loosen it up by tilting my head, but otherwise, it wouldnt move. This lasted until I got up and danced. I suspect the feeling of not being able to move my neck was because I was wearing a turtleneck sweater (I believe that's what's it called). So my neck was kind of 'locked up' in there. Anyway, this was a pretty strange experience, although at the time I didnt mind it, I even thought it was pretty funny.

So, these were a couple of experiences. Nothing special if you ask me, but still not usual either.

I am a frequent user of marijuana.

By this I mean at least one or two bowls a day.  I do believe that this has somewhat allowed my body to build up a tolerance to weed, but this was certainly not the case with this event.

One bright and sunny afternoon, I found myself driving to my friend's house for a casual afternoon smoke.  When I got there, I found that all of my other friends were there also, in the process of opening up a keg of beer, although I drank very little since I generally do not enjoy being drunk nearly as much as being high.

Anyway, I sat down at a table of fellow smokers, and one of my friends passed me a spliff (cone shaped joint with both marajuana and tobacco).  I hit the spliff moderately hard, not really wanting to take a big lungfull of tobacco, but certainly felt the THC soaking into my lungs.

Within minutes, a different friend busted out a normal size bong, and proceeded to stuff it with weed, 'This stuff is called Skunk,' he told me, 'because of how much it smells... not quite as good as hydro, but it aint no shwag.  That's what's in that spliff also.'

After taking a hit himself, he passed the bong to me, and I took a moderate hit although it was not very well lit.  After taking another trip around the circle, the bong returned to my hands, and I wasn't feeling very high at all.  Determined to get blazed, this time I took the biggest hit possible.

Shortly after, I keeled over, putting my head down on the table and shoving the bong to the person next to me.

'Dude, you didn't even clear the chamber,' he said, although I wasn't really paying attention.

My body felt like a live current was being run through it, and every time I tried to take in a little breath, my lungs started to convulse and for a while, I thought that I was going to choke to death.  I couldn't open my eyes because every time I tried, the power of my vision flooded into my skull like a huge waterfall that pounded me like an anvil.

Almost everyone asked me if I was doing alright (good to know that I have friends like that) to which I nodded yes every time.

Eventually I was able to mutter, 'w...water...', and within seconds, one of my friends had brought me a glass.  I tried to drink some to clear out my throat, but each time I tried, my lungs started convulsing again.

Eventually, I forced myself to get up, open up my eyes, and take the glass of water inside where I found a couch to crash on.  I laid on that couch for maybe an hour, every now and then muttering, 'Oh my God...'  Later the next day, my friends would tell me that I kept saying unintelligible things that made absolutely no sense.

I was still coughing about every other breath, but I managed to slowly adjust to drinking water, and eventually had enough control over myself to leave and drive back home.  I took the mega-hit at around 4 PM.  I was still feeling high at 9 PM.  For some of you, that's a normal days work, but for a daily smoker like me, that's absolutely incredible.

The rest of my day was excellent actually, after I regained motor skills (that is, without feeling an overpowering force that drove me to the ground), I went and had an absolutely delicious dinner (everything tastes better to me while high), and just enjoyed everything.

My overall message is this: No matter how messed up I get, it'll be OK in the end as long as I remember that and don't get paranoid, and in the end, the good times will outweigh the bad.

I passed my drug test!   

Considering my weight and my body fat composition (I'm 5'0) I was terrified I would never be able to pass a piss test.  When the job I was interviewing for told me they were going to test, I almost walked out, but I needed the job really bad.  I had planned to use substitution, but when my donor backed out on me I had to think of something quick -- test had to be that day.

Lady Luck was smiling on me -- I'd been dry for almost a week when the job interview came up, and the interview process took a week before I had to pee.  But I knew I'd still test positive unless I did something drastic.

Three hours before the test, I drank 5 LARGE glasses of water, ate a piece of peanut butter toast (the fats supposedly help), and took two caplets of Horsetail (Shavegrass is another one that works, dunno if they are the same or not) that I had gotten from my local health food store.  Horsetail is a diuretic.  Another good one is Buchu.  I also took two b-complex vitamins to give it some color.

Urinated several times before I left for the test (don't worry, with the Horsetail you'll come up with plenty of urine), then drove thru the snow to take the test.  I was observed and they wouldn't let me wash my hands (gross!).  Came up with midstream test sample -- which was NEON yellow.  Pale, but still neon.  Lo and behold, I passed.

Side effects included a niacin flush reaction from so much b complex and pissing dark neon yellow for two days. 

Good luck and beat those bladder cops!

Wow. Never try this!! I am an idiot!

Setting: my bedroom, 10:30pm. slightly tired, but happy, and hopeful to get high. home alone.

I smoke pot very often, but was getting bored of smoking out of the same bowl all the time, so, i decided to try and hunt for parts for a new one. In the search, I found a gel pen, and a small pewter washer type of thing. I hot glued this to the pen, whose contents I had emptied. I thought I would just try and see if it hit well, or if the glue would melt, and when I lit it, the pewter started to melt slightly, and I got a fairly big hit off it. I felt high for a good 20 minutes, but had problems breathing.

After the effects wore off, i was almost gasping for air for about 5 minutes. I was coughing a lot. I felt like i had taken a big breath next to a fireplace where there was burning plastic; like i had plastic in my lungs. A pretty hard price to pay for a 20 minute buzz!!

To start things off, I'm 16 and have been smoking weed for about a year and a half, usually two or three times a week.

One day sitting at home a friend called me and said that he had just gotten half an ounce of purple haze from his brother and asked me if I would be interested in buying some. Having never tried purple haze I said of course. I ended up buying a quarter sack from him for $60.00 - high priced shit.

I was sitting around later that evening and decided that I was going to smoke some. (this was the first time that I ever smoked alone)I decided to only smoke one bowl since I heard that this was extremely potent pot. So, I got my pipe, went outside, and fired it up. I took one hit and waited a few seconds . . . nothing. After the second hit I started to get a tingling sensation in the back of my head which felt incredible. So i decided to take another one. After the third I started to feel my muscles relax and my body started to get extremely heavy, even more so than usual. At this point my heart was beating so fast that it was hard to breath but the reefer in the bowl was still burning so I decided to finish it off. After all, I payed good money for it and I wasnt about to waste some good pot. So I enhaled the fourth hit and while I was holding it in I fell down on the ground and started laughing insanely. I felt so great! I then put the pipe away and went inside to watch some tv. But that's when things started to go wrong.

I dont know why but I started to feel guilty about smoking the weed and began to get very very paranoid. I thought at any moment my heart was going to explode and I was going to die. I tried to think about something else but it didnt work. I would start feeling guilty and paranoid again. It seemed like hours had gone by and I began to think that it would soon go away but when I looked at my watch, only 5 minutes had passed by!

For the next few hours I was in emotional hell, with feelings of depression and anxiety. But after while I started to come down and feel somewhat normal again but for the next few days I felt a feeling of deep guilt and didnt smoke pot again for about a month. The next time I did smoke, I only took 2 hits and it was phenominal. But be warned. When trying a new kind of weed, especially very potent weed, pace yourself and only smoke a little at a time so you dont get too stoned and have a panic attack like I did.

Before I even begin, let me just state that I am a 16 year old student and I have been a habitual marijuana user for over a year. I am a fairly experienced psychonaut as well. I have had experiences with DXM, LSD, salvia, nitrous, PCP and loads of other chemicals whose names I can't recall. In short, I've tried everything I've ever been offered and I have (miraculously) lived through experiences that should've landed me an obituary. With all that said, last night was the most incredible night of my life, and it took nothing but two bowls of bud, great music and the love of my life.

Now, I understand that this report isn't very orthodox, in the way that it's not simply about tripping out and getting a new perspective on shit, this is honestly an evening that changed my life and I doubt I will ever live a day without remembering last night.

For two months before last night, my girlfriend (we'll call her K) had been out of town and I had only talked briefly with her several times while she was gone. So, naturally, when she came home we felt like celebrating. We did so by calling my most reliable dealer and getting two grams of Northern Lights sativa. After driving around for an hour or so, looking for a good park to toke in, we settled on a nice field about 100 yards off of a local highway and parked the car. I packed the first bowl and turned it over to K. She took a nice big hit and held it in for what seemed like an eternity, when she blew it in my direction I was overwhelmed by the all-too-familiar aroma of really, really good weed. We passed the bowl back and forth for a good twenty minutes when I decided to crash in the back seat and let the music flow through me. After about a half hour of stoned nothingness, I leaned over to K and touched her fingertips to mine, we then, almost instinctually began moving our hands as one. We were moving in very fluid, sensual motions with no apparent leader, this went on for a good fifteen minutes when she turned her head to mine and smiled. At this point, despite my intense drymouth, I kissed her. It was a brilliant kiss, magnified a thousand times by the euphoria of the weed, it was warm and soft and with my eyes closed all I could see was a picture of the ocean, all in shades of pink and red. Then, I fell back into the seat and began to doze off, but, minutes before I fell into the Sandman's grasp, the door opened and K climbed in.

We sat there for a time, just holding eachother, listening to Van Morrison play on the radio. Just the sensation of being totally wrapped in another person was so divine, I was, 'happy as a clam.' As the music ebbed and swelled our bodies seemed to move with it, then as the song climaxed, it became apparent to me that we had been slowly removing one another's clothes. As the next song began, I realized that we were not only naked, but making love, and I had not even conciously acknowledged it until this point. Upon figuring out what was going on in the back seat of K's car, I climaxed, and became a potential father. At that precise moment, 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' by Guns 'n Roses began playing over the radio, and by God, I certainly felt like I was knocking on Heaven's door. She looked at me, and I looked back, and I started crying. 

I stepped outside of the car, naked both physically and emotionally. I looked at the stars, and I looked at the car. I looked at my surroundings, and realized that I had just become eligible for fatherhood at the age of 16. When I went back to the car, K was crying. We sat there and said nothing for an hour or so, sobered up, and finally she cleared her throat. Before she could say anything I reassured her that whatever happened, and whatever she chose to do, that I loved her and that I would be there all the way to the end. Now, I've heard people talk about eye-contact, and I've looked people in the eye before. But this time, when our eyes made contact, so did our souls, and it was beautiful. She dryed her eye and smiled.

We got dressed, and told ourselves that everything would be okay, and we decided that in the morning we would visit the planned parenthood center and get a morning after pill. We went back to my house, sat on my floor, and I was bombarded with feelings of fear. But at the same time I was happier than I had ever been, because I recognized what had happened as a sort of test of our friendship, and we passed it with flying colors. And I'll tell you what, I've never, ever felt so high.

I should start off by mentioning that pot can have a WIDE range of effects on me. Anything from a light stoning affect, to a three hour long 'trip'. I call it a trip because I DO hallucinate off pot sometimes.

A friend of mine asked me and my room mate if we wanted to go toke with her. We both said yeah. We walked down to the river by campus and sat on one of the park benches to smoke. It was night, about 10pm, and very windy. Pretty cold, too.

I took a hit of the first joint and held it in as long as I could, about 30 seconds. I exhaled and immediately took another long toke and held it in for the same ammount of time. By the time I passed the joint to my room mate, I could already tell it was going to be one of 'those times'. After coughing for about five minutes while my head buzzed like crazy, I settled into a strange dream-like state. It's the same feeling I get coming down from shrooms. It feels like I'm waking up from sleep every 5 seconds or so. Or like I'm not actually part of time. I can remember everything that happened, but nothing that happens regisers with me UNTIL I remember it. It's hard to explain. I don't know how long we were out there, but it felt like hours. The wind was blowing my face off, and I felt like if I turned my head I would see my flesh blowing away with the wind.

Eventually (what seemed an eternity, was really only 10 minutes) my friends were done and got up to leave. I was very cold by this time, and my heart felt like it was beating in rhythm with a hardcore techno song. It didn't feel good. So we started walking back to rez, and I ended up walking a few steps behind the other two as they talked. I still couldn't get my mind to work 'in the moment', I just kept remembering everything that was happening. Then I snapped back into time, but my vision went all funny. Everything looked 2D and all the colors were washed out, just like in a cartoon. It looked like I was watching the Simpsons. The walk seemed to take forever, but eventually we got back to our friend's room and sat down to watch TV. The next few hours are a complete blank to me. I apparently went to the other end of rez to visit a friend, but I don't remember that at all. The only thing I can remember is all of a sudden realizing that I was in my friend's room, watching the Simpsons.

This has happened to me at other times, but not nearly as strong as that.

A friend of mine, Matt, was drifting away after the summer ended. We stopped talking and hanging out. Every now and then he would come over to my house, pick me up and we would drive around with his 'new' friends and get stoned. I didn't really feel connected with him anymore, he seemed older, more mature. Recently, we have been talking and hanging out a lot more, and I got to spend the night at his house with a friend of his. I didn't really know this new friend...and I felt intimidated. Anyway, we were walking around the area I live in, trying to get 'shrooms, but just settled for more weed. We went behind the movie theater and got stoned. They smoked 2 bowls between them, and I smoked 1 (I'm very sensitive). We then waited out front of the movie theater for Matt's friend's dad to pick us up. While we waited we had a long conversation about how fake the moon landing was. It was actually a very interesting conversation, full of exaggerated facts and fake sources, like most of the conversations me and Matt had over the summer, only Matt's friend was joining in.

When we got to the mall, me and Matt's friend, still slightly stoned, talked about 'shrooms and how great they are. After a while at the mall, we went back to Matt's house. Matt's house has a lot of history, we always got stoned there, it was the best place to go. Now, I felt very comfortable around both Matt and his friend, being able to have a good back and forth conversation with both of them. I felt connected, I finally felt like I belonged after losing my best friend.

We then smoked the rest of my weed in a blunt, and they smoked 2 more bowls between them. A half hour later, I asked if we could smoke more, so Matt packed 3 bowls. About an hour after smoking out of the pipe, I asked to smoke a little more, so we smoked 2 more bowls. Now I felt even more comfortable. These were my friends. We talked about how weird batman was, and how great weed is. I didn't quite learn anything new while hanging out with them. I never smoked weed to have a 'life affirming experience.' Just after me and Matt drifted away, I kind of became a hermit, and lonely, unable to care about anyone, but that night changed my attitude completely. It was a great experience, and I never felt more comfortable around two people in my entire life.

Just last night i had a very impressive experiance.  I was hanging about with some of my closest friends smoking some top notch cannabis.  I have smoked many, many, many, many times before and last nights experiance was something special.  I have not taken any 'halucinogens' and do not particularly care to.  What happened last night was an eye opener of EPIC proportions, and i was surprised that i got the effect that i did.

At Appoximatly 8:30 (t+00.00) we packed a (supposedly) average sized bowl.  I say supposedly because i was the one who packe it, and i didnt put that much in. However, the sample burned FOREVER.  Its a nice change when the bud sticks around for a while rather than going up in smoke so quickly.  There were 5 of us, and the pipe went around about 5 times!!!  about 3 times more than usual.  To re-itterate, this was a pleasant surprise.  Once the bowl was finished (t+.15) we were all quite high,  very happy high too, gigles and smiles all around.

I went down stairs to watch some TV, unlike many of those who submit reports to Erowid, i thoroughly enjoy the boob tube, it tends to be nice to me, regardless of how i treat it.  In the middle of Titus(T+45), i began to get this smile.  Not on my face, but in my gut.  I felt as if i had been lifted.  My body got up and went down the hall to a small bed room where it put on some Bob Marley and lied down on a futon, legs crossed and eyes closed.....simply enjoying the high.  Once lying down my mind could fully wander.  The first thing i saw (!!!) was a tennis player...like the ones on super tennis on super nintendo. He was green orange and yellow....all very intense shades. It was as if i was on the level of the court looking up at him from about 15 feet away.  Then a tennis ball went careening through my feild of vision, covered in the saem blues yellows and greens.  

I am, or was, afraid of halucinations, and still have no urge to try any other substance.  Curious?  yes... willing to try?   no. Im not sure why, it just doesnt seem right to me.  After seeing the tennis bit, i shot up.  Sitting straight as a board, my mind came back to zero. Then i realized what had happened, i was hallucinating.  It took me a moment to realize that i was SAFE.  Around friends, in a house with no worries to speak of.  I lied back down and tried to find that place again.  (t+1:15)  I found it!!!  it came back in full force and this time, willingly took a ride.  This lasted for about 15 minits more...until i could no longer keep my experiance to my self.

I ran up stairs to tell my companions about what had happened.  None of them had gotten the same effects.  Maybe my 'set' had something to do with it.  I have just recently beaten a long time case of depresion and anxiety, and realized that i am the happiest person on this planet.  There is nothing that i cant do if i put my mind to it, and nothing can worry me.  Its a nice mind set to be in...let me tell you.  

Anyhow, my friends mainly dismissed it as i tend to have very different experiences than they do. I went out on the back patio for a smoke, and then the world let me in on a little secret.  Its mine, and im sure that the rest of you know it too, so im not going to write it down.  Once this secret hit me, the world opened up.....i watched an appartment complex take off...like a rocket ship.  Then my attention turned to nature.  Everything was praising the sky....the trees, with each and every branch reaching up to touch it. In the snow on the ground i saw faces, mountains and other earthly bits and peices.  Never once did my attention sway towards the universe, i felt centered where i was.

(t+2.45)  Comming down was unappreciated, i was having too much fun.  But all good things must come to an end. I went inside and joined my friends in a conversation. I tried to bring them outside with me, but no one was interested...i guess that this was a little gift from cannabis, to me.  I was thankful, and hope to be on the receiving end again soon.

My perspectives change, maybe for the better, but most certainly not for the worse.  Take it in stride and all greivances will be lifted.

hmm where to start.... i've been smokin mj for a few months, and i can tell you it's definitely been one of the most exciting things to come into my life for a long time! here's a story of one of the most interesting sessions i've had:

this happened just last night, so it's pretty clear in my head. it was my friend's 16th (i'm 15) and she was holding a big party. me and my girlfriend (we'll call her b.) rolled up expecting a pretty cool party, but it was kinda boring, and we got there a bit late so everyone was kinda wasted already. b. doesn't do any drugs of any kind, and there weren't any spare for my use. we just chilled the whole night, went for a walk, it wasn't really much of a party for us. at about 11pm a whole bunch of people showed up who were way older than us and basically fucked the whole place, trashed the tables, etc., so that sucked. they left around midnight, and so did b. and a few other people. i went and chilled out with some other friends for a bit, but we got bored and went for a walk to get some fresh air.

understandably, we were a bit down about not being able to get nicely trashed like we wanted to (my 2 friends i was with unfortunately didn't have anything either), so we were absolutely stoked when we heard our mutual friend had scored a $10 deal, and we quickly ran back to the party.

now over here in Australia, $10 doesn't get you a great deal of weed, especially when the person who buys it smokes most of it before he gets back to the party! he only had one big nug left, but he was pretty gone so he just put it in a piece and said we could all have some. we went outside with our really dodgy grav bong (our good bong got taxed), in the dark, and proceded to have about a hit each. i always considered myself pretty tolerant to weed, but this time i took in WAY too much and i was coughing my guts up for about 10 minutes (it seemed like a long time, the effects set in after about 30 seconds), and this was really good stuff, so i got completely ripped off this one hit! i went inside where everyone else was, sat down holding my head, and basically tried to keep myself alive (or so it seemed), because i could hardly breathe. i must have looked like shit because everyone was coming up to me asking if i was ok. of course i wasn't ok for a while, but that passed, and after about 30 mins and a lot of liquids, i was feeling so completely wasted i almost fell over on several occasions. this is more wasted than i've ever felt, and i've had over 16 bongs during one session!

all in all, i had a really good night in the end, and i'm still amazed at how gone i was off such a small amount. i was considering moving on to LSD because i wasn't getting enough out of weed, but last night changed my mind completely!

Me and my friend B were pretty steady pot smokers until B had to go on vacation and he had to stop use for 2 weeks. I had still been using but not as often.

I wanted to smoke out of our 2 foot bong we call the cannon to bring back that marijuana feeling. For me the bong was always the most efficient way to smoke. Basically, the bong got us fucked! We bought an 1/8 of mids (decent weed, few seeds) from my dealer and headed on over to a hidden area for us to smoke in peace. Well, we began by packing the first bowl. We took the enormous hits which occasionally made us cough. After the second bowl, I noticed I was feeling extremely fuzzy-eyed and kind of floaty. As soon as we were done smoking, we decided to take a walk to the store to buy some munchies.

We sat down outside of the store to just chill while we ate. I felt pretty good at this point, but there was this feeling of anxiety. I would watch the cars drive by and criticize the shitty ones and point out the ones I thought would be nice to drive for the day. Then as each car drove by, it started to get annoying to look at them and everything was bright. When the cars drove by they seemed to move slower than usual. They were all 2-D, like I couldn't see all the dimensions of the car and I couldn't tell where the corners of the car were. 

We got up to walk to a friend's about 30min. later and I saw patterns around my vision. You know where you can see farther right or left when looking straight ahead. Well, in the black area around my vision I could see patterns. I know I'm not crazy because I am sitting here typing this today more sober than I have ever been and I can't even see the blackness around my eyes. I think it's just me, but many times when I smoke I get the weird tunnel-like vision that I experienced that day.

I tried the butane as described on Erowid at 
http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_info13.shtml 
and found that it worked extremely well.  I used approximately 1 ounce of some dried leaf clippings and about 1/16th an ounce of some really old buds that I had lying around.  

I extracted using two 3.5oz cannisters of ultra-refined butane (lighter
fluid refill) into a 12 inch PVC pipe with a 1.5 inch inner diameter.  I used several small holes in the bottom with a piece of paper napkin as the filter.  My result was about 1.9 grams of pure hash oil (about 5% yield).

I rolled two 1.5 gram joints and put a small amount (perhaps .2g) of this oil in only of of the two joints.  Then two friends and I compared the effects of these two joints.  The hash-laced joint was clearly much stronger to all three of us-- a much more uplifting, heady high and no 'couch lock' effect.  The comedown took longer than with the unlaced joint as well.

The source material was headed for the trash -- I now can't believe I almost threw this away!  This oil is absolutely a treasure.  It took only about 20-30 minutes of effort from start to finish to make.  Highly recommended!

This account is the first of who-knows how many to come, a path that has led us to question much of what we thought reality to be.  It was an accident really, that propelled us into what has been a journey and a dream concerning our lives, and how they are connected.  

We took the long way to the farm on account of vague directions and even vaguer attention.  Farmer wanted us to camp with him, but we only planned to go out for the evening.  

We took a walk around the farm just after our arrival.  Farmer handed Jim and I what appeared to be an abused fig-newton.  It was his candy, he said.  It was figs and raisins and dates and extracted THC, the psychoactive in Cannabis.  Farmers candy is made with what is still a closely guarded recipe.  He told us wed be staying the night and we nodded-  we planned on leaving late.  Little did we know that Farmer was right.  I had had some prior experience with smoking Cannabis, and the experimentation every high school student has with alcohol.  I didnt think Jim had experience with anything, but he took the candy without seeming hesitation.  They werent horrible but they wouldnt sell on taste alone either.  

After our walk I began to notice subtle shifts in attention span and depth of field.  I felt as though I was speaking from far away.  I remember asking Jim a question and then wondering if I had spoken at all.  He said he felt nothing.  My attention would drift without notice, and then when I became aware of it, I was unsure of how long I had been gone.  My focus seemed to lock onto isolated quadrants, i.e. the plants directly around my feet as we walked, or a tree on the far bank, a spot on the water where the light flashed, etc.  Everything else was perfectly visible, but like a camera with a shallow field of focus, one area was observed with perfect clarity.  

Jim went off to do some thinking and meditate.  Farmer said Jim was high, although I couldnt tell.  Ten minutes ago I had been laughing in hysterics, and now I had become very foggy, worrying that I would lose track of the young dog I had brought along, despite how close she stayed all night.  

Farmer alerted me to Jim, now sitting some distance off staring out over the fields.  I told Farmer that Jim was practicing a Zen meditation.  Farmer found this particularly amusing.  I was unsure.  I was beginning to feel the first wave of a paranoia that gripped both Jim and I that night.  If you like the candy, beware kids, whatevers inside  is coming out!  I worked on it for a few moments and got it under control, riding the wave and paddling up to meet the next one.  We faced five or six of these waves of paranoia over something or other.  Each one seemed weaker than the previous.  Farmer was there as the voice of experience, and experience has taught this psychonaut that its always good to have a Tripmaster;  someone who has enough experience to go along with you for the journey, as well as cope with the real world if necessary.  That voice of experience was needed when Jim came rushing back into camp.  

I saw him running from a long way off and he seemed to take longer than I expected to arrive.  Not only depth perception was affected but perception of time as well.  What we thought to be an hour was fifteen minutes, six hours only two.  I was lying beside the camp-fire when Jim finally arrived.  

When I first began to trip on the candy I took every opportunity to go pee and try and clear my head.  I kept wondering that if we had knowingly and willingly induced this state of mind that was euphoric and fearsome at the same time, then why did the mind seem to constantly try to reassert itself to its standard frame of awareness?  I remember thinking at the time that these could not be higher states of consciousness then, but lower, more primal states.  After a good many other trips and conversations with mushrooms later on, I changed my mind.  I think what we experienced that night on our initiation was resistance.  We go after an experience sometimes with a preconceived notion of what we will receive, when the truth is, we can only accept what we are given and transform it into what we needed all the long.  

When Jim finally reached the camp he was frantic. He was dying, overdosing.  He was having an anxiety attack.  His heart was beating furiously and he couldnt breathe.  I wanted to tell him it was simply a rush, that my heart was pounding too, but my words seemed to come from a long way off and never made it past my lips.  Farmer tried to reassure Jim that everything was alright, but this was Jims first experience with anything this strong, and he was not to be immediately calmed.  

A lost tourist pulled up just then, and things got a little sticky.  Jim felt he was receiving no help from our group so he rushed up to the car window of the man and asked him to take him to the hospital.  Farmer, the Tripmaster, shooed Jim back toward the camp and got rid of the tourist, giving them directions and explaining that Jim was a newly diagnosed diabetic, and had forgotten his insulin.  We would have to ride into town to get some from a local pharmacy.  For one moment or two I thought we were going to spend the night or more in jail in Iowa!  

Farmer talked Jim down and then took us for a walk.  Jim rode that first big wave of paranoia and then began to see a point of clarity that he could operate from, and we began to talk and sort out what we were feeling and thinking.  The waves seemed to stem from deep-seated fears or traumatizing events.  These were new stretches of the horizon for Jim, and to rush into it with little or no introduction, and to such depths I cannot imagine.  I tease him about it still, but never belittle.  

I remember Jim handing me his soda bottle, asking me to hold it because he didnt trust himself with it.  I was barely able to hold onto my own, but took it out of reflex, painfully aware of the icy cold.  I didnt know Farmer very well at the time and at one time a distrust of him arose in me.  It stemmed from the vulnerability factor, and not trusting myself this time, I placed my pocket knife in the car, only to retrieve it moments later in case I needed it.  None of our fears were justified.  

Periodically riverboats passed lit for the night now, and Farmer seemed to lose his mind whenever one passed us.  He would leap out of his chair and run to the bank, once screaming at the Queen of Iowa.  Hey!  Can you hear me?!  He loved the moon, the riverboats, the sacred circle he believed we sat in, and the people who lived here before us.  Farmer would prove out to be a kind of mad mentor to us, a friend and gentle conspirator.  He was Wendell Berrys Mad Farmer  with a shamans rattle.  Thanks Farmer, for everything.  

We slept in the car toward the end of the evening.  Sleep was fitful, and when we did leave the next morning we were not entirely clear of the effects.  My attention drifted on the ride home.  Once, we came to wonder how we had arrived on the top of some grassy hill, and had to turn around and find our foggy way back.  Even after a nights sleep I was still foggy from the experience.  I worked at night and sometime around six in the morning I knew I was clear.  That would make the total run time about thirty-one hours of various states of altered consciousness, with the core intensity about six or seven hours.  

I called Jim and we got together for a long walk and talk.  He decided never to place himself in these states again.  I felt somewhat the same on the tail end, but the more time that flowed between myself and the experience, I saw that I was more and more apt to experience and experiment again.  Did we gain anything from that experience?   I think so.  We faced our deepest fears, the ones we pack around with us on a daily basis, and we came through to the other side.  Like good travel, one always goes far from home, only to wish for our own bed again.  And once home we begin to think back and long for foreign dust on our shoes once more.  

This experience was had at a small, isolated farm just outside of a major city in Iowa.  Jim is still pursuing his spiritual and intellectual curiosities, as am I.  Farmer is still Farmer, and as far as Im concerned thats a good thing.  I am planning to write more of these chapters, experimenting with LSA, Stropharia Cubenis, Mescaline, and Syrian Rue.  I would encourage any potential or fledgling psychonauts out there to listen carefully to your heart, research like a scholar, and experience ecstatically.

It's surprising how such a small amount of a thing can effect such a profound change in a person. I just shelled out $30 for an eighth of ganja. I know it's a large price for such a small amount (4 oz is about $300 where I come from), but it was well worth it. It was my first hookup from this person (I will call him 'Steve'), and I had the usual hope/joy/fear feeling that comes from putting your trust in somebody you hardly know. Two days later, it happened, 'Steve' told me to meet him in class early; we would 'make the pass' there. A simple handshake and a smile was all it took. Now, normally, I don't like to do that stuff at school, because I believe that students that don't want to be exposed to 'drugs' at school have the right not to be (that and it's almost asking to get busted), but I made an exception that day. School flew by in a blur as I anticpated my enjoyment of the evening.

I got home at 3:00 that afternoon, and made my preperations. A glass of lemonade to stave off cottonmouth, a carrot (a very effective way to eliminate ganja breath), and 'Are You Experienced?' by Jimmy Hendrix was all I needed.

At exactly 4:20 I packed my bowl and sparked up. I took a few 'warm-up hits' (I hadn't toked up in a while) and took a few more regular hits. I then repacked and relit. 

Now, I don't know if it was something in the ganja, or if my lungs just reacted strangely, but when I was about ready to take another hit, I involuntarily inhaled VERY deeply. I was overcome instantly with a feeling of extreme disorientation and confusion. I put my bowl away and just sat there for a while. I ate my carrot and sipped the lemonade as I felt the first effects of cottonmouth coming on. I put Jimmy on and listened for a while. 

When 'The Wind Cries Mary' came on, I felt a funny feeling in my ears. You know when you have the munchies and eat something crunchy and get that really good feeling in your jaws? Well, I had that, only in my ears! It was the most amazing feeling I have had in my life so far (I'm only 16). I sat there for what seemed like hours, listening to 'The Wind Cries Mary'. I downed the last of my lemonade and grabbed a pack of gum on my way outside to see what I could see.

I sat in my back yard, chewing gum and watching the sun set. It was incredably beautiful. All the colors and shapes seemed to dance in the sky, just for me. I felt deeply awed and honored to be able to see this sunset. I sat and thought about myself and my life, and their directions. I learned some pretty deep stuff about myself that evening. For example, I found that by unintentionally acting like an asshole for most of my youth, I had hurt some people pretty badly, and had really been a major source of bad vibes. Others did not hurt me, I only hurt myself.

When I came down, I felt reborn. I wanted to put my lessons learned into use. My life was going to be better from now on, I came back to school with a new mission. I made amends with all the people I had hurt. I got some wierd looks (apoligizing to somebody for something you had done 5 years ago will do that). And started to learn, not just be there. What were once D's and F's are now A's and B's. I have turned my life around, all because of a kind green bush that the U.S. government has decided must be outlawed because the think it is bad for people. It is because they do not listen to people like me. They refuse to hear the good, only the bad.

I would like to thank Erowid for allowing me to voice my profound changes brought on by the kind bud. May we all learn greater lessons to come.

I consider myself fairly educated in cannabis and so was somewhat caught off guard by this event.  Two weeks ago, I and four other close friends decided we would spend a Friday testing the limits of cannabis and its potency.  At about 9:30pm we decided we would blaze. We each had a dub.  I smoked a full dub, and after about 10 minutes began to feel my body warming up. My knees became very loose and I soon had to watch my step because controlling the amount my knees bent was becoming very difficult.  As we headed back to the car I became aware of a very intense full body feeling, my knees were now just like Jell-O, and my fingertips felt as though hundreds of tiny hands were slowly pulling them. 

As we got into the car, we got into a long conversation on the depth of the seats and how our bodies had 'melted' into them, giving us all an odd unison with the vehicle.   We conversed on subjects ranging from the simplest thoughts to the deepest of emotion, as time became an infinite realm of thought and divine right.  The stars glowed, and the wind brought full body orgasms at the slightest breeze. Vision became like the shot of a 35mm camera, sequences of beauty flashed in my mind and I could relate to my youngest childhood memories once again.  As we exited the car and began to walk up the steep driveway of my friend's house, it began to be a struggle as the floor would convulse and grow beneath us.

In his kitchen, we found two cartons of mocha ice-cream, which we polished off in a matter of minutes, the flavors being more intense than imaginable, as though our tongues were now holding a small world of impossible reality and depth.  We made our way to his room and watched TV. I began drawing and soon had come up with some very interesting sketches, most of them, although drawn with a blue pen, appeared to be sketched with black charcoal.  My trip was in full effect, for some reason which to this day I am still unsure of. I decided that black and white were the precursor to reality.  The lines that defined good and evil, truth or lie. I began to question the world around us and the false charade that had become of it.  Everything to me was a media and I used every medium near me to explain this. On the sketch I wrote 'Novus Ordo Seclorum,' a phrase used on the back of the one dollar bill, signifying revolution and the dawn of a new day.

At around 2am we decided we would all take a break and get some sleep, and just as with my reality, the dreams were altered.  When we woke the next day we were all groggy although we agreed the night before had given us some of the most pleasant dreams imaginable.

I HIGHLY suggest to anyone to try cannabis at least once,  it is not very addicting, and no, it is not going  make you go 'crazy' and  regret the night you have. I'm not saying that YOU HAVE TO SMOKE WEED  or that you won't get out of control if anything happens to you, it's your problem, not mine, but I do suggest trying it once.

This was the second time I tried Salvia, the first being two days earlier. I am a member of the now defunct Church of the Tree of Life, and had obtained a live specimen back in 1979, and it must have been good stuff, as my two cats scaled several bookshelves in order to attack & devoured it (they were fond of fresh cannabis also). I had also experimented with coleus several times with no noticeable results. 

Any ways, I got together with a tripping buddy at about 1:00PM, I had read a lot of trip reports and had a pretty serious attitude about our endeavor, his approach was a bit more cavalier. At 1:00 we each did a hit of mj. At 1:05 we both took 3 droppers of the Sage Essence, while I held mine in my mouth for a full ten minutes, he swallowed his at 4 or 5 min. and then took an additional two droppers. Even before I reached the 10 minute mark I was feeling effects that seemed to start in my mouth & throat.

One thing I have not read in other trip reports is a mention of euphoria,
which I definitely did feel, I also felt myself move into a semi-familiar state of tripping. That is to say, I was definitely tripping, but with a different flavor than acid or shrooms. My friend was a bit restless, and I later found out that he wasn't any where near where I was, he said that he felt a few minutes of a gelatinous feeling, and a rather narcotic feeling after that, but nothing else. 

On the other hand I was able to close my eyes and see colorful swirls. After a few more minutes I was feeling as though I was in between worlds, or realities, that I was existing in the barrier between these realities. Behind me was myself and the physical existence, and in front of me was an expansive,(infinite?), reality filled with all sorts of images, stars, planets, beams of energy, expanding in all directions. All these things were sort of half-seen and half-felt. I then became aware of a bluish/purple form in front of me. It was undulating and morphing, but never took on a definite shape. The unique thing at this point was that the form and the space in front of me took on a fuller 3-d appearance. There was a lot of other stuff going on at this time as well, I remember a feeling of leaves at one point as well. 

Right about here my friend got up and walked past me, and I was brought back to this side of the barrier. I got up to go to the bathroom, and it was as if I was a foot shorter than I really am. I should also mention that I am diabetic, and I got very dehydrated during this experience, I mean I peed like crazy. When I sat back down, I tried explaining what had happened to me to my friend. And as I did, I could close my eyes and see/feel things still going on, the 3-d richness had passed, but my hands seemed to move in the other reality, I could feel it. I remember telling him something about open eye reality, closed eye reality, and how this experience moved beyond closed eye reality. Well it all made sense at the time. 

I also felt very high/stoned/euphoric during this time. On a second trip to the bathroom, it felt as though I was walking on blocks, but a foot below the level of the floor. I then lay down on the floor and watched the ceiling, there were silhouettes of fractal leave patterns moving around there. They almost seemed like spotlights, but the edges of the beams were not well defined. I lay there for 30 min. watching these beams as they changed color. At some point there seemed to appear a hole/ or tube, but it never really developed, it couldn't 'break through'.  At this time, we had both pretty much returned to normal open eye reality, but a narcotic type of feeling continued for another 30 to 45 min. 

I have about a third of this magic bottle left for one more try, and probably will feel compelled to relay that experience as well.

As all smokers tend to be, I am very close friends with the people I would describe as my 'connection' for obtaining marijuana.  This relationship has several benefits, not the least of which is getting in on some killer strong dope whenever it falls into my friends' hands.  This experience pertains to just such an occasion.

Whenever I would stop by my friends' house, one of the first thing they would do is set me up with a big ol' binger and insist that I suck down the whole bowl-full by myself.  Early on in our relationship when I had first started smoking, this would sometimes become quite annoying as I would not want to finish the whole bowl and would have to come up with new and innovative ways to try and get away without finishing the entire thing.  Time progressed however, as time tends to do, and after a few short months of constant smoking my tolerance was soon high enough that that tightly packed bowl was a much welcomed sight when I walked through my friends' door.

Then, one day, came the India Kush.

On this particular day, my friends' and I had retired to their bedroom to partake in our bong-hitting ritual.  My binger was set up first and I noticed right off the bat that it was a significantly smaller bowl then I was usually offered.  In fact, it seemed to be one, maybe just two hits of weed at the most.  But, I reminded myself, it wasn't my weed and my friends are by no means ungracious hosts, so I took the proffered bong and promptly lit it up without complaints.  I filled the chamber of the bong with about the amount of smoke I usually like to take in on one hit and sucked it down.

Immediately I wished that I hadn't.  The smoke felt much 'denser' then it usually was and the urge to cough became nearly unbearable.  I waited for a nice long count of 10 though before I finally gave in and blew the smoke out of my lungs.  The effects of the hit seemed to set in immediately.  As I slowly tilted my head back with the last tendrils smoke floating towards the ceiling, I felt like the back of my skull was inexplicably being drawn towards the ground.  I could feel my vision expanding, my peripheral vision becoming sharper and wider.  Only one or two minutes after taking the hit, I realized that my cheeks were hurting because I had been smiling ever since the bong hit the floor.  It was definitely a GOOD feeling and I probably should have stopped right there.

But, as I said, my friends can be very insistent.

I wound up finishing the rest of the binger in about 1 ½ hits.  By the time I passed the bong on to be re-packed, I was completely out of my mind.  My friends, who were all still sober, were chatting and watching TV.  It was all I could do to sit there and keep my eyes open.  I felt like my brain was racing with thoughts and images faster then I could consciously process them.  The closest thing I could describe the feeling too is tripping on mushrooms.  It was very similar in that I felt that the individual compartments of my psyche had been suddenly thrown open and scattered to the wind.  I could either try desperately to gather them all back together, which was proving impossible, or else let myself go and have fun in the playground of my mind.  I chose to do the latter.

I have no idea how long I actually sat in the room.  I barely spoke unless spoken too, and that was usually only in non-committal grunts or brief nods of my head.  When some time had passed, everybody in the room was smoked up and a decision was made that we should all go hiking.  I wasn't sure I was ready for it, but I thought what the hell.

Now, I should preface this next part by saying that right or wrong, I used to drive stoned.  A lot.  As in every day.  I still do it occasionally nowadays, but usually prefer to hold out on smoking until later at night when I know I won't be going out.  On this particular day however, I happened to be one of the only people with a car and was, subsequently, volunteered to drive everybody to the park where we would be hiking.  As I said before, I would usually jump behind the wheel stoned without a second thought.  But even as fucked up as I was on this weed, I still had the presence of mind to hand the keys over to the one person who hadn't smoked up and say, 'You drive.'

Everyone was rather startled at that and this was the first time I told them just how high I really was.  Which then prompted my smirking friends to inform me that the shit I had just smoked was not regular schwag or even their regular KB connection.  It was a little bit of homegrown goodness which they called India Kush.  They told me that they usually only get their hands on it every couple of months or so and that they hadn't told me so that I would be surprised.  Hell, surprised is an understatement.  I was completely messed up!

We piled into my car and I volunteered to sit in the back seat.  As we started driving, I was finding it more and more difficult to concentrate on anything and was starting to feel a little bit dizzy and nauseous.  To try and calm myself, I closed my eyes and tried to focus on consuming the racing thought in my head rather then the racing scenery shooting by the car.  That's when one of my friends turned on the radio.  Peter Gabriel was playing.  It was 'In Your Eyes,' what some may consider a cheesy love ballad to be sure.  But with my eyes closed shut and the radio blaring in my ears, it was the most beautiful thing I had ever heard.

At this point, I was actually experiencing auditory hallucinations.  Peter Gabriel's voice seemed very commanding, very powerful.   The actual music would fade and warble in and out of focus, but his voice and the lyrics were locked in the forefront of my brain.  I felt like I was experiencing the music, feeling each note in my soul.  I wanted to laugh, wanted to cry, to scream and shout.  All I could do was sit with my eyes closed and listen.  About halfway through the song, I felt like I suddenly had a revelation.  It was as if God or some higher being had chosen to impart upon me a truth, and that truth was that 'In Your Eyes' is not a cheesy love song as it is often portrayed.  It is a song about god.  It is a song about religion.  Peter Gabriel wasn't singing to a woman, he was singing to GOD!

This notion came to me in a very profound way.  It was not a hunch, or a theory.  I somehow knew that it was a truth.  And no matter how trivial that truth seems now, at the time it was earth shattering.  I felt as if I had somehow cracked open the fabric of the universe to steal this vision.  It filled me with an overwhelming joy that lasted long after the song was over.  I don't even remember what else played on the radio the rest of the way to the park.  Hell, I don't even really remember much about the rest of the car trip or the hike itself, but I clearly remember that Peter Gabriel song and the way it made me feel.  Absolutely incredible.

I smoked the India Kush a few more times after that.  Each time it gave me a killer buzz that beats any other KB I've ever tried, though never again quite like that first time.  I haven't had an opportunity to try it again in many months now though, and am eagerly awaiting the next time my friends get their hands on a little of the Kush.

Maybe next time I'll try spinning a Phil Collins record and see what God has to say!

Today I had the most powerful weed experience I have had in my life.

I have always liked the bushland park down the road from me, and I have a few juvenile plants growing in there as well.

First thing in the morning I woke up early to watch tv, because I had a big smoke last night and I was feeling dazed. So, after mum and dad left I grabbed my gear, which was:  pipe, weed, lighter, discman, seeds, and I brought some osmocote as well for the plants. I turned on my discman and walked down to the park.

When I got to the grow site, I quickly looked around for people and climbed up the rock where my plants are growing. I planted the seeds and sat down on a log where I then had around 4-5 hits  of this really strong weed and I waited. I felt nothing much for about 20 minutes and I was wondering if it was doing anything, so I had 2 more cones. After the second to last puff I coughed violently and my head spun. I then finished the last puff and put my stuff away.

After about half an hour of nausea, I laid in the thick grass and dozed off for what felt like hours. I remember seeing weird patterns and a vision that reminded me that I was falling down a tunnel. I came to it 10 minutes later and I was lying 5m away from where I first laid down. I noticed that I had tunnel vision and everything I saw was outlined in black and the sun seemed so bright that I found it uncomfortable to sit in its light, so I moved into the shade.

I was concentrating on some magpies that were collecting sticks for their nests. I remember hearing them repeat their calls and I was getting the impression that something sounded odd. Before I knew it, the sound dissipated into the sound of the river flowing and I then realized that the magpies weren't even there, that I was imagining it.

I just sat there eyes half closed and taking in the sounds of the bush. At 10 o'clock I decided to leave, but when I stood up I collapsed back down, so I tried again and jumped onto the foot path, which was a 3m drop underneath the overhang. On my way home I heard all of these cries for help and I kept getting the feeling that something was stalking me. I started running as if I was running for my life, which spooked me a lot and I raced up the hill where I could reach the entrance. I made it out and went home to find that mum was already at home, so I bypassed home and went to the soccer field where I had a few more puffs and then closed my eyes so I could concentrate on the patterns that I was seeing. From that I remember reflecting on what I had heard and saw, so I slipped out of the sleep after a while because I felt that someone was gonna steal my headphones and discman and I realized that I never had gone to the soccerfield - I had fallen asleep in the bush and I was only dreaming it. The dream was the most lifelike and realistic I have had. 

Conclusion:  This was the strangest experience I have had with weed and I will ask my dealer what sort it was and if it was laced, which I think it was.

I can still feel the effects after 5 hours of sleeping in the loungeroom. I decided to write this while I had it fresh in my mind, but I am forgetting quickly. I am about to finish the rest of it now.

I have never tried acid or any other mind altering drugs apart from pot, alcohol, and 12 cold and flu tablets (not recommended), so this phenomenal experience was definitely not a flashback of an acid trip.

Several weeks ago on a Thursday afternoon before sport at school, my good friend and I decided that we should alter our state of mind ever so slightly through a complex ritual we like to call ?getting shitfaced.? I was not particularly in the mood to get stoned, as I tend to become very uneasy when I am the only one stoned in a large group, and my friend and I both do different sports, so I decided to only have one lungfull of mildly potent grass, spun with some crushed rose petals (they do nothing to change the experience in any way, my friend is just a bit strange).

We then proceeded to the yard where everyone was already lined up to go to sport.

By this time the effects were minimal, only a slight light-headed feeling, and that?s all that I was expecting, not in the slightest way able to foresee the incomprehensible psychological events which were about to take place.

Waiting outside the bus I was completely capable of participating in a ?normal? conversation with a friend who was not on any drugs. I didn?t even have any fragmented thoughts; apart from the occasional illogical thought, I was totally straight. I was later told that if I had not told them that I just smoked some pot, they would not have known.

                 (now this is the good bit)
I suddenly felt the urge to kneel down. It wasn?t an overpowering compulsion to get closer to the ground, rather a feeling of, ? i'll be a bit more comfortable if I kneel.?  So I did.

The way down seemed to be the turning point for the experience. The time dilation I experienced was incredible. What seemed to me an hour was only the time it took to get from a standing position to a kneel.
I studied the warm sun?s rays, which splashed onto the semi-dried grass where I knelt. It seemed to remind me of a time in my childhood that I had long forgotten, when my parents would take me to the river where we used to live. And for an instant I was once again there, filled with the same uninhibited innocent bliss that only childhood (and apparently now drugs) could evoke.

This total bliss, although indescribably pleasant, came as a shock. I had experienced an emotion similar to this before, yet on a much higher dose. I stood up, and just as mysteriously and unexpectedly as the emotion came it dissipated, leaving me pondering what had just taken place.

I made my way onto the bus and sat by the window.

I was joined by a friend, who upon sitting down next to me sparked up a meaningless conversation, in which I involved myself for awhile. However, in my current state of mind I knew I would benefit more if I just turned and looked out the window, so I told him in a very polite way that I am incredibly sorry but I must turn and look out the window now. (He thought I was joking, but after seeing that I did not turn back to him he found another victim to bore with pointless chatter.)

As I was trying to figure out what had caused my bliss just a few minutes ago, I started to take greater notice of the lush green trees outside. Then just as suddenly a wondrous feeling came over me. This was many times more profound than before and it lasted for most of the 15-minute bus ride. During this time I lost my entire internal monologue, apart from the occasional ?wow? and ?what?s going on.? My mind was empty of verbal thought, instead filled with raw emotion, a type of bliss or ?nirvana,? if you will, so profusely mind-blowing that it brought tears to my eyes.

An endless psychological orgasm is perhaps the closest verbal description I can put to it.

Every stimulus from the outside world conveyed a type of wonder and pure undivided happiness that I have never seen the likes of before.

This utopia stopped when we reached the pools, but then an hour later on the bus home I experienced the same phenomenon as before, on the same amazingly vivid scale.

And to this day I occasionally have a glimpse into this state without any drugs and find that the world seems to have much more wonder and beauty than it once had.

I have only been smoking for about 6 months, it hasn't been that long but I decided to put it aside.  I already told one of my friends that I had tried it, and she stoped talking to me b/c she thought I smoked. I think all smokers have gone trough that.  I decided to try it one more time then stop for good.  

It was my birthday and these 3 girls said they were gonna smoke me out.  They got the stuff and we went in an empty parking lot and smoked up. They claimed it was kb, but it was a different experience.  I took two good hits and was gone...  I felt like I wasn't there, it felt like I had never existed.  

Before I smoked I was at the mall and got in an argument with this guy and I drove off.  We decided to go back to the mall and get something to eat.  When the girls were eating something the guy came up to me and wanted to fight me.  All I did was shake his hand and say something i have never said before.  I said: 'Listen man, I'm sorry I didn't mean to mess with you.  Let's all just be friends'  Right when he heard me say that he smiled and said it's cool.  

I had never felt better in my life.  I apologized to everyone that night for all the bad things I had done in the past to them. The next day I became depressed but I understood that the world was'nt created so that we can fight and waste our time, but it was created to make peace and love.  I use to be a bitch before this experience, but now I'm a new man.....

I remember that night very vividly. It was the end of April and everyone was beginning to anticipate the end of the school year. I was but 16 years young and a sophomore in high school. Unfortunately, at the time I lived in the southeastern US, where there was nothing to do but drugs. The problem was that I never got into the drug scene, until one night. Drugs never really interested me, but they sure interested my girlfriend at the time. I knew that when I got into the whole relationship and I swore to myself that she was the only one who could ever get me to try anything. At last, one night the inevitable happened.

We went on a double date with her best friend and some guy her friend had picked up the previous night. They told me that we were going to a movie after we got some takeouts. Then, she ambushed me with a wild look in her eye and said, 'I want to get you high.' All my life I had been conservative to the point of people sometimes referring to me as The Republican. Now, I had the chance to have a little fun. I bit the hook, but only on a few conditions. One was that I had to be in a sheltered environment such as a house or apartment. I wasn't going to try something which I had no idea how it would affect me in the middle of a park or in an alley somewhere. The second condition was that someone needed to be sober enough to watch me and make sure I didn't kill myself. (I know all you experienced pot users are probably laughing at me, but it was my first time, okay?!) My girlfriend and her friend knew exactly where both those demands could be met. They really must have wanted to see me high. So we drove for an hour and a half to get to her friend's beach house in the next state. During the ride over there, I was nervous but in a strange way I was excited. 

We arrived around 8:00PM that night and proceeded to consume the Chinese take-out we had acquired earlier that evening. My girlfriend told me to sit down on the couch in the kitchen and wait. Her friend sat next to me with the guy she was with, whom I'll call T. My girlfriend then entered with the stuff and handed it to her friend. She lit it up, inhaled and held it in. She then passed it to me and I looked at it puzzled. As I put it to my mouth the phrase 'all in the name of science' passed through my brain. It was probably just as an excuse to my conscience. I inhaled and held it in just as I was instructed to do. T. then passed it onto my girlfriend. I finally exhaled when it got back to me. We proceeded in this fashion until it became a roach and then nothing. 

I became disappointed when at first I didn't feel anything. Then, I suddenly became very at home with myself and my surroundings. My mood lifted and all I wanted to do was sit and smile at my girlfriend. Still, I was curious about doing other things. I decided to stand up and test out my new legs. I was feeling very tingly. Then, my vision wrapped around me in a sort of panorama. 'Wow,' I said, thinking I really wasn't speaking, 'panorama vision!' 

'You're high!' exclaimed the friend. She continued, 'Normal people never get high their first time. I love you.' I realized I had become my relaxed, laid back, joking normal self. The person I hadn't been in a long time due to family stress and my stupid job.

'I love you too,' I said to the friend with my trademark goofy grin. This was great. I felt wonderful all over. Panorama vision dissolved into the wallpaper climbing up the wall. Very funny things would happen, to the amusement of my friends. For example, I decided to get rid of all the stuff I had in my pockets. So instead of just logically laying them down somewhere, I had to walk into the den and place them on the TV. The thing was, I'd stumble in there, put one item down and stumble back into the kitchen. Realizing my mistake, I'd repeat the process, several times I might add.

In the kitchen, everyone sat down on the couch save for my girlfriend. Se was sitting on a stool in front of us where she began a sort of stand-up routine. She said things that messed with the friend and I in our altered state. My mind was wandering this way and that, and I loved it. My girlfriend would grab random things such as a coke can and say the most illogical and random things about it. The funny thing was, the can seemed to change as her description of it changed. The pot, I believe, augmented my already overactive imagination. I say this because I could have sworn as I moved my hand in an orchistrating gesture, I would hear music, but only when I was conducting. Since I'm a classical music lover, I eat every bit of this up. From what I remembered, I conjured up Borodin's 2nd Symphony in B-minor.

We all then piled into the den and T. began watching TV. Everyone seemed satisfied to sit there while high. Not me, though. I wanted to go outside and experience everything I could in my altered state. I convinced them that we needed to go out on the dock and look at the stars. While walking out there, it was as if my alignment was off. I kept veering towards the left, again to the amusement of my friends. The friend and I stayed on the top part while my girlfriend and T. went to the floating part to sit. The friend & I had deep conversations about whatever the winds of the universe blew in our direction.

Afterwards we went back inside where some sexual stuff happened with my girfriend and me (which I will skip describing). And the night lurked on. One more thing, really. I had no problem with munchies or paranoia, until on the way back, we saw a lot of blue flashing lights. It turned out there had been an accident, but I was convinced that I was going to jail. I expressed this concern verbally, once again to the amusement of my friends. We came home and they dropped me off at my house. Inside, still buzzing, I proceeded to have a 40 minute conversation with my dad, who I almost never talk to. 

That's the story of my first time. A great experience, it was. Actually, as it turned out, I broke up with that girlfriend a few months later. I never saw T. again. But the friend I referred to is now my wife. So, how do we tell the story of how we met to the kids, eh?

I was a freshman in high school who got high every so often - not a pothead. a friend called and said come over so i did. i got there and he pulled out a sorta pipe that we hit off for a few minutes, maybe 15.  he gave me 3-4 shotguns, then we went to the table, got out the bong and hit off it, very large hits. i think we were sitting there trying to do a puzzle, which was extremely difficult and confusing. i couldn't get any, but my other friend, not the one smoking but who had already had a lot, was doing it pretty good. i decided to leave and go home when i started to get bored and uncomfortable. i started walking home. i put my hat and jacket on but really didn't like what i was wearing. i thought i looked extremely ignorant and couldn't get comfortable. my pants were bugging me and i couldn't get my hands in a normal position. i would get them one place and then decide it wasn't normal. then i realized that i didn't know what was normal and i just flat out couldn't get comfortable. i didnt know how fast to walk. i was trying to act straight, but just couldn't feel like i was. i then couldn't figure out the purpose for me on earth, not all this time. i was thinking about my self-importance and the universe and people in general. i lost who i was. i mean, i knew who i was, where i was at, but i couldn't put my finger on who i really was inside. i felt like my thoughts were right in front of me and that they were out of my head. then i started getting worried about if the weed or something was laced with lsd or a hallucinogen, because i had been high before and this was not normal. i was so uncomfortable when i got home i couldn't figure out if anything i did was normal. i changed clothes over and over, laid down, sat up, tried to watch a movie, but everything was annoying. then my girlfriend called, which suddenly made everything better and nomal. i thought i was completely sober when she came over. i snuggled up with her in her bosom and felt like a million bucks. but that event still lingers in my mind, pondering what went on and why.

I am a regular user of cannabis, and have been smoking on almost an everyday basis for only a year.  Getting high and cutting up or embarking in deep thought had become rather routine, almost boring, until one night a couple of weeks ago.

I was in my room by myself trying to get to sleep.  I had some things on my mind that seemed to bother me, although I couldn't figure out what they were.  After a couple of hours of restlessness I decided 'I need to smoke.'  So I set up my homemade gravity bong using a two liter bottle.  I am usually pretty high after 2 or 3 gravity swats, but by the time I had reached my fourth hit, I wasn't as high as I should have been (I was not on any other medication).  So I started packing bowl after bowl until I realized it had almost become involuntary, and that's when I noticed I was blitzed!

I cleaned up and laid flat on my bed with my eyes closed, trying to ease my mind and get some rest for the day ahead. Before I knew it I was in a dream-like state, but I was conscious.  It was like my body was asleep but my mind was awake.  I found myself in a vast void, with visible ideas circling around me.  Then I heard a voice that seemed to echo over everything (I assigned him the name Buddha, although not until after the experience).  It seemed like somebody was talking to me, and while I remember carrying on a conversation with the voice, I cannot put into words what was said.  The voice then became dormant, and other smaller voices began to whisper all around simultaneously.  I questioned where I was and what was going on and almost instantly the echoing voice returned and told me that if I lost concentration, I would be forced to leave and never return.  I then questioned all of the whispers and was told that they were spirits who reached inner peace and this was where they resided (NO FUCKIN LIE!!!).  Then everything began to get distant until it faded away.  This is when I returned to the real world and looked at the clock to see that about 3 hours had passed and my high was gone (of course).

I still question whether this experience really happened or not, but it seemed as real as the weed I smoked.  Since then I have actually noticed things about people and the ways of life that I had never noticed before.  Almost as if my eyes have been opened.  I have tried numerous times using the same technique, and even more potent herb at higher amounts, as I had that night and have not begun to re-visit the place.  Whether it was a dream or not, it was definitely total bliss.  I'm sure that I am not the only one to have such an experience from just marijuana, and have started looking for others who have, yet I am still unsuccesful.

Duration: Six hours

First off, I must note that my tolerance to cannabis is very low; usually 4 or 5 hits will be enough to keep me in a state of bliss for 4 to 7 hours. I regard it as a very powerful and religious experience, and thus treat herb with respect.

This happened when I lived in Arizona not too long ago. I was walking around the mesa behind my house at about an hour before sundown, enjoying the view of the Earth and open sky. Before I headed home, I decided to smoke a joint I had with me.

Sitting cross-legged in a sandy wash, I smoked most of the joint before deciding to head home. After the intense sensory 'strobing' started, I noticed the small, fine details around me, all the tiny wonders that we usually overlook. The feel of the fine sand, the crisp purity of the desert air, the simple pleasure of watching a lizard dart among the rocks. I had just read the Tao Te Ch'ing, and reflected on the wisdom of the sages in urging us to be more appreciative of the little joys in life.

As I walked back down the dirt road that went near my house, the sun setting behind the mesa created a gorgeous mix of red, purple and orange, whose richness I found to be very peaceful. I reflected on the myriad beauty of nature. The small desert plants all around seemed more alive than I had noticed before, and I could hear dogs barking in the distance. I stretched and moved my body in various directions, marveling at the complexity of the human body. To think that mere electrical impulses from the brain could dictate the actions of this vessel! I began to think of the soul, how we fit in with the 'cosmic scheme of things.' I contemplated God, who could surely not be a physical entity. If so, s/he/it would be bound by some laws and forces. I thought of what we know as God to be some universal concentration of incomprehensible energy, directing all things from the scurrying of an ant to the slow, majestic wheeling of galaxies. My body was crude and puny in comparison, relying on material sustenance and physical manifestation. The thought kept recurring through my head 'We Are Machines Compared To God,' as if our idea of 'Organic' pales in comparison to the raw life-essence that is God.

The moon was already high and the vivid blue of a Northern Arizona sky framed it perfectly. I stopped and looked around, my eyes tracing the red soil out to the horizon. Standing there, the Earth seemed suddenly vast and wondrous. I could feel through my boots how solid and eternal was the skin of our Mother, how truly great She was. Far off, the Tsaile mountains loomed, the air was still and clear, the Moon was silver and awesome. I began to view the world as some hunter of the steppes must have viewed it in the Pleistocene, as it must have appeared to humans before electricity, before cars, guns, 'civilisation.' All the long centuries of Human existence are but a tiny blip in the life of the Earth and the Sky, which shelter us and whose songs we have forgotten in our modern dedication to money, convenience and noise.

The old Australian legends of the Dreamtime gained a newfound sacredness; I could see reflected in the Moon how our ancestors danced beneath her bright face ten thousand years ago in the stillness of the wilderness. All the cycles of life on Earth were perfectly meshed, like threads in a tapestry: even our species' recent trend toward destruction and rape would soon come to an end and we would once more come to love God, the Earth and Each Other.

I felt very peaceful, serene even; I suspect that if a pair of coyotes had come upon me and decided to rip me to shreds, I would have offered my nourishing body to them, for truly, what is death but a change in worlds, in planes of awareness? The Earth, Sky, Moon were immortal--and so was I. It was a simple, joyous, eternally patient feeling.

This was one of my most enlightening voyages into the mind; the sense of Oneness with nature cannot be lost by Us but only forgotten. That day I found it again.

I've been toking for about 10 years now, often frequently and heavily, often not at all, but recently, I've been finding it more and more difficult to find time to smoke. Why? Because it now takes me about 2 days to recover completly from a couple of hits.

The last time I smoked was this Friday night. I had one deep hit from a pipe, followed by a bowl through a gravity bong (I've been clean for the last three months) I had a pretty good time, though I didn't get all that stoned. (As well as making me more sleepy, it also seems to have lost a lot of it's effect, as if I've developed a permament tolerance.) Over the next two days, I slept about 30 hours. I wasn't sleep deprived, and didn't feel all that tired when I was awake - it was just took such effort to get out of bed... It felt pretty good, but my whole weekend was screwed.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is there something I can do? Now that smoking is seriously fucking with my sleeping patterns, I'm going to have to avoid my favourite activity :<

This was my first pot experience. I had tried smoking it for three consecutive nights, nothing happened. It all happened on the fourth night. I have been lately dealing with 'issues' - nothing too bad, but repressed events of my life, realizing just how I have compressed time and selectively forgotten events. I was well prepared if these issues surfaced. I can't say I fully remember every second clearly, but I sure can accurately give details about the majority of my trip. After smoking about 7 hoots in a 20 minute period, I still felt normal. I took one more hit. 

I can't remember when I put the pipe down, or how long it had been. I instantly forgot every aspect of myself and my past, although I was well aware of my surroundings and somewhat aware of my boyfriend, who sat next to me. For a moment it felt like I was living in the present, and neither the past nor future existed. He seemed deeply focused on me. It looked as if he was asking me if I was okay. I couldn't seem to understand exactly. I told him it had hit me and I needed to lay down. The kitchen cupboards to my left seemed to become somewhat alive and the feeling of them moving consumed me. Next, the couch began to sway and compress and expand, and I felt like I was sinking into it. My whole body (especially lower) felt so amazing, almost even painful. It was so tingly and shaky, it felt a lot like an out of body experience, although I was well aware of the presence of my physical body, but only because of the sensation of energy that surrounded it. 

The whole trip seemed to revolve in time frames. For every second or so (it felt) that I was somewhat aware of myself physically, emotionally, etc., I was instantly forced to snap into another time frame that seemed to last forever (from periods of 2 to 5 minutes that seemed like hours, until I reached periods that lasted years!). I couldn't remember the last time frame I experienced and there seemed to be a lot of gliches. I couldn't walk and I couldn't communicate. I had reached a point where I felt I was living within my mind and its understanding of time, which is drastically altered from repression. It was very scary at first, but once I started to understand when I was coming down just what had happended, I couldn't believe it, but I knew so well that I was not going to repress it, or anything, ever. I could not think as I was experiencing it or afterwards until I was coming down. 

The effects of the pot and a dream-like state lasted for a period of almost 24 hours. I can't even begin to explain the time lapses, but from every moment from the next, it felt as if I was placed in the moment, not knowing how or when I got there, or even being able to understand the concept of time, or even that of a 'future,' nevermind the familarity of 'myself.' I learned a lot and I am amazed with how my mind can alter time and memory to such an extent. Nevertheless, it was quite amazing.

   When vacationing with my family in West Virginia.  I waited till everyone was asleep and ventured from the cabin down the mountain to the lake.  I set myself on the steep beach of rocks and clay. And lit up.  About halfway through the makeshift joint, I became aware of nature's music.  Crickets and cicadas singing.  It was so beautiful.  Why did they sing? To attract mates and propigate their species.  Mother nature at her finest.  

It was time for me to embark on a quest.  Looking up at the full moon and stars, I realized for these few hours I would be one with nature, looking
through the eyes of our ancestors viewing the calm, peaceful lake knowing in 8 or 9 hours I would strap on planks to my feet and ride above the waterline, courtesy of the combustion engine of my family's motorboat.  I went on a quest.  I walked down the steep beach of the lake towards the moonlight.  I saw things and heard things I cannot explain.  

I was no longer a part of the physical world. I moved on to the spiritual plane, where time and consequence held no meaning.  I was visted by euphoria. It was then I decided to cultivate the seed.  Two years later
I started a closet garden.

This past summer was when I started puffing, and my best friend Dan who got me into it bought alot of beasters nugs for a while, and the first time I puffed with those, oh man. About 20 minutes after we smoked, he was playin a game on PS, and I was sittin there watching. And there was something about the music that just made me relax so much, and I just closed my eyes, and it was like I was falling. Even with the littlest thought and motion I could 'change the direction' I was falling. 

I lost track of all time, but I'm guessing this lasted for a good 2 hours. From then up until about 6 hours later, I was still high, but not at all like I was immediately after we puffed. In the time after the first 2 hours, everything felt like it was in rapid stop-go animation, and I couldn't tell if it was just me twiching like nutz or if it was just in my head. Either way, it was frickin great.

Me and a friend of mine (we'll call him Cornbread) were sitting around my house pondering the universal question: 'What the hell are we gonna do today?'  The answer was obvious, really: 'Smoke a phatty!!'  Well, we both had some weed at the time (his was about $80/quarter and mine about $50), so we decided to match up on a phat blunt.  

My room has a black light and a circular disco light that throws objects in the shape of mushrooms on the walls, and we were listening to an Eightball & MJG song low in the background.  When we smoked it down to a roach, we emptied the remains into a bowl and finished it off.  

About ten minutes later I was floating and the beat of the music had become one with my heartbeat, every time the bass bumped, my body twitched.  It was interesting almost to the point of disturbing me.  After that I started to fall into states of unconciousness where I would relive conversations I'd had recently.  When I emerged from that state the texture of my bed and ceiling became too much to ignore, so I fell into the ripples of the bed.  I know this sounds like an LSD trip, but this was purely pot (Cornbread reassured me his wasn't laced).  

I can't remember much after that except that my friend left and I fell into a stupor in which the music filled my head and seemed to come out of a pure white, hot light. All the separate instrumental aspects seemed to come from different sides of my head and it seemed to become louder and louder until that's all that I was concerned with.

The only bad aspect of this experience was that I fell into a deep sleep soon after, which I can usually avoid.  In the end, this turned out to be the most rewarding experience with marijuana I have ever had.

I was sitting on the floor of my friend Debra's room one evening, when a friend of hers came round to see her.  They hadnt seen each other for ages and just sat there chatting and catching up, and basically just ignored me.  Id never met Suzy before, and I started to listen to some of what was said.  As I did so, something began to happen.

While Suzy was talking to Debra about some traumatic experience shed just been through, I felt myself connecting with her in a way Id never experienced before.  I realised that I knew exactly what she was talking about.  It wasnt that I could read her mind, it felt more like I was her mind!  The words she was using to describe her experiences were also describing my experiences too.  Her observation of life and her attitude were somehow also me.  It took me a while to get used to this bizarre perception, but the moment I started feeling comfortable with it, it changed into something else.  I began communicating with her using only my mind; it happened completely spontaneously, but it was totally unlike any form of mental communication Id ever heard about.  As I asked her things, the words she was using to reply to Debras questions, which were of course totally different, would somehow answer my questions too!  It felt really weird, yet at the same time perfectly normal.

Suzy left a few hours later; Debra saw her to the door.  The moment she left the room, things started to change again.  I could feel it coming and it seemed to wait for Debra to return.

The moment Debra came back in, I entered into this incredible state of ecstasy.  It felt like something was descending into me, allowing me to experience the world from a perspective that was totally different, it was almost indescribable.  I felt as if something very old was either trying to come in from the outside, or was pushing out of me from the inside.  Whatever it was, I felt like I was becoming something else, something far more real than I could possibly imagine.  The feeling of knowing that this was what was happening was so wonderful that tears just poured down my cheeks.

I went through a number of physical reactions:  My mouth tightened into a closed O shape, and my hands came up to just below my chin, tingling as if with pins and needles.  The area around my solar plexus felt like it was pulsating with energy.  The experience lasted about ten or fifteen minutes.  Debra just sat on the bed watching this the whole time.  She told me afterwards that my face actually changed and I took on an 'old man' appearance.

One night when I was home alone I decided to smoke. I usually smoke with friends so this was a little different. The weed wasn't laced or anything and the only other drug that I have used is alcohol (twice). As I was smoking I had this odd sensation that I could feel the THC running from my lungs and into my bloodstream and then into my brain. I was caught up in this thought of the THC flowing through my body. When it reached my brain was when I really got fucked.

I sat in my room waiting for my friends to come over with some Wendy's and I was listening to music. As I was listening to the music I began to drift off in a semi concious dream. My mind began to become very clairvoyant to the meaning of the music that I was listening to. I started to think of dreams that i had once when I was a little kid. As quickly as they came to me they would leave and I couldnt remember them. I soon became aware of the music that I was listening to and it took shape in my mind. The music was rather techno so I began to think about all the electrical instruments that were required to make it. In my mind I started flowing through these wires to the tune of the music. 

I became aware of how odd this was and then all of the sudden i woke up as if from a dream. I was lying on the floor and i tried to get up but I couldn't move. I felt as if I had a big down comforter on me and I was too comfortable and weighed down to move. I started to lose these feelings in about twenty minutes when my friends came by. While I was talking to them i began to realize how little I knew about them. I would look at them and realize that everyone that knows this person has a different opinion abotu them and they're the only ones that truly know themselves. I began to wonder what other people thought of me and the type of person they thought that i was, I came to the conclusion that no one knows me the way I perceive myself but me. After these odd experiences it was just the regular laugh and have a good time high.

I'd always heard that eating Cannabis produced an entirely different effect than smoking it, so I went about experimenting on my own.  I cooked about 7 small/medium buds in 7 Tbsps of butter, by microwaving it to hot, but not boiling, then letting it cool for 15 minutes, then repeating the process for about 2 hours.  When I was done, it was a crystallized, almost icy mix, still kind of wet.  I ate the entire thing on toast with jelly.  The taste is a little strong by itself, so the jelly was a must.  I didn't strain anything out, just ate everything.

About 30 minutes later, I was well on the way to a trip that I can only compare to about 50%-75% of an acid trip.  It kept getting more and more severe, complete with tracers, an inability to speak, an inability to stand up or even concentrate on anything.  Wasn't a very cognitive high, more of just an experience kind of high.  VERY unsimilar to smoking it.  After the experience, I don't think I'll ever smoke it again, I'll only eat it.  I was never a huge fan of the smoking side-effects anyway.

I'm not sure where to start so I'll just go in chronological order. That day I had just finished a math exam that I wasn't too pleased with when a friend of mine met me at my locker. 'Hey man, I got some chronic weed! You wanna buy?' he asked. I guess it was a combination of fustration over my poor math performance and looking for a way to cut loose after exams, but I purchased some of this fine ganja.

Previously I had smoked some mild weed without much effect and said to my friend, 'I hope this is worth it'. 'Believe me man! Don't smoke this alone!' he warned. So, I headed home and rolled a fat joint (about a gram), which took some time because I don't toke very often. So then I headed out to the garage. On the way (I don't know what compelled me) I asked my sister if she wanted to join me. To my surprise, she did. Little did we know what the next two hours had in store for us!

I sparked it up and got it burning. We took turns until about half the joint was done. Then I noticed that I no longer felt cold (it was January). I asked my sister how she felt, she said she didn't feel anything yet. The joint fizzled out and I went to relight it, which was a bit difficult. I passed it to my sister and adjusted my coat, which felt weird. Then it happened! As I shifted the coat, I got a weird tingling sensation like when your leg falls asleep. I became aware that I had entered a different reality. I knew that everything was the same, but my perception had changed.

I decided we should go inside. The trip to the door was both funny and frightening. We stumbeled inside, my thoughts were all over the place. Then I got paranoid and ran to the washroom and flushed the roach down the toilet. Was this laced? I asked myself, this was too strong.

Everything moved in flash frames, no longer continuous. I was a bit disoriented and so was my sister. We bumped into each other several times. We made our way to the kitchen and drank some water, our mouths were bone dry. I could feel paranoia setting in, but I was determined not to have a bad trip so I put my demented thoughts in the back of my mind. We decided to watch TV. I couldn't keep still, the numbing of my body drove me nuts. My thoughts went everywhere except the movie we were trying to watch. One moment seemed unconnected to the next. What was going on?

I wandered around the house a bit while my sister sat stupified in front of the TV. I tried to rest but my heart was pounding and the shirt I was wearing made my skin tingle whenever I shifted position. My sister started to talk on the phone. Apparently our communtication skills were fine because no one noticed we were different in any way. We both got a bit depressed and nauseated but it passed eventually. I continued to wander around the house in a dream-like state lost in my thoughts.

By dinner we were fairly normal. Two hours, what a trip it was! Time started moving at a normal pace, instead of slo-mo like before. I think it must have been a strong Indica because it didn't make us giddy but almost comatose!

Despite the fact that the numbness persisted for almost two days and the experience of slight paranoia, we were both fine. We both agreed it was a worthwhile experience and it has been the topic of much discussion between us. The shared experience brought us closer together. We might do it again sometime, but we both agreed frequent use isn't a good idea.

It was a mind opening experience that I recommend, but as with any choice it should be an educated one. (I had researched a bit before the first time I smoked marijuana just to be sure.) I hope my experience might educate others on the potential effects of marijuana. Open your mind to new things and thoughts and as long as you think it through, you'll most likely come out better for it. We did.

Peace love and unity to all!

The mindset was serious ecstasy depression since 3 months back with serious thoughts on taking my life or/and some of my friend's lives. Added to that in synergy was an LSD psychosis/neurosis from a bad trip 3 weeks prior to the ecstasy (they were mitsubishi turbo, I hate mitsu, they are a waste of money and 'E time,' mitsu do NOT seem like mdma).

I have smoked hash since I was 15, multiple-a-day-user since I was 16 until I was 18 (I´m 19). Apart from just having fun, I have always considered my drug intake as a search for something that would heal me up. I want to tell you about the time when I got a breakthrough.

The setting was a park, alone. I lit up and got high, walking away towards the city, still feeling fine (the last 6 months I always got psychotic on hash, feeling really bad), then all those thoughts came flying, I started working on them in a sort-of-metaprogramming way, but I was so fucked up, slipping into a psychotic reality, a bit disoriented, with nasty, threatening auditory hallucinations (I don't know if they really were hallucinations, but I think so. Wherever I went people were shouting at me, like, 'There he is again!', they were completely real for me at the time. This is what´s characteristic for a psychotic state, not being able to differentiate between a hallucination as 'not really there, I´m the only one seeing it' and a hallucination that you think of as reality). Well, long story short, I managed to get home, having to take three, four different transits to get there instead of taking the bus which takes me direct to my house (doh!). When I got home I managed to unlock the door after staring at the lock for 15 minutes trying to figure out what to do with it (minor LSD flashback, it would have been fun if it was fun, you know what I mean).

When I get inside I position myself spontaneously into a medative position, knees to chest, hands on head, elbows on knees, thinking how to solve all my problems. Sitting there I notic this sensation on my head. I feel it as some sort of entity, god or something. He makes clear to me that he wants to take my head over to, heal it. I think, what the fuck have I to loose?', so I take my hands away from my head, indicating that I accept. The  sensation gets stronger and I can feel the entity investigating different parts of my brain subconsciously, then it talks to the concious part of me. He asks me what powers I want, to be able to deal with the problem. I tell him I don't know; he tells me that I do know. I search for the answer; CONFIDENCE, I tell him. OK, he says.

Suddenly I can feel this red light (red light is the color of raw energy in the human aura, I later discovered, maybe a connection) all around my head, filling up the room, and he gives me the power of confidence. He gives it to me by beaming energy right into my subconcious and I'm filled with confidence. When he leaves me, he tells me it will be OK. He also shows me some valuable insights, clearing up the situation.

I put on a record, feeling real up, the solution is so clear, and so simple, so simple. I start to cry out of joy and tension. I found peace, at last.

This is the most powerful emotional experience of my life. It's really personal, I haven't told it to any of my close friends. It felt as if I was touched by god, but I'm leaning towards that it was not god (I'm an atheist), but that, through the cannabis, I got a powerful channel to my subconcious, communicating with it and trying together to solve the problem between us. But, I´m not sure.

I have now taken a more respectful attitude towards cannabis, smoking it for more meditative purposes.

This is about the first time I was REALLY stoned. The first few times I smoked, I didn't feel much but maybe a little giddy. Since this experience, I have gotten stoned many times, but never quite like this.

I was at a friend's house, and we were just talking and having a good time. I suggested we get some weed, so I sprung for a dimebag. The room was lit only with a blacklight and the glow of the TV. I smoked a lot, I would guess about seven hits. I got up off the couch and I felt like I was swimming. I could barely walk. After that, things get hazy, but I left the apartment and went down to mine.

I laid down on my bed and put on my headphones and 'Tomorrow Never Knows' by the Beatles. I was instantly tranported into another world. It vaguely felt like India, but like a desert with strange people with weird clothes walking around in the sand. I closed my eyes and let the music talk to me. I could see the face of John Lennon, and he seemed to be telling me what to do. I heard (or felt) a voice say, 'Music is the language of the universe'. I was thrown into deep, reflecting thought. The line of the song, 'Listen to the color of your dreams' had a similer effect.

The song was sort of fast, so everything in my 'mind-movie' was, like, sped up. Things moved very fast. I  got the feeling that I had entered a new world. I could 'see' the music, and be inside the mind of the artists. I felt like I was taking a leap of faith off a cliff, yet overwhelming peace. Overall, it was a 'it's OK' feeling, like no matter what happens, It's gonna turn out fine.

It felt as if a veil was lifted off my mind, and I could see the universe as a whole, and see beauty in everything. I knew that the universe is one, bound together by music and love. I knew that I would always see the world from a slightly different perspective, perhaps a higher one. Since then I have seen order in chaos, and chaos in order. As a musician, I have changed dramatically. Overall, I feel a hightened awareness, and a greater connection with the universe, the earth, and mankind.

This incredible occurence of mine occurred around the middle of the first year I began smoking weed.  I was still relatively new to the experience and had only gotten legitimately blazed one time before.  I decided to drop by my friend's house to get just a little high.  Of course, I brought along a little of my own weed, it's just courtesy, but I also knew he had his own little stash, I just didn't know he was growing in his closet!  Well, we rolled most of mine into blunts, and spent 1/2 an hour on them.  As I mentioned, I was relativly new to the experience and everything was new to me.  He put on some Bob Marley and dimmed the lights, I leaned my head back on the couch and closed my eyes, It felt almost as if I was on a roller coaster, but it was moving along with the speed of the song.  My feet felt as if they didn't touch the ground and I sat there for what seemed like hours.

My friend woke me from my dream-like state and said something along the lines of, 'You gonna hit it man?' I opened my eyes and he presented me with a blue tinted glass bong and a well packed bowl.  It seems I was only sitting there for several minutes while he packed a bowl into this instrument that was thoroughly foreign to me.  Well, I said he could hit it again, to give me a second because I didn't even know how to use it.  I stared as he hit the bong and the smoke traveled up the odd contraption.  I thought I had it down, and so I decided to brave a hit.  I hit it and kept waiting for my throat to burn as a sigal to slow down, but even as I cleared the carb it was a beautiful flow that felt almost as clean as Oxygen as it passed into my throat.  'Hey guy, slow down on that,' I heard from somewhere around me, I passed it to my friend, I couldn't understand what he said after that.  I listened to the beat of the music and leaned back again.  I returned almost instantly to the roller coaster-type-world and that levitation feeling returned in my feet and eventually captivated my entire body.  'Holy Christ,' I muttered aloud, unaware I was talking, the sound of my own voice was amazing to me and I began mumbling.  I forgot that my friend was even in the room with me.

'Guy, take another hit on this, then I'll pack again,' He said.  I took hold of the bong and exhaled all of the air in my lungs, then I flicked the lighter and intook all the smoke I could.  I coughed suddenly, and my throat began to burn, one after another the coughs exploded from inside the inner-most core of my body.  I began to lose track of everything around me and my world span.  The roller-coaster world was now surrounding me, and I could feel evey move of it in conjunction with the real world.  It stopped suddenly, and I realized it had only lasted a few seconds, I felt amazing, like I could do anything.  He said I could clear it, so with pleasure I did just that.  I got the cool air feeling again, and wondered what went wrong last time.  To this day I still do not know.

I passed the bong and gazed at the curling smoke,  I looked beyond it, to a world where everything was made of the smoke and I was part of it, I was floating with it, and then he passed it to me again.  This went on for what seemed like all night but in reality was only about an hour and a half.   When he was fresh out of bud, I do not know, I just know that eventually the bong stopped coming to me and I fell into this amazing trance where it seemed as though the music was a part of me and it was swirling around me and I could have never felt better in my whole life.  From there the effects gradually decreased, my rollercoaster stopped and I eventually returned to my normal state of consciousness.  To this day I doubt I've ever reached a high so full as that, and I can hardly wait till the day it is upon me again.

My best friend, his brother, two of his friends and I were sitting in his garage passing around several joints. After finishing the joints we decided to go back into the house where it was warm and comfortable. After about 10 minutes, I began to feel disapointed; I was  not the least bit high.
I walked upstairs into a dark room and turned on a lava lamp. The second my eyes hit the lamp I felt this huge surge of energy shoot through my body. It was very unexpected but felt great none the less. My overwhelmed body collapsed to the floor. My legs and arms began to move every-which way as I lay on my back gigling. I had no control...NONE. Then, as sudenly as they began, my muscle spasms stoped. I was curious as to how much time had past since I walked into the room. I stared at my indeglo watch. Instead of the usual #'s, I saw strange lines moving up and down the face of my watch. For some strange reason this didn't surprise me at all. 

Then my friend walked into the room and suggested that we turn on the strobe light. Having tripped out on that thing before, I agreed. He turned it on, slow at first. I picked up a small baseball and threw it up in the air. It seemd to suspend in the air for several seconds before comming back down into my hands.I got such a kick out of it, that I kept on just throwing the ball up and down for about 10 minutes. My friend then turned the strobe light to fastmode. I put it up to my face and looked directly into it (never do that...very bad for eyes). I saw the rear view of a space ship as it made its way through space. Then my friends bro walked in and sprayed cold water in my face with a water pistol. this caused me to immediately lose my high.

This was a very interesting trip from which I learned two things: 
1)A lava lamp and a small dark room make an excellent combo.
2)Sometimes a high kicks in relatively late, so be ready.

It was a cool night. I was at home hanging with my friend. I took out my cuchhi pipe (a pipe given to me when I was fourteen by my Obi high priest) loaded it up and fired away. I closed my eye only to see a old world. I was in the my past. i saw things that carved me into how i am now. I saw a man dancing to the beat of the ketta drums. His head was wrapt in a red, white, and blue cloth. As the drummer played to movements of the sprits, the man dancing moved with more passion, more vigor, more life. 'Who is this man,' I asked myself. it was then i realized this man was me.

As I opened my eyes, I saw how that spritual dancer carved me into who I am today. I was traveling on the vission of my life. Now i understand why i think and process things the way i do. the joureny was teaching me how to look on things in different perspectives.

With this brief look in the mirror of my life, my journey took me on a mental trip of what is to come. i saw what i will succeed in, and i saw what i would have a hard time accomplisihing. the vision also showed me how to overcome the obstacles in my life in order to accomplish every thing i want and need.

the pipe of visions took me on a trip of my past, present, and future. i saw my tradition put me where i am now, and where i intend to go.

Me and my buddies decided to go camping one weekend at a place called elora gorge. It was a killer campground with a huge gorge in it that was kinda of like a mini grand canyon with trees and stuff.

Anyhow my friend whose name also is john told me he had a Dutch strand of weed, not grown in Holland but seedlings that had been taken from there and grown hydroponically. Needless to say I was very excited to partake into exotic bud and in such a cool place. So we went off on a hike looking for a cool place to toke. We find a cave that led into another opening in the middle of the cliff face. It was here we decided it was the place we would smoke. we had rolled three joints as was our custom and smoked them in a row one after the other. In combination with the elements and the extremely high quality slaba, I achieved a, or rather fell into a completely barbaric stage of mind, our setting no longer seemed modern but i felt as if I was an ancient being partaking in an ancient tradition during ancient times. I looked at my friend and he just nodded at me I nodded at him and he nodded again and we just took off running through the forest on the path for about a half hour frantically making crazy noises. i had such an adreninaline rush and there was no other way to say it then I was fucked, finally we reached our campsite and realized just how messed we really were, we sat down and lit a fire and smoked bowls until the night faded away into nothing but a memory and a dream. That seemed to have been many years ago but really was a reality.

I recently tried smoking buddah.  What an experience it was.  The dosage was about 3 large bowls (by myself mind you).  I heard a lot about people smoking it and feeling great so I decided it was for me.  I lit up in the second floor of my garage where I have a small party room set up. I always heard that it worked fast, but for some reason I smoked all of it.  There was no reaction.  I was so disapointed because there was a school dance that night and I hoped to be stoned for it. So I thought what the hell I'll go have a couple of shots of vodka before I go that'll do the trick.  After about 30 minutes my mother called me in the house to eat.  I remember my mouth being extremely dry. While I was eating i went throught 5 glasses of soda.

About 15 minutes into dinner I felt this huge sense of relaxation and calm. Then when I lifted my fork to put some steak in my mouth.... BAM! I whipped the fork across the room and couldn't explain why.  At this point I was way out of my mind so I went to my room and downed about 10 or 11 shots of vodka.  My friend came to pick me up and couldn't believe how messed up I was.  He kept laughing at me and asking if I was ok.  I was like yeah whatever.  After about 1 and 1/2 hours after smoking up I felt another wave of the tinglies come over me.  Then when we were pulling into the school parking lot I was the happiest I had ever been.  I remember feeling so at peace with myself and everyone else around me.

I was looking at the street lights when all of a sudden the poles they were on began to bend over.  This seriously freaked me out as I had never heard of people hallucionating on weed before.  Then I looked to my friend to ask if he could see it and his face took on the form of a penguin.  I was seriously wacked out so i decided to make the best of it and just enjoy it. We were walking in when suddenly the school zoomed out away from us about 100 yards.  Then it zoomed in again about 2 minutes later.  So we went inside and it was about 2 hours from liftoff so I was definetely out there somewhere.  We got in on the dance floor and another peaceful wave hit me only this time it wouldn't recide.  It just got stronger, stronger, and stronger until it stayed there at the same level for about an hour or so.  All the while I saw patterns in things, not like out of nowhere like on acid or anything, but simply on tye-dye shirts or on the paint on the walls etc.  I would have spells where i would just stare at them and talk to them.  Then I got upset because a gnome I saw on a table wouldn't talk back to me (people must have been staring terribly).  So I decided to go outside for a minute and calm down.  Outside I discussed the dismemberment of the Grateful Dead with my friend (both of us being deadheads).  So after about 10 minutes or so I went back inside.  When I got on the dance floor, it just went on forever.  It was infinite, never ending, until I saw the DJ and he was at a point that looked like the edge of the plane.  I went up to where he was only to find it went on forever still. I was amazed.  It was like a revalation that went through my body.  I suddenly tied it to the possibilities of life being infinate and ever changing.

At the end of the dance I met up with my penguin headed friend and headed to the car.  I couldn't stop thinking about the plane, about how it just kept going.  So I got home about 12:00 and went directly to bed.  It took me 20 minutes to do it but i crawled into bed, turned on some Phish, and looked forward to my next experience.

I told some of my stoner friends about this and they believe that there was definetely something besides weed in the bag I had.  My one friend said Datura, another said PCP.  In any case all I can say is that Marijuana should be legalized because it can truly change you life for the better.

Ones condition on marijuana is always existential. One can feel the importance of each moment and how it is changing one. One feels ones being, one becomes aware of the enormous apparatus of nothingnessthe hum of a hi-fi set, the emptiness of a pointless interruption, one becomes aware of the war between each of us, how the nothingness in each of us seeks to attack the being of others, how our being in turn is attacked by the nothingness in others.

- - Norman Mailer - in Writers at Work 
 

 

I've had an *overwhelming* reaction to marijuana. I consider myself a fairly heavy user of the herb. But for some reason instead of being high and in the groove, I was having a very bad trip and nausea, no psychedelics involved.

I was at 2 aquaintances' apt with my best friend and his old high school friend. We had smoked some hash I brought from Am'dam, a couple fatties and christened a new glass bong. More than I usually smoke, but nothing I didn't think I could handle.

But then my high became adverse. My body was disassociating. Music was coming out of the ambient white noise. I asked my friends, 'do you hear that beautiful music?' Negative. I was alone. Then the waves of evil started lapping at my feet. The 2 aquaintances took on a new persona. I took on a strange delirium. I believed that the man was satan, and his female roomate was his succubi. Caught in this thought loop, my body would revolt each time I thought about the satan connection. In a sick way, I was really enjoying these stream of evil thoughts, however my body was revolting.

I snuck away to the bathroom because I felt I had to vomit. Dry heaves. I couldn't commit my body to release the evil. I kept thinking of what someone said to me about vomiting as a means of cleansing. More feeble attempts. My friend came in to check on me, and we decided to leave. I made it home and was finally able to release and give in to the vomiting and all was better. Lesson learned, don't fight the urge to spew. Purged and cleansed, I lied on the floor in the darkness, finally able to enjoy the space in my mind. No more bad thoughts. I continued hearing music from white noise and tried my best to remember the melodies so that I could tune in later.

All in all, a new and exciting experience from pot. Never thought it would be possible. Why do I think it happened? I had a large amount of Indian food for lunch, and I think there was a synergy from the spices. Yea, it could be food poisoning, but my girlfriend wasn't sick at all. This experience reinforced my belief that MJ is definitely a visionary plant. I'll probably try to repeat the indian food + copious mj combo just to satisfy my curiosity. However, the taste of curried bile is a poignant reminder that lingers on my tongue.

A year ago my bro and i were lucky enough to get 6-7 grams of some chronic shit, and i don't just throw that term around. This shit was the bomb. I'm talkin one hit shit. I'm talkin if you sqeezed a bud of this shit in your fingers, marijuana oil literally dripped off. Like i said, This was the chronic shit. So there was only one justifiable course of action, and that was to roll a phatty. I took a moment to notice my surroundings as he carefully filled the paper with green. The room was lit much like a doctor's office, cold white light. Not at all your typical smoking lighting, but i suppose that was the point. I noticed a previously rolled joint in a test tube on the smoking table which brought a smile to my face, and as he finished his bomber masterpiece, the joint in the test tube cought his attention as well. He asked me what i thought we should do with it, to which i replied: LET'S LIGHT EM BOTH UP!! Which would have been a bold enough statement as it is considering the bud we normally get around here, but the fact that this stuff was dripping with T.H.C. oil made us both wonder if we really should smoke both of them at the same time. But the concern of getting 'too stoned' quickly faded as the excitement of getting started took over, and the last thing i really remember clearly is my bro saying, 'See you on the flipside.' And with that we lit up. Instantly we were blasted, but we wern't stoppin till both j's were roaches. As soon as one of us would take a hit we would switch and take a puff off the other joint, not once taking a breather. When both j's were halfway burnt i could barely take another hit. My heart rate was already goin a mile a minute and all my bro could say was 'oh shit..' And on it went.. 

By the time the smaller joint was roached the b-52 was still goin strong and we were trippin HARD! Tar was bubbling out the end as we finished it off, and we sat back and tried to get some real oxygen flowing in our systems again. I was blasted into the stratosphere. I started seeing spots and my heart was now beating so hard my chest hurt, and what started as a dull ache in my chest was amplified by the extremely high thc level and felt as if i had been shot or stabbed. I'm dead serious! My bro was reporting 'cardio' as well. They don't call marijuana psycho-active for nothing, And with this bomb shit and the amount we smoked, it was actually quite hullucinogenic. 

The neighbors had been playing basketball and since we had all the windows and doors closed you could barely even make out the sound of the dribbling ball. And this i find VERY interesting: My mind actually intensified the distant sound as though it was in my head! I began to feel as though i WAS the basketball. My mind's eye had completely taken over to the point that my conciousness seemed either to BE the basketball, or perhaps my subjective take on what it would be like to be the basketball converted to reality by means of personal expirience. At any rate, Evertime the ball hit the ground it was a painfull experience. I found this quite amusing.

I began to have fairly strong audio hullucinations and subtle open eye visuals, and definate closed eye visuals. And beyond that point i don't remember much of the trip.

This marijuana was definatly NOT laced. All effects were purely tetrohydrocannabinol effects. Fun, exciting, interesting, even a little painful, which if you ask me was one of the best parts. Overall, a very intense cannabis trip.

I have never tried acid or any other mind altering drugs apart from pot, alcohol, and 12 cold and flue tables (not recommended)so this phenominal expirience was definataly not a flash back of an acid trip.

Several weeks ago on a Thursday afternoon before sport at school my good friend and I decided that we should alter our state of mine ever so slightly through a complex ritual we like to call getting shit faced. I was not particularly in the mood to get stoned as I tend to become very uneasy when I am the only one stoned within a large group, and my friend and I both do different sports, so I decided to only have one lung full of mildly potent grass spun with some crushed rose petals (they do nothing to potent or change the experience in any way, my friend is just a bit strange).

We then proceeded to make our way to the yard where every one was already lined up to go to sport. By this time the effects were minimal only a slight light headed feeling, and thats all that I was expecting, not in the slightest way able to for see the incomprehensible psychological events which were about to take place. Waiting outside the bus I was completely capable of participating in a normal conversation with a friend who was not on any drugs at the time I didnt even have any fragmented thoughts apart from the occasional illogical thought I was totally straight. I was later told that if I had not told them that I just some pot they would not have been able to tell.

(now this is the good bit) I suddenly felt the urge to kneel down, it wasnt an over powering compulsion to get closer to the ground rather a feeling of  ill be a bit more comfortable if I kneel so I did.

The way down seemed to be the turning point for the experience. The time dilation I experienced was incredible what seemed to me an hour was only the time it took to get from a standing position to a kneel.

I studied the way the warm suns rays which splashed on to the semi-dried grass where I knelt. It seemed to remind me of a time in my childhood that I had long forgotten when my parents would take me to the river where we used to live. And for an instant I was once again there, filled with the same uninhibited innocent bliss that only childhood (and apparently now drugs) could evoke.

This total bliss although indescribably pleasant came as a shock, I had experienced an emotion similar to this before yet on a much higher dose. I stood up, and just as mysteriously and unexpectedly as the emotion came it dissipated leaving me pondering what had just taken place. I made my way onto the bus and sat by the window.

I was joined by a friend, who upon sitting down next to me sparked up a meaning less conversation, in which I involved myself for a while, but seeing that in my current state of mind I would benefit more if I just turned and looked out the window. I told him in a very polite way that I am incredibly sorry but I must turn and look out the window now. (He thought I was joking but after seeing that I did not turn back to him he found another victim to bore with pointless chatter.)

As I was trying to figure out what had caused my bliss just a few minutes ago I started to take greater notice of the lush green trees out side. Then just as suddenly was the first time the wondrous feeling came over me. Only this time many times more profound than before and it lasted for most of the 15-minute bus ride to the pools during this time I had lost my entire internal monologue apart from the occasional wow and whats going on. My mind was empty of verbal thought, instead filled with raw emotion, a type of bliss or nirvana if u will so profusely mind blowing that brought tears to my eyes.

An endless psychological orgasm is perhaps the closest verbal description I can put to it.

Every stimulus from the outside world conveyed a type of wonder and pure undivided happiness that I have never seen the likes of before. This utopia stoped when we reached the pools but then an hour later on the bus home I experienced the same phenomena as before to the same amazingly vivid scale. And to this day I occasionally have a glimpse into this state without any drugs and find that the world seems to have a much more wonder and beauty than it once had.

The strangest thing happened yesterday, and I thought it would be wise to write my experience down, before I forget all its details.

I usually smoke weed alone. I'm lucky enough to have a lovely setting, sitting comfortably in front of the window, with a nice view (trees, stars, etc.). I consider myself a rather experienced user - normally I smoke pot to relax and lift my mood. Therefore I wasn't completely ready for what happened last night.

I'm not certain of the dose, but I only smoked one joint. Okay, it was what I consider a strong one - but still...I knew how powerful this weed was (I smoked the day before), however, I didn't know that pot alone could blow my mind this way.

I started taking off after a few hits. After about twenty-five minutes, I felt really tense. My eyes were feeling strange. And before I knew it, I was on the floor. I don't know how I ended up there, though. I was literally knocked down by the power of the experience - it reminded me of the first effects of mushrooms, a heart that beats fast, and a different level of awareness.

After maybe thirty or thirty-five minutes, the first hallucinations occurred. The window became 3-dimensional - in other words, I could see things come out of the glass, it looked like a mountain all of a sudden. I was completely out of reality (note : I smoke in the dark, with only the light of the day - there is one, even at 1 am). I fell off my chair again, and when I wanted to find it again, I couldn't. I felt like I was losing my mind, because I couldn't find a big chair in such a little room.

And then the most impressive moment of the trip occurred. I got closer to the window to look outside. I could see an assembly of people, and strange patterns and characters moving on the tree. The hallucination was very real, because no matter how I looked at it, it was there, permanent. Then I saw a piece of steel with a ball on it, and the piece of steel was moving back and forth. For some reason, it was very important to me to make sure the ball wouldn't fall off. So I concentrated on it, and I noticed I could curve the steel each time the ball was about to fall, only with the power my mind. 

It's probably very unclear, but the whole experience was extremely disturbing. Making the hallucinations change just by my will is something I never went through before. It was very exciting. The whole experience lasted for about 2 hours, and then I started to come down a little. I didn't understand that weed (and only one joint) could be such a powerful, mind altering drug. It raises a lot of questions about awareness. During the trip, I had moments when I felt I was going through a quasi-religious experience. 

I didn't know that weed could free your mind this way, and enable your brain to work completely. I've been in deep thought since this trip - next time, I will take a piece of paper and write all the things I feel and see. Drugs that affect consciousness are very appealing to me. They make me realize how much more there is out there, how many ways there are to see the world and use your mind. 

Sorry for rambling, I just had to share this experience. It was very pleasant, although at times quite breathtaking. I will try to reach this state again, but I'm not sure that weed alone is responsible for this. Another thing I learned is that the setting and your state of mind just before the trip are *very* important. Overall, this trip was very enlightening to me, and made me reconsider several things I took for granted about reality.

I consider myself a experienced pot smoker even though I am just in high school, but this trip rocked my socks off. I am starting by telling you my usual preparations which I always do including this time. When I smoke pot it is after school most of the time so I drive home, go upstairs, get into my stash get what I need then head to the bathroom. I almost always roll my joints on the crapper while I crap. I find it very relaxing and I enjoy it. This time was slighty different, I rolled me a great joint, it was fairly large and I was proud and happy, like always after I roll a joint. I had some left over on my yearbook that I use to roll on and I was trying to put it back into the bag but the book slipped off my knee and a fair amout of weed (about enough for a pen sized joint) fell into the toilet. That tore me up bad but I knew it wasnt worth going in after so I was just really pissed at myself, but I lit my joint and burned it and then went into my room and flipped on the television, King of the Hill was on and me being I big fan of Mike Judge I always watch this show when I get home.

By this time I was lifted pretty good but I was still upset about that joint so I decided to roll another one in my room to forget it, I did this and burt this one too and also burnt my fingers and lips a little from running the roach down too far but I could feel the high hit me like a freight train, my ears were pressurized like I was under water my mouth was so dry and I was giggling because of king of the hill. I laid back onto my bed and chilled out, I was looking at the cartoon characters on the flat screen but they were not inside the tv, they were slightly raised about the screen, this caused me to start laughing ridiculously hard, my abs were wore out after what seemed like an hour of laughing but I am sure it was no more than 10 minutes. I dried my eyes and looked at the screen again, they were outside the screen now and pulsing  colors, it was soooo cool and I was happy about my experience so far so I decided to chill some more and see what I thought about. I layed on my bed and closed my eyes, I saw an outline of a body, I thought that it was strange but I was too involved to think much, then I saw pulsing light come from what would be the area of the face where th lips are and I looked at the fingers and they were pulsing too. I realized that I was thinking of me and began laughing again for no real reason. Then as I laughed with my eyes squinted I saw the body and the abs were glowing which made me laugh harder and wrap myself with my arms and the arms started glowing on the body and this went on until I quit laughing which took forever. But when it did the high had already started going and all I needed to do was think and sleep. So I did just that.

I went to the hill where I met my friends and went with them down to the local pub with some money to buy myself an eighth of weed from one of the dealers inside. We were in there for about half an hour, they were smoking their own stash, I hadn't opened mine yet because I was going to save it all for later on in the evening. All my friends told me I should smoke it now and I finally gave in. I opened up the bag and got a bud out. I then pulled my rizla out of my pocket, pulled a sheet out and tore off a bit of the lid to make a roach. I made myself a nice roach and put it in the left of the rizla. I then pulled small bits of my weed off the bud I had pulled out. I put them all into the rizla, making sure there was more weed to the end of the rizla so I could cone it properly. I then proceeded to roll a fat blunt :-)

I decided I didn't want to smoke it in the pub, so I put it in my tin and we all went back up to the hill where we usually hang out. When we arrived, I pulled out my blunt and sparked it up. I took my piece and then passed it round to my friends. Immediately I felt a warm sensation flood my body, and I started to feel far more relaxed and I started to be more talkative and less shy.
When we had finished the blunt, we all stood around and talked for a bit. After about five minutes, my friend Sam asked me if I wanted to goto the chippie down the road. I went with him into 'The Town Fryer' and purchased some chips. As I sat down I was looking at the window in front of me. It had some fake snow sprayed on it around the edges and around some of the stickers that had been placed on it. I noticed that someone had written 'HENRY' in the fake snow and it got me laughing. I was sitting there laughing for what seemed like ages. My friend Sam came and sat down next to me and asked what I was laughing at and I didn't tell him because I thought it would seem stupid. So we sat there and didn't say anything to eachother. Even though there was nothing particularly interesting going on at the time, everything seemed really interesting to me. I was thinking, thinking, thinking, and everything lead on to a thought, which turned into another thought. It was really great! I had to physically shake my head to get myself out of this trance of thought. I noticed that most of my chips had gone and that I was chewing on one at the time, so even while thinking and thinking, I was still eating my chips and not noticing it!

After we had both finished our chips, we walked out of the chippie and went back up to the hill. Most of our friends had already gone home, and there was only a few other people sitting down, skinning up and smoking some joints. I never smoke joints because I feel the tobacco ruins the effect of the weed. I think this may be because I don't smoke cigarettes and I'm not really used to smoking tobacco like I smoke weed.

After sitting with them for a bit, and having a deep conversation with them, I looked at the time and realised I had to be home. I got up and walked down to the bus stop and waited for my bus. Even waiting for my bus seemed like fun because I was just thinking of things all the time until my bus came along. I got on my bus and paid for my ticket. I sat at the back and started thinking again. I was thinking so deeply, that I nearly forgot to press the button to make the driver stop at my stop. I managed to press the button and the bus stopped. I walked out and thanked the driver and proceeded to walk home... thinking all the way.
When I got home, I said hello to my parents, and walked up the stairs. I laid on my bed and closed my eyes.
I woke up the next morning and I was in my pyjamas, under the sheets. Even though I had been wearing my jeans and shirt and a belt that was fiddly to undo, I had still managaed to take it all off, put my pyjamas on, and get under the sheets. I don't remember any of this, so I must have done it in my sleep while still quite stoned.

This was the best time I have ever had on weed. It was also the first time I had ever smoked a blunt. So from then on, I never smoke joints... only blunts... Blunts are the way forward!

UPDATE----

Now I think about it, a few things I have missed out in that report. I remembered some of the effects that I haven't mentioned yet.

When I was sitting in the chippie, I was noticing that all the things I was looking at were going really slowly and if I looked from one place to another, it took a while for me to see what I was looking at. Also, I was looking at people walking past and thinking about their own lives, how different they were from mine, and then I realized that I had just planned out their lives for them... I had thought of that their partners would look like, their parents... what they would do for a job, what they were doing in town that night. Everyone I was looking at, all these thoughts came into my head. It wasn't overwhelming though, it was just nice. I could have stopped thinking at any time, but I didn't want to. If someone had started talking to me, then I could have come out of the trance and talked to them quite easily, without worrying about saying the wrong thing.

The thing I remember about sitting there the most is how I couldn't feel the chair I was sitting on, I couldn't feel the table I was leaning on, and I couldn't feel the temperature of the room I was in. It was as if I was just in my own little bubble around me and I couldn't hear what anyone else in the chippie were saying. I was just sitting there, it was just me and nobody else in that chippie, and I felt great.

Sorry I posted 2 experiences, but I started reading other people's experiences and I realised that I had missed some of the feelings I had while sitting in the chippie.

At the time this experience occurred, I was relatively new to cannabis.  I only did it once before, and I didn't really get much out of it (basically I felt kinda good and acted really stupid).  However, this experience shaped my entire perspective of cannabis.

I was pretty unenthusiastic about smoking marijuana, for reasons previously described.  But I decided to give it a try for kicks.  Me and my buds (pun) walked outside to a 'safe place' (i.e., no prying neighbors or parents) with our patented 'apple pipe' (we were all new to it, so it's all we had).  I inhaled around 5 hits of medium, over-priced marijuana.  Felt good, but definitely not euphoric.  We decided it was safe to walk back to the house and do the rest in the back yard.  On the way back, one of my friends (I'll call him 'Jake'), for a split second, appeared to be dressed up as a clown.  I decided it was hilarious enough to share it with him, so I sputtered 'Hey... Jake... You need to be a... CLOWN.'  My friends (not as stoned as I) were obviously laughing AT me, instead of with me.  Another note, my face and throat were numb... I'm not sure if this is a normal reaction or not, just thought I'd share.

We went back to the yard and smoked the rest.  As I pulled out a bud, my friend examined it and exclaimed 'Dude... This is the beginning of a chronic bud!'  (Wether it was or not, I'm not sure.)  Anyway, I proceeded to take two more hits.  Afterword my mind felt like it was at the peak of a roller coaster, ready to fall down the first hill.  It was a very intense euphoria.  Soon I began to see colors... All I could see was yellow with red specks.  It took me a second or two to regain my vision.  I could hardly mumble '...the colors...', but I managed to.  Jake's eyes appeared to bulge; I said he had buggy eyes.  We passed the pipe around two more times, each time it was harder to actually inhale.  After my ninth inhale, no matter how hard I tried, I could not find the hole in the 'pipe', so my friends determined that I was too fucked up for any more weed.  We then walked in the house and sat down.

When I sat down, I still felt that roller coaster sensation.  The euphoria I was experiencing increased at the same rate a roller coaster falls!  It was extremely intense, and so I panicked slightly for a minute until I finally just sat back and accepted it.  It was this time I decised the theory that the mind is an echo inside your head.  Individual thoughts themselves were just echoes.  I probably stated this because that's how thought itself felt; my mind felt like an echo you would hear inside a large cave. (Sorry, this is the best I can describe it.)  Speech wasn't self-controlled, it was automatic.  I simply could not control it, words just came out of my mouth. (Perhaps it triggered a dissociative effect?)  This sensation increased for at least 10 more minutes, but I went to sleep so it could have lasted even longer.

Anyway, I think that's the most intense high I've ever experienced with Mary Jane.  I don't know what exactly triggered it either... And going by other accounts, it doesn't appear to be a normal reaction.  My only explanation is that I take certain medication for seizures, but then why wouldn't it occur every time I do it?

I have smoked Weed in the past but, only taken like 3 hits or so. I was going to sell my friend a video game for $20 but instead he offered my a gram for the game. So I went over to his house. He had rolled a blunt for me. We went in the back yard and he lit it up and gave it to me. I took the first hit and inhaled. Then another and a third. It kicked in like 30 seconds. I felt like I did with previous experiences kinda dizzy, happy tingly. The blunt was barely even worn down I let him take a few hits while it settled in. I took it back and took 2 more hits, and a couple more and then the blunt was gone. 

When we were finished I hadn't even remembered smoking in the first place. I tried to walk and I felt like I was a dinosaur for some reason. I looked out into his back yard and it looked and felt like heaven. I felt so peaceful and calm. I felt so peaceful and calm. This was probably 20 mins after I first smoked. I heard this buzzing sound and it was so nice and harmonic.

We went inside his house and I remembered smoking now and I watched him play video games, but I couldn't pay attention I would keep on dozing off and look at random things and become entertained by them. This wasn't even the peak. My friend had to leave so I walked home. I only live like 2 streets away. On my way home I saw the mailman. I got really paranoid I kept saying to myself he knows I'm high he knows I'm high.

I finally made it home and went upstairs to my bed. It had been about an hour since I smoked. This was probably the peak. I was tired so I laid in my bed. I turned the T.V on but I couldn't pay attention. When I was laying down I felt like my soul was jumping out my body and coming back, then it would sink into the floor and come back out again. I also started to make up words and keep on saying them and this random melody would start playing in my head and it wouldn't stop. I didn't remember who I was. I wasn't thinking about school or my mom and dad or my brother I forgot all of that.

I started coming down and I remembered who I was and that I was a teenager and I go to high school and things like that. I went down stairs and I watched T.V. It was now about 2 and a half hours since I smoked. I could pay attention now. I was still buzzed for another hour and a half. The whole high lasted 4 hours. The whole high lasted 4 hours. It was crazy.

The next day I told the same friend about it. He said the only reason why I was so high was because that I don't smoke a lot. Overall the experience was fun.

I have researched cannabis, and picked apart all the health pros and cons of it. At the time I dabbled with marijuana from time to time, and never really acheived a 'high' that my friends described. So I saved up some money and bought some hydro. 

I got all the necessary requirements for an enjoyable marijuana experience, my pipe, sublime (my favorite band), cookies, and the weed of course. I finished the bowl and within a few minutes began to feel the effects. The quality of the weed was very good. You get what you pay for. My legs began feeling like they were falling off my body. Every movement felt like a delayed reaction. My head began moving around on my shoulders, I was unaware of this. I began to see in somewhat of tunnel vision, but it was slightly colorful in my peripherals. The music resonated in my head, my sinuses. My head was like the body of an acoustic guitar. My head was like the body of an acoustic guitar. 

About thirty minutes into the experience I felt hungry, so I grabbed my cookies and began to munch. I felt like I was inside my own mouth. I could feel and taste every ingredient in the cookie. It was quite amazing. 

After about an hour I thought it was time for another bowl. So I smoked one more and layed down on the bed. I felt magnetized to my mattress, like I was becoming one with the bed. I adjusted and then felt like I was in a rubber tube, my muscles contracting and moving to fit through. All the while I hear the warpy echoing music. This went on for about an hour until I decided to go outside. Once outside I felt truly enlightened and amazing. The weather was perfect, and the feel of the breeze against my skin was magnified. I heard a car horn, and the sound repeated itself for a few seconds then faded away. My head was buzzing, along with the vibration of my body. I felt just right. 

After awhile of my walking I went inside. It had been about 2 hours and the peak had worn off. The after effects were really nice. A relaxed feeling, but not a sleepy one.

Psychotic Episode From Cannabis

Cannabis is one of the most enjoyable drugs, but it is not completely harmless. One night, I was smoking a lot. I had a very happy day and thought, '**** it I'm gunna smoke my heart out...' I smoked 3 grams of bong hits in a total of 30 minutes. I just kept packing bowls, turned up the Zeppelin playing, and tried to get as blazed as I've ever been.

After smoking 3 grams in bong hits... As you can imagine I was flying. I was singing along to Pink Floyd songs, laughing at nothing, just having a good time. Then it started...

Suddenly a strange feeling overcame me. I started to drift away from the pleasant high I was having, and started to get mentally uncomfortable. I started to drift away from the pleasant high I was having, and started to get mentally uncomfortable. I felt like I was having a bad trip, although there was nothing in the world that could stop me! Nothing was even bothering me. I started to feel like it wasn't me inside of my head... I looked at the mirror, and wondered if it was me inside of my head. Every time I looked into a mirror at myself it would send tingles down my spine. 

I ignored it and tried to get back to a good trip. I started packing more bowls, and I started to notice, when I would talk to myself, like just saying 'damn Im gunna get wrecked from this hit!' , I wouldn't say I... I was saying 'we' when I was talking about myself... I would say 'oh we're gunna get blazed' and I'm thinking... Who is we? It was like I started developing a different personality in my head. At this point I started getting scared. 

I felt like I was being taken over by insanity, and that this other person in my head was trying to gain control. This feeling continued until the high ended...

Never in my life have I ever experienced a moment where I literally was scared of going insane. I still smoke marijuana and enjoy it very much.  

I don't think I have any mental illnesses, although my family has a history of it (mothers side). But it always makes me wonder...

I had been smoking pot for about 3 or 4 months, and until then, I had never hit from a gravity bong. I'm a recovering Bulimic, so I weigh very very little. So this was good shit, it was headies. I take a monster hit off of the gravity bong, and I didn't exhale all of it. So I start coughing, a lot. I start to get dizzy from lack of oxygen. At this time I started thinking I was blacking out, but in reality I was just blinking. I start freaking out majorly, thinking I'm going to die. My friends, and the guy who bought the pot for me, help me onto a mattress, and things become very weird.

The room I was in, very slightly resembled my bedroom from when I was a small child, like 3. Instead of thinking, my brain told me this WAS the room I lived in when I was 3, and I began to think I was 3. Instead of thinking, my brain told me this WAS the room I lived in when I was 3, and I began to think I was 3. I realized around this time I was shaking very very violently. Things were moving, the world was tilting. I start to close my eyes, so I don't get dizzier than I was. When I closed my eyes, it was like a dream I had when I was 3. I kept having all these random memories come to life for me. The guy who wanted to spend time with me, came and brought me water, knowing I more than likely had dry mouth. I couldn't hold up the water cup, because I was shaking so much. The water went EVERYWHERE, and I started laughing hysterically. Things kept changing color for me, it was so pretty and trippy. Then I realized, I smoked way too much and I was tripping. I felt like I was living inside a dream, and time had just slowed down. Minutes turned to hours. 

Looking back, I would get that high again. Now that I know what to expect.

Previous Experience: At this time, I had not been smoking weed for long. I had only smoked 4 times, and my tolerance was still quite low. However, I greatly enjoyed it, and planned to both smoke more cannabis and try LSD.
Time:~6:00 PM
Setting: Friends house, nice spring day
Mindset: Some stress in background, mostly relaxed
Other notes: At this point in time, I was on a prescription of 20mg citalopram (celexa) daily.

After a long week of schoolwork, my buddy and I decided to relax and get high. I went over to his house where he showed me his new dab pen. I asked him where he got the carts from, and he said he had gotten them from a friend. I was skeptical about their quality, but he assured me it was good shit. We both took several hits (approximately 10 each, although Im not 100% positive) and waited for the effects (other than a burning throat) to kick in.

First thing I noticed was a lack of ability to focus. My thoughts were jumping around and it was harder to form coherent sentences and understand others. With it came a lack of hand-eye coordination, making physical tasks harder. My peripheral vision became more fuzzy. Also, the typical euphoria and giggles kicked in.

However, I had never experienced what would happen next. First came intense shaking, nothing like the little bit of shaking from previous experiences with weed. Next, my vision went completely crazy. When I focused on an object, the area around it that I was not focusing on would flash black and white. Objects would also sometimes feel closer than they were if I looked at them and moved my head back and forth. I began seeing tracers. But, perhaps strangest of all, was the teleportation of objects I saw at the peak.

I dont know if teleportation is a good word for it, but I dont think drifting is good either. Objects I looked at would often move slightly in one direction and then instantly zip back to their starting place. This accompanied me feeling like I was falling and frequently losing my balance. If I tried to sit straight up in a chair, I would feel like I was falling and eventually rest my head on the countertop, without trying to.

I was absolutely loopy at this point, and I began spinning in circles on my friends couch, giggling uncontrollably. It had hit him hard too, and he was acting strangely as well, pacing and speaking incoherently (or maybe I was too high to understand him!). We fired up Smash Bros. and neither of us could play well at all. Eventually, we settled in and started watching TV. 

About an hour and a half in, I was starting to come down slightly. I had the munchies hard, and searched for something to eat. What I realized at this point was how slow time felt to me. It wasnt like getting something to eat was a colossal effort to me, it just felt like it was taking forever. This was actually slightly annoying, especially when trying to set up my amp and guitar later (were both musicians). We chilled and watched TV for a long while. I wasnt paying attention to it because trying to was difficult and it was hard to comprehend what was happening. 

Eventually, around 10:30, we went out to a nearby gas station to grab some food. It was a beautiful night, and in retrospect I wish we had walked out there for longer, enjoying the weather. After coming back to his house, we ate our food, watched some more TV and eventually went to sleep. The next morning, both of us could still feel a slight buzz. Time was moving a little slowly still, and it was taking longer to process things. This wore off pretty quickly.

Overall, this was a fun experience. Definitely the highest I had ever been, and Id certainly like to try getting this high again (although I doubt I could do something like that every day).

ASTROLOGY AND PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCES
The night of 20th February was Mahashivaratri - the Hindu festival, night of the Great Shiva. On this day bhang (dried female shoots and flowers of Cannabis) are taken as prasaad. From the overwhelming spiritual nature of the trip I had on this day, I now suspect that astrology and especially the position of the moon also influence the nature of the trip that one gets on Bhang/Cannabis. The Hindu calendar is partially Solar and Lunar based and Mahashivaratri invariably falls on the night previous to a Amaavasya or New Moon. I still must look up whether shamans and spiritual practitioners in other parts of the world consulted astrology to time their psychedelic rituals.

CONSPIRACY TO KEEP PEOPLE ASLEEP
One of the overwhelming feelings throughout this trip was there was some kind of conspiracy to keep humans asleep/under illusion/under the grasp of Maya. However, it was unclear as to who was behind this conspiracy - was it our own ignorance and/or hostile forces that Sri Aurobindo talked about in his 'Letters on Yoga'. Could this feeling be the source of all kinds of conspiracy theories by people who perceived the original truth in a distorted way and came up with all kinds of beliefs of government cover ups, alien abductions, alien invasion etc. Are there people among us who are 'awake' yet are silent witness to the play - lila (Divine play according to Hinduism) of the world? Are there others silently doing their work, making subtle attempts at 'waking' people up, leaving signs for people who are partially awake to tell them that they are not alone and that they are not under some sort of delusion?!!

I very strongly had the 'feeling' that the esoteric and mystical texts and poems left by sages and seers in the past are a kind of symbol/code language for those of us who are partly awake, to guide us and to show us the Way. There could be three reasons why this message is given in a code/symbolic language:
1.  Those who are yet asleep do not get alarmed and confused.
2. To prevent the message from going into the hands of ignorant/hostile people who could misuse this knowledge.
3. Most importantly, to a person in an altered state of consciousness, metaphors and symbols make more sense than ordinary language because the experiences during a 'high' can be best described in symbols and metaphors.
It was very clear, however that most of humanity is asleep or under some kind of a spell and all the sages and mystics of the past have been trying to break this spell and awaken the slumber of humanity.

LOSS OF SENSE OF TIME
The passage of time, on this trip was remarkably erratic. At some point it appeared to speed up, on another occasion slow down and at times, come to a standstill.

ACCESS TO UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE
I felt as if I could access universal knowledge simply with the effort of will and focus. Comprehension of ideas/concepts and phenomena was almost effortless.  Was this the reason why some governments had banned Cannabis for their 'subjects/citizens?!!

SANITY AND INSANITY, DREAM AND REALITY
I felt as if I was living with insane people and once the effects of Cannabis wear off I will slowly slip back into a similar kind of insanity. A kind of insanity in which you take a 'make believe world' created by the ignorance of your mind as 'reality'. It felt very similar to the concept depicted in the film 'Inception' where they show a group of people asleep and a man in charge of that place tells Leonardo DiCaprio that this is the place where they come to 'wake up' to their 'dream reality'. I felt that I too would wake up to a 'dream reality' once the effects of Cannabis wear off. I felt that I too would wake up to a 'dream reality' once the effects of Cannabis wear off. 

CANNABIS AND ESP: SUBTLE SMELLS
I felt as if I had developed the ability of sensing subtle smells. I could 'smell' my younger son's indigestion (it wasn't very pleasant !!). At another point when I was roasting egg plants/brinjals, one of them smelt different and unpleasant. When I cut it open I found a small rotten patch inside.  This ability continued for the next few days and then slowly faded out.

DIRECT COMPREHENSION IN WAVES
Concepts and ideas would initially float in front of my mind's eye, like a wave hitting the shore gently, rise and then fall back to be replaced by another wave....
Lord Shiva is believed to be the Lord of Destruction (destroyer of ignorance ?) and the Lord of the Underworld. His abode is Mt. Kailash which is a part of the great Himalayas.
The Master will come when the Disciple is ready 

It dawned on me that the above saying was not to be taken literally. Under Cannabis, I become receptive to 'higher truths' and insights and this higher/divine knowledge is the Guru or the Master that comes when one is ready. The Master may not necessarily be a person. One becomes one's own master/guru in a 'high' state. Evil is not an external entity, it is one's own ignorance. The message of the Sufis came to my mind - 'you stand between yourself and God'. Here God means enlightenment, you imply your ignorance. The words and spiritual compositions of great seers and sages were written in a similar state of high which they achieved through non-chemical means. Taking of such psychotropic plants is perhaps a short-cut, and that is the reason why its effects are short-lived.

Key-hole view of Enlightenment
My direct comprehension of concepts/phenomenon was always in a visual form. However, the edges/margins of the visual were always hazy. I felt that I was getting a mere key-hole experience/revelation. As if I was peeping through a hole in a doorway, and the doorway led to a beautiful mansion with multiple rooms and stories. Christians saints and Sufis have often mentioned various stages/growth in spirituality and in order to reach the highest step of the ladder one has to be ready - purge/cleanse one's lower self. Perhaps the reason why a lot of people who take Cannabis do not get a spiritual experience could be because their intentions are not proper or strong enough, as mentioned in one of my earlier posts and secondly because their lower self has not been cleansed of ignorance. Esoteric literature from all over the world give you various ways and techniques to cleanse your lower self.

I am not a religious person i.e. I do not go to temples or perform regular worship or pray to a specific deity on a regular basis. However I do meditate and perform mantra jaap. However the overwhelming feeling that pervaded throughout all my recent trips was that I had been selected to be a part of some great Secret. I felt special. I felt Grace and blessings being bestowed on me, and the world appeared magical and bewildering. Perhaps this is how the world appears to a child before it is conditioned by the society !!

Cerebral Overdrive
This trip was intensely spiritual and cerebral. At one point I felt as if I could take in no more 'knowledge', and that my brain needed some rest. I also understood how knowledge could give a person pure pleasure/bliss and bewilderment. This cerebral pleasure (I call it thus for the want of a better word) was like a mental orgasm.

Following are some of the spontaneous ideas/revelations that dawned on me on this day. They may not be original and I am not the first to discover them, but in this state I could feel their meaning with my entire being and not just my mind:
It is clear that most of the humanity in 'normal' state  is asleep and so do I slip into a kind of slumber when the effects of Cannabis wear off.
Silencing of mind and tongue prevents us from falling asleep, from getting lost into this illusory word. The key is mindfulness - be mindful to the people and situations in your life.. Do not get caught/seduced by the myriad of distractions/temporary pleasures that the world offers you. They are all meant to put you back to a kind of sleep - the sleep of ignorance. Negative attributes are like lullabies that put you to sleep.
Religion is for the masses, those who are asleep, to show them the way in the darkness; mysticism is for those who are partially awake.
The Spiritual Path is like a game of Snakes and Ladder, for most the path is long and cumbersome, but the fortunate come across ladders/Grace on their way to hasten their journey, and at times even 'angels' and saints fall when bitten by the snake of heedlessness.

The breathing exercises, rhythmic dance and zikr of the Sufis, after a certain stage of progress on the Path, are physical methods to get a 'high' - an altered state of consciousness when they can experience higher realities. These methods are long and laborious and require will and perseverance. However they are fool-proof, you cannot go astray.  Shortcuts to achieving an altered state of consciousness like drugs and psychotropic plants can lead a lot of people astray if they take it without  the right  intention and also if their lower selves are not ready for it.
The 'door keepers' of mystical/hidden/secret knowledge are not some special people but our own egos, our lower selves. You can cross the threshold only if your intentions are pure and your hearts ready.
The demon Mara who tried to lead Buddha astray was a symbol for Buddha's own lower self, whom he finally vanquishes and attains Nirvana.
Negative emotions especially anger and hate, stiffen certain parts of your physical and psychological self, leading to various ailments.

Physiological Effects on the Body
My body temperature appeared to have risen slightly but not high enough to make me feel uncomfortable.
Could also sense a slight rise in my pulse rate and hear beat but this came in waves. I would also swallow more frequently. 
Vision was not affected neither was motor function. However, like seeing shapes in random clouds in the sky, I could clearly discern humanoid faces and body shapes in inanimate objects.

It was a gorgeous day in Upstate New York where my girlfriend rides her horse. The sun was so bright that the snow was rapidly melting, and I didn't even need to wear a coat (this was the first week of feb, by the way.) I waited until no one was around to light my crudely rolled joint. The smoke was very harsh from the paper, so I had to chain smoke quickly, in little puffs. I didn't think I was going to get very high. I WAS VERY WRONG.  

I began to feel it right away. Everything was beautiful! The sun, the fields and the trees, everything. The melting snow added even more to the effect, as it's rays warmed me in a an undescribable way. I usually get paranoid about seeing other people who aren't 'cool' while high, but not now. I was very talkative and happy to be around anyone. But everyone was busy riding horses, so I layed on a bench, put my IPOD on random mode, and took a mini-vacation. I literally traveled through that blue, infinite sky that day. There literally wasn't a cloud in sight. I saw an over flying air plane while some reggae song played, and I felt like I was back in the Carribean, just loving life. Now here comes the most amazing part (to me, anyway). My IPOD WAS OFF, and 'I get by with a little help from my friends' by the Beatles was playing. I DON'T EVEN HAVE THIS SONG ON MY IPOD! I just kept looking at the sky in total amazement. I felt like I was flying, and the song actually made sense. I don't know how I 'played' the song in my head from memory, because I never have owned or listened to the Sgt. Pepper album, with the exception of the songs Sgt Pepper and 'LSD'. The hallucinations I had were of the Sgt Pepper cartoon as well, which, I have also never seen indepth, but only in fragments from commercials. What was my mind trying to tell me? To love life, and every damn second of it at that. Life is too short, and thats the bottom line. Its experiences like this that reaffirm my faith in an almighty power, and the concept of Carpe Diem. I wish everyone could experience what I did that day. But alas, not all things come to be. I just hope my story has given some insight to those who wonder about the reasons why people smoke marijuana. This is just one example, but there are many more. Enjoy, and be excellent to each other.

I used to smoke weed almost every day so I am familiar with it.  I quit weed and decided to get some yesterday.  Today is my first day smoking in a while.

I am home alone and in a good mood.  I have about 5 hours before my cousins get home and my car is snowed in. At 2:30 I take 2 hits.  I feel relaxed and energetic so I dance around and chase my dog at full speed through the house.  I feel a closer connection to my dog, like I understand her better and like she understands me.  It seemed likes she understood english.  At 3:30 I do the same.  I get another energy burst.  4:30 I take 2 more hits and I just feel the same as how I have felt since 2:30.  By 5:30 I decide I am not as sensitive to weed as I used to be so I go take two more hits, but this time I take large hits.  

This is where it started to really really kick in.  I began realizing that I was extremely stoned and I had that oh so familiar feeling.  I was paranoid yet happy at the same time.  I was so happy to be stoned again but scared I wasnt going to come down early enough.  My heart was racing and I had an extreme body high.  I went to the bathroom and could barely button my pants up because I couldnt feel anything.  It was the best body high.  I felt somewhat out of it but I was still thinking like how I normally thinking when I am not stoned, I just had a tendency to space out between my moments of lucidity.  Right now it is 915 and I am feeling relatively normal.  I am feeling laid back and content.  My muscles still feel good even though I do not have a body high.  Weed has proven to relieve me of my muscle spasms while I am stoned and afterwards my muscles feel slightly better as well.  Weed not only soothes my muscles but also my mind.  If I would say the best description of weed would be a refreshment.  Weed doesnt make me feel stupid or crappy during the high or the come down.  It is extremely refreshing.

That Saturday morning I woke up and felt like smoking some ganj. I had never waked and baked before so I wasn't sure how much higher I would get. Now before I say anything else I want to tell you I had smoked weed about 300 times before this give or take. However, I somehow no matter how often I smoke can get little or no tolerance built up. I'm not complaining I actually like to save money. 

Anyway that morning I loaded up my homemade bong and toked away. What happened about 10 minutes later changed my purpose for getting high. Before this I just cared about getting as destroyed as possible. Before this I just cared about getting as destroyed as possible. Well anyway after I finished smoking I layed down in my bed and put on my headphones and turned on a song that sounded trippy called strobe by deadmau5. My shoulders, which had been aching from carrying my heavy backpack began to feel a overwhelmingly euphoric rush. I just thought to myself, this is medicine for soul and body. I sat up in my bed looking out my window with the sunlight shining in on me and I felt just pure astonishment of the universe. I closed my eyes and I just kept thinking that this is God's herb and that it was placed here for a reason. 

I now look at getting high as a spiritual journey and hope to be enlightened, but I am not sure what I am looking for. Hopefully, some day I will be able to experiment with more powerful psychadelics.

Sick Experience

Since my first experience, I have been smoking weed everyday cause weed is awesome. Before my first experience, I have never done research or knew any effects of marijuana. I felt confident to try it and wasnt scared. I never knew the power of drugs. 

So after my first year in high school in the summer, my friend and I grab some proper kush from his area and decide to smoke it in the forest beside a swimming pool, this was on a bright summer day. We sit on a log to enjoy our burn sesh and my friend takes the first hit out of the pipe. I watched him to see how this works. Then I take my hit. At that point I thought that I had a small hit, but it turns out my first hit was huge, maybe a .3. Halfway through my hit I feel like I'm going to die from coughing, and my lungs and throat were irritating like a bitch. I hold my hit in for as long as I can until my lungs start to hurt. After my exhale, I literally couldent see anything, my vision went all black for about 5 seconds and after that it hit me right away. 

I felt light, floaty, spaced out and the sun got way brighter before burning. Everything kind of looks like glass, very bright, deep, and serious look to everything. As I was walking on the grass, I felt very relaxed witch made me want to lye down. After that happened, we start walking to the plaza to 'chill' since we had nothing better to do that day, stoned out of our minds. When we get to the plaza we sit down on the ledge and watch as people pull up to the plaza and people walking by us, it was so funny, I couldn't stop laughing, it was uncontrollable, but awesome. The high makes me feel more aware about everything, myself, as if I were someone else. Sometimes it literally feels like I am watching myself, or my eyes are ahead of me. It is hard to explain but it makes me feel like ' I am there' (sense of well-being). And the body high was great. Every ten seconds or so, my nerves feel like they are mildly shocking me, like a relaxing tingling. And the closed eye hallucinations are sick. I see a bunch of random things fly by me or like treadmill things or space objects circling around me, different trippy machines, shapes, etc. I start to think differently about things, like looking at people, or thinking about myself. Everything I see isnt changed, but it kind of looks funny because I think differently about the design or purpose. When I close my eyes when I'm high, I see yourself moving around like a ball, like I'm getting shaken around, exactly. Sometimes when I'm stoned I literally feel like my hands are made of paper and are floating by me when I walk, it feels good, and most effects are noticeable.

It is a very enlightening drug, and it is very easy to overcome a panic attack during my high, or having a bad trip I have enjoyed my experience with marijuana and going to probably try shrooms, acid later, and dmt laaater. Cya

This was my second time ever trying cannabis, it was also the worst by far. It was my first bad trip and so unlike anything I had ever experienced in consciousnes. It was my first Panic Attack, either sober or drug-aggravated. 

I was hanging out with my step-brother and a female friend of his. We drove quite a way to get it from a friend of hers. We went back to my brother's place to smoke it. She made a home-made bong out of a 2 litre pop bottle. My brother rolled two joints, one for me to and one to share with them. I paid for the 2 grams, so they were very liberal with giving it to me. They also thought it was great that it was only my second time. They are both chronic users.

My first experience  with cannabis wasn't very exceptional. I also got drunk at the same time and so I don't really remember much about it other than being more incapacitated than usual being drunk and also that everyone's language seemed to be Chinese.

I was definitely looking forward to trying it again. I'm very impulsive baseline, and was so happy and jittery with excitement. We were all completely sober, and I hadn't been taking anything else whatsoever in those times, not even a multi-vitamin. This was the first time trying that would be completely cannabis alone.

First we all took a hit off of her bong. I didn't notice anything. I went outside to smoke my joint a couple minutes later while they waited inside for me. After finishing the joint all my myself after about 4 minutes, not inhaling too efficiently as I recall looking back, I was definitely feeling a buzz. It felt very similar to being drunk at the time as my thoughts were much slower. Time and perception of everything was slower. I had the permagrin on when I went inside to get them to smoke theirs.

They came out and immediately took a few hits off their joint and said they were good, and gave me about 1/3-1/2 of their joint to finish myself also. I heartily accepted. 

I took a few big hits off that joint in about one minute and then started coughing violently, I apparently had taken good hits. I was coughing uncontrollably for about a minute. My brother asked me if I was good to drive my car back home, I said no. I was definitely in a different state of consciousness now. Everything was more meaningful, and my mind dwelt on everything a little longer. I was also ignoring a lot of stimulus and focusing on what caught my attention. This was all in addition to the extremely slow perception of everything happening I had already mentioned.

My brother got in to drive and I sat in the passenger seat, which his friend sitting on the drivers side in the backseat. This was the first extremely pleasant experience I had with cannabis. I under a seemed compulsion closed my eyes to allow my mind to think about what it wanted to. I felt the oft mentioned waves of pleasure coming at me at an almost perceptible frequency. I could 'see' the waves in my head. Soon they turned into objects zooming by my field of vision. My eyes were still closed during all of this, but it seemed like a dream. These random objects from life experiences floating around inside my head brought me great humour. I was smiling and giggling almost constantly. My brothers said 'yep, he's trippin!' they were both laughing as well as they were quite experienced users and I was obviously enjoying myself immensely.

Then it turned bad. I started to get this thought in my head that I was going to 'lose my mind'. This is the first mental thought for a panic attack. In this particular instance, I was afraid I was going to go crazy and kill my brother and his friend. At first I just tried to ignore this feeling to opt instead to feel the amazing warmth and joy experienced earlier. This didn't work, and I started getting this sinking paralyzing feeling of impending doom. All the somatic effects of a panic attack started - heart racing, blood pressure increasing, my muscles got extra blood and oxygen, and this caused me to lock my arms together very tightly and I could not move them no matter how hard I tried. My jaw locked and I started shaking. My mind existed only in a state of pure terror and dread.

My brother could sense something was wrong, and kept asking me, but I just kept shrugging it off saying nothing with a trembling stuttering voice, and imagined that I had to not talk to him at all or I would lose control of my body and it would somehow kill them both. In retrospect I often laugh about the absurdity of believing something like that could have happened. It makes a good laugh when high. I imagined somehow my staying conscious was some way to keep my mind from detaching from my body and allowing it to do crazy things. I imagined I suppose at the time this was how psychotic killers were born, on a bad trip, lost control of themselves and killed people.

My eyes were closed for much of the rest of the trip. All I remember is sensing the lights off the street lights, and the intensely painful feelings I was experiencing. I was shaking and panting, my heart pounding against my chest. I was jittering and had spasms too. I'm pretty sure it's a good thing I can't remember with much detail how it felt other than what I'm writing here.

It took us an hour and a half to get to my place from his, that time felt like hours upon hours upon eons. He tried to keep me talking throughout it, he did mention a few times that I was ruining his buzz, which made me feel worse while all this was happening. His talking to me just made it worse as at the time I believe any distraction would cause me to 'lose my mind'. By the time we got to my place about two hours after smoking it, I didn't feel at all high anymore, compared to what I had been though, coming out of a panic attack would feel different in any state I'd imagine.

This event made me not want to try cannabis again. That thought only last three weeks however, and I was back for more. It was a good thing, those next few times were my honeymoon period in which I had the best highs I'll probably ever have on cannabis. It was a stepping stone in my personal experience with the substance, and I've learned much from it since.

Funky chocolate and LSD imprinting

This report has some relevance to the is oral cannabis a psychedelic? debate.

The background is that this summer I had my first encounters with LSD (four trips of varying doses from estimated 30 ug up to 150 ug). All were delightful experiences in outdoor natural settings with varying degrees of classical LSD visuals.

Since then I have been experimenting with edible cannabis. This weekend I had a second piece of my home-made cannabis chocolate.

The chocolate was made using what I think is Moroccan hash (dark brown and soft). I decarboxylated the hash in a double boiling kettle for two hours.  By the way, if you do this, make sure all the windows are open. The hash smell is pretty strong.  I then divided 1 g of the decarboxylated hash into small pieces and put it in a saucepan with plenty of butter on a low heat. After about 15 minutes the hash was fully dissolved leaving no residue. I then added dark chocolate and stirred to an even mixture. The total weight of the resulting hash chocolate was 60g (probably about half butter and half chocolate plus the 1g of hash). I froze the hash chocolate and then broke it into about twenty pieces.

I tested the batch last month with 2.7 g of the chocolate which resulted in a light but distinct high. The flavour was delicious  rich and warm with coffee and hash notes. I was quite surprised and pleased to get any effect from such a small quantity (less than a twentieth of a gram of the hash). This weekend I tried slightly more: 3.6 g of the chocolate.

This time I ate 3.6g. If I assume that the raw hash contained 20% THCA and if I also assume 100% conversion of the raw THCA to 9THC by decarboxylation, then the consumed edible dose in my 3.6g of chocolate would have been 60 mg of hash (slightly over a twentieth of a gram) containing about 12 mg of 9THC, most of which is then converted by the liver into 11 THC. 

The funky chocolate experience confirmed what I had suspected from eating cannabis gummies  that 11THC is an active psychedelic with effects that seemed to almost exactly mimic a threshold dose of LSD in the 30 to 50 ug range. 

I felt the effects of the chocolate within 45 minutes and by T+ one hour was experiencing visuals. They were not dynamic in the way that they are during the peak of an LSD trip (warping, breathing, rippling etc), but they were still very pronounced in terms of colour, contrast and shading.  Leaves for examples seemed to blend into textures and forms that drew upon the original but were far richer and more complex with colours and shade transforming from greens into golds and silvers. Depth perception was also altered with a mixture of flattening and deepening. It remained possible to come back to normality by focusing hard, but as soon as I relaxed, the visuals would come back. The peak experience lasted for perhaps one and a half to two hours. 

Hearing also became more acute and I was aware of the richness of background sounds, but I have had this before with both smoked cannabis and San Pedro.

The similarity with a light LSD trip was so pronounced that if I had not known, I would haves sworn that I had taken half a tab of LSD. I do wonder whether somehow those first LSD trips have imprinted themselves on my mind so that now when I take edible cannabis the LSD pathways are triggered.  I dont get the same effect from smoked/vaped cannabis, which produces more of a classical cannabis high without any obvious visuals. I dont get the same effect from smoked/vaped cannabis, which produces more of a classical cannabis high without any obvious visuals. 

My conclusion is that 11THC (the active metabolite in oral cannabis) certainly has a psychedelic component to it, which is triggered or enhanced by previous use of classical psychedelics.

One other observation is that the effect of this single piece of chocolate with an estimated THC content of 12 mg was similar to that produced by consuming 30 mg of THC in gummies (see my first time gummy report). Why the THC in my chocolate should be nearly three times as strong as the THC in gummies is a bit of a mystery.  When I previously tried a gummy with 10mg of THC it had no effect whatsoever.  I presume it may have something to do with the bioavailability of THC in butter as compared to gummies. Or perhaps slow low temperature decarboxylation retains other mildly psychoactive cannabinoids that are not present in commercial products. 

Anyway, Im glad I was cautious and tested the chocolate first with a very low dose. If I had simply assumed 1:1 THC equivalence between gummies and chocolate then I would eaten 10g of the chocolate which would have sent me sky high.

By the way, I had no after-effects or hangover whatever. What a difference from alcohol.

My now fiance, at the time my new girlfriend, had invited me to her dad's for the weekend, because he and his wife (my fiance's stepmom) were on vacation.  We woke at about 11am, and my fiance, I'll call her LA, wanted to take a shower before we started smoking.  By the time she was done in the shower, maybe 15 minutes after we agreed to this little wake and bake session, I was in her living room, stoned to bejesus.  This was the first time that I had ever experienced any psycho-active symptoms from smoking pot.  Everything was of course coated in hillarity, and when she got back from the shower, I was in wide-eyed disbelief about how high I was.  She laughed and took the bong from me, finishing up the last little bit and having her own load.

I then tried to explain what my head was feeling like.  When sober, we view our world from our eyes, and this is where our perception of ourselves comes from-the front of the face.  I felt like my concept of 'me' was not my immediate body or eyes.  I felt like I was watching a movie of the living room, and my eyes were the camera, only I was watching this movie playing out from 3 feet behind my head.  The movie 'Being John Malkovich' is similar to what I experienced.  In 'BJM,' people's consciousnesses are thrown into John's head, and they watch through his eyes, but from behind them, with no apparent control over their new body.

Throughout this weird trip, I was never scared, or aprehensive, or panicky at all.  I was just amazed at the weirdness of it all.  I had displaced my self-realizing or self-perception a few feet behind me.  Thank god her 100# great dane was still locked up, because I don't think I could have handled the great puppy beast in such a stupified state.

Hash... What a night, a moroccan friend of mine rolled me up a joint full of moroccan hash (he actually knew the guy who made it there, in the Rif mountains, so the quality was really high). I was living with my grandma at that moment, and one night I decided to light it up but I didn't have a lighter so I decided it would be a good idea to heat a paper sheet with a soldering gun until a flame came up...

All of this was happening in my bedroom, with almost 0 ventilation, after several minutes the flame finally formed in the sheet, I took the joint and lit it up. All my bedroom was full of hash smoke and burned paper sheet smoke. I took 3 hits and all of a sudden when I thought it wasn't working and had finished THE WHOLE JOINT with no tolerance to hash, I started to feel my legs tingly/numb and my body became like really drowsy. I took a look at the mirror and I had my eyes ALL RED, I had trouble remembering what was I going to do at every moment and I was trying my best to clean my room (burned paper sheets, the soldering gun heatened up in the floor, joint ash everywhere). Right after finishing cleaning, my grandma who was on fucking AMBIEN woke up due to the intense smell that was coming out from my room and asked me what the fuck was happening, she knows little to nothing about hash or pot smell so I told her I was soldering something and the smoke that had came out went straight into my eyes. I told her not to worry and that I was going to sleep. She believed me and went to sleep.

My trip was really intense(in terms of hash), at first I felt a pressure above my head that was causing me anxiety and only stopped whenever I didn't focus on it or when I pressed my hand against the top of my head(it really impressed me how I couldn't control the anxiety). Everything was funny, I remember brushing my teeth and listening how the water drops coming out from the tap had rythym and how I was dancing to fucking water drops. My face was really warm as well as my body, I went to sleep and my head started working really fast, thoughts were so fast I couldn't even concentrate on something, they were like bullets passing through my head. Whenever I closed my eyes I could see patterns in the dark, they were mild but still noticeable. Another interesting effect is how I felt every single vein and the blood running through them, like I could visualize it perfectly in my head, this was really unpleasant. The effects I didn't like were the muscle spasms everywhere whenever I relaxed(the spasms would happen whenever I thought of a part of my body, if I started thinking of my leg, spasms would move there) and the anxiety along with the fast heartbeat.

To end this I must say my grandma never told anything to anyone about that night (she prob doesn't recall thanks to the ambien lol)

I bought a gram of squidgy black, it's a sticky black resin. (At time of report fully legal in my country.) I got a very small amount and rolled it into a ball, probably no more than 1-2mms in diameter and placed it in my bong with ice in.

Using a normal lighter, I got it to burn and took between 2-3 full hits, and I held them in for at least 10 seconds. By full hits, I mean the bong was full of smoke. It came on very quickly, no less than a minute after the first hit. 

My heart started fluttering, I feel a tingling throughout my body. I can't say this was immediately pleasant, I was worrying that I was having a heart attack, it wasn't painful, it just didn't feel right. My mouth became very dry. I became slower and more zoned out. Although I think that was made more prominent because I was listening to music with my headphones. (Tycho - Dive)

I was very zoned out, I temporarily forgot things. At one point I felt close to being sick, I tried to eat a biscuit and couldn't because I felt sick.  

After the first hour the effects started to slowly fade. The whole experience lasted about 2 hours. 

I would give it a 6/10 - Not horrible, not amazing, slightly interesting.

I had been smoking weed off and on for around two years. Within the last few months, me and my friend Leztart noticed that we had to get a piece of glassware.

It came to the point, after smoking a blunt of piff, before seeing Santa, that I asked him for a bong for Christmas. He said sure, but I didnt expect anything.

The night was different from others when we had relaxed. It was the day before Christmas Eve. I had finished all my shopping, had $40 in weed on me (two nice, thick bags worth. It was airy, my everyday, good high stuff), and had a lot of cash left.

I cant remember which one of us suggested it, but we decided to go into a head shop and see how much a piece of good glassware was. Let me give out one true detail about me I live in NYC, which makes shopping for stuff like that pretty simple.

The first shop we went into had some beautiful pieces in the window, so we decided that they probably had something for a reasonable price.

Outside the store, a random guy was having a smoke (cigarette, I think), and, after exchanging a few words, we realized that he worked inside. When we went in, there was quite a beautiful selection of glassware; from tall, elegant hookahs, to small adorable pipes (the ones that look like spoons).

Were smart girls, so we didnt even bother to look at the big pieces, so instead focused on some small ones. There were quite a few to choose from, laced with different colors, and swirls. I had been on the computer before, searching prices, styles, and relative uses, so I wasnt going in dumb.

The first one I really liked turned out to be a little expensive, $40. It seemed a little too much, especially for a first piece. So, we looked, and saw another one.

It was small, it fit in the palm of my hand. The bowl had four swirls coming from it, red and blue, giving it the appearance of candy. I fell in love with it there. On the plus, it was only $30, so I didnt have to shell out too much cash.

Another thing we figured in was that we would save that much in money because we wouldnt have to buy a lot of blunt wraps. If we had $10, we could buy a dime, not a nick and then have to hold on to some for the tobacco.

As I paid for it, I asked the guy how to clean it, just to make sure we didnt fuck around and damage it. He said rubbing it down with alcohol was good for the first time.

Excited to use our new toy, I got home quite soon. Cleaning my bedroom a bit, we sat, pulling it out of the bag.

After rubbing it down and rinsing it, I dried it, and got out the herb. I had never used one before, but Leztart had.

Its okay dude, she said, you just light it, cover up the hole right here, let it go, and inhale. The instructions seemed simple enough, and I thought I could do it.

Because it was my piece, I greened the first bowl (even thinking of it that way made me feel more sophisticated). I didnt do a good job at all, I wont lie, and I barely had smoke come out, if at all.

Instead of getting frustrated, I watched her do it. She took the hit with ease, and it seemed, almost with grace (mind you, I wasnt high or anything).

She coughed a little, and took another pull. Thinking I had a better idea, when I got it, I took my time.

The sound of the marijuana crackling in the pipe, and burning a bright orange was like a symphony to my ears. The nicotine-free smoke burned my throat and made me cough. The more I coughed, the more it seemed like I wanted to.

With that first hit, I could already feel the very mild effects of it; my heart thumping louder and a soft covering of warmth, with cold hands.

Damn. I shuck my head in approval as Leztart took another pull. There was no real rush, we had plenty of bud.

When I got it back, I began looking online for a name for my bowl. The first thing I thought of was the Greek, original mother goddess. Doing a bit of research, I saw it, Gaea. It was almost perfect for her. But then, it didnt seem to fit well.
	What about nipple? Leztart suggested.
	Nipple? I thought she was just being an uber lesbian. Why nipple.
	Because of the little thing on the side. The rest for your index finger.
	Well, I dont want to call her nipple
	But it looks like one. Its Nipple.
	Fine but Im not calling it just nipple. Because its the first one Alpha Nipple. So if we get another one, itll be Beta Nipple.

Laughing, we proceeded to smoke three more bowls. 

I wasted around two bowls worth, thinking it was dead. When it really is all ashes, it will not smoke anymore. And it will pop out if I try to smoke it too hard.

It happened to Leztart, and she almost singed her eyelashes (theyre quite long) and she sizzled a bit of her bangs.

Since then (Its New Years Day), Ive used Alpha Nipple, maybe three times. I dont smoke everyday, just almost once a week, depending on whats going on. Every time has been successful. It was one of the best weed investments Ive ever made. Of course, I still want a bong, but for right now, shes good.

Now, my weed list only has a grinder, but weed thats too finely ground isnt as good in a bowl.

Well, to end this tale on a high note, Ill say that while smoking, it is highly entertaining to watch it turn different colors. With regular, good weed, the bowl part turned dark amber, almost gold. With piff, the level of hash on it made it dark gray with gold only on the neck. Its very beautiful to look at.

So, as you may have guessed from the title dear reader, I had anxiety and depression at the time of this experience. To give you a bit of history, I had finished high school the year before and had no idea what to do, I didn't really want to do anything either. Anyway, one of my friends knew a few people who could get some weed, so naturally I asked. This wouldn't be my first experience nor would it be my last. It was an average Friday; my mother and I had gone out earlier and gotten supplies for the weekend, nothing out of the ordinary about it. 

So at about 10pm I asked if she would roll me a joint (I was a lazy little bastard back then). I smoked it fairly quickly, barely coughed at all, and was fine for the first 20 minutes or so. Then I let my mind wander, which when I have depression and anxiety AND I happen to have taken a psychoactive/mind altering drug is not such a great idea. I've managed to dislocate both my kneecaps twice in my life, so I have a fairly thorough knowledge of what the sensation of injury feels like; that sudden SHOCK my body gives me. That's what happened to me. I started imagining various injuries on my body and my brain would seemingly trigger that shock in the corresponding place. This went on for a good 15 to 20 minutes, everywhere from my knees, to my arms breaking, shoulders popping, ankles, and worst of all my spine. I had been watching...  Something earlier which involved a spinal injury, so my mind instantly went to it. 

On top of this my mind would switch from that to basically conjuring up an image in my head of my heart and brain arguing and fighting. My mind as I remember was just belittling my heart at every turn, constantly mocking its ideas, hopes and dreams, always finding reasons why they wouldn't work. Eventually I got up and got a drink. This halted the argument and torment for a while. Not long after I sat back down again, the argument continued, albeit less intensely (this was most likely the beginning of the come-down period). I began to kind of ignore it and focus on the YouTube videos I was watching. Around 0:00 or 0100 the heightened imagination had gone and I was left with the munchies and an almost blank mind, similar to being drunk, just without the nausea and discomfort. 

So that was probably the worst experience I've had with marijuana to date. It hasn't halted my use or fondness any; in fact in my new, happy and healthy state of mind it's probably increased it. I found it fascinating. My overanalysis of what I experienced really enlightened my fears (of injury and risk taking in general) and eventually helped me get better.

I started smoking a lot of hash this year in college. I love the high it gives me. I went home for summer break and decided to eat the hash instead since the smoke leaves a smell to it and I didnt want my parents to know. Anyway, after numerous google searches on edibles I found a way to make one - in a mug. Its so quick and easy; 1 tsp of white flour, 1 and a half tsp of cocoa powder, 1 tsp sugar, mix that with a bit of milk to form a thick batter, add 1 tsp of vanilla essence to suppress the hash taste, take 1 tsp of oil, put some hash in it, don't need a lot, just the size of a pea, heat that until the hash melts in the oil completely. Mix it all together. Microwave for 1 min and a half - and voila.

The brownie tastes like a fudge chocolate one, but in a hour I know it's much more than that.

After an hour the effects started to occur, now I've eaten this brownie a nice 10 times by now and I say this with experience, I trip can get really bad if I dont have control over my mind. The music seems louder and intense, vision gets blurry, I hear everything loudly, all my senses are super alert, perfume seems to sting my nose, the cold wind just really hits me hard. Often there are times when I get super paranoid and anxious. I always felt as if my dad is going to find my stash or something bad is going to happen, that shit just makes everything awful but with time I have gained the ability to control my mind, I just gotta tell myself over and over again that everything will be fine. I watched perks of being a wallflower in that state and it was fucking wonderful. I do get hungry, so I make sure to keep snacks.

I try not to engage in conversation with anyone I dont want to tell that I'm stoned because my eyes get red, I look baked physically and I cannot really form a proper sentence. I once ate a brownie at work and my boss called me, it was embarrassing as I couldnt really respond properly...

Anyway, the trip lasts for more than 6 hours, and even the next day I'm not fully sober. Everything seems funny and happiness seems eternal in this trip.

Another negative aspect would be that my mind starts getting so many thoughts at once, it's crazy, I just have to keep our calm, because I control my mind, I even can get myself to orgasm when I really start thinking about it. Best. Orgasms. Ever. Period. 
If I'm just are able to control the paranoia everything goes perfect.

First time smiles

I would like to share my first high off of the beautiful plant marijuana.  I had a friend that had been smoking for some time and I asked him to score us some good stuff.  He got us abou 8 grams and we set into making preparations.  I picked a varried list of music I enjoyed to listen to and stocked up on water and chips.  When it was around 12 we snuck outside and packed a full bowl.  He lit it up and I began to inhale the peperry smelling smoke.  I began to caugh I was expecting it to be a little smoother. I didnt know if I was ever going to stop caughing, but after a few loud deep coughs I was under control. After we finished the first bowl, which took about 10 min, I felt disapointed cause I was having no affects what so ever. About this time my shins began to not feel the cold air anymore and things all around me seamed different somehow, how I can still not define but in my febal attempt at words it felt happy like in the good dream I dont want to wake up from.  We smoked 2 more bowls and started to sneak inside.  My head was a mess of questions, how to get inside, why did I do this, when will it be over, how can I get back to normal etc etc.

When we got inside I sat on the carpet in my friends room and felt somewhat like a frightend child.  I was worried that I would be stuck in this new and interesting world forever. My body felt numb I knew I was cold because I was still shivering but I felt no cold air.  I looked up at the ceiling, my movement felt slower than usual,the light on the ceiling amazed me in its brightness and imbedded its shadow (if you will) in my vision.  I looked over at my friend and he looked completly differnt in the shadow of the light, like a super hero.  I was seeing colors like little dots infront of my vission, green mostly, with purple making amazing paterns that I was transfixed by. At some point I said oh my God, not really for any reason just from sure amazment. I felt stupid after I said it and I hung my head in shame.

My friend turned on some bob marley and I was immediatly transformed into a different world.  The music seamed to slow and speed up growing in my wonder. I felt part of the music like when I moved my head I was keeping up with the slow bobbing of the notes.The music seamed to bend I was truely struck by the wonder of it all.  The music seamed to fade into the backround and I was sitting on the bad.  I began to stare at the digital clock and it seamed to be blinking at me.  I then became deep in thought about my life and how I needed to change, and how good I really did have it.  I didnt realize I had been staring at this clock for 13 min till my friend smacked me.  This is when I became nervous, and I believe my high peaked, about an hour after we started smoking. I felt like I was trapped and I needed out.  I strained to feel normal and I found that with little effort I could.  This reasured me that I wasnt that far out of my 'world'.  After several min of making myself 'normal' I realized I was wasting the trip.  The beautiful colors were still all around, and as I focused in on some mellow 311 tunes and closed my eyes the greens and purples that was blinking before now seamed to be waving to me in a very soothing manner.  I tried to thank God for the wonderful expierence and hoped it would never end.  I was getting tired and my head seamed strained by the trip, if you can call it that.  I laid down thinkin of my life floating in and out of the 'real world' and my alternate world on marijuana.  I passed out around 3:45

The next morning I awoke around 10 happy with a slight fuzzy feeling.  The fuzzy feeling seamed to last most of that day but I liked it.  I hoped it would stay with me but it faded shortly around 6 pm.  This was my most intense and mellow high on marijuana.  It changed my life in some little aspects, it helped me change my atitude which was bad at the time, and I appreciate life better than I ever did before that cold March day.

Im 18 still in high school and just started smoking a few months ago. My first two or three experiences with bud, I didn't feel a thing, as most commonly seen. I've never smoked anything before aside from messing around with cinnamon sticks with a friend of mine. I tried smoking on May 5th, 2006. I was a little tipsy at my friends house. He wasnt home so I was drinking with my best friend and the cousin of my friend whose house I was at. She (my friends cousin) told me she was picking up a sack later that night and I was totally down to try some marijuana with the persuasion of some alcohol. We eventually got some and broke out the 3 foot bong. I took 1 or 2 fat rips but didnt know how 2 inhale so got nothing out of it. 

A few months later my friend, who Ill call mike, started smoking, I saw him and couldnt understand what was going though his mind as he walked around the driveway excited and giggling about nothing. I decided I wanted to see what it was like. I tried it for my 3rd time at my girlfriends house. She was having a couple of our friends sleeping over and we took out a bong. I hit that thing hard, and tried to clear it but forgot to take out the bowl. I exhaled and took out the bowl and cleared it. I held it for a few seconds and exhaled due to a coughing fit. The coughing wouldnt go away so I went to the bathroom and spit to relieve some of the burning. 15 minutes passed and I was starting to feel better, I stood up from my hunched position over the sink and all of a sudden the marijuana hit me like a ton of bricks. I froze, I started feeling the sensation of falling through the ground, it was fun, I liked it, I was on a rollercoaster in my body. My girlfriend who was sitting next to me this whole time asked me if I was alright, all I could do was smile and stutter trying to explain what I was feeling. I skipped back in the room where all my friends were with the biggest smile on my face. The rest of the night was a blur of falling through the bed when I was laying on it, falling though the floor whenever I stopped walking, and eating peanut butter and fruit loops and jack in the box. That night was one of the best nights of my high school life. 

Now, months later, I smoke about 1-3 times a week during weekends trying to be as responsible as I can while still having fun. My first prophetic experience with marijuana begins here. Since I began smoking I have forever longed for those classic moments you hear about people summarizing life, the earth, and life beyond death in amazingly deep quotes. I had yet to think deeply and become one with myself while under the influence of marijuana. Last night my time had come, I smoked with a few of my work buddies at one of their houses. It was a slightly odd setting being I was the only guy there in a room full of bi/lesbian women. Most guys would kill to be in that situation but it is a lot different than first imagined. We lit up in one of their cars after making a food run to a local Mexican joint. I got first greens on the small 1 foot bong we had considering it was my bud and I was smoking out 4 other people. We all smoked about 3 or 4 bowls and I could tell I was starting to feel it. We eventually went back inside the house and ate and sat around and talked while one couple was flirting on the ground. We finished eating and were sitting around just talking and somehow the subject of time came up. It was like a light bulb lit up inside me, I could feel warmth in my chest as I realized I was taping into my inner self and began to elaborate on the subject of time. I said what I felt and what I had thought about before. I continued to speak about how time is so fleeting and you have to make the most out of every second because you will never get that second back, how people shouldnt fight or make enemies because it is a waste of precious time that you can never take another chance at. 

After a few minutes of discussing our feelings and deepest thoughts on time, the subject shifted to space and the concept of infinite space. We delved deeper into our thoughts and feelings as the night went on. I left with a sense of oneness with myself and kept it till I laid my head on my pillow.

So it was 22nd june 2017,

Me and my friends were on a vacation in India. It was 10:00 pm me and my friends were taking long exposure shots of the night sky.

Few minutes later my friends went back to their cottages but I was standing there in the dark experimenting with my dslr.
I took long exposure shot of myself and when I saw the picture there was a white shadow that could be seen at the far end.

12:00am
‌We were back in our cottages,  and we were yet to try our first ever hash brownie.  We opened the foil,  ate some of it,it was terrible. Then we went back to sleep

3:00am
I woke up,  I was scared as shit!  Everything around me started revolving 360 degrees.  I shouted, I asked help. Everything started to repeat itself.  I woke up again.. I shouted and asked for help.. Then again. My friends got scared, the hash didn't hit anybody else but me.

I couldnt control my words.. I told my friends how I felt but again those same words kept coming out of my mouth asking for help.

Few minutes later a new thing happened,  I knew what's gonna happen 5 seconds after.. This was really irritating.. Anything my friends told me,  I knew it before.  The works around me moved in slow motion..my hand movdments became smooth and fluid. 
I coudn't move from my bed.

The second thing happened was I felt a new spirit inside me.  I think she was an old lady.. My hands,  shoulder started to shake really fast,  my throat got dry, I asked for water but when I drank it,  it didnt felt like I drank something,  it felt the other soul drank it.

My eyes were pushed inside,  I could see the world from the inside, I saw symbols.. Those symbols had meanings. These symbols came from my deep unconscious mind. I've seen them before at my early age.

1 hour passed, my other friends got a bit sick and started puking but no one had a bad trip like me.. The effect of hash got a bit low but I still felt the soul inside me.. She wanted to stay and have rest.

I remember telling my friends the soul is not going completely.. I hope it'll be over soon, you guys dont worry! 
They made me sleep,  I woke up at 5:00 am,  the spirit gone,  I was feeling a bit week but a bit happy that it was all over.

Last night I had the most amazing marijuana high of my life so far.  It was unbelievable.  I've been smoking pot quite regularly (daily, often multiple times daily) for about 4 months, and had not as regularly smoked for about a year.  So last night 2 of my friends and I smoked up at about 10, 2 bowls and then 10 minutes later another 3 and I was quite high.  At about midnight I went to bed and decided to smoke up first.  So I smoked about 3 bowls to myself and got into bed.  And it was incredible, I just lay in my bed listening to music and felt my whole body numb and tingling, the music reverberated in different parts of my body and I had waves of sheer euphoria.  It was reminiscent of MDMA in that way, I almost felt like I was rolling.  At one point as I lay there focusing on my intense body buzz I got really frightened because at this point my teeth and entire jaw felt paralyzed with this intense tingling - it felt amazing and I just talked myself down and into how unbelievable I was feeling and how awesome this was.  I don't know how long I lay there until I fell asleep (and dreamed the most vivid crazy dreams) but it was absolutely wonderful.

My first time smoking pot was out of a small glass pipe, which was rather psychidelic-looking. I was with a group of trusted friends, four of us in all, and they had all had smoked before. I was incredibly nervous. It was like the first day of school in some ways.

After all of the weed was gone, (I didn't cough that much!) and we were all well baked, we started listening to music (it's clichè.. but Phish is cool) and talking about everything. I had the most intellectual conversations while stoned. And, even though we were in serious thoughts and philosophies, we could laugh about it. We were talking about religion and its effects on today's soceities, the laws on marijuana, and why people can be so vain to look to outside beauty instead of who people are on the inside.

Of course, we laughed so hard that we all had tears in our eyes, but the overall mood was extremely mellow and peaceful. I never once had the 'munchies', but I was extremely thirsty. But, I had never felt so at ease. And, while high, I learned that I was just like the people I was against... the people that judged by the outside and didn't care what the inside was about. So, I decided to change it. And I have. I learned that we're all one, we are all equal, and violence and war only causes more problems. I saw the world from a completely differend point of view. I was no longer interested in what people thought of me, I was interested in standing up and having a voice.

Marijuana has done great things for me, even though my usage is very low. (Once every 2-3 months.)

My brother and I had gone over to one of his friends house to hang out and check out his plants that he was growing. After a while he asked if we wanted to test some of it out, my brother declined and I said OK. Now I had been smoking pretty much all summer and had a lofty tolerance. After we smoked a bowl of it I was feeling great, my face was tingling and felt very light. About 10min past and I was suddenly overwhelmed by a surge of panic, like being on a roller coaster right before you drop. I was unnaturally frightened by this feeling and started to see grey diamond shaped patterns appear in my peripheral vision. This might have truly been the most inconceivable pot I have ever smoked, Ive never tripped so hard off of just one bowl. I had sat there for what felt like hours dreading every thought and picture that popped into my head. By the time we left it was dark out and I was aware of this disgusting feeling having arrived there with the sun still out and not noticing the transitional change of the day. We then drove to a restaurant I also began to think about my life and how it was going to end, about how there are an endless number of different possibilities. Then I began to think about size and distance, the universe and what not. This is all very hard for me to put into words for you all reading to understand. This experience, one could say was a spiritual awaking for me. It was one of the things a person only gets to feel once, such a genuine and rare feeling one truly wouldnt be able to remember how it really felt even though oneself was there.

I had been smoking for about a year, but have never had an experience like this.  I was hiking alone in the woods when I came across a tree growing out over a stream, a perfect place to take a rest.  I sat down on the tree and began packing a hitter.  By the time I finished my third hitter, I lay back and began watching the leaves of the many small maple saplings that were surounding me.  As I slowly unfocused my eyes I started to see not just the movements of the leaves but also the movements of the air around the leaves, in fact my surroundings took on a 'wavy' appearance.  I sat back up and changed my perspective by changing the side of the tree I sat on.  I watched the stream for a while and began to concentrate on the sound it was making.  After a little bit I began hearing a sort of whispering sound, almost like formed words but just past the recognizable.  Shortly after that occurance I decided to continue my hike up the hill to a more familiar part of the woods.

Type of experience: Mystical/Retrospective

About me: I am 22 years of age, consumed till now cannabis (monthly), DXM (thrice), tobacco (a pack / two days), alcohol (occasionally  but on these occasions 500ml+). No medical history whatsoever. Psychology and arts student. Reports of pure cannabis use, show up in the Erowid archives  but I didnt read any that describe the profundity of my experience.

We were three friends gathered in a college dorm room: TS, BD (the room was his), myself. We weighted out half a gram of high quality bud and rolled it into a joint. We all were recreational users of weed, smoking every second week or so.

All of our girlfriends were out of town so we decided to do something for which we rarely have occasion  have some quality time together, only us. This influenced the set and setting profoundly, in a positive sense: the inner glow of freedom and security and the outer social bond that felt almost like tying together a family. This practically made the difference between a horrible and a spiritual story.

The joint was lit and smoked. The onset was in 2-3 minutes but very subtle  we thought we were in reality and nothing really happened but it was not so. BD came up with the idea of playing a video game. We havent played a computer game in quite a while, since we got in college we didnt really have time for games. The choice landed upon Jericho, a game inspired by a Clive Barker novel. A horror game.

The game was launched and we watched the intro (you can find it on youtube). The intro was vast, 10 minutes or more and started out as a black screen with some abstract shapes resembling fire. The voice-over was made by a bad actor but it seemed to us that it was the voice of a prophet we are hearing. He talked about the Firstborn: Gods first, failed, creation, locked away in a reality inside of our own. The story is incredibly complex and under the influence of cannabis you can imagine that it built up an entire world around us.

This world was incredibly menacing  I literally felt that our world was a world in which the Firstborn is present and nobody knows about him besides us. It was sickening. By the end of the story the abstract shapes have grown into muscles and tendons, covered by a swarm of flies. But this was only the beginning.

The intro was followed by an in-game cinematic showing an intervention team entering a tomb in Al-Khali, the middle of desert. A location which was fought for by many great leaders but forgotten in our days. They discovered corpses dripping of blood in that place, still fresh, although they were the first to enter there in more than a decade (if not a century). They acted very soldier-like, spreading out and investigating the perimeter like it was the most unsurprising occurrence ever. Then they were attacked from all sides and met their horrifying end. After this followed a weird dream sequence came up and you are shown getting a phone call (in the middle of the night) and going to the airport.

You, in a helicopter, going to the same tomb where the previous team died, but knowing nothing of what happened to them. This was the moment that all clicked together and all three of us got a very very powerful feeling of pressure: if we dont do everything by the book, the world will perish. We felt like the heroes might have felt in the time when Gods existed (think antique Greece). Incredible force and incredible risk: the fragility of life directly proportional to the power wielded. Power and visibility of God but with the mortal life force of a human.

At this moment I knew that this was one of the most profound experiences in my life. The highest point of my spiritual existence. It was so overwhelming that I left for the bathroom, took a pee, washed my face with cold water and looked in the mirror for about a minute. All, trying to snap out of it for a few seconds, just to see if reality is still there. But I still was in that universe, even in the bathroom, knowing that the Firstborn was there somewhere and we hold ALL responsibility for the future of the world. It was not the first time I got a psychotic episode on weed but it was the first time I could not stop it. So I relaxed, accepted this world and I didnt regret my decision.

We barely talked between us, but from small fragments of conversation we understood that we were all in the same trip. Our personalities showed through the veil of dropped words: I was anxious and delighted (i.e. be careful! be careful! do you know what means if we die?), BD was joking but the jokes adhered to the coherence of the story (i.e. we are all screwed, but TS, you are almost dead! TS being the one manning the soldier), TS living a mélange of lightheadedness and despair (i.e. noooo!).

TS soon gave up the controls. He needed a break. BD took over, than me. That was when it started to fade (around 35 min. must have passed). Although I still felt the cognitive effect of the material, I was not so linked to that world, the despair has evaporated. I was more like a soldier doing his job. Maybe I succeeded entering the trip of the fighter I controlled. Also, the game became very monotonous. The level design was not shining and the story became a thin broth. Action consisted of killing an infinite number of monsters every ten steps so thoughts began drifting away and soon we all snapped out completely of the game's world...

Conclusions:

I observed many times that under the influence of THC the most reality-altering phenomenon is literary coherence. Even the most fantastic story, if told coherently, builds up a fantastic world. My opinion is that the greatest asset in a group is a good storyteller. When we lack that, but still want an engaging trip which takes you in a different reality  we can play a computer game, recite a book (Clive Barker and Lovecraft work wonders) or explore the city. I am very much against watching movies because I feel like they draw people apart instead of together. Also, I never underestimate the value of smoking alone as it is practically the only occasion during which I can reflect/create/write undisturbed.

I dont know if there exists a good game recipe to play while on marijuana. We also tried Dreamfall and we were fascinated every inch of the way through the city. Agon: The Mysterious Codex creates a solid setting too but can get frustrating. Myst seems like a good choice - I havent tried yet but I imagine that it can get frustrating. Condemned 2 might ring a whistle. Fact is that you can believe in scary things more readily, live them more thoroughly.

All in all, I consider cannabis to be a great substance for living stories (medium to large doses, 100-200mg+ high quality/pers.). 

Thank you for reading.

This was not my first experience with pot, but it certainly was the best that I have ever had. 

It was 5/21/08 and my friend S and I had the intention to hang out at her cousin H's house and possibly smoke weed and we had discussed this at school and planned it all out. As soon as it was time to go at 3:00 PM, I met her outside the classroom and we walked off to her car and left for a place to get a bite to eat and then to my place to get some shit if I had any left. We got to my house and I found that there was only a tiny roach left, so I took that, a pair of tweezers, and a lighter. Now, this was some good shit I had thought, so I didn't want to waste any. We got in the car after saying bye to my parents, and we left to go to her cousin H's house. Little did I know what was in store for me.

4:30 PM: The car pulls in at cousin H's place. I've got my weed in my pocket, along with my tweezers and lighter. Now, S had told me that H was big into weed so I didn't feel as if I should keep this from anybody or not, so I brought up the topic of pot so we all started discussing it and such. A couple minutes later, H's cell phone rings and it is supposedly her dealer that has called so S and I both looked at each other excitedly as cousin H said 'You ready for me to spend a hundred dollars? Yeah, I'll be there soon.' Cousin H got us in the car and we set out to the dealers house. 

5:00 PM: We arrive at said dealer's household with a large rust-red volkswagon bus with hippie stickers all over it, and flowers popping about here and there in the garden. S and I wait in the car while H goes in to get the weed. About 10 minutes later, H comes back and the smell of mint/skunk immediately fills my nostrils as I move up to see what she's got. Holy shit, this stuff smells so fucking good. Cousin H unwraps the magazine page and reveals the most beautiful marijuana that I had ever been blessed in my entire life to see. Absolutely fucking beautiful weed;  some real top notch stuff. S and I smile at H as she wraps it back up and we set off back home.

5:30 PM: S, H, and I get back to Cousin H's place and we go to the side yard where the table and chairs are. H talks to S about being a designated driver, what if she gets too high, what her parents will say, ect.. while I get out my little roach and tweezers and light it up. I take about 1 puff off it and it's already much too small for me to smoke anymore so I just put it in my pocket for me to unwrap and roll in another joint later. Well, S puts some eye drops in so I figure I should do the same and we're both smiling really big at each other as we do this. Cousin H goes back in the house to roll a joint, and as she comes out I was greeted with the most amazing looking hooter I had ever seen in my life! H lights it and takes a few puffs and then hands it to me, seeing as my parents know I smoke weed and are fine with it. I take 2 pretty good hits off it and wait a minute, and them a couple more and give it back to H and thank her graciously for being able to smoke that wonderful smelling, looking, tasting, joint. 

5:35 PM: I cannot feel a thing, and I wonder what is up with the weed. I know it's great stuff, so I lay back and figure that it's just a creeper. 

5:40 PM: I REALLY feel it now! S didn't want to get high, but shit I think I'm high for the both of us at this point. Cousin H looks pretty fried too, but she can act perfectly straight if need be. I need to learn that talent.. 

5:45 PM: I break into the chip bag, and Cousin H and I tore that bitch up, haha. 

5:49 PM: Yes, I'm looking at my watch and writing the times and everything that's gone on. I feel really messed up, and I start to explain how I feel to Cousin H. She looks at S and says 'oh dear god what have we done!' with a huge laugh at the end. I get on the trampoline and jump as high as I possibly can and I jump way above the netting. I feel as if I close my eyes, I'd be teleported away into outer space I'd be up so high. No, I'd be so high that God himself would put his hand to his forehead and gaze up into the sky and watch me fly up, up and away! Nobody and nothing could bring me down now, absolutely nothing. My skull is unscrewed like a bottle cap and my soul is wisping out and away with the wind from the center of my head. I feel completely dissasociated from my body and I touch things to see if they are real. All of my emotions, feelings, memories, hopes, and dreams are being poured out of my skull, and I feel as if everyone else can sense them as well. I feel very united, I feel perfect. I jump higher and higher, not even God with a telescope could possibly see me. I jump higher, and I hit my head on the ceiling of space and flutter back down, laughing. I feel a full body orgasm and every cell in my body is screaming with the most amazing pleasure it's ever felt. It's good to be human and I love life and everything in it. Well, everything but sadness, but that doesn't exist now. No, not now it doesn't.

6:00 PM: There are a lot of people here and I am tired so I sit back at the table where everyone is congrigated. S suggests that we leave because I'm acting really weird, so we do. I wanted to be with the people and possibly tell them how good I feel so that they can feel the same pleasure, but I didn't have the chance to. Oh well.

6:10 PM: We arrive at Taco Bell. I order a bean burrito and she doesn't order a damn thing because she isn't high. I tell you what, that bean burrito tasted like heaven.

6:15 PM: We go to the gas station to get gas, and I run in and get 3 packs of gummy candies to eat. I think the lady at the cash register could tell I was fried off my ass, but I didn't care. We get back in the car and I tear open the packages and get to eating.

6:30 PM: The car is driving at an incredible speed as we go up this mountain, I can fly! I throw octopus gummies on the window of the car and laugh my ass off with S. 

6:35 PM: We get to the top of the mountain and I take pictures of it. I want to jump off this mountain and fly so damn badly. I have the most amazing wings, and they say 'PEACE, HOPE, and LOVE.' and I can do anything I set my mind to;  I want to fly. 

6:40 PM: Apparently that didn't work to well, because S had to shove me back in the car because I really wanted to jump off. Oh well. We set off to drive around town and just chill. I can feel the peak of the high barely wearing off, but it is still ten times or more powerful than any shit I've ever had.

7:00 PM: I arrive home, I don't know how, but I'm here. My parents are sitting on the couch and I'm trying as hard as I can to look sober because I've got to get a job interview done soon. I can't worry about that now, so I go up to my bedroom and just listen to music. I find that everything sounds a lot better than they usually do, and stuff is a whole lot cooler to watch. I could do this every day all day..

7:30 PM: I'm completely knocked out cold at the point, because I laid down and the cozyness of it all drifted me off to sleep. I dreamt of candy, flowing everywhere, spinning in circles, dancing across my field of vision;  melting, twirling, dancing, like a tribe of Native Americans doing the Corn Dance. 

It really was the best experience on pot that I have ever had. Since then my stuff hasn't felt as good since, haha. Have fun out there!

Severe Psychedelic Cannabis Experience

I assume it is a somewhat infrequent occurrence to have such a severe, psychedelic-esque trip report to be reported just from Cannabis use, but this is what happened. 

Background of the Story: This was less than a week after I got a somewhat bad concussion, though the symptoms of it were strange and it was hard to pinpoint the status of my head. My tolerance to weed has always been very low, but because of my recent concussion, this experience was something unrivalled in intensity, and the effects it induced are not at all representative of what one thinks of when they think of a Marijuana experience. 

Story: I decided I would invite my friend over, just to get some company to feel more occupied and less bored. When he arrived, we started smoking some weed out of a bong. The strain was Maui Wowie, a strong sativa, and the batch I had smoked was of fine quality. I was loaded a fat bowl out of the bong, and smoked it in two big rips. 

Some incredible effects immediately began to become present. I remember after I smoked it, I was trying to play a video game I enjoyed on the computer, but I noticed I was becoming too sensually agitated and went to sit down in the bathroom. I remember covering my hand, and was starting to shake. The weed had hit me too hard, it was starting to become a very unpleasant experience. I placed my hands on my face, I remember being incredibly high, telling my friend that I had to go to bed, and then went upstairs and lay down. 

This is when the trip really escalated. I was sitting in bed, my mind was becoming delusionally paranoid, I was fearing my parents might walk in and see me in this state. I felt my heart rate was probably something in between 150-200 bpm, and I was worried. My body was completely shaking, I could feel the bed vibrating because of it. The probably only positive (ish) thing that happened on the trip were the hallucinations. With my eyes closed, the hallucinations were vivid and memorable. At one point, I remember seeing a green circle surrounded by darkness which had a thick diameter of some sort of ancient looking design within its diameter. The circle had distinct symbolic figures lying on points all around it, and was fulling rotating. Then, as the hallucination became more and more vivid, its reality slowly overpowering my perception, I had to open my eyes. When I did this, the darkness of my eyes closed which surrounded the circle was replaced with the darkness of the room, though I could see the rest of my room in this darkness. The hallucination continued vividly as ever. 

After this, I can say that I had open-eye hallucinations induced from only weed (there was no way it was laced, as my friends smoked it and had normal experiences). Overall, when compared to my two experiences with Mushrooms, this cannabis experience was more intense in hallucination, bodily sensation, and most ways. The divine clarity of mushrooms was not at all present, however. Although it is hard to compare substances, this weed experience (although not enjoyable) made me higher than I was on shrooms and is one I look back at in amazement.

Last week I woke up and immediately ate a fairly potent cannabis brownie thinking that it wouldn't hit by the time I got to the airport. Boy was I wrong. One hour later and I'm stoned off my ass attempting to make conversation with my mom on the way to the airport. She had to have known. I had planned on taking a second edible when I got to the airport but decided against it as the first one was already working its magic.

As soon as I got in the security line I felt a surge of paranoia. With the recent terrorist attack in Brussels I couldn't help but feel anxious at a major city airport. I could tell that the people around me were nervous as well. Nobody was looking each other in the eye and there was an air of uneasiness. I noticed the keen attention the TSA was giving to people of color. One elderly lady in a hijab was asked to pass through the metal detector three times before she was allowed to proceed. I felt guilty for being afraid. For giving in to the reaction of hate fueled ideologies.

As soon as I got through security I was able to relax a bit more. I got to my gate and watched passengers hurriedly walk among the airport corridors. Each person with their own complex lives crossing my path for a single fleeting moment in the form of a fellow traveler. I was the same to them.

The edible had taken full effect by the time the plane had taken off. As the plane got higher and higher, the tiny houses below got tinier and tinier. The arrangement of streets below began to resemble tree roots, branching off from one another as far as the eye could see. As we ascended above the clouds, they too began to take geometric form and seemed to have an almost Aztec-like architectural filter. 

Then something peculiar happened. Something that I have not experienced even in my endeavors with the classic hallucinogens. I was watching the clouds and I could see colorful light patterns begin to define themselves against the white background. As these patterns became more evident they came together to form a bird. While the features of this bird were not clearly defined, its overall shape was. For the next 5 to 10 minutes I was flying next to this light bird that seemed to be playfully flapping in the wind. I rubbed my eyes, opened and closed them, pinched myself, did everything I could to convince myself my mind was playing tricks and still the bird persisted in my visual processes. For the first time in my life, I was having a 'hallucination' that appeared to be more than just mere sensory distortion. The bird eventually stopped in the middle of my visual view and spread its wings as if to reveal all of its glory, turned around and flew away into the distance.

I don't know what to make of this experience. On one hand, my mind is playing visual tricks when presented with the blank white space that is the clouds. However, on the other hand, this seems to fall right into the category of a true mystical experience. One thing is certain, I got more than I expected out of the edible.

It was the night of the school reunion. Me and an old classmate shared about half a bottle of vodka. That of course made us a bit drunk, even if we are experienced drinkers (we are from Denmark).

But as the reunion drew to a close, we wanted to continue the party in the big city. And so we did, but not before a quick trip to 'Christiania' (the 'freetown' in Copenhagen, much like a mini-Amsterdam, I guess). There we bought two nice hashish cookies. Nothing new about that, we have been eating cookies many times. But these were not the cookies we were used to.

T-0:00

We eat em, and went into a club in Copenhagen. The club was packed with people, and a handful from the reunion too. Well, the club is not the kind of club we normally go to. This was pop, and we prefer techno.

T-0:30

Then things started to get crazy (remembering that this is 'only' hashish). Suddenly I realized that I was totally wasted! I heard all the voices clearly now. It was pretty funny, I could hear conversations across the lounge-room, just being able to ignore the rest of the noise. And looking at peoples' faces, time sort of slowed down, and I had the feeling that I had known that person for a long time, knew what he/she was like, knew where they grew up, etc. They were all unique characters in a movie. A funny thing.

Then I got more and more tunnel vision, and more and more disorientated about where I was, and what to do. People from my old school (that had been at the reunion too) came over and talked to me. But I didn't understand a word of what they were saying. Not that I couldn't clearly hear them, it just didn't make sense. When I tried to speak, jibberish came out of my mouth too. I was so confused, what had I just said?!

Well, communicating with anyone but my best friend became impossible, I had just realised. So why not move to the dancefloor? The music was pretty nice. (It wasnt. It was terrible pop music, but at the time it was really nice).

Then something strange happened. Something I have never tried with cannabis before. I got sort of a hallucination! As I was standing on the dancefloor (unable to really move my body to the music by the way), the volume of the sound seemed like it got turned down, and I could only hear the bass sound, like a heartbeat. And the colors from the dancefloor light became very sharp, almost blinding me. Then my point of view got elevated to the celling, and as it did, I saw that all the people looked like flat cardboard people. Like sprites, in two dimensions, in a three dimensional room.

Then I got sort of scared, that was not supposed to happen! I said to my friend I wanted to leave now, course this was not what I wanted. And then we left the club.
I'm sure people thought I was on acid or something, I was talking jibberish about the cardboard people at the dancefloor.

T-0:50

We got outside, and went to get something to eat at the fast food place. Ordering was very hard, and confusing too. And eating the burgers was a slow process. I don't remember much of this myself, but I was told it took me around 15 minutes to eat a burger.

T-1:30

Then we took a taxi home. And I remember the street we drove down was almost infinitely long. Also pretty strange. My friend got dropped off at his house, and then there was a 5-10 minute drive to my place. Then I started getting a little worried that the driver was going to cheat me, or drive me to some remote location and drop me off. But he didnt an I somehow got home!

T-2:00

Fell asleep and woke up confused and disorientated a few time the next few hours.

To sum it up. I was very surprised by how fast and powerful the cookies worked on me. And very surprise to almost see a halo! But it was a very fun 'trip'... I must have had a stupid smile on my face all the time.

My best friend didnt get wasted that quickly. He got wasted when he came home, two hours after. Still very powerful, but not as heavy as I.

I think they might have been a little nice in mixing the cookies that day :)

This is a report of my first time smoking alone on a school night. I haven't experimented with many drugs before, just weed and pharms, having had a very good time doing them on all occasions.

8:00-I sneak downstairs to avoid the watchful eye of my parents and begin to pack a bowl with some good quality weed that has brought me some very good times in the past. After I've finished I watch some T.V. and wait until my parents go to sleep.

11:00-My parents have finally gone to sleep and I hurry downstairs to grab my homemade bong. I sneak out the back door, onto my porch, and into my backyard, but it is extremely windy outside, so I decide to return onto my screened-in porch.

11:05-I finish smoking and return to my house. I notice that the wind outside seems more harsh and it freaks me out a little. Inside, I notice haloish affects around lights and my hearing is dulled.

11:45-After watching some flash videos, very hilarious, I decide to go and take a shower to remove the smell and so that I wont have to do it in the morning.

11:55-The warm shower water makes my skin feel incredibly tingly and I feel very relaxed. While standing there, I have an epitome. I realize that this shower water is composed of thousands of little droplets, just like people in a society, and that these droplets are separated and become individuals when they are shot out of the shower head, just like being born. I also realize that their existence is short, just as ours is, and that they all rejoin each other at the drain, just as we all end up in the same position: dead.

12:10-I finish my shower and go to bed. I quickly fall asleep and dream of myself traveling through the world as a droplet of water.

I wake up the next morning, still remembering my experience. I feel as if I must try harder to make my existence worthwhile because I know that my time on this earth is short and if I don't do anything about it, I'll end up in that drain having wasted my time.

'Sunday, March 22 - 2009'
so i haven't lit since 
election night
=========================================
I was baptized under the showerhead
I was sewn upon the ground

there is not one moment with you that i do not receive
some intimate information about my nature or what my body is requesting
the in in in in's are beginning to shuffle mmm wmmm mm

it is god's garden,
it's the angel's hedgerows

it spurs me with dense rushes telling me to stay from technology
this time I'll break it
it shows me my placement from all surrounding angles
=====================================================
it gives me a new eye for the natural world
like a dead man usurping an infant's face to view a field once again
it is lifting oneself out of Hades in order to vview the bluue pink and yellow once morre
the smile carries it out
and Mephistopheles or whoever pulls you back in again
-=================--=================----
it disarms and de-panels the ideal
like blown solar plates
it is the satellite of the world
you'll stay in the dark room and still hear the static telepathy
you'll still feel the hot sun like it's being sent back in on a discus of light
--------------------------------====
it inspires capitulation
it is a one-word judgment without malice,
 just peeeeeeling the answers back
 like a sticker's back
it is understanding all
-----===========================
it is turning my body to thousands of leaves twistling down and off a tree's bark
it is becoming the leaf-pile and being blown into liquid propeller leaves
it is all of fall's colours surrounded with deep lush greens
it is the palm frond cocoon
set at perfect temperature
it is 'WHAT IS IT THAT REALLY MATTERS?' in Hollywood's best god voice
and recognizing that is a new sensation in the skin

----------------------------===
-------my whole
 system is ------------===
reporting--------------------------------==
----------------------==
-----===
----------------==

it is nature's last defense against the unnatural
it's the ghost in the highway
it is the manual (instructions)
shifting to manual (setting)

it is the ever-reclining race car
the roller-coaster network of neurons
it is the limb-loggering high-jump

it is a warm vat for the satyr
it is the lei garland necklace that you get off the plane in Hawaii

it is the ecstatic, imperfect mess
spliced frames
unsequenced until you can cut-and-paste the moments and truly live them
not reading the instructions to the nerves and cells

all in-between thoughts have been banished for the constant flourish
it is a tactile heaven gym-court
know that you don't
have to live five seconds in the future of each fragment

it is all the drapery being shook and thrown off and down the street
IT IS THE FIRE WITH THE FINGER SNAP.
it is placing your mind in the CD tray ----and ACTUALLY GETTING TO LISTEN.-----
----------------------------------------------------------------------------============
===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------========
realizing there are more channels devoted to you than you can ever flip the cards on

it is that touch-and-go foreign language you keep threatening to invent
it's getting a brand new bellows to breathe with
stomping down stairs by the stained glass 
up by the church organ
and it's knowing EXACTLY how to play that church organ
 and getting to play it your way at 7am for a well-lit church congregation
taking the top down off of the cathedral
then being seated at a plate
 of sunny side up eggs afterward
all yellow and white
just like me 
because I'm pure
AM I? mostly

it is knowing the music-tracks on every incense stick 
and smiling knowingly to your friend
when you come across it in your record collection
it means getting to share that laugh, 
knowing you're both in two completely different places
 grabbing hands over great distances

it is a profound thought
 being served to you every day at the same time
in your cranberry purple, yellow-covered reform school
it is every noon a school class trip
to some fond, vague, Austrian meadowland
you'll be seated upfront
with your pupils pushed back

leaping at lilies like cheap puppets
'SHOWING THE DOG HIS OWN FACE'

it is the wood of the cabin and
THE TORSION OF THE SLUG HEADING DOWN THE STEEL
with no salt around
------------=====================---------------
all blue green now
its the cut leather swaying on native clothing
the gentle breeze
--------------============--------------
it is the nerve-ending dance which no composer has written for yet
no one has tried
then you realize nothing decent has been done yet
  BUT IIT WIILLL!

it is getting to swim in the crystal lake with its light-red-yellow-blue divers and
gemmed stalactites

it is the whole wealth of personalities known
at your fondest perusal
it is 'REMEMBER THAT BEAUTIFUL FACE THAT YOU NEVER LOVED?'
it is falling on your back on your seat letting nerves charge
electrified in jolts
it is letting things fly at full mast
it is getting the soul's autograph and going home on the bus of life happy
it is foot-peddling the ceiling like an infant
rolling-ovrrr like a bohemian jaguar right after a rest in the jungle's core

is it sparking all the kindling on the smile
it is fine ways of transmitting insights into humanity

it's moving like you can breathe underwater

IT IS THE FROSTY BOB-SLED RUN OUT
                  into the verdant valley
it is more fun than you can record
far better than any mass experience

===============================================--------=============----------
--------------=================---------------==============--------------=========
it is always telling you to leap to your feet
fall back into a pillow if you want to have a downtime

you'll find it's also all the stripes on the pillow come off on your back
it is all those psychedelic viewfinders from childhood
slights of the optics

thrills from those magic eye posters
with the hidden image that none of the teachers could see
or a magic mirror which reflects us all

it is the third-eye chromatrope
it is visionary company
============================================--------==================

it is the prismatic train taking looonnnng leeeaaaps off the track
taking higher strides each time

it is anything that prevents your father from talking
it is the FF>> wedding to post-ritual speech
it is leaping on the plush chair savage-like
and throwing a leg over it carelessly like an angel on a tuft of cloud
it is stretching your legs and doing chores that would've bored you
exercises that can't begin to exert you
art that spindles out of you in a daze
part of the nameless, but 
un-ashed hours
========================================
----------------------------------------
it is nothing like its been made out to be
you should be ashamed of calling it anything but what it is
it's bedfeathers without concerns,
it is a re-connector...

Strange experience 

Went down the road for a couple of drinks (flatmates friends birthday), night started off normal, listening to music etc. Awhile later there were some deserts passed around, truffles and brownies but these contained cannabis.  Just had 1 of each, why not, no commitments at the time Having a good time going up and down stairs (others up there) while coming down the stairs spotted (for the first time) the occupants large ornament of Buddha in some stone colored blue, interestingly placed as you walk down, wow I thought that was cool.  Felt quite high from the sweets, as only had 2 drinks, and started to feel it more and more with racing heart and jelly legs! Thought it was time to head home, just down the road Opened the door, something didnt feel quite right, went to my room, 1 cat was on bed that woke up, meowing and kept meowing wouldnt stop, thought there was something seriously wrong with him, this accelerated the high more, then felt like someone or something was in the house, so checked round, of coarse nothing physical, but something wasnt right and both cats acting strange (mind you-they missing 1 owner who was away).  To the lounge, sat down to try relax because it was intense and heart race, while trying to relax/meditate/breathing  felt powerful forces, spiritual energy pulsing through my body, especially focused on hands, knees, spine, head. Like electricity race up the spine to the head and out the top (no real closed eye visuals except pulsing light).   

While this was happening 1 thing that crossed my mind was a crystal relation? and also that Buddha a saw earlier This part sitting down wasnt scary (like the cats) but intense, felt like it was more than something that just the plant set off.  Wow.  As far as the cats go, when arriving home earlier I thought they where trying to tell me of a spirit in the house, but reflecting on it a day or 2 later, I have a feeling spirit inside cat? and not able to look at the cats eyes since without unease dont like cats as much now (feel like they are stealing good energy).  

Didnt get much sleep that morning but when I woke up I felt like I had some sort of awakening! Only sort of similar to 1 or 2 other times in my life - (A SIMILAR HIGH/GOING UP THE SPINE -AFTER JUST SMOKING 1 BUCKET),, (IN SOME WAYS MORE INTENSE THAN SOME OF MY MESC/CACTUS TRIP BUT WITHOUT THE VISUALS).  Had to write it down.

The following story is completely true, not a bit stretching the truth.

Last night I went to a club in SOMA San Francisco. I watched a few sets from the band, and after finishing my Hefeweizen I to outside to bum a cigarette. A woman with curly black hair offers me a joint. I smoke one fair toke, cough a bit, but not too much. After that I was pretty much gone. 

The bouncers from the club tell us, You cant have that on the premises, then one of them says, Cant you read the sign, says no-meth zone.' Or something like that. We stumble down the street. I could not comprehend what she had meant. I ask the woman I am with, Nivette, and she says, I think she is being sarcastic. I still dont understand. Its just pot I say. Nivette responds, yeah my family accepts this as a normal thing. I was too naïve to ask if there was anything else in the joint. Or actually, I was just stupid to accept a joint from a strange woman. From what I read afterwards about experiences on meth, I think the joint was laced with PCP or something.

I started to talk to Nivette about this guy Ezra I had been dating for about a month. He had just broken up with me that day because he is Jewish and I am not. It was something that bothered me and I did not understand it. I hoped that by telling people I could get some insight. Nivette says she is attracted to Jewish men, she says she is Babylonian which she says goes way back before the Jews. Then I think it would be a good idea for Nivette to talk to Ezra. I call him, its about 11pm at this point, and Nivette immediately reprimands him, Why are you breaking up with this woman, just because she is not Jewish? She is a princess! 

Next thing I know Nivette and I are kissing against a chain link fence. My phone still open as Ezra listens to me kissing and breathing, Ohh this is soo nice. Nivette brings me up against a small tree or parking meter, I slide down it as she feels me up. People are walking down the sidewalk, couples hand in hand, amazed to find two women making out on the ground. Her hands moving over my smooth dress, my breasts, between my legs. Then I look up at peoples stares of amazement, and realize what is happening, Whoah, what is going on. I get up and walk down the street with the lighter, ¼ of a joint and my phone still open. 

I hear some good rap music coming from a taqueria across the street. I jaywalk across the 5-lane road. I start moving to the beats as I walk up to the window. I determine the man making burritos is amazingly cute and I tell him he is gorgeous, he smiles. I walk up to a guy eating at a table outside, and have a strange conversation. Then I realize I am freezing and I go up to a group of people stepping into a van. I feel the warmth from inside the car and I ask where they are going. I end up telling them to all ride bikes and I slide the van door shut.

I walk back across the street and this guy with a blue mowhawk steps out of a cab. I go up to him and smooth his hair up between my two hands and exclaim, That is awesome, I love it! He laughs as he walks away. I continue to go up to strangers talking gibberish. I felt like I was dreaming! Really I was like, wow, when am I going to wake up. 

At this point I was cold and wanted back in the club. I go up to the bouncers and they say, You are too intoxicated to enter. I say in disbelief, Wow, what is going on here? This has never happened to me, I have my ticket right here, see my stamp? I hold out my hand. We dont care. Then he takes a black marker and draws two large Xs on the tops of my hands. I try to enter anyway and two men PUSH me back out. 

I leave, amazed this is happening. Now I feel like I am in a nightmare. I walk up to a homeless man and buy his newspaper, then start to cry, telling people, This man is homeless! I was so cold, the wind ripping between the buildings and this homeless man just standing out there. He responds sadly, I am just trying to make enough money to get a place to stay.

I felt so far away from my home, like I would never get back. I go back to the club and walk in thinking I can pretend they wont notice me, but they push me out again. Some people come out of the club and I go up to a couple, drawn by the beauty of the guy. I tell him he is beautiful and reach to feel his hair, then I turn to his girlfriend and say, You are not good enough for him.(!) And she replies, Well, I am glad you feel that way. Wow!

I call my friend who is inside and he comes out. I say they wont let me in and they explain I am too intoxicated. I dont know what my friend is thinking at this point. Finally the show ends and my friends get a cab and we all get in. We go to their hotel, I think I even kissed my friends friend in the elevator, a woman I hardly know. I lay on their hotel bed and I wanted to make out with the two women, but they get me up and take me home in a cab. I get home and I am like, Oh my god what just happened!?

So let this be a lesson, dont accept drugs from strangers!

Well it was during the middle of summer vacation my friend paid 60 dollars for an eighth of this really good smelling marijuana from a guy that usually doesnt get the best stuff. But he claimed that this was really bomb ass dank. So we bought it expecting to get the same stuff that we usually get and to be high for about 1 hour. So I stayed at my friends house that night to smoke it and he had already been caught by his dad once so we had to be careful about how we did it. We started at about 11:00pm and we had an awesome glass pipe I had just bought from my friend with a nice size bowl packed into it already. My friend since he paid for it got the first hit. After it got passed to me about 10 times I was done and ready to trip out. We had smoked in all about 2 bowls and then couldn't even inhale smoke anymore so we were forced to quit.

After that I don't really know what happened we listened to a mix of songs I had made especially to make u trip out. There was lots of techno and weird stuff like English guys singing. Then we got to the techno song called Marijuana In Your Brain this is when all the weird shit started happening. My spine felt like it was moving up and down through my back making it tingle, my head felt like it was flying off of my body into heaven, and my feet stayed on the ground which sort of scared me because I'm afraid of heights and looking down from the clouds was pretty high up, and I could see myself going through the ground all the way to the core of the earth. It was the craziest thing I have ever felt.

Then we realized that we had a huka party poster that reacted to a black light that we haven't even looked at yet. So we turned on my blacklight and I looked at the poster and listened to the music again. I was laying on my friends floor staring at the poster when all of the sudden there were 4 mushrooms in the corner that started moving in a circle, and all of the sudden I was sitting in this park and all these kids were yelling and I couldn't figure out what was going on. But luckily then I realized I didnt like this and it was the song doing this to me so I jumped up and switched the song.

Then I laid back down on the floor looked up and closed my eyes. When I opened them it was morning but I was still feeling a little high so I got up and then decided we were going to go out for breakfast so we smoked another bowl and went for breakfast at the same place we work. That was a mistake because when we came back the high was pretty much done ,it had been about 3 hours and his dad had came home early, he ran into my friends room after us and opened my friends dresser and pulled out all of our weed, pipe, and a methadone pill we had just got. My friend was grounded for month and his dad never told my parents. My friend that I had got the pipe from was pretty mad because he had smoked about 4000 times out of it and now it was gone. I now have quit because this whole time I have been getting piss tested by my parents and if I fail another one I have to go to rehab.

This experience was a few years ago so i cannot remember all the details, insted of inputting every detail I will get streight to the point.

While on the computer on a sunny day a friend (We will call him Danny ) contacted me on MSN and told me that his parents and family had gone away for the weekend and asked me if I wanted to stay over. I was good mates with another friend of his that lived near him that I had spoked to on the internet we will call him Luke. As I'd been wanting to meet Luke face to face for a while we always plannned to get together and have a smoke-up. I was most delighted and at about 5pm I got down to his village met up with Luke and went to his dealers. We only had £10 and so this could of scored us an 8th but the guy only had 2 teenths so we baught them. We eventualy met up with Danny. He was with his cousin and his cousins mate, I didnt mind them comming as im a generous smoker and dont mind sharing my shit.

Eventually the smoking started in Dannys backgarden. We took it kinda easy to start with rolling big joints with about 10 minute gaps inbetween rolling again. We was all having a good time laughing, joking and telling stories. The time was about 8pm and after the 5th joint I felt a bit giddy but it felt like my laughter was fake and I slowly fell into depression. Ive experienced and know others have experienced feeling down from smoking cannabis before but this time it was more of a strong feeling. 


While in this state I kept quiet and kept on smoking while observing the conversation going on by the others. I was occasionally asked by them every so often if i was alright, I gave them a nod and replied that I was fine. I was layed down and the depressive state kept creeping up on me. By this time I was very intoxicated and eventually my vision was consumed with bright moving patterns. I began thinking about my life, friends, family and my future, but that was making me more depresssed as I didnt have a clue what I was going to do with myself after College. I began thinking how i was percived by  people that knew me. Then It hit like a ton of bricks, I understood how i was percived. I could see myself reconstructing was i was like around people like my friends for example, was I some sort of Geek or some annoying moron that other people look down on? could this be the reason why I dont always remain friends with people? because I cramp there style? Was this me? Millions of these thoughs rushed around my head while each one was reanacted in my mind. Everybody else at this time was chilled out with only a two way conversation going on. I asked everybody else if they was mashed (Mashed meaning very stoned/intoxicated) they and they agreed. 

A good few hours after I was coming down to earth and Felt much better. I was in denial about the thoughs I encounted that night for a while and eventaully I came to terms with them. All of it was true. Back then I admit I was kind of annoying, lacked communication skills, and made people feel uncool while I was around them. 

Now-a-days I am more sociable, have better communication skills and Have more friends. Maybe cannabis helped me see this properly and helped me see the door to improving my life and life style.

Thanks for reading my Experience

My experience occured about a year and a half ago, when I was 14 and heavily into drinking and smoking marijuana. . .I was in the middle of a football camp week, and that night I had a few friends over. We were basically bored, until one of my other friends called my up and asked if I wanted to go smoke some weed, and threw out there that he had some dust, so I happily agreed. We walked our asses about a mile to some bridge in the woods next to a lake.

Well anyway, he busts out this shitty ass wooden bowl and we throw all that stuff in there and smoke it. We then stand up and about 5-10 minutes later we're really feeling it, my friend sayss, 'dude, just pretend we're sitting in some big ass reclining chairs watching TV' so I did it. . .it was soooo comfy and real feeling. My other friends(who were sober) said we sat in the most uncomfertable looking positions for about 20 minutes.

After that we journied off the bridge into a trail in the woods, my friend starts doing to siccest impression of the Corcodile Hunter, he was like, 'look over there! it's a three-toed sloth with Goneria' and I get down on all fours and start doing all the habbits he is saying it does. . .including sexing my friends mother and walking extremely slowly(later my friends told me i was crawling through glass not even phasing me).

We continued down the trail until we looked out onto the lake and saw some floating lily pads. . .or so we thought. We kept focusing on these things until we got closer, and they started moving! This was all in the dark so me and my friend start bugging out thinking it was a submarine coming up from the depths. . .THEN! we instantly found ourselves in the middle of the Vietnam War for some reason, shooting 'charlies'.

Later down the trail we hit some LONG grass which was really bugging us because it felt like bugs on our legs, but my friend says, 'man, we cant feel this, our legs are covered in foam'. . .and that instant the irritation dispeared, it was great. A few feet more and we found ourselves in one of those old Mario games for nintendo, picturing it seemed so real, like I was really in it. . .

Well, the last funny thing to happen was I closed my eyes while we were walking and I could still picture the suroundings as if my eyes were open, but it was changing colors like crazy. . .until, SLAM! I walked right into the raised bridge. . .5 minutes later I noticed I had a huge gash on my arm, and continued to go off on my friend for about 5 more minutes about how they should have told me the bridge was there.

Man that was great. . .I haven't done it since, but I probably soon will.

[Erowid Note: 
Some authors report suspicions that their cannabis has been 'laced' (adulterated), in some cases, presumably with PCP. While this is possible, readers should be aware that idiosyncratic response to the effects of cannabis (usually higher doses) can lead some users to presume their cannabis has been 'laced'. There is no way to know if the cannabis in the report below was adulterated or not. Reports of plant material and cannabis laced with powerful synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive substances became more common starting in 2007.] 

It's fair to say I'm a stoner.  I smoke pot just about every day, spend my money on pot, and regularly go to school/work stoned, and no one really notices.  So generally, I don't get really fucked from a bowl or two.

The other day, though, I bought some shit from a buddy of mine.  It was a fat eighth, so naturally, I assumed the volume was to make up for the fact it was shitty regs.  Fuck it, I rolled a couple joints, went out, smoked a joint, got a surprising high, but straightened myself out with some music and TV, and fell out early.  

I knew this was good shit when I smelled it, but looking back, I'd gotten far more fucked than I should have from what I smoked....  Anyway, I took some bong hits with a buddy the day after, but then the next day, I went out into the woods, at a favorite spot of mine, and lit up a joint.  At this point I was waiting for someone...  After I finished, I was immediately at a regular point of high, and I still had a bowl on me, so I said fuck it, and lit up.  A couple deep hits, and I was sitting on a log with my head hung, looking at the ground.  

All of a sudden, I heard a ticking in my head... it wasn't that loud that I thought there was a giant clock or something, but I was unable to completely phase it out.    So I focussed on it, and as I foccused on the ticks, and I saw a line of pink, red, and green crossing my vision, straight across.  My vision continued to light up, and things in the ground became highlighted, images in the pine needles.  I saw a lot of A's outlined, as if I was suddenly seeing what was drawn in the pine needles.  I had a sense of profound purpose about these images, but was not altogether out of control enough to shout it out to the world.  I was fully conscious that I was high, but things that happened were just uncontrollable.... There were the usual thoughts, for me, of writing a show in my head as it goes along, and watching it in my head, laughing at the funny parts but often getting into plots too complicated and completely forgetting what I was thinking about, but there were further, physical visual hallucinations.

When someone walked their dogs past me, I was able to focus enough to keep my visuals down to a blur and some excess colors, and put my head in my lap.  Soon after asserting control over these visions, I began to feel as if I was in purgatory, still on my log bench, but as if focusing one way or the other I could enter different worlds, one progressingly further into images of the pine needles, becoming so complex as to be completely colored clowns' faces, the other the 'real' world, just me, cold, in the woods.  

I soon realized an hour or so had passed, and I was starting to come down.  I could not realize half of what had happened that I told myself to remember, because it was crazy, but my friend never showed up, and apparently I made some calls to another friend of mine flipping out...  This shit must have been laced, but hell, I don't care.

When this experience occured I had already gone through various experiments with weed, and was used to the mind altering effects. The story begins when I was hanging out with a couple of friends, hitting the bowl. We had been passing it back and forth taking deep hits of the bud, which was extremely potent. We had been smoking for a while and I had yet to feel the high set in so I kept smoking. We finished off the herb and started to walk down the street, slowly my mind oozed into a dream like state, which was considerably pleasent. 

We had reached my street and as I looked around I noticed a house that seemed to look exactly like mine except completely backwards, also the houses around it were similar to those around mine. At that moment  I could only think that I was in a universe that contradicted the one that I was in while I was sober. I told my friends my thoughts and they all seemed to agree. I then had a vision, but not a halucination about the future. In the vision we were sitting in my neighbors driveway at night rolling a joint when a cop car pulled up. At the time I thought nothing of it and proceeded rambling about my parallel universe.

 About 10 minutes later we were in my neighbors driveway and one of my friends suggested rolling a joint,it was then I remembered my vision,  told my friends that this was my vision and we had to go somewhere else, but everyone was stoned and had lost all motivation to move. I made them move and we went so someones back yard, about 5 minutes later I saw I cop car drive down the street with a spot light going really slow. It was amazing, I still dont no if it was just deja vu or the weed?

I hadn't smoked weed in well over 2 years when I decided one night to take a friend up on an offer to get high and go to the school's homecoming football game.  We acquired a dugout and a one-hitter from a friend and proceeded to smoke approximately 7 hits each.

Initially I was dissapointed that I wasn't feeling the effects at all, and began to think that maybe what we had smoked hadn't been weed at all, and that I wasn't going to feel anything that night.  On the car ride to the school, I began to feel very relaxed, and out of body, almost.  As I looked out the window nothing seemed quite real.  I decided then that I didn't want to go to the game, and instead would prefer to sit at home and study the wonderful effects I was feeling.

I noticed as I walked that my limbs seemed to be working completely under their own control.  As I walked my legs felt as if they were controlling themselves, and there seemed to be a very powerful force pulling me around.  If I would lean heavily to one side, the force would pull me back, as if I literally could not fall over, the force would not allow it.  The night was wonderful.  As I typed on the keyboard, my hands seemed to float, and perfectly coherant sentences would turn into incessant ramblings, or just random letters being mashed.  Yet they all seemed to make sense.

Since that night I have not been able to replicate that high.  I have also not been able to get my hands on anything better than shwag.  I am wondering if the weed that I smoked that night was possibly KB, but I have no clue.  All I know is that every high I have had since that night has been a let-down, and I long for the wonderful feeling that was present that evening.  I will continute to attempt to locate some high quality weed, and attempt to replicate that nights high.  If all goes well, chances are I will become a 'pothead,' but would it really be so bad?  =)

One day after a night of boredom me and mate who will be known as MW rocked up to a mates place looking for some billys. He gave us about a 20 worth of good hydro. MW chopped up and we proceeded to smoke away. We went cone for cone until the mix was over. MW said he had to get back to where he was staying and walked home. 

I stayed on the couch in my mates room and watched AUSTAR. As I sat there I thought wow he talked up this hydro a bit, I think im gonna go and get a drink. But when I tried to move I was stuck to the couch. I shut my eyes to try and focus myself and thats when the rollercoaster experience started. I felt as if I was flying along in the rollercoaster, banking up turns, flying down hills, slowing to go up slopes and I must admit I was really enjoying myself. This continued for about half an hour until I reopened my eyes. I had a cigarette after my body could move again. My mate came in from whatever he was doing  and I told him about what had just happened. 

He said that the pot did the same thing to him today. So we chopped up again and smoked another session and proceeded to ride the rollercoaster  Again. This has never happened to me on any other pot and I must admit it was the first hallucination I'd had off pot and it was a great one.

So every weekend I  smoke a bunch of weed with my friend Jordon. I have a big house, and its easy to smoke in my room when my dad falls asleep. So one weekend, I had two other friends come up and smoke, one brought about 2-3 grams of hydro, and me and Jordon had 3 grams in Indoor KB. After smoking a good 80% of all of it, I took the biggest hit of my life. The weed cought on fire, the flame was pretty big. I got the whole bowl down in one hit, and then my whole body went numb. Then things went hazy. 

The next thing i knew, I was around seven feet tall, wearing a plaid brown suit, and I had a beard and hair down to my knees. I hate on big glasses, and i was being interveiwed on CNN becaus ei had discovered fossil fuel. I was interviewed for a good hour and a half, answering a bunch of questions and drawing up graphs. My friends said that during that entire time, I was speaking in complete jibberish. I either was saying random words and numbers, or just making strange noises.

This story is actually about a friend of mine (G) who suffered from acute depression, and had a long history of depression and suicide attempts in his family. He is extremely chemically dependant, as both his parents formerly were. 

What happened is that I bought a quarter, when this stupid kid called looking for a quarter and a dime, so I sold him that quarter which was skimpy at that for thirty-five dollars. I know it is a bastard move but it is some limp-bizkit kid that walks around calling people fags. I got the thirty five bucks and then called up the dude I got the quarter from, said it was a little skimpy, and asked him to sell me a half for 35. Well, he didn't give a fuck as we are friends, and then I took the half to a party at my friend J's house. 

There were about eight of us smoking, and since I was packing for the time being, they made me smoke a bowl out of the bong to myself. Then we proceeded to smoke most of the half, and found that it is the most potent shwag/mec that I have ever smoked. I had no problem smoking a lot of it cause it was so cheap. We were all unbelievably fucked up. 

My friend G, the depression guy, got higher than any of us. He also gets depressed when really high. He went home and decided to take two bottles of tylenol, 48 pills. I woke from a deep slumber to G's roomate calling and wanting to know if G took any acid or shrooms or anything, because G was puking red and delirious. I said get him to a hospital fast, and found out about the whole incident the next day.

He spent a couple weeks in the psych ward and on the whole fucked up his life. Anyone smart would see this as a cue to stop, but the day he was out of the hospital he took to smoking cigarettes again. The first time I saw him once he was out of the hospital, he was drinking. Two days later, he was smoking pot again. He ended up having some fucked up hallucinations due to some medication he was on. He is now back to smoking tons, and I have no doubt that he will kill himself one of these days.

It somewhat started a day before the fourth of July. Raz and I had the idea to hook our computers up over at his house because his parents would be gone. Then we could play Warcraft 3 for all hours of the day. Then, the fourth of July rolled around, and I went to bed around four-thirty. The next morning I awoke around one to the sound of the vacuum. At first I became disoriented, thinking that it was Thursday, we no longer had cleaning ladies, and my mom should have been at work. I let it pass and went back to sleep.

Then, I finally rose from bed at roughly three p.m. and walked outside my room. Chaos abounded. My mom was cleaning the house for some unknown reason before it clicked that it was the fourth of July. She sees me...first thing I get instead of a 'good morning' or whichever greeting applies was, 'Weren't you supposed to do this?' I tell her I was going to clean the house tomorrow (Friday), and ask who ask coming over. She replied to me with, 'Charlie and Cynthia....your dad invited them...' I asked her why I hadn't been told this and she gave me this trip somewhere around the lines of, 'You knew damn well they were coming over...' and I laid things out for her. Simply, I did not know. I asked her several times before what her plans were, hoping they would leave the house. Everytime I got the answer, 'I don't know, nothing yet.' Apparently, she recalled differently. I gave her the usual rounaround: 'Whatever...I didn't know anything about it and I planned on cleaning tomorrow.' Then, very pissed  as I was, I went back to my room.

I got online and IMed Raz with a message that went something to the effect of, 'Let's get this bitch started.' He then told me to get my computer rounded up because he'd be there shortly. I quickly got off, unhooked it all, tossed it into my bag, and prepared to wash my face and bursh my teeth. I had not time for a shower, so I merely tossed on my hat and wore exactly what I had on the day prior. As I was getting ready I noticed all sorts of items lying around that pissed me off to all extents. Crazy fold over calendars containing biblical references and passages. Pictures that had been thrown in am obscure drawer for ages, toiletries in the bathroom that I did not know we posessed. 

I then had it in my mind, that I would never become this. Scurrying around, cleaning things, throwing up items that would hopefully give others a false impression of myself (be it one I hoped to obtain). This simply would never be me. I then had it set in my mind that if my dad told me to either clean up my room or possibly take the Grateful Dead sign from my door, I would begin a speech that would rival that of the Gettysburg Address. A monolouge so compelling it could be contained in a coming-of-age movie staring Colin Hanks or Josh Hartnett. I had it all planned out in my head, the entire scenario, it was so rivveting I actually began to hope he would request these things of me simply so I could give this performance. My mind was reeling: 'Dad...I'm not going to do such things. I'm not going to run around the house picking up every magazine and shoe so it appears that we live a way we do not. I'm not cleaning my room or taking the sign off my door. That's who I am. Most of your other friends know who I am...to varying degrees. I'm not going to hide myself in a lie that will hopefully please your co-worker and his wife. If they don't like that my room is dirty, tell them to close the door. 

Also, if I find out that you took the sign off my door, and I will be able to find out if you did...I will lose a great amount of respect for you that I doubt will ever be regained.' It was incredible. But sadly, it did not happen.

All I got was, 'Do you want steak or hamburger?' My reply to him was the news of the LAN with Razgard. He then told me to be careful if we got fireworks. I said we wouldn't get them...and then the doorbell rang. I opened it to find Razgard's smiling face ready to kick off and play some games. We loaded up and left for his house. We got there, set it all up, got a game ready to go, and then decided it was time to smoke some fat bowls. We grabbed the supplies and headed out to the backyard. Mind you it is no somewhere around 4:45 and 5:00 and I had not showered or eaten since the day previous. 

We smoked two...maybe three large bowls of hydro, and we were toast. This is the kind of high many people experience let alone with someone else. We began to walk back to his room for a rousing game of 'stoned WarCraft 3'. As we go inside I feel the cold air blast me with a nova strictly aiming for the heat arising from my body. My body is sent into a minimal form of shot. The El Nino of temperature combined with the lack of food sent a straight overkill to my brain. Instead of my stomach screaming and crying for sustance my eyes go out. It works just as that. A small pixel of black suddenly swells and amasses an army of grey and black squares that engullf my vision, very similar to a fire diffusing through an entire forest. Now, instead of seeing the home and furniture that was before me, I saw a swirling and caccophany of light greys, dark greys and blacks impairing any vision I may have once had. I was not scared though. It was somewhat entertaining and it had happened once before, so I knew the procedure. I was hot..then cold...and hungry beyond any feeling I have had before.

I debate myself for lingering seconds that tick away like hours. Then I decide. 'Dude...I'm fucking blind.' I comically exclaim. Raz is somewhat worried. I can sense it. They say that when people are blind their other senses become heightened. I can attest to this. I then tell him that it would quickly pass, because it was beginning to. 

The darkness was not as searing and it was leaving in the same form it arrived: A raging torrent collapsing upon itself. I then sat down and we began to play some WarCraft 3, stoned out our skulls. Then, as I slightly lean forward to find the nearest gold deposit, the hatred returns. My vision dies once more and I slightly turn to where Raz was at and I say, 'Dude...I need something to eat.' So, I feel my way around, looking out of what little splotches of vision that still remain and make myself to the kitchen. He points out to what they have, and I reach for the Simpson's Pop Tarts. Little did I know, I had actually grabbed a packet of popcorn. He laughs at me, as do I as I slightly read the words 'Pop-sec --' on the package. He then exclaims, 'Fuck man! Are you going to be alright?' out of pure worry after discovering the true magnatude of my condition. 

I relay the story of last summer with my brother when the hunger and heat teamed up to deliver a finishing blow to my sight. I also make sure to point out the comedy of the situation, because my brother's friend's father was there and told his so to, 'Stay away from that stuff,' that he, 'better not be doing that stuff.' We both laugh at this as we go to sit down in the living room. My vision is still greatly fucked for lack of a better word. We watched a little TV but I still noticed I was hungry. I was at approximately this moment that Razgard brings up, 'Hey...do you still want that Pop-Tart?' I, having totally forgetting about it in the thirty seconds since we last saw it exclaimed, 'Fuck yea! I forgot.' We both laughed at this for what lingered on to be five, maybe ten minutes. Then, we went to get the Pop-Tart. I asked him if I could have it toasted, as a warm, gooey Simpson Pop-Tart tasted much better to my mental senses than a cold, not cooked Pop-Tart. We put it in, and he heads back to the living room. I, awaiting for my proverbial 'knight in shining armor' lean against the counter staring down the heated death coils of the toaster, fearing for my snack's life. 

I contemplate whether or not I should save it from the metal and spring coils of death and simply eat it as it was. I then realized that it actually enjoyed being in there. The toaster was what a sauna is to us. I then smiled for him, and let a small tuft of noise pass through my lips as I nearly began to talk to it, before noticing Raz standing by the kitchen entryway, laughing at my giddyness for a Pop-Tart. Had he only known the connection we had. I was staring at him, totally oblivious to the Pop-Tart that once engrossed my every braincell, before *CHINK* the toaster exploded the toasty Pop-Tart back to it's original position, as I too exploded in a fit of fear, anger, and chaos as I did not expect the noise. My partner began to laugh at my antics, as I said, 'Fuck man...I'm going to enjoy this fucker.' I then stepped out into the garage of his home to claim a drink for myself. A Diet Lemon Coke. My meal was complete, and my blindness still intact mainly in the center of my vision. 

I could see the outer edges of my periphriel vision, and I used it to my full advantage. I then made the journey back to the living room to fulfill my stomach's every fantasy.

We turned on the TV as I ate what was the most delicios Pop-Tart in my life, complimented perfectly with diet coke, hinting slightly of Lemon. Now, being the stoners we were, we both knew very well of the odd coincedences that happen when we're stoned and watching TV. The most fucked up programming is available to us. Things that would never claim the television cables had you not been stoned. So, flipping through the channels we notice several of them, somewhat distant from each other were showing very similiar images, the kind that accompany 'breaking news' or 'top stories'. 

After we both noticed this and decided it was possibly something of importance, we searched frantically for one of the several stations carrying the images. After we had finally arrived on the scene of the news program, we slowly learned of the shooting at LAX airport. The caption read, 'Three dead in shooting incident.' Not sure what to make of it we watched, and then, as wrong as it may have been, laughed until we were very short on breath. The comment taking blame for these fits of laughter? 'We believe it was nearly a personal problem, nothing more than that, although we have contained all those that were in the airport.' I am still not sure why this was so humorous as it was, but I believe it was due to the conversation we had about Grand Theft Auto III days before. 

An incident very similiar to the one that occured in real life, happened to my friend in the game. He was running around the third island (the only island with an airport) when he found a few people walking around. He nonchalantly pulled out his shotgun, shot them both dead, and then ran for a random truck. After this had taken place I began to talk about how things of this nature would never happen in real life. One man would not randomly go somewhere, shoot two people, attract all manners of the cops, secret service, SWAT team, and any other law enforcement agency. As I was saying this, he ran into a woman who, before being shot, screamed, 'Do you have a diet soda?!' So, naturally, as everything I had mention the night before was present in this news story, I took it upon myself to yell through the house, 'Do you have a diet soda!?!' in my best woman voice. Again, we both died of laughing fits.

Deciding that this news story was not the best thing to watch, we set out in hopes of finding something far more entertaining. Not until I stumbled upon FOX that we saw what would become the most fucked up episode of Fresh Prince ever. We were in the middle of the episode, having missed the first half, but provided we were deeply invovled in the dialouge, we slightly caught on the what was happening. Apparently Will and Carlton mad a bet where Carlton goes into the hood for a while and tries to survive. To cut a very long, drawn out, insane episode short, Will goes to get Carlton out of the hood fearing for his safety. When he (Will) arrives there, Carlton is dressed up in all sorts of 'fly' gear, with a bandana over his shaved head, and some gold on. He then spouts out some of the usual gang/hip hop terminology, containing, but not limited to 'homey' 'Sup?' 'fronting' and many others I fail to forget now. This had set us both into a primitive state of shock, confusion, and humor all at once. Not sure to laugh or say 'What the fuck?' we simply did both.

Next we opted to see else became of the shooting at LAX and I continually mashed buttons on the remote, hoping to press the correct combination that would give us a news channel. I finally opted for merely typing in '4-1', '4-2', '4-3', etc... I then began to debate with myself why I did this instead of pressing the 'channel up' button. Still unsure of my actions, I continued to climb the channels in this manner. We were unable to find the correct station, although we did find some Junkyard Wars. Thankfully, we were slightly descending from out mental mindfuck of a stoning, and we were able to watch and concentrate on the show. Between laughing and watching we made many references to what a team of stoners would do had they been involved.

Provided you're unaware of the premise to the show, they take two teams of three, give them a certain challenge, then give them an expert in the field. Of course, the tiwst is that everything they use to build must come from the junkyard the provide. The challenges range from boats, to hovercrafts, to wind-powered cars, to tools of destruction. Luckily for us, the episode we were watching was the finals of the season, so they had to destroy a hundred foot concrete wall. 

Anyway, back to our jokes. Many times we told tales of how the stoner team would just weld a bong to their contraption, or simply make a scrap-heap pipe instead of what they were supposed to make. Then, Raz pointed out that on their white board for ideas and model designs, they would just have pot leaves and 4:20 scrawled all over the place. I then added that one of them would say something along the lines of, 'Dude...do you think they have anything I can eat around here?' and another one would say, 'Wait...weren't we supposed to be doing something?' Naturally, we decided it would be the best rated episode ever. Finally, the show was over, and we headed back to the room for WarCraft III. We began to play several games, each getting our asses handed to us by the insanely difficult computer opponents. We laughed and cursed and mainly blamed it on the drugs. Suddenly, things took a turn for the odd. A knock on the door could be heard, then the opening of said door. We knew very well who it was, but we weren't ready for what they had in store. We were playing and who comes through the door? 

It was damn BMF (Bad Mother Fucker) and a damned Ox. Naturally, both of their nicknames were changed to protect identities and/or possible misconceptions about their nature. One of the first things to come forth from BMFs mouth: 'Hey...you guys want some tabs?' Jesus Fuck! Why must they have dealt us these cards? Of course we wanted tabs damn it. We'd do tabs any time of the day. So, we had a short conversation, gathered up money, told the orders, and then waited. At this point that the two friends that just joined us were on Crystal Meth. So...we weren't too sure what to expect. I was debating whether or not to do the tabs that night, but after I found out that others would be and it wouldn't be me alone, I went for it. Just then, two other friends showed up, these two of the opposite sex. Sicily and Fuck-Up walked in for reasons I'm still not sure of. 

I don't think anyone knew why they came over or how they knew we were there, but nobody cared either. So, we all sat around talking before Ox claimed he wanted to take another 'bump'. We then all went to the kitchen, because to put it frankly, you don't see someone rail some Meth everyday. Everyone took their turn, sans Raz and I, he too afraid he would like it more than he should, and I...well I don't know why. Ox then told me that I could have some if I wanted, but that would be the only time he would ask. He also filled me in that no matter what he had, if I wanted some I could ask and provided he had enough, he's share. 

Ox is a really nice fucking guy. Raz and I went back to finish up our WarCraft III game, got our asses kicked, then went back to the living room. We all sat around talking some, then a few went outside to smoke while BMF and Sicily left to go get our rolls.
Previous message was not received because of error (8:24:14 PM): Your message was refused by the AOL Instant Messenger server, probably because the message was too big. Try making the message shorter and send it again.

Raz and I yet again play some WarCraft III before deciding we should just hold it off for now and get some music ready. We begin to set out our musical collection for the roll. We also picked up the room some so we wouldn't break shit. Then we headed out to the living room to watch TV and chat with those still around. Finally, BMF and Sicily finally came back with the goods. Just like one of the three wisemen, BMF sat down, opened his little baggy, and showed us the sixteen rolls he had gotten a hold of, as well as the relatively larger amount of hydro. Splitting them up into baggys and passing them out, BMF then told us that he was going to someone elses house to hang out for a bit, as was everyone else. Minutes later, Raz and I were the only ones around again, but we still had a friend on the way. About half an hour later, maybe a full hour, Grunge showed up with his girlfriend. His prime motive for the visit was to play some WarCraft III, so I got it set up for him and watched him play. Then, quickly and quietly one o'clock stopped by, and we got a phone call. The others had dropped their pills. It was now our turn. Taking a cue from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas I turned to Raz and said, 'As your attorney I advise you to follow me into the bathroom.' It was not one-oh-five, and we were going to digest our disco biscuits.

We did the deed and went back to the room to watch our friend play our game, when shortly, another person showed up. Track (I just gave her the name...she runs track, no allusion to heroin, something none of us did) stopped by to hang out with us for a little while because nothing else was going on. Soon enough BMF came back while the others stayed where they were for a while. Around this time Grunge left because his girlfriend was tired and he thought her better off sleeping at home than around a collection of people she didn't know. 

So, now it was just Raz, Track, BMF, and myself. Again, another twist comes up. Having a few extra X's left, BMF attempts to coerce Track into rolling with us. Her only real reason for not wanting to was having to work the next day at four and being tired, but BMF still tried. I even threw in a little taste of my own, simply because I like peer pressure. I know, it's twisted. But I laid off, because I only wanted to make one little comment. Soon enough I found myself back with the computers playing some excellent toys I had downloaded. Then, I began to get restless. We had our supple of straws and water, which I carried around with me most of the time because I like water. Of course, I made the mistake of setting them down several times and losing them for extended periods of time. I would walk around the house with a stride of determination, spouting off lines like, 'Where the fuck is my goddamned water!' or Jesus Fucking Heral Christ....I just want my cursed water!' Track told me to get another glass and it would be alright, but I prefer to have what I started out with. 

If i just gave up on the first one I had, what would stop me from losing a second? A third? Hell, soon enough I'd have lost all the glasses. Aside from that there was this pestering tingle in the back of my mind just wondering where this amazing hiding spot was. Soon enough I found it by the TV from when BMF and I tried to get some music going in the DVD player. Having wanted to go outside for what seemed like hours, I finally said fuck it to everything, took a leak, and went outside to smoke with BMF, notebook in my hand. I had it in my mind that I would roll and draw and/or write. I had a great cigarette and talk with BMF about just how cool I thought he was, his reciprocated comment, art, clothing, people, all the usual. Then I started to talk and draw, and he told me that he wanted to go inside for a while. I told him that I'd stay out there for some time, and that he could join me again if he wished. 

As he walked off I asked him for another cigarette incase I wanted one, and out of generosity he gave me the rest of the pack. Granted it was only three, that's still real fucking nice. He also ensured me that if I ever wanted any more that I could ask him and have as many as I liked. I'm no a big smoker, but that's just damn nice of him. So, there I was, on a trampoline, out of my mind, with a notepad and minimal light.

We did the deed and went back to the room to watch our friend play our game, when shortly, another person showed up. Track (I just gave her the name...she runs track, no allusion to heroin, something none of us did) stopped by to hang out with us for a little while because nothing else was going on. Soon enough BMF came back while the others stayed where they were for a while. Around this time Grunge left because his girlfriend was tired and he thought her better off sleeping at home than around a collection of people she didn't know. So, now it was just Raz, Track, BMF, and myself. Again, another twist comes up. Having a few extra X's left, BMF attempts to coerce Track into rolling with us. 

Her only real reason for not wanting to was having to work the next day at four and being tired, but BMF still tried. I even threw in a little taste of my own, simply because I like peer pressure. I know, it's twisted. But I laid off, because I only wanted to make one little comment. Soon enough I found myself back with the computers playing some excellent toys I had downloaded. Then, I began to get restless. We had our supple of straws and water, which I carried around with me most of the time because I like water. Of course, I made the mistake of setting them down several times and losing them for extended periods of time.

I first began to draw what I had imagened the other day. It's something I want to possibly paint out of whatever provided I get back into art (I had told BMF the entire story about how I felt out of interest with art and hoped to maybe get back into it all). Realizing that low light and trying to draw while speeding didn't work, I settled for my true enjoyment. Writing. Now, I'm not too sure how the rest of the writing went out. This was all done in the dark, on a trampoline, speeding, with possible effects of the X taking hold. I present you now with the writing: 

'Jesus...did I fuck up? No inhibitions left. My affidavit of responsibility chewed up and digested in pill form. What have I done to myself? Is this me? Or did I forge an alternate being in my thoughtless actions? Will I ever get the chance to figure it out? So many goddam questions....Do answers exist? If I did lay my ignorance to waste, would they be true? Is it possible that the knowledge I learn is only crafted by a cunning orator greater than myself? Impossible. There is no being greater than a mind. If truths are revealed it's simply due to my own intelligence. Fuck! My perception has been torn from its sanctuary. In its place a beast so powerful....I am unable to tame the godforsaken spawn of synthetic evil. Goddam...creatures lurk in every crevice my mind is aware of. Fucking bats and wolves --' 
 
This is as far as I got before my mind went blank. When I write I prefer it to flow and entangle rather than forcing myself to get something to work. At this time, I headed back inside.

Once returning inside I found Tracks sleeping on the couch (sleep is something she did often), and the others back in BMF's car with the heater on and Things Fall Apart by NIN pounding the speakers. I joined in, trying not to disturb them too much, spill my water, or drop the cigarette from behing my ear, but the latter wasn't working for me. I pulled out a lighter in hopes of finding it again, but wasn't able. Not until I got out did I find it and place it behind my ear again. I went back inside, then to the trampoline to jump. Somewhere around this time I went back to the computers to search for something to do, although I was inevitably unable to find it. I then went and laid on the floor as I always do when the others came back in. We conversed wondering if anyone was feeling anything, but nothing came about it. We tried everything in our desperate measures to kick in the roll but couldn't find anything sufficient enough. 

Somewhere around this time we decided to join the others at Monster's place, sadly, they too were unable to roll. Track left for her apartment, I imagine it was to sleep in her own bed, and we gathered up our things and went to Monster's. The drive there seemed like it took hours while in reality it was merely ten, maybe fifteen minutes. I nearly smoked the cigarette I had behind my ear before losing it on the floor again. NWA was rapping throughout the car as I blindly searched for the lost cigarette, again my obsesive-compulsive similarities kicked in. Finally we made it to Monster's to find Ox and Sicily in his truck blasting the heater. I on the other hand went to the house door, tapped it a few times, then walked in. 

I looked around at Monster and Fuck-Up, the only two inside now, and exclaimed my well rehearsed line in the car, 'So...this is where the mighty [name here] resides.' He laughed a bit, then concurred with my statement before I set in for my next line of dialouge (also well rehearsed), 'So...I know I just got here, and not wanting to come off like a dick or anything, could I use your bathroom?' Once more he ind of laughed and directed me to the second door on the left stating, 'It's a trailer, not too hard to figure out.' I then, once again, went to the bathroom, pissed off because I was still going to the bathroom. 

If only I was rolling, my ability to drink massive quantities of water and not urinate would have been intact. I then stepped outside and sat next to Spin (For lack of anything better to call him, merely the first part of where he works) and started talking to him. He took was on one of the pills we took, but like the rest, wasn't feeling anything. I smoked a few bowls with him and talked a bit before going back inside. After Sicily went back outside I claimed a spot on the couch next to Fuck-Up and began talking. Fuck-Up was waiting to roll the next day with some others in a big city, but after she saw how everyone else faired, she was thinking about not doing it. Monster on the other hand....he was pretty fucked up from the shrooms he ate. We sat around watching VH1-Classic while all manners of friends came and went outside. We had a small conversation about what we dubbed the 'bunk ass pills.' We had two tips and six people attempting to roll. 

We all started off with tryign the same one because it was rated the better roll. By this time though, pretty much everyone had one of the first, and then had just taken one of the others. Raz and I split ours up. A few of us decided to go back to Raz's place, because Monster needed some sleep and we just wanted to roll. I rode over there with Ox, smoking a cigarette on the way, while listening to the godlike Mr. Bungle. I suppose the half hit me a little as I felt good and the music was excellent. Then, just as the first, the minor feeling was gone. Ox told me he felt the exact same way. We finally went inside and were bitching about the bunk ass pills. By this time it was about 4:15, maybe 4:30, and none of us could sleep. In the house was Sicily and Spin, Ox, BMF, Raz, and Me...the six that took the rolls. 

Ox was real fucking bored so we decided to watch some of NIN And All That Could Have Been. I got up a few times to go back to the computers, humoring myself with google searching such as 'kicking in a roll' 'making myself roll' 'bunk ass pills' 'I took some bunk ass pills and I'm not feeling shit right now'. I found one crazy writing from someone, highlighted a passage about dancing pink elephants, and left it there for someone to see. I then went back out to the living room, where apparently everyone was talking a turn running off the shower.

By now, we all knew we weren't going to roll at all, and started to watch movies. It was something like 5:30 all of a sudden, the sun was up, and we were all pissed about the bunk pills. BMF ensured us that things would be taken care of and we would either get the money back for the pills or we'd get new ones to replace those. This made us all happy. We then began to watch Hackers, and about halfway through, I went to go join BMF on the trampoline to just lie there. We talked about how it was really pretty outside and smoked a few bowls to further enjoy it. I then went back inside, caught the end of the movie, and sat there while Ox selected Eyes Wide Shut for out next DVD. By now Raz was in a back room, BMF was still outside, and Spin was sleeping for work. Ox, Sicily, and myself were going to watch the movie. 

I had seen bits and pieces of it on TV and thought it was fucked up, but I was never ready for the shit they put in front of me. It got very fucked up, then Ox (He had seen it several times before) went to smoke a cigarette while Sicily sadly exclaimed, 'Dammit...right when it gets really fucked up I have to wake up Spin for work!' So, now I was alone, trying to comprehend the shit that was flcikering before my eyes. It ended, and I dug it, although it was so insane. Now, BMF was inside, Sicily and Spin had left, and Raz was sleeping in a room. Ox and I were the only ones left up, me by a miracle, and him by a bump of Meth not too long ago. He surprised me by putting in an unknown cassette that turned out to be old school Tom Green Show when it was still in Canada. Boy did that blow my mind. 

Tom Green is a fucking moron, but he's funny about it. Somewhere into the video BMF sauntered out to watch with us. It ended, and another one was put in. A second hour of madness. After all of that the time was something like eight o'clock in the damn morning.

When the videos finished, BMF went back out to the trampoline and Ox but in an Xbox game and played. I watched him for a little bit, then went out to the trampoline. I laid there for a while, having some very weird closed-eye visuals that I can only claim to be from the lack of sleep. I mean, the rolls would have worn off somewhere around four or five, but it was eight in the morning. So, I just layed there for a while, then got kind of hungry and went to make some more Pop-Tarts. I made my poptarts and ate them while Ox did something on the TV that I don't recall. It was either still the game or just some show, I wasn't paying attention. 

After I finished my poptarts and helepd BMF look for his phone some...not some...we looked for the better part of half an hour, maybe forty-five minutes. I finally found it when I went to go get my notebook out of his car, noticing his phone crammed into his boots in the back. I gave it to him, he checked his calls or whatever, and then we went back out to the trampoline. We laid there for some long length of time, and the next thing I noticed was BMF going inside. I then realized I must have fallen asleep, but for how long? A minute, an hour? Six? I went inside to talk to BMF about it and he said that he had just gotten up to go inside and told me, but figured I was alseep. I image my slumber as somewhere near ten minutes. Then I laid down on the couch to watch some more game playing by Ox and BMF. 

I watched about the second round before dozing off and coming to at what I imagine to be the third round or so. I look at the clock in the kitchen and it's 1:00 p.m. I then fall asleep again, this time when I wake up it's 1:30 and I notice Monster sitting there in front of me. I shout out, 'Jesus Fuck! I fall asleep and wake up with fucking Monster in front of me...that's insane.' I then fall asleep for a little longer, waking up when they're leaving to get some food at a place where they can sit in a booth and smoke. 

I tell them I'm going to stay there, as it's 2:30 already, and they leave. I then look at TV and see the paused game showing they played a total of twenty matches...I was asleep for a long fucking time. I almost started to doze off when Raz walked in, kind of asleep. I relayed the message about them going off, and how it was now 4:30 and we both slept a bit. He had to go meet up with Grunge later to go talk to some guy, and I needed to get home anyway. By the time we finally got around to it and got everything packed up it was 5:30. We then headed back to my house where he dropped me off with all of my stuff and headed out to see Grunge. 

I hauled everything inside, found a note saying my parents were gone out to eat, then I noticed my hand was all inked up. I searched my pocket and found out a pen had busted. I now had ink on everything in my pocket, including my hand. I don't know what it could mean, but I thin I'm owed some fucking Karma for this fourth of July.

I've been high before, but this was the most beautiful experience i've ever had. We were sitting around the circle and after getting stoned decided to put on pink floyd as usual. Then one of my friends said, 'Give this cd a chance.' The name of the cd was 'El Cielo' by a band called Dredg. We began our musical journey, the music is so haunting it's nearly impossible to describe in words.

I completely spaced and felt that the music only improved my high nearly two fold. Suddenly, I felt as if i was traveling, it felt like I was moving at lightspeed al thought it was apparent i was sitting still. I was immobilized. Completely paralyzed. I felt the sonic waves shining on me almost like the sun. I was no longer experiencing the music I was feeling it or even experiencing it. Now i've probably listened to the album nearly 100 times all the way through, and sometimes when I'm sober, this album even gives me a flash back high. I will never forget the first time I experienced music asopposed to just feeling it.

My girlfriend and I were hanging out and listening to music.  I believe it was led zep.  But recently I have been really concentrating on controlling my body and mind.  I havent ever researched meditation or anything of a sort, so thats why I'm not sure what the hell happened.  But here goes:

I was lying down and was pretty damn high.  I concentrated on the music in some sort of way I cant really explain.  I let the music consume me and let my imagination run wild.  It brought me to a place with laser lights and stuff.  I close my eyes and all of a sudden a feeling came over me and I felt like I dropped down.  It was like I dove down into a place.  The feeling was intense and really unexplainable.  I didnt want to leave this place so I concentrated on exploring it.  I never had a real picture in my mind, but what I felt made me think I had a picture in my mind.  I cant remember what I was seeing, but it was amazing.  I opened my eyes to see my girlfriend next to me.  She said she could see my pulse in my neck and that it was beating to the music.  I didnt try to ever do this again just because I dont know if I can.  It was that... crazy.

Well, I was sitting around my house thinking about what to do because my parents were gone for the week.  I decided to call up a few guys and toke a bowl or 4.  Friend A and B came over and we toked in the backyard.  It was some really good weed, but thats typical for oregon.  It was one of those 'one nug' eigths.  Once we we're extremely high, friend B started playing super mario 64.  Me and friend A decided we'd go out to the drum room in the garage to play some music.  I got on the drumset and Friend A got on the guitar, even though he didn't play!

Now, I'm a pretty good drummer sober, but when I'm high, the playing of drums takes on this spiritual, intense quality.  The drums sounded just perfect and the sticks felt like natural extensions of my hands.  I put on Tool's new CD 'Lateralus' through the headphones and played to it.  To my disbelief I hit everything exactly.  For some reason...my ability to percieve the timing of a song increases incredibly while high.  The beat naturally nestles itself in my mind and stays there, allowing me to improvise naturally over it.  Also, my mind strays to these complex thoughts about the 'importance' of my playing, and the general 'coolness' of hitting drums with sticks in different patterns.  Also, my creativity levels are at an all time 'high' will high (excuse pun).  My brain seems to be able to spontaneously come up with ideas more readily when stoned.  This all goes for the guitar too.  All the little riffs and techniques that are slightly beyond my sober grasp allow themselves to be played when im stoned.  Odd timings, emotional influxuations, almost sexuality permeate the guitar and amplifier.  

I can definately see how many of the world's most respected musicians are High 24/7, because of the incredible creative power THC seems to impart.

Cannabis usually makes me one of two things each time I smoke it.  I either get real excited, not nervous but my mind is clouded and has a hard time thinking.  If I dont get the above stated, I get deeply relaxed, muscle tension fades, and it feels as though a door has opened and my brain expands until there is ton of open space around my current thoughts.

One such experience was last Saturday.  Two friends of mine named Scott and Russ (nicknamed S and R for easier reference) bought some bud and got high before heading to the mall.  We packed a few bowls, two namely and smoked then rolled a blunt with the rest of the weed.  Between the time we smoked our bowls and rolled the blunt, I was feeling slightly giddy and giggly, yet not high.  We rolled the blunt and smoked it to where we couldn't hold it the put it in the bowl and finished it off.  I went to stand up and I couldnt.  I was feeling as if air was as heavy as water and I could only move my head really slow.  When I did finally figure out how to move my head again, it seemed as though my head stayed still but my body and the world are the ones that turned....

We made it into the mall, neither one of us could stop smiling.  We were walking around when I was hit with an instant of personal realization.  Im not talking about just getting messed up and heading to the mall for kicks.  I instantly realized how big the world actually was.  It felt as though time for me stopped but everyone else kept going at the exact same speed, I caught a glimpse of everyone past the mall doing their daily lives.  I stopped and took a minute to thank god for letting me see such things and experience such a nice life.  For about twenty minutes after that, it felt as though my mind and brain were two different things.  My brain seemed to take control of my body and move it for me while my brain laid in the back of my mind and enjoyed the ride... I was doing the same.

Somehow I reached the food-court and we chilled for a little bit at a table when I was staring at S and he was talking in a weird language and telling me to buy a book at Wal-Mart without moving his lips.  I asked him what he was saying and he told me I was hearing the Skytron monitor.  The Skytron was a huge TV above the food court that played constant commercials.  Anyway I stopped and watched the beautiful scene and let my worries fade when R looked at me and asked me if I heard the robot.  I was hearing a constant sound for a while now, not realizing it was a robot till R said something.  Normally I would get freaked out about something like this and hate myself for smoking bud.  This time I said , 'yeah' and sat back and relaxed and lived/loved life for what time I had left till the robot came to kill me.  It never did.

I came to realize later on that the robot was nothing merely other then the large jumble of voices eating their lunch and enjoying their life.... that made me happy to see that other people were enjoying their day also.  I was coming down from my high by the time we were leaving the mall, however that didn't stop Russ, Scott , and I from enjoying a laughing fit in the car so hard it made my chest hurt.

Smoking weed is fun... I believe it's something for everyone to try at least once and see how they like it.  As with beer, if I find myself getting messed up once a week or more, I'm going to cut back.  I have such a fun time each time I smoke the sweet herb, and I encourage everyone to be safe and have fun.

Let me start off by saying that I have been smoking cannabis and using many other substances off and on for about 6 years of my life, and I have yet to come across any bud that was this potent ever again, and maybe for the best.

It started on a Thursday night at a friends who I had agreed to sit for while he took a pretty high dose of DXM and Dramamine tablets (somewhere around 700mg DXM and 20 tablets of Dramamine). Well about two hours after taking the combination he wanted to go across the street to a friends and chill with some people. To my surprise he could actually walk without any problems whatsoever. Anyways, when we got over to A's house, there were 5 other friends over and they were all passing around a blunt and about to pack a bowl. They asked me if I wanted to smoke a bowl, so I agreed and went to sit down with them. I was the first to hit the bong, and I didn't want to get really high so I only took 1 hit. 'Only 1 hit, what could that do?', I mistakenly thought and later found out. Close to 10 minutes after my hit, I was feeling it come on pretty fast, thought it wasn't the usual cannabis high, it had a *weird* vibe to it.

So, I decided to stand up (usually helps when I'm feeling ill) to get rid of the nausea that had suddenly swept over me, and sure enough, it went away with no problems. I was coming up VERY fast and it was VERY intense. I wasn't really comfortable with the surroundings I was in so I asked my friends to watch B, my friend who took all the DXM and dram., while I went for a walk to clear my head. Well, I ended up walking home. The whole way home I was hallucinating all sorts of weird bugs and animals all around me. At one point on the way home, two old men standing next to a truck asked me if 'I was in the bar tonight'. I don't know if this had really happened so I just ignored it and kept walking my usual route home. About halfway home, every little spec on the road looked like a bug running around in the street, and I kept seeing bats and strange birds flying through the air above me, all making very strange noises similar to cars passing by on the highway. When I finally got home, I started fading in and out of consciousness, without knowing it until my body would 'jerk' and I would awaken.

I suddenly got nauseous again so I stumbled to the bathroom to vomit, but nothing came out. While I was sitting at the toilet, still fading in and out of consciousness, I thought I was standing in my friends backyard drinking malt liquor and kept saying 'I think I need to start heading home in a minute, the rice cakes will be ready soon.' Then I kinda 'popped' back into reality still feeling very nauseous. I never actually threw up, but came very close. Then next 40 minutes or so were spent sitting down at the toilet, falling in/out of reality, and falling over and hitting my head against the bathroom wall. When I finally came down enough to get up and move, I looked into the mirror and saw myself wearing a GIANT orange sombrero; very strange. When I moved into the living room, I collapsed on the couch and passed out until the next morning. And yes, I got a very good nights sleep.

For all of you who read this and think, 'cool', its was everything BUT cool. It scared the hell out of me. The whole time I had this overwhelming fear similar to the fear you get when on acid. On top of that, the stomach pains through the whole experience were terrible. And the friend who I was supposed to be sitting for, freaked out that night and went running naked through the neighborhood looking for his 'necklaces'.(it still amazes me that he could walk with no problems) But I hope this report helps those of you out there who think that there is no such thing as 'one hit shit', cuz there is, and this was by far, the most intense experience I've ever had with cannabis. 

Peace,
Wisdom

My name is Yuna, 16 and currently in 11th grade.

I'm a good kid. I'm smart, I go to school and respect elders. But I also do things that some people don't think very highly of.

Cigarettes. Alcohol. Pot. Speed. Ecstasy. Acid. Coke. Morphine.

I've never had a bad experience smoking weed in all the times I've done it. And it's pretty often - I usually smoke 2 or 3 times a week on average. Sometimes it's with friends and sometimes it's not. I buy from an ex of mine and he always gets me good stuff. For the most part, getting high is a nice experience.

Last week, I had my first bad trip. It had been a unusual time for me, I hadn't smoked any weed for about a month. It wasn't planned or anything, I just didn't find the time for it. Some of my brother's friends came over with some weed and asked if I wanted to smoke with them. 

I had always heard to never smoke weed from an Asian. And to that point, I hadn't. Even though I'm Asian myself, I never fit into that hoochie-ghetto-wigger kind very well and out of my group of friends, I'm really the only one who isn't white. But my brother is one of those gangster kind of Asians who only hang out with other gangstery Asians. I assumed the weed they brought was probably bleached or laced but I didn't think much of it. And besides, it had been a while since I had gotten high, so why not?

They rolled a fat blunt out of about a 30 of weed. We started passing it around the 4 of us and I was taking really big, monster hits. I wanted to get as much out of it as I could. I had about 10-15 big hits off of it, and a few shoties. It probably wasn't the greatest idea. I'm a tiny person. I'm only 5'2 and dont even make the 100 pound mark. But by then, I was too high to think about it too much.

At first, I was having a great time. I was really high and feeling really good. It lasted for about 20 minuites, when I started to get nauseous. I went into my room to lie down for a little bit, hoping it would take the nausea away, but it only got worse. I turned on the air conditioner full blast and stripped down to my bra and panties and tried to calm down. My heart was beating too fast and I was sweating like mad. I curled up on my bed and closed my eyes and tried to fall asleep but it didn't work.

When I had my eyes open, the entire room was spinning and twirling. Whenever I closed them, I got the strangest sensation that I was rolling foward, off my bed, even though I wasn't. I couldn't move the slightest bit or I was hit with extreme nausea. I couldn't even throw up because I hadn't eaten anything for a while. There were times I felt that the piece of my bed that I was lying on was hovering midair somewhere and things were flying around me. And I was overheated like crazy.

I'm not sure how much time passed. Later, I found out it was 45 minuites but it felt like hours. I eventually passed out and woke up an hour later, still feeling a bit nauseous but better. I drank some water and took an asprin to make my headache go away. I still had slight nausea for the rest of the night, but I wasn't burned at all. I made it okay.

But I'm never smoking weed from an Asian again.

Not long ago, my brother-in law scored a dime or two of good reefer from a guy at work.  I had come to visit, and he mentioned that he's like to try it (being less experianced than myself). Lacking rolling papers, the only smoking apparatus I had was an old 'zeppelin' on the floor of my car. after sharing a few hits each, we were feeling pretty good, starting to get a little buzzed, and the strangest thing happened...time slowed down!  I'm not talking about normal slow stoned, this was serious.  From what my sister reports (she was sober, watching us), a normal 5 minutes seemed like 4-6 hours to us.  Our thought processes seemed extremely fast, but breaks in the conversation were unusually long. Overall, we were probably high for the better part of 5 hours, but I can't begin to describe how long it felt.  I've never experianced this effect from Cannabis.  

Fortunately, the high was rather smooth, and not at all uncomfortable, but there were some strange side-effects that went along with it.  My bro got some serious munchies as a result of the stuff, and ate a whole jar of peanut butter.  I on the other hand had a single bite of chocolate cake, followed by the sensation that my mouth was 'glued shut' (BTW, the cake was REALLY GOOD!) the strange part is that my mouth was actually wide open, and my face was completely paralyzed. I found that I could neither move my jaw, nor feel anything touching my face during this time (an hour or two after smoking up).  I also felt very much disconnected from my hands, and motor dexterity in my fingers became sluggish, and delayed almost to the point of uselessness. these effects took about 3 hours to subside, and the next morning, I still felt somewhat stoned.   I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else.

I got a call from my friend one night, lets call her Betty Sue. She called to say that she was over at her Neighbor's (Sue Bee) House. Se told me to have my mom drop me off immideately. I could smell a good amount of almost sweet marijuana at the doorway. My mom didn't smell it. I sat down in the house and had one small hit from the bammer filled joint Betty Sue was smoking. it was definitetely not enough to have any  sort of effect, but it was the kind I could stay  up all night smoking for a good alert buzz if I had enough. We went out to get some food and shared a few more hits of bammer. By this time, the bammer wasn't having any psychoactive effect, but I could feel cottonmouth coming on, so I at least knew that when we smoked enough, there would be a pleasant mild high that I could enjoy. 

Sue Bee broke out the 'Blue Box' full of her stash. there was a sandwich bag full of bammer and I got excited, but there was one more thing. Green Bud. Now I had had green bud before, but this had a very stoney smell, Sue Bee said that it was new and real good (by the way, sue bee is about sixty to seventy years old) so I opted to try some. The taste was very sweet, probly what I had smelled coming in. We began passing around the pipe, filled with a full bud (enough to fill the bowl) and we refilled after a few minutes. I tried to hold it in, but it made me cough too much, which I didn't expect because the smoke was very very smooth and light tasting. And for a while, I noticed nothing. The onset was about five or ten minutes longer than normal. 

Finally it hit me. I didn't really come up, I actually hit the plateau immideately. I first noticed that I was in fact high (at the time I couldn't remember how that  felt and I couldn't actually feel anything, I just knew I was high) I started to remember what pot was usually like, and noticed that I did  not get cottonmouth like I do with the pot I usually smoke, and I had certainly never felt this clear headed after smoking so much (these were huge bowls, I had way more than one or two hits) I decided to stand up, and I noticed a slight swell in my limbs that spread to my whole body. Like I was being filled up with blood. I felt very heavy, I noticed that when I jumped, I only got about three inches off the ground When my jumping was usually about a foot normally and two feet when I am high and it feels like I am flying (It was probly a foot every time, my perception just changed) I eventually at down and let it fade. 

I would like to experiment with this type of green bud again and write a more thorough report and try more things. I would also like to examine it for other  plant material such as california poppy (I have noticed a similar effect mixing california poppy with damania).

Well, I figured I'd write this down in here too while I'm here and high both at once.

I started smoking the wacky tobaccy the summer after freshman year. 

I remember Maggie filled up a bong with stems she had left over and told me to smoke it, showed me how and said that it wouldn't get me high but it would put thc in my system so i'd  get really baked the real time i do it.
but as i was walking home from her house, I began to feel as though the street was rising and I was walking upwards.

Now i feel like im floating and letting my body come down a bit from the air so that i can type on the keyboard. or something real nice like that.
I notice that even though i ponder things when im not high, that's it's nothing unusual for me, its easier for me to do it right now, and my thoughts flow easily, they just click and connect like a puzzle.
i guess the brain power must shift from all the parts of the brain to specific spots....like from the part that governs memory to the part that governs thought processes. I dunno.

Sometimes I actualy become aroused when I smoke weed, which is odd. When one thinks of marijuana one does not think of being horny.

I get the munchies bad. I eat everything in the house. Like I can't get full and my stomach is rumbling. I think if you have cancer or aids or some other chronic (no pun intended) disease that depletes your hunger and makes you underweight, this can be a good thing, along with the pain relief.

For me, I have OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) which is an anxiety disorder where I can't quite worrying about stupid things no matter what anyone tells me, like if i am afraid that my hands have germs on them, and i freak out, yet I know it's not possible, the fear and such is so strong that i cant ignore it and wont believe my own mind. 

So when I smoke, I feel relaxed and light, and thinking about my fear just doesn't process in my mind, because it's too filled with the goodness of the leafy greens^^

Okay, I had only taken weed 3 times before this experience. It might be weird but I don't know, somehow the first two didn't have any effects on me. Of course it had some, but at least it wasn't as I had expected.
I got a friend, E , who's been smoking pot for over a year. He would come to school so high, wouldn't listen to the teachers, and stare around foolishly. He would tell me about the experiences he had while smoking weed and finally these made me try it.

Before marijuana, I had only smoked cigarrettes and taken alcohol, so I was a bit anxious about what could happen to me. The first time I smoked one joint, and honestly NOTHING happened to me. As I didn't get what I wanted from marijuana I wanted to do it again. That was a bit better and I felt high. But again, not as I wanted.
And here it comes..One day, E told me that his friend had got some strong weed and asked me if I wanted to go over and get high :) I couldn't say NO, because I wanted to have that feeling of highness so much. So we went to his house, prepared the bong , and started hitting.

1.. 2.. and I started feeling strange.. I was acting so different, I realised. But I could say to myself that 'I'm not high' 'I'm okay'. But with a look at the mirror, I saw my eyes half open, and bloodshot. I was having so much fun, we were listening to rap, and dancing wildly. I felt a little tired and sat on E's bed. He was sitting beside me singing. I lighted up a cigar and it's smoke got into my eyes, it hurt me so much and my eyes were all watery. I kept them closed for a few seconds and as I opened them THE WHOLE ROOM WAS FULL OF WATER.
I could see bubbles around the room just like I was in a pool or a sea. Things were floating and so was E's hair. Suddenly a blue shark, just like a cartoon passed behind E. I stared at it for a few moments and tried to realise what was happening. The shark made a few curves and faded away and I blinked to see it again but as I opened my eyes, everything was gone. I was in the room again, E was sitting there and staring at me blankly.

When I told him what happened , he was in a kind of shock because he had told me before that he hadn't ever had any hallucinations before so he was kinda jealous. It was a great experience, but I can't say anything about whether it is good or bad to use marijuana as I'm new. I just can say that it's fun!

I come from Germany so I guess there will be a lot of mistakes in the whole context - I want to appologize for that first. Okay I have to admit that I smoked weed a lot of times before but because I am not a smoker I really didn't get that high (because I didn't inhale it that deep and that long). I wanted to give it a last try because I really thought Marijuana is just boring and I couldn't imagine why people like that small not very intensive kick so much.

Me and a friend used about 0.5 g weed with tea. First we heated it in a microwave - then we started drinking it. Actually I tried to take weed oral like 2 times before which failed both cause I didn't eat it at all or I forget heating it - whatever this time should really be the last if it doesn't work... It was midnight when we used it so I know we should have got one hour left before it will have an effect on us but I doubted it anyway so we headed to Hanover City. It was an early Tuesday morning and nobody was on the streets when I first felt that something must have been changed - it was kind of more interesting and funny to look in all that windows of the closed stores.

Then we entered the station and it really went further very fast. So after a short while all was very funny and ridicolous. Walking was getting a problem because it was very hard to use one step for the other. Then we left the station again and get outside. We tried to talk to some people but we weren't able to do it - we only could make some noises and our converstion was getting more and more difficult maybe every 10th word was kind of sensible. 3 guys realized us and started laughing about us because we were behaving like robots - we just made noises and keep on walking. By the time one of them get the idea to rob us I got an unpleasant feeling and we went back to the station (btw we must have been crossing that station maybe 50 times that night!). Now I lost time and place control I mean I forgot in which direction we were heading and I wasn't able to speak one sentence because every time I forgot the beginning so it was no use.

To find the right way and walking itself were that hard that a short distance seemed to be like a long travel - the same with the time.By the time that I realized that 10 minutes really didn't pass by I got in panic and I was like: 'Does it ever stop again and all will it be okay? Maybe the drug dealer used some LSD on the grass and I will get mad...'

By that time I really felt like going to the hospital especially as we get so thirsty and the mouth were that try I can't tell...I was on heat and I didn't know wether I will get an heart attack or maybe I couldn't breathe anymore - but we found a book store which were opened by night so we entered it. We have been there like some hours before but there it was just cool. I just told the woman we only want to rest and get some drink and we won't make any trouble but then I saw her using the telephone - I got the paranoia that she would call the police... 40 minutes passed by and some people were supervising us - I realized it although they must have thought I couldn't take notice of them. My friend was sitting on a chair trying to read a book what of course was impossible - we didn't talk a lot anymore... I was walking and walking and walking arround the furnitures and talking to myself that I really don't have fun anymore and I want it to be over by now...

I wasn't that hungry anymore when I got the idea that my friend must be the devil because he rejected recognizing me and only sometimes I felt like he was back when he said: 'It's all cool - nothing to worry about'... suddenly two police men arrived and I got really angry cause that dumb woman really called them so we tried to leave the store and the police men were cool so all were cool... now I started coming down but then my friend wanted to drive and I jumped out of the car and took his keys cause I was afraid to die so we just hang out about another hour before I could accept driving home... after all this trip was really high and the following trips we made were more or less good but there were none what I would call a bad trip again... if I wouldn't have had that experience again I probably wouldn't use it anymore but now I really learned to use that stuff and we really had much fun but this is not the topic...

This happened two days ago...it was such an unusual experience, I thought I'd share with you guys :)

I've been smoking cannabis for about three years now, so I'd say I'm pretty experienced with joints, bongs etc. Anyway, I was in college around 11am, and met up with a long time stoner friend (lets call him Harris) in the student union. I mentioned I didn't feel like going to lectures that day, and he suggested we have a waterfall each.

If you don't know what a waterfall is, its usually a plastic soda bottle (in this case 500ml). You punch a hole in the bottom, put a gaze over the top, and put the cannabis in that. Then fill the bottle with water (cover the hole!), and burn in the cannabis as you let out the water. Then suck in that white smoke baby. Result: Some seriously good pure hash. Anyways, we had one each (I hadn't had a waterfall before), and decided to head outside on the campus lawn (gorgeous weather). After about 5 minutes, I could tell this was gonna be a strange buzz. Sounds were getting a little distorted, and everything seemed to be moving and sliding around slightly. About 10 minutes after taking the waterfall, my mind just clicked, and suddenly I was really, really trippy! I really can't describe it, but basically my mind was absolutley racing, new thoughts coming into my head every few seconds, and every ten seconds or so I just had to tap myself on the shoulder metaphorically, to remind myself where I was and who I was.

I looked up in the sky and saw four airplanes, two heading one way and two the other. I suddenly panicked, and said to my friend 'This is it man, it's World War Three' - The airplanes looked exactly like missiles - nukes on their way to their respective targets. It was really creepy, because it honestly felt like this was it, nuclear war.

Luckily, after a few minutes this feeling went, and I just went with the buzz, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Maybe it was the pot, maybe it was the waterfall, but it was simply the most intense buzz I'd every gotten off cannabis.

So, what did I learn? Well, its hard at first, but I think you just have to let go...don't try to control or stop the intensity, because it only turns it into a bad buzz. Try to remain relaxed, and just melt into it. My mistake was to try and keep a grip on who and where I was - My tip, don't. 

Thanks for reading,
lampsie.

I started smoking a couple of months ago and have since become a more laid-back person who feels more at peace with her life and the world.  Marijuana is so commonplace and such a part of my life now that I hardly think of it as a drug, yet I have had a couple of experiences that were definitely mindblowing and reminded me that weed is more than food.  I had heard people speak of seeing sounds and feeling colors, etc. when they were tripping off acid, etc. but I never believed that such effects could be triggered by marijuana.

However, not too long ago, me and a couple of friends packed a bowl with some really potent KB and after about three hits I was really tripping hard.  I was sitting in a car in a parking lot at night listening to trance music.  My eyelids were drooping and I could not move my body at all, not that I wanted to.  The music was enthralling--I could actually see it.  Everyone knows that smoking makes music better and I definitely appreciate it more when I am high, but seeing music is something else.  It was as if each facet of the music, and there were probably at least twenty--the bassline, the main melody, that strange clicking noise in the background, etc.--every noise took on a visual shape.  I could see every line of the music moving and dancing to its beat.  It was beautiful, absolutely breathtaking, until one of the shapes--a pink ball of light--began circling my head repeatedly.

First I was dizzy, then I became nauseous and my friend laughed as she changed the song because I was groaning that the music was making me sick.  Who would have thought you could see music and feel its effects?  Ever since this experience I have better recognized the beauty of music when you are high, though never again have I actually seen the sounds.  Marijuana enhances all the senses though, and on other occasions I have felt lights.  Driving down the highway at night, the streetlamps seemed to stroke my body and the feeling was intense.  In conclusion, marijuana is a wonderful substance that can open your body and mind to otherworldly experiences.

At about eight oclock I met my friend, whom I'll call Kathy. She and I walked to a small wooded park, where earlier that afternoon we'd found a perfect place to smoke. We arrived at the designated area, I packed a bowl, and we lit up. We got about two hits apiece off each bowl (I packed them really small because I knew how potent it was) and after the third bowl, we decided to stop. I was feeling a little buzzed and Kathy said she wasn't really feeling it at all. So we packed up the dope, the flashlight we'd brought, and the lighters and set out for the road. 

However, as soon as we stepped off the small concrete platform where we'd been standing onto the grass, it hit. Everything that I looked at was very, very pixellated, as though I were looking at a low-resolution digital image. Each separate part of my body, especially my hands and feet, felt like they were in different, discrete planes of existence. All of my senses, except touch in certain cases, were incredibly heightened. I especially remember thinking that my hearing had been augmented. I was twitching, slightly. I was so unable to judge distances that I didn't trust myself to light a cigarette.

However, without a doubt the strangest part of this whole experience was the way in which I perceived reality and the passage of time. For at least two and a half hours (in real-time...For me it seemed like days), I had a feeling of unreality. At first I thought I was dreaming, but I realized that that didn't quite cover what I was feeling. So I thought some more, and the best explanation that I can come up with is that I felt like I was an image on a movie screen...That I was a physical piece of a movie that someone else was watching. I had a pervasive, at times frightening feeling that nothing I did had any consequences because none of it was real. 

In terms of my awareness of my surroundings...It's difficult to describe this without being really confusing and roundabout...The way I saw and thought about things was very similar to any movie or movie preview or something where the editors take several clips of a particular scene and place them all one after the other, even though in reality five or ten minutes may have passed between each clip. I would exchange a few words with Kathy, then we'd both fall into silence for a moment, and then I'd look back up at her and realize that I'd completely forgotten she was there, and I would have no memory of just having talked to her. Usually for those first few moments of realization I'd think she was a hallucination I was having (eventually, that began really to unnerve me, so I asked her to hold onto my arm, which made it a little better, but I was still pretty startled every time I looked at her). I had many consecutive trains of thought, but they were all very brief and died out one after the other. So, the end result of all of that is that everything felt incredibly disjointed. 

That, combined with the fact that I felt like I was in a film, made last night one of the strangest nights of my life. I think I enjoyed it, though I think I would have enjoyed it more if Kathy and I had spent most of the night in a place where we knew we were going to be safe, such as one of our houses (both of our sets of parents were home, which is why we stayed out until it wore off a little, and that took about three hours).

This report is intended to attest to the extent that Cannabis is capable of putting you out like a light. One night, my friends and I decided to have a little jam session at a friend's garage. This entailed playing music with little or no actual cohesion, and smoking lots of weed.

Before entering the experience, I was not noticably tired. Keep this in mind. Also, I have a relatively low tolerance to weed. 

T+00 The first bowl gets passed around as we are setting up our equipment. The weed is of fairly good quality, and by the time we are all done smoking, I'm starting to feel fairly stoned.

We play music for a while. We have only one light in the entire loft, a lamp pointing straight up. This caused the surroundings to be either illuminated in light or cast in pitch black shadow. The intense contrast in lighting might have contributed to the experience.

T+60 Starting to feel a bit tired.

T+90 I eat a meatball sub, and smoke more weed. I was VERY hungry at this point and wolfed down the sandwich. 

T+95 I finish sandwich and realize that energy level is declining rapidly.

We play more music for a while. I am still sitting on the couch as I have no inclination to get up, being very tired and very stoned. Starting to loose motor coordination.


T+140 We smoke yet another bowl, which in retrospect, given my level of exhaustion, was a really stupid idea. I still had to drive home, which fortunately was only 20 minutes away.

T+170 I bid my friends goodbye, and climb the ladder (we were in a loft) down to my car. Climbing down can only be described as choppy and unsteady, and I'm sure my balance was horrible at that point.

I had told my parents that I was going to be home by 11 as it was a school night. They are usually asleep by then, so it wouldn't matter how stoned I would be when I finally arrive. However, it was only 10pm. I had an hour to kill, so I figured I'd drive my incredably stoned and out of it self down to the beach parking lot, and chill out there for a while.

T+190 I arrive at the parking lot. It's now 10:20 and I'm still extremely stoned and tired, I make the foolish mistake of 'resting my eyes.'

T+310 (120 minutes later) I wake up, realize I am an hour and 15 minutes late, and zoom home. I had slept off most of the effects of the weed, and was feeling refreshed. 

Luckily, I didn't get into any sort of trouble for this incident. But, it did teach me that Cannabis can make one extremely tired, to the point of not being able to keep oneself awake unless one's eyes are open. Although random slumber is not necessarily a bad thing, I definitely think I should not have been driving that night, as I very well could have fallen asleep at the wheel. Be forewarned.

I was visiting the hippy town of Woodstock for the weekend with some older friends (most of my friends are over 30 and I am in high school). I suspected that pot might be part of the day's activities, but I wasn't sure if my friends thought I was old enough to become one of the stoner crowd.

We arrived at an art collector's house to hang out before we went swimming. My friend J pulled out his pipe, and a little box with a bud in it, and put it in front of me and walked away. I took it upon myself to prepare it and share it with everyone else. My first inhale was smooth, maybe because I had been around the smoke before, and my lungs were more tolerant. I held it in long, hoping to get some amazing high that is spoken of in movies and cloudy rooms. I took two more hits afterward, just to ensure some reaction from the stuff.

After we finished, we went to a swimming hole by the waterfalls. This was very cool. On the way there, I was hearing my favorite CD for the first time, all over again. Every sound was a perfect harmony to my mood. It was beautiful. The water was cold, and the reflections of light on the water got my mind to wander. I closed my eyes and thought about breathing underwater, and floating in a tranquil paradise. Somewhere in this stream of thought my parents came to mind, and I began to feel guilty. This was a major bring down from my high. I quickly deminished the thought, but I couldnt get back what was lost.

The day went on, and it wore off slowly. I was in a generally calm, peaceful state of mind for the entire day. I do recommend this stuff to everyone who likes to relax and dream, but only in moderation. In excess, this does no good.

I tried weed for the first time when I was in grade 8, when I was 13 years old. The first time I 'tried' it I didnt feel anything at all. After about 3 times of trying it and having feeling nothing, I felt that I had a different kind of brain than other people and that weed wouldnt affect me. 

One Friday during school my friend 'S', who has been smoking me the weed for the last few times, asked me if I wanted to smoke again. As I was still wondering about the feeling that weed could give me, I agreed to come over and smoke with him.  Between 4 people, we smoked two joints, and about 5 big bowls. I averaged it out later that I myself probably smoked 1 gram of weed. 

Like the many times before, nothing appeared different than normal life. I just went upstairs and got a drink of water. After I got my drink I walked over to my friend C and began to talk with her. I forget what we talked about, but one time during the conversation I went to have a drink of water from my glass, when I realized that I didnt have a glass in my hand.

Hey C, didnt I have a glass of water in my HAHAHAHA I began to laugh uncontrollably at the fact that I thought I had water in my hand. After what felt like 10 minutes of laughing, I turned to my friend D and yelled, What is going on! 

Youre stoned man! D told me.

When he said that, I immediately started to explore my surroundings, finally I was high. So THIS is what I was trying to experience. So THIS is what I was trying to experience. After that more of the weed kicked in and eventually I realized I was really stoned.

We than walked downstairs and sat on chairs in Cs room. All of my other friends were talking with each other while I was sitting in my chair stoned off my ass. During the time I was sitting in my chair I kept feeling like somebody added weights to the front of my body, making it hard to sit up straight. I would fall over and than catch myself and sit up straight and look around the room. The whole time this was going on a felt bloated and close to throwing up. 

All of a sudden I felt that my mouth was extremely dry. I then realized, for possibly the fifth time, that I didnt have a drink in my hand anymore. I then told everyone in the room several times that I was going to get a drink, and finally I did.

I began to walk up the stairs and then all of a sudden I mind-blanked into the kitchen. I felt like the trip up the stairs never happened. As I was in the kitchen all I could think of was how I got up here. Then as I saw the sink I remembered that I was looking for my glass that I had previously so that I could get some water. After I had found my glass I began to fill it up with water, which is when I had another mind-blank.

At one moment I was filling up my glass with water, at the next I was walking down the stairs and sat down in my chair. When I sat down I began to drink my water. Right after I started, my friends were laughing at me, I didnt know why and was tripping out to hard at them laughing to ask why they were laughing.

In between laughing, my friend C came out with the words salt in your water? 

I then looked at my glass and I was murky. I then tasted my water and it tasted horrible. So I put it down in awe at what my brain did while I had no control over it. 

We sat in the basement for a while and then we had to leave. Cs room was in the basement and her window was level with the ground so for fun we decided to climb out the window to leave. I had a little bit of trouble, but when I got outside I felt awesome. To this day I still enjoy being outside when Im stoned. I feel like I enjoy the natural beauty of the earth more when Im stoned. 

While I was walking I felt that my heart was beating really fast. Every once and a while, I would be walking by myself, and then I would run to catch up with my friends to walk with them. After that I would usually have a mind-blank, and I would be behind them and have to catch up with them again.

We walked around my town for a while and then I went home. I snuck in quietly and trying to act normal told my mom that I was going to bed. I turned on the TV in my room and watched TV until I fell asleep.

In the morning I felt a little fuzzy and still messed up but I could still think and function fine. After a while I became completely normal, and I was excited about what I had just experienced the night before.

It is more than three years later and I have been smoking a fair bit of weed ever since, about once a week, and always enjoy it. 

After my first time being stoned I have never had the mind-blanks that I had that evening. My first time being stoned was a weird experience, a taste of the other side of life.

On a final note I would like to say to be cautious when trying weed for the first time. You may find things to be very unknown and messed up, but remember that you will be fine in a couple hours and that you will not die, as I thought many time during the trip that I was having a heart attack and/or was about to die.

One night I was at a friends house, and we had just got back from my sisters high school graduation. We all (5 people) went to my friends room, and lit up some great Boone (north carolina) Nug bud. It taste so good I could have died. I could feel it kick in as I took the first hit. We all sat and talked and laughed, but then Thomas took out a rolling paper. Oh, shit I was already in over my head. I didn't think I could handle any more, but it was just the kind of bud I couldn't pass up. Do you know what I mean?

Thomas started rolling it and showed us how to roll a ' mully' joint. It was so fucking funny. He was acting like it was an infomercial. We where all tripping out, he is so funny. Then we smoked another one and talked and laughed. But here is were the good part starts. Every one left the room , but I stayed in the room. The reason for this is I usually trip unusually to much. So, I stayed and tripped.

The first part was me sitting down in an air bubble chair. I was thinking of me just sitting on air, and that must have affected my trip coming up. Here it goes. I was just sitting there thinking of things, and all of a sudden I was blocked in by bricks. Not regular bricks but air bubble bricks (the only way to explain it). The bricks were like the bubble chair I was sitting in. I could not possibly move, the bricks were holding me tight. I closed my Eyes thinking I could lose the trip, but as soon as I did I got sucked into a portal. A portal of infinite knowledge (as always as I trip). I drift and drift. It was telling a story, and a great one at that. Life is great, you have to hold on to the moments and create new ones. I was literally taking deep refreshing breaths just to savour the moment. I can't remember every moment of this experience so I won't ramble. Every time I trip it is spiritual and I learn more and more about the actual world that surrounds us all. I hope you have liked this if you didn't have a wonderful day anyway.

As a prelude to my journey into the water pipe dimension I must confront the reader with the facts that I have tried the sweet herb a good 10 or so times before and have used a gravity bong but not a water, and it was a great experience! 

The day started off cold and dreary.  I woke from bed and went to my friends house.  The friend whom I was picking up just turned 18 and wanted to buy something to smoke out of by himself, so I told him I would take him to a shop that sells them; and I did.  One of the grayest and colorless days I have ever known passed by us on that trip.  Once we got there we selected a nice straight bong with about a 2 inch mouth piece.  It fit my mug nicely as it did his.  We made the trip home talking quiet a bit how hungry we were, yet we didnt stop anywhere at all to eat which was a blessing in disguise I guess, it saved us money.

The time is now around 1 pm and we are sitting at home admiring his new water bong.  Again it is just my friend Justin and I.  We still didnt think to get anything to eat when suddenly the doorbell rang and in walked my pothead friend Scott.  We could always get weed from him and today was no exception, we decided to buy and eighth and ended up smoking it in his car with the water bong.  Justin got the first hit and I saw him draw no smoke into the chamber and my doubts were starting to arise.  The bong went to Scott and he took one of the most monster hits I ever saw and didnt choke.  I couldnt wait to try it, and after what seemed like a day it came back to me and I settled it into my lap and put my mouth to it.  I prayed to have a good high and hoped I got really stoned off of the bong.   I drew a big hit into the chamber and cleared it expecting to kill myself coughing but it was so nice and smooth! The hit I took was almost like a cigarette! I should mention that this bud was nothing more then powerful oregano, really nothing good.... we didnt care though, it was working it seemed.  That is to say, it was weed but a very inferior quality as I judged by the mass amounts of seeds and stems, and just the way it smoked.  I went on and took about 10 hits off the bong and we ended up smoking the rest of the eighth.

The rest of the day was a blur but I remember the first of it, sitting in the car marveling how complex the scenery is when I realized I had no idea where I was.  I began to think we were near my house when I forgot why I was thinking what I was thinking.  I never had such bad short-term memory loss like that before.  I literally would think of one thing, and then either forget what I was thinking about in the middle of thinking it, or space out and just realize I was spacing ten minutes later.  I wasnt thinking I was high until right then and it just hit me I was stoned off my ass.  I couldnt do anything but just smile with a big grin on my face and giggle at nothing.  We were lost in the city for a while in the car, maybe about 45 minutes when suddenly I realized a road and yelled out of no where 'AAAHH HOUSE NEAR HERE!' I couldnt think of what to say and after a while it ended up we were nowhere even near the city anymore somehow, which to this day I can never figure out how that happened.  

So we headed toward another friends house that lives close to me.  His name was also Justin.  We relaxed there and I had some things to eat such as chips and ice cream. The second Justin looked a lot like Jim Morrison, especially with the hair and I kept thinking it was actually Jim and flipping out.  I could feel Mary Jane clutching at my brain, and it felt as though the weed lifted a blanket off my brain and I had so much more space for all my thoughts to go to now.... if that makes any sense.

We talked for a while and watched some TV.  The only other thing I can remember until that night is just staring at my friends face and watching it glow then turn into another friends face.  The second Justin turned on Any Colour You Like by Pink Floyd and told me to close my eyes and watch the colors.  That was a great show; it felt as if my body was being cut in half but in a pleasant way.  The feeling went up into my tooth and made my tooth feel fuzzy.  I then started to feel like liquid and the music made me feel as though my liquid self was slowly going upwards for some reason in a quelling motion.

I eventually came down that day but I had a lot of 'brain farts' I guess you call them.  For instance I went into a gas station, one is in my town, and another in the city over and they both look the same inside.  I looked at the soda fountain and all of a sudden I couldnt remember which one I was at or how I got there.  I asked my friend and he just thought I was saying that to make myself look still high, but I really didnt know which one we were at.  Then later on I was dining out, and scooping myself some sprinkles for ice cream and I dipped the sprinkle spoon in the hot chocolate by accident and just left it there and walked away while the people I was with were screaming my name, I knew they were too but I just didnt register  in my mind to turn around.  The rest of the night everything just seemed so cool and the world around me was such a nice place.  I had a wonderful long lasting feeling of euphoria long after it, and I still feel as everything is going to work out great.

Anyway, this about wraps up my first try on a water bong, and let me tell you it was the highest I have ever got.  Out of all my times when I got high, it was the best from the water bong.  I was also surprised at how easy it hits.

A brief substance history before the experience. Before today 2002 was the last time I had ever done drugs. I had been clean of any substance abuse for 15 years. My health has been getting the best of me for so long that I have been scared to do anything, much less have an eye opening experience. I made one mistake, and that was underestimating the potency of this strain. I was sick to my stomach for a good while before it passed. It was too much for me, and too strong. This weed was no joke.

With a blunt rolled by my brother ready we go outside and I spend a little time in meditation before I spark it up. What begins to take place while we are smoking this blunt is the deepest conversation I can remember having with anyone. My tolerance is at square one here so as far as you know this is like a first time experience. 

Within 10 minutes I am in another world. I am beginning to feel the effects of this blunt hit me like a ton of bricks. Everything I feel, say, and do begins to feel like a dream, but it's real life. Everything I feel, say, and do begins to feel like a dream, but it's real life. Me and my brother start having a deep conversation about things that nobody understands but us two. Out of nowhere I ask the question 'How have I made it this far?'. I promise you that I have never asked a deeper question in my whole lifetime and I have had 5 surgeries in the past 7 years, plus a near death experience with Pneumonia so I have came close to not making it a time or two. At this time I am bawling and letting so much out I begin to make myself speechless because what I am sharing with my younger brother is some real life stuff that needed to come out. After talking for a while longer I decide to take a nap because I am emotionally drained, and far away in another place. 

When I wake up from a short nap I decide to order a Pizza, and watch some LIVE PD. I enjoy my meal while laughing at folks on tv getting arrested for various crimes. 

Although this experience was rough, it taught me something. I need to be more open, and have more deep conversations with folks instead of being so quiet all of the time. It's hard to talk when life has humbled you on a level you can't begin to understand. For some reason I have made it this far. I have survived it all.

One day I will smoke weed again, but it won't be for a while. I have a great life, and I'd like to keep it that way.

My experiences with marijuana are very similar every time, but very enjoyable. I decided I had to write this report about it because of the amazing similarities between my experiences and those of another user. I will use one experience of mine that had all the things I normally feel, only more extreme because I was more high than usual.

There is a girl that goes to our school who lives in a rather nice apartment downtown (we live in a small town, so downtown isnt much), but her parents were in Europe for a few weeks and she let us smoke in her apartment. On this occasion, she wasnt even home when we were smoking. But anyway I was smoking with my best friend and one of his friends, who Im also pretty well acquainted with. So we smoked almost an eighth, just us three, and I went to sit on the couch. 

Many times I meditate while high because I can focus more without distracting thoughts Many times I meditate while high because I can focus more without distracting thoughts, but this day I decided I was so high, I should probably just enjoy it. All my friends know that with me, I get high very easily, and I have intense highs. For whatever reason, my highs are in my head, body, and eyes at the same time. So when I sit still I shiver and shake and twitch, but also get distorted visuals. Well sitting on the couch I started feeling like the couch was falling backwards all the time, as if I was on a small, but fast ferris wheel going in reverse. I could actually feel the wind against my skin (I later realized this was an exaggeration of the wind from the fan above me). Then I closed my eyes and got some closed eye visuals, which are somewhat consistent with every time I get high. It seems to me that these visuals are of things I saw as an infant. For example, I saw my house, but it was an incredibly simplified version, with only one floor, and only one level of roof which slanted to the back. But it was most definitely my house. I think I was somehow remembering the way I saw or thought of my house when I was just an infant. I also saw a pattern that could either be an eye or a loose outline of a house, but that pattern appears in my head almost every time. 

Eventually I decided to return to my friends who were sitting at the counter together but both were very intently staring at the counter-top. So I got a granola bar, which was somewhat hard to chew but every time I opened my jaw the stickiness sent waves of euphoria through my body. It felt so good. Then I sat down again and decided I would travel down the rabbit hole. I closed my eyes and could easily visualize a rabbit hole. I pushed down through the hole by chewing, and those waves pushed the dirt aside. The rest of the day pretty much went on like this.

For the next few days I felt more refreshed and optimistic than I have in as long as I can remember.

Simple Cannabis, Life Alteration

Every month or so, I buy a bit of cannabis from a good friend of mine, usually 1/16th of an oz., as this time. I tend to consume all of it in a period of 3-4 days remaining under its influence from waking to sleep unless work or school get in the way. During this time, I tend to write, draw, tell stories, come up with plans, and all of the regular experiences associated with cannabis use. My 'Stoned Philosophy' has been subject of many jokes by friends My 'Stoned Philosophy' has been subject of many jokes by friends, but often enough they listen openly, assuming I am indeed speaking from more than a simply 'stoned' perspective. 

I bought from this friend of mine with the intent of having a regular time, as per my usual. Listen to music, write some stories, play some videogames, and watch some movies. After having been less-than-sober for many hours, I began to watch a movie. Across the Universe, a movie I had been wanting to see for some time, having been told by many people how wonderful it was and my undying love for The Beatles. John Lennon is one of the reasons I got into philosophy, in fact. 

The movie started out very strongly, and as I lit up another bowl, I started singing along to some of the songs that I knew, although the remakes had rhythms I was not used to. It was perhaps twenty minutes into this movie that I started seeing it as the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, a feeling I still hold some months later. The utter perfection of the 'humanity' in the movie made me weep several times. By the end of the film, I had decided upon what I wanted to accomplish with much of my life. As a college student, I have been slightly indecisive about my major, where to go in life, and what to do. The character Jude, although fictitious, finalized ideas I had been having for some time. I knew I wanted to work on the wrongs of the world, and the best way I see is to start from the ground up; what people think. People think by what they know, and they know by what they are taught. 

I am a History major, soon to be attending another year of college, in order to teach people in the same position I am the wrongs humans have perpetrated, the great things we have done, in hopes of bettering mankind. Something I think all people need to work towards. 

In all of my experiences with multiple substances, I have never felt so 'right' as I did that night. I have never felt so 'right' as I did that night. I called members of my family, telling them of my revelation, of my new insight, and every one of them has helped me in working towards this goal, which is still a long way off. Through cannabis induced rants, silly ideas, a completely irrational fear of Zerglings, and all other foolish, but fun, things associated with my cannabis experiences, 'weed' really helped me. I am happier now than I have been in some time, even with the constant stress around me. I know that, due to a simple little plant and a movie, life will be completely worth all the hardship just to pass on any knowledge I am able, to hopefully better our so often ignorant species.

[Erowid Note: 
Some authors report suspicions that their cannabis has been 'laced' (adulterated), in some cases, presumably with PCP. While this is possible, readers should be aware that idiosyncratic response to the effects of cannabis (usually higher doses) can lead some users to presume their cannabis has been 'laced'. There is no way to know if the cannabis in the report below was adulterated or not. Reports of plant material and cannabis laced with powerful synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive substances became more common starting in 2007.] 

It was a day pretty much like most others. I was still in high school at this point, hanging out with my buddies who I'll call N and C. After school ended I drove them both home before heading to work. When I was dropping N off he said, 'Pick me up after work, I got something.'

I figured he meant he had bought some buds, as we were all pretty much potheads by this point. I finished work (I do construction) and was tired and achy as I pulled into N's driveway. I picked them both up (C was living at N's due to familial problems), and we started driving down toward my neighborhood. We parked the car at the end of a road that went down to the harbor. The spot was relatively secluded so we got out and packed a bowl of weed. N told me he had found the bag in the school parking lot that day.

We sat on a piece of driftwood watching heat lightning while we smoked two bowls. I noticed the smoke had a sort of 'mentholish' taste to it... kind of cool and minty. But sort of gross and chemical. In any event, I didn't like it much, but I figured weed is weed.

After a short time we all became agitated, we couldn't stop shifting our weight and fidgeting, talking all kinds of nonsense. I could hear my blood rushing through my veins and feel my heart pounding in my chest. At this point I kept saying, 'Dude, I'm dieing man!' over and over again.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

We wandered around the beach, a total mess, for a few hours. Then I felt safe to drive again and we went around our town, going into the village and parking near Town Pond. It is this little pond next to the cemetary near the ocean. We sat there watching cars drive by, I noticed the tail lights left behind blurs as they went.

I had never taken any drug stronger than pot or mushrooms before this day, and the experience was slightly frightening, but ended up being pretty funny too. I felt sort of numb and hysterical, like a weird drunk in addition to a spacey high feeling.
We all went home and I ended up laying around in bed feeling weird for a little while before falling asleep. The next day I felt pretty burnt.

We later concluded that the pot could have been laced with PCP after hearing about some similar baggies going around our school. This was my first, and likely only experience with this drug.

Cannabis - Hash





BODY WEIGHT:

I've been smoking cannabis for the past few years now. I started when I was 15. I've had different kinds of trips but this one was what I guess a 'Trip' is supposed to be. 

A friend hooked us up with Malana Cream which is grown in Malana, India. It's one of the best quality hash you can get in the world. No kidding. We rolled them and we smoked. It was after the 4th Joint (Shared by 3 people), I was certain that I'm getting fucked.

The Experience

Constant white flashes. Then white circles around the corner of my eye. Sound sensitive, that usually happens. I couldn't eat, it just didn't want to go down.

I had only slept for 3 hours the previous night which is obviously a big mistake.  I had trouble keeping my eyes open and I was a bit scared because one of my friends who is quite a sober person ate a few pieces of cake filled with 72 grams of weed and he was hospitalized after he fainted, haha. I obviously didn't want to faint and be hospitalized which kept me at bay. So I went home and lied down on the bed. 

Then I felt this sensation around my chest, I can't say it was a burning sensation. I don't know but in my mind it felt like something bright inside my chest in my mind it felt like something bright inside my chest. Then I felt like I floating above my body. Separated from my body. At that very point, it felt great. I never knew I could hallucinate like this on hashish. Though I have never done Heroin, Acid etc. I do remember telling myself during the trip 'Fuck I'm floating, really!' I was back and running after 30 mins then, though I felt pretty lazy through out the day.

There is actually one more thing which isn't really big but but its been 2 weeks since then and I have yellow light flashes out of nowhere. It has happened to me 4-5 times this week. Sometimes I feel like the earth is shaking or a feeling of losing balance I guess but I'm pretty much still. 

Today I did think about these yellow flashes and the earth shaking thing and its kinda weird. I thought about all those people who have spiritual experiences through drugs. I'm a non believer though. But it was well worth the trip.

I was in a party, an a friend of mine was smoking a joint. I gave 2-3 puffs from it, I wasnt a frequent smoker, just once in a while if someone offered. This pot was very pure, not the dried one, so it hit pretty hard, really quick. The party was really loud and I sat in a couch as I started to feel overwhelmed by the voices of everyone. I catched isolated words, but every word I heard was reminding me of a memory of a conversation I had with different people at different ocasions long ago, where that word was used. They were all memories from high school, at gave me a frightful feel of meaning and irreality.

I think I closed my eyes, I dont remember, just everything went very dark. I panicked everything went very dark. I panicked. The whole world had faded away and I didn´t know what happened. I started to think of the reasons why this happened. First I thought I died and I felt bad for my parents. Second I thought maybe I became crazy and I wasnt aware of reality but I was truly institutionalised and I felt even worse. Then I started to feel like I was floating. I was floating in the dark and I couldnt feel my body. I was sure suddenly, the world had ended. Like it had exploded with some asteroid and that it happened so quickly that anyone had time to be aware of its own death. This certainty made me angry, bexause I was still conscious, and I'm not religious. To be aware after dying wasnt something I was expecting, and I felt annoyed by it.  

I started to feel like I was drifting, like falling, and I started thinking of everything that was lost, of everyone that died and that no one had time to say goodbye. I felt so alone and sad. I was cursing the fact that I still existed, I was so alone and afraid and thinking how much time is this going to last? Eternity? Will I join the others or is everyone alone in it one space like me forever? 

As I continue falling I tried to calm myself and I started to feel like I was falling through membranes. I started to feel like I was falling through membranes. Every membrane was a state, like I was growing or maturing, from one human condition into another state. As time passed and I continue to fall through this stage, I felt simpler, like a speck of dust lost in space. No longer feeling the need of everything I left behind in my previous life.

This lasted what I felt it was a long time, until a friend of mine shaked my shoulder and asked me If I was alright. I still had a shoulder. I opened my eyes. I had eyes. I was still in the party and my friend told me I sat there for like ten minutes. 

I was snapped out of it but still pretty high so I asked if I could go lay down in a bedroom. I was calm now because I knew it was just a trip so I fell asleep easily until it was time to go, a couple of hours later and I was feeling normal by then. 

It was a disturbing but interesting experience.

I'm a quite regular user of cannabis, I often buy half ounces and sort out little gatherings of a few people. 

I bought a half ounce for a night, expecting 3 people (including myself) to turn up, O and D. I got home with my stash and rolled up a big joint with about 1/4oz in it. Only O turned up, and we walked up a hill to one of our usual haunts, a nice hilltop bench with a brilliant view of the sky. It was around 8pm this time, and already getting hard to find the floor underneath the cover of trees. We sat down, and sparked up the joint. O took a few tokes on it before curling up on the bench. I proceeded to smoke the rest of it. We started talking about other drugs and whether we would or wouldnt do them, and then started looking at shapes in the sky. O rolled up another joint, just a kingsize one, and started smoking it.
Light clouds quickly flowed through the stars and the last of the sunlight died. 

As I neared the end of the joint, we started saying little things that just had us laughing for ages. I started thinking of everything good and bad in life, and then started to feel quite sick, like I'd drunk too much alcohol. This passed shortly, and then my right leg started shaking uncontrollably. O laughed, because I was shaking the bench, and then all of a sudden my left leg started too. We laughed at this for about 5 minutes and then decided to head off to a set of tennis courts in the hope that some other people would be there. We walked in, and lay down on the tennis courts. I stared straight up at the sky and started thinking of when I was a little kid; I used to stare up at the sky during the day, the white clouds against the blue skies. Now I had grey clouds against a black sky. I kept thinking of all the ways I'd changed, how everything had gone wrong, how all my aspirations burned and all my love lost. I'd grown up and I'd hated it.

The trees bordered my vision and I got the nauseous feeling again. I sat there thinking about everything and decided to close my eyes. I kept thinking back to a time when I'd drunk about 1.5l of rum and felt like I was going to die. This felt like that.

We walked back to O's house and I rolled up a few more joints. We went around to another friends house, S and smoked these in her bedroom. Eventually we said our goodbyes and see you tommorows, and I headed off home.

I had a strange walk ahead of me, through groves of trees, with a pinprick of light at the end. I couldnt see my feet because of the dark. I usually would have been slightly nervous when sober, but the effects of the weed were just intensifying this. I felt incrediably scared, I was sure the grim reaper was following me. I kept repeating 'its just the drug, home is only a few minutes away', and got out of the first tunnel of trees.

Then the rain started. Gently it covered my face in a mist, and I started down the grassy hill, and got into the second tree-tunnel. I eventually got home, and it was about midnight. I went up to bed and experienced the spinning head I last remember with alcohol. It took me a long time to get to sleep, and thoughts raced through my head.

Anyway, looking back on it, the laughs I had on the bench were well worth it, and the spiritual aspects I experienced in the tennis courts were quite interesting and well worth 30mins of mildly severe fear.

To give a little background on myself, I am 16 years old and have been smoking for over a month now. I have had many problems with my dad and ended up going into a deep depression due to me not being able to express my emotions, but little did I know this was about to change.

Onto the trip, it was a good Wednesday morning, my friend spent the night as we were planning on going to the movies with two of our other more experienced stoner friends. So, we figure out the time and movie that we are going to see. The movie started at 11:40 and we got there around 11:20 or 11:30 giving us time to smoke a blunt in the car. About halfway through the smoking session one of my friends points out that it is already 11:45, so we finished up the blunt rather quickly and started walking to the theater.

By this time I am already feeling the effects. We get the tickets and find the theater, and by this time the lights are already off so we can't see a thing.

We were going to sit on the top row since we were in a small theater, so while walking up the seemingly endless stairs I realize that I won't be able to see if the stairs end and I will probably hit the seats at the top and fall. So I am trying to keep my balance as I take each step. Eventually I reach the top and like I had figured I hit the seats and stumbled, but I did not fall due to me holding the rail. I slide down a couple seats giving my friends room and I just relaxed.

It was probably about 5 more minutes and the movie started, I was reaching my climax at this point. The movie we were seeing was a Sci-Fi movie, so I knew that it was probably going to be frightening and verry strange. I was right, the movie was very odd and I had trouble keeping up with it. During the first ten minutes of the movie all I could see was a small part of the screen that I was focusing on and the rest was blurry. This being a quite frequent effect that I get I enjoyed it, moving my focus to different spots on the screen trying to guess what was going to happen, etc.

Enough about the movie, By the time I got home I was still decently high. Since my parents are divorced my dad calls me every other week on Wednesday. So it gets to that time and he calls, and due to the effects of the Marijuana without hesitation I told my father how I truly felt about what he has done. 

Without the help of Marijuana I believe that I would have ended in deep depression before this year ended, if not worse.

I will deffinitely continue my use of Marijuana.

Cannabis and Altered State of Mind

Its been a long time since my last dose of Bhang (dried and powdered Cannabis flowering tips ingested orally). The body grows and ages fast but the growth/decay of the soul is slower.

I was going through a phase of life where I felt that I was not in a very good place emotionally and it would not have been a good idea to take Cannabis at that time. Since then I have shifted home and am in a better place emotionally.

I haven't begun to grow Cannabis in my new place yet but  managed to get Bhang from a friend and took a pellet last week. Following is my trip report which is basically, as always, a list of some of the random thoughts and ideas that began to blitzkrieg my mind:

I live on the second floor of an apartment building and sat in my balcony looking out at the surrounding apartment buildings, the clothes hanging out to dry in the balconies flapping in the wind, the pigeons flying from one roof to another -all seem to come alive and were throbbing in synchrony with the music playing in my mobile.

Shapes can convey/invoke emotions. Figures and shapes with sharp edges are the creation of and appeal to the logical side of our minds whereas shapes with smooth curvaceous edges appeal to the emotional subconscious part of us.

Everything behaves according to their inert nature or Svabhava and Prakruti (Sanskrit). There is no free will. In order to exercise free will one needs to overcome ones inner embedded tendencies.

The human personality has three aspects - the Distracted Doer, the Tempter/Counselor and the Witness. The Distractor Doer is all the time distracted by the illusory nature of Reality or Maya. The Temptor/Counsellor guides/misguides you out of ignorance/wisdom. There is no separate Evil and Good or the Devil and Angel, two entities of voices that whisper in your ears. There is just one, like two sides of the coin who whisper to you. It is up to to the waking-discerning   Doer whether it makes this inner voice a tempter or a guide. The Witness, is just that,  a Witness. It is the unknowable super conscious part of us that only a lucky few can ever realize fully.

Written words too have an aura. The strength and nature of which depends on their meaning and the kind  of people who have been using them for centuries. Their energy of intention is embedded in them and when spoken out loudly with the right intention and energy they have the power to act on the material world. This is the science behind magical spells and mantras.

The Human mind is actually a cluster, consisting of and giving out parallel streams of thought/energy. To the normal waking mind, which is not under the influence of any psychotopic plant/drug and is therefore  slow at grasping these multiple stream of thoughts simultaneously, they seem to appear one after the other.  Under Cannabis, the mind is conscious of these simultaneous stream of thoughts and is able to look at each of them separately. But the speed at which these thoughts arise is mind boggling !! Perhaps in case of of  schizophrenics this cluster is in a reality-shattering overdrive.

Then there is also a parallel phenomenon  where a thought/intention arises followed by an emotion,  but to the normal mind it appears as one infused with other. We are incapable, therefore, of a pure thought or intention or feeling except under exceptional circumstances. If we were, we would be able to move mountains just with our minds !!  In Star Wars, Yoda tells his young apprentice  to 'Believe' when Luke is unable to lift X-wing out of the Dagobah swamp with his mind.

Most of our thoughts/intentions are infused with self-doubt/insecurity etc., all of which are different variations of the one primeval feeling of Fear. In Hindusim there is a universal blessing: Nirbhaya Bhava- be fearless.  Be fearless, of not some external mortal enemy, but your inner fears and self-doubts. Under the influence of Bhang I became actually aware of an intention to do something arising in my consciousness and then almost immediately a feeling of self-doubt or fear  piggyback riding on this intention, like a vampire, sucking out all the energy from it.  All those books teaching the power of positive thinking ask you to believe in yourself but do not teach you how to get rid of the claws of fear digging into your subconscious. This fear will be there as long as the Self identifies itself with the body, mind and ego.

Thoughts occur in a different plane/dimension which modern Science has yet to break into. Dreams are actually  the journeys of our conscious, sub-conscious and supra-conscious selves into their respective dimensions/planes of existence. We awake with distorted memories of these journeys. The enlightened souls come back with un-distorted memories.

The partaking of psychotropic substances in certain faiths -shaman, Sufism, Hinduism and others- is for the Guru to decipher/discern what state her/his disciple has reached in their spiritual journey. As change in perception induced by the drug and the consequent thoughts, emotions and visions that arise indicate the progress of the disciple.

The body is the product of our consciousness. The physical body arises out of our individual Consciousness and not the other way around.

Sound pollution is more damaging than chemical pollution as it effects our nervous system and hence our mental and emotional well being. In the long run the very nature of our consciousness will change. The polluting sounds have a suffocating effect blocking our nerves, nodes and glands. This renders us more and more insensitive/deaf to the subtle vibrations so essential for our spiritual growth.

In order to understand/realize certain concepts/ideas one needs to think with one's heart/emotional self rather than the logical mind. The heart too has a kind of intelligence, I would call it lateral intelligence.

Almost at the peak of my high, I switched on some hemi-sync music and lay down with my eyes closed. Withing a few moments I could feel a vibration in my fingers and toes, and a feeling that my body was preparing to lift off !! It was disorienting and a bit scary. And once fear entered my mind, it was over. Was I about to have an out of body experience (OBE) ? Perhaps I will try it next time around and might discover something.

Like any other day, my brother and I were driving to Ultimate Frisbee practice at the local park, rolling some joints and listening to Phish, when we met up with three other frisbee companions and proceeded to smoke all five joints in our van, when we finished, ready and in the proper state of mind for a serious game of frisbee, we stepped out of the billowing side door and walked from the parking lot five feet to the field. Immediately, I felt the calming effects of the tasty bud, and kept humming my favorite Phish song (bouncing around the room), when it happened. 

How can I accurately describe an out of body experience? It was like I was hanging from a nearby tree, watching myself walk slowly down the field. Id see myself, then see myself see myself, if that makes sense. I had a double out of body experience. I had a double out of body experience. 

Yet I was just walking down the sideline, it was like a movie, you know, where you could zoom in and out, make your own character, then BE the character. This whole action took about 30 seconds, but during that day I constantly felt this over and over, Ive never been that high and conscious since, but wouldnt hesitate to try again.

Potent BHO infused rock sugar candy.  I had a lot at the 420 rally. Its hits fast with in 20 minuets I felt it.  I wander off walking to a teahouse.  My memories from that point on happen in 20 second increments.  Like every 20 seconds I get to look through my own eyes. Dragged away from my memory I was in that moment. I could recall sobriety but it was fleeting.  Once at the bridge my movements became a bit stiff.  My ankles did not move as they should.  Gravity, it seemed had its thumb on my head and solders but this only slowed me down. No paranoid thoughts and just a bit nervous. 

My trek was over, I was home.  Got some food in me and I felt better but still stiff.  I then had a nap. Upon waking I continued eating small bits of candy every 1-2 hours. I was couch-locked and later at 2 am I went to sleep.

So basically I had 3 doses at once.  The jelly candy sample and the hard candy sample and my cookie. 

It affects my memory.  Memories don't record that well. This afternoon I went for a walk to ferry terminal.  As of now I only retained segmented fragments of that walk.  It was if I was home then at the park with little or no memories of the journey between the two. This trend continued over my walk.  I remember sitting at the ferry terminal then at the wooden steps of the graveyard then the last 20 feet to home. The feeling of sun on my skin was magnetic. I was intaking sunshine. About 2 Km round trip.

Its 6 o'clock now and the small bits of candy I had this morning are still affecting me.

For 20 bucks that jar of candy has over 30 doses for me at least.  That combined with my low tolerance for this stuff. Makes it a great deal.

All names have been changed to protect those involved.

A few years ago I was almost hit by a car, the driver of which turned out to be a merchant of the marijuana kind. After an exchange in numbers and an apology bud, I met up with a friend (male).  

We were both very into our puff at the time and liked to try different strains of the substance. I ended up with what is known as Afghan Kush. We went to the house of a friend and rolled up a smoke of the Afghan Kush to share with her and her boyfriend. 

Within half an hour of smoking this joint we felt a very intense fog settle on us. As I can't speak for everyone else, I  remember the high to be very thick and cloudy. Tobacco (as we all smoked) seemed to have a strange taste like a bonfire and our munchies, Haribo and pizza, tasted very very weird. I recall that the Haribo left a thick coating on my tongue that tasted amazing for a very long time. 

Around 3 - 4 hours after finishing the smoke, we slowly passed out watching a horror film which I would NOT recommend others try. Somehow I didn't have nightmares but watching the horror film was essentially self inflicting paranoia on myself. 

Overall I found the following: 
PROS: 

Strong buzz from a shared joint left me in no doubt as to the potency of this strain.
Very pleasant and euphoric-watch-the-world-go-by feeling.

CONS
Extreme munchies and dry mouth. I blame this single event for the reasons behind a filling (courtesy of the amount of Dr.Pepper I drank!). 
Easy to turn to a bad high if in the wrong environment.

It was a casual party with several friends, and we had just puffed a couple drags off of a shitty apple pipe. Some were drinking, but I was satisfied with the marijuana. As they were making noise downstairs, I was zoning out on a couch in the upper level. Eventually, I began what can only be explained as 'eating the sun'.

At first it seemed like nothing but a funny illusion at first, but as I thought about it later, I began to see the symbolism in it. I was thinking that it was now dark outside because I had eaten the sun as a result of innocent fun. Then it hit me: we  humans are eating away at the world around us. As we indulge in material goods to satisfy our greedy urges for what we percieve is happiness, we are destroying the true source of beauty and joy: our planet earth.

As it was now the night, dark and cold, I worried that it would stay this way. If we continue to harm the planet, it would be nothing but a dark and cold hell. Perhaps our destructive tendencies could even result in the sun itself ending prematurely. Everything seemed to connect, and that day I developed an even greater respect for the environment and nature than I already had. The following morning was perhaps the greatest part, for to my relief the sun had not been eaten.

So this is being written while I am tripping. Just want to start things off with that. 

I experience what are called 8b, and 8a level geometries at varying times. I see multiple dimensions and experience intense synesthesia. I have spiritual visions intensely as this is being practiced alongside Pagan Chaos Magick. 

I am watching fear and loathing at 10:55 PM at night and Im 15:52 into the movie. Raoul Duke is checking into the casino.

10:59 PM I am watching the movie. I began to come down a bit from the cannabis.

Reality has taken on a bright vibrant aesthetic that has a cartoonish or graphic novel feel to it.

That is all. I am gonna forget to finish this so thats all I have to report.

This trip was the best I've ever experienced on weed.  It was so intense yet, so relaxing.  It first started when I rode my bike over to my friends house still a little high.  Then we got buzzed at the house and had a cigarette or two.  Then his dealer came over and rolled us a fat joint.  We were so excited that we ran into the garage and got ready to hotbox this small ass little plymouth.  My friend took first hit then me.  9 hit's later I was laughing uncontrollably.  Then we calmed down and hit the bowl in my pipe.  I got three hits and was finally out.  By this time I was very blown and things I've never experienced before started to happen.  I started to see everything in red.  Then I looked at my friend and he look like a rubber tree with moving branches.  I thought the weed might have been laced, so I aksed him and he said no.  So we decided to go back into the house and this is where I started laughing uncontrollably again.  My friends suggested filming me and putting me on Guinness for ''most fucked up''.  But I said I'll pass  After I stopped laughing for like a half hour straight I laid down on the floor and everything just seemed like I was in total paradise.  I felt so free and so connected with myself that I just wanted to explode in joy and happiness.  I started to get hungry so I got some pizza and everyone else got Burger King.  I ate about 4 slices of pizza and then just went into a complete state of oblivion.  I listened to no one.  I was having the time of my life.  I cared about nothing.  I was like this for about 2 hours going in and out of this and other different states. I was too stoned to remember much but all I can tell you is that this was a life changing experience and may be too intense for some.  Overall I had a great time and I'm looking forward to being stoned this much again.

The first time I ever smoke weed I was when I was 15.  I was going to be home alone for about an hour, so I decided to take my ounce and brand new bong out for a test run.  I loaded a heavy bowl, smoked, and felt nothing.  But I was determined.  I smoked another bowl, and thought I wasn't high, but then stood up off my patio chair, and immediately plopped back down again.  The whole backyard swirled and I realized how much had smoked.  I walked back inside just as my parents pulled up the driveway, so I hid the bong and the rest of my stash in my room, and collected myself enough to go get a snack and BIG glass of cold water.  All I wanted was some water and chocolate chip cookies.

I threw in a movie (The Big Lebowski) and hung out for awhile.  By the time the movie ended I had eaten the entire box of cookies, and since it was about 11:00, everyone was asleep.  So I snuck back outside and smoked another bowl.  Now I felt on top of the world and very energetic.  I got my little brother (10 yrs old) to play tag with me in the house at 11:00 at night.  The next morning I woke in my bed, cookie crumbs and bottled water all over my room.  My brother said later to me that day that I was acting crazy last night.  I couldn't believe I got so high.

Ever since this experience, I've smoke weed atleast once a month with my friends just to hang out.  The best people to smoke with are ones who like good music, and are experinced smokers.  They'll keep you talking and ensure you have a good time. 

It's also good to be friends with some small-time dealers because A. I get the real hook-up and discounts, and B-they can always get me good shit and will never turn down a chance to smoke with me.  It's always fun to get a big circle together and pass around five or six pieces at once.  Everybody gets real high and someone always has something fun to say or do.

It was on December 4th 2004 and I had decided to do some weed with a 'cousin' of mine. I hadn't done any for over a year and was really excited. He brought some really expensive KB and while we were in his car at night around 9 p.m. we decided to do it in a crappy little side-street. I took the glass pipe and took 1-1/2 hits and it tasted really strong and bad. I opened the door and threw up a little. After a few seconds I felt sick and opened the door and threw up some more. My cousin asked me if I was OK and I said that it just tasted bad and that I didn't want to do anymore.

Once we started to ride off the street lights started to feel like they were blinking and time would go on strangely. Every other second would skip. I didn't think I would get high but I did (it must have been some strongass bud). Then I immediately fell into this trance that I will never ever forget. I slumped over in my seat and fell into this coma-like state. I started have memories from long ago come back (early early childhood)! I started to think that life was all one big dream and everything is a pattern and that I've already lived this life and will live it again and again. I thought that maybe I had this feeling every time I got high and that I just don't remember. Whenever I had a thought another idea would come over it and make me forget. I would come up with a conclusion in my head about life, the universe and everything and why this was happening to me but another thought would come over that and tell me that it's all a dream, but then another thought would tell me that that was a dream too. This would happen for what seriously felt like millions of years. I was very frightened yet I could not do anything.

We drove to a theater but when I got out I was acting and walking like a very drunk person so we went back in the car. When I put my seatbelt on or tried to take it off I couldn't and it felt like I did it hundreds of times. Everything I did would repeat and it was very annoying and frightening. My cousin told me that I passed out for a while and then I threw up on myself a whole shitload. I remember parking at a grocery store and waiting for him to buy paper towels, it felt like hours and I kept on looking around for cops (I have been arrested twice for possession and it was the worst things that ever happened to me and ever since I've been very paranoid). Once he came back he got me out of the car and cleaned it up and cleaned me up the best he could. I remember looking at him as a father figure (I don't know my biological father, but I don't normally think about him). We decided to go home and sleep.

When I saw my dad (not biological) I tried to talk as normal as I could but he noticed I was acting weird and asked me what was wrong. I told him I felt car sick and the macaroni I ate was bad, then I rushed to the bathroom and threw up. My dad heard me throwing up but I tried to convince him I was just a little sick. Then my cousin and I went downstairs to sleep and I immediately went to sleep on the sofa with my contacts and shoes and everything on. I fell asleep immediately. In the morning I was fine, but I kept on thinking about the night before over and over in my head.

Ever since (it's been a few months) I think about that night every day a few times a day and wonder what the fuck had happened. It was by far the most frightening yet interesting and enlightening moment in my life. I will never forget it. I don't know why it happened, whether it was because it was KB, or because I hadn't done weed in a long time or because I was scared and slightly depressed at the time. I promised to never to drugs again but that's bullshit because for 4/20 I bought some regular weed and have done it and it was like the old days (nothing weird). I also did Morning Glory seeds last night and the same thing almost happened to me once I entered a car. I can't fully explain what all I felt and thought that night but I wish everyone could experience some time in their lives. I had a kind of epiphany, I now am pretty sure I will grow up to be a world leader (maybe The World Leader)! It reminded me of Mein Kampf and what Hitler said happened to him after he got gassed in WW1. I lover marijuana and other drugs and hope they will be around for ever and that I can keep on doing them. I don't ever want that experience of Dec. 4th to happen to me again because I felt like I was stuck in it forever and forever. I will probably write a book about some time in my life if I can do it accurately.

 When I was growing up I always thought I would be the one person who would never try drugs. In eigth grade I was 'straight edge' The one night my cousin Shaunna was over. She is two years older than me and has tried many difftent drugs. My neighbor Tom used to grow his own weed and told me if I ever wanted to get high then I was welcome to come over. 

One night Shaunna was staying the night at my house and since it was so nice out we decided to sleep in my tent on our pool deck. At around one AM she suggested we go over to Toms and get high because she hadn't had any sine she moved down here two months ago. I agreed and we made sure my parents were asleep and jumped my fence and climbed rock stairs to Tom's house. He answered the door and knowing what we were there for led us too his back room.

I was feeling pretty nervous as I watched him pack a bowl. Shaunna told me to calm down and that I might not even feel much of anything since this was my first time. (By the way whoever came up with that dumb theory that you don't get high your first time is crazy) I took a couple of hits and I wasn't really feeling anything. Then when Shaunna went to go take her hit she put the bowl in to her mouth and tried to light the other end. I started laughing and I could not stop. I was laughing for at least a couple of minutes. I felt so happy and relaxed like nothing in the world could hurt me. 

At around four we decided to get back. This was the hard part. Like I said before we had to walk up the makeshift rock stairs and jump a fence to get back to my yard. I was behind Shaunna walking down the stairs and I tripped and we both ended up falling the rest of the way. We layed at the edge of the fence just giggling to ourselves and looking at the stars. Shaunna jumped the fence first and had no problems then it was my turn. Getting to the top wasn't bad but getting back down turned out to be a lot harder than it should have been. I ended up sitting at the top of the fence for about five minutes just laughing because it fasinated me that I could not get down.

When we finnaly got back to our tent we ate some chips and drank some Mountain Dew but everything tasted like chicken to me. (I have never had that feeling again) After our snack we just layed and after about fifteen minutes of talking about nothing we fell asleep.

Ever since then I have been an avid pot smoker. I am lucky I had a good first experiance with pot because I know a lot of people who didn't.

I've been a regular pot smoker for several years now and have always enjoyed its benefits both therapeutic and entertaining but just a few days ago I had one of the most unpleasant highs I've ever had in my life. One day out of curiosity I ingested about a half eighth of dried buds and to my surprise I didn't feel anything for the first hour. After the hour passed by I started having a pounding headache and every visual/sound I could see/hear irritated me a lot. Several minutes later I ran to the bathroom and started throwing up uncontrollably and then this paralized feeling overtook me. I could feel my buddy vibrating and getting heavier so I just laid down next to the toilet bowl with an agonizing headache without being able to move. A few minutes later I heared some noises and decided to try and sleep over my pain, so I headed to my room and just laid down on my bed with the lights off. The headache dissapeared and a few minutes later I fell asleep. The next morning I could feel a slight buzz and promised myself never to ingest so much cannabis again. Laying down and shut the lights off seemed to alleviate my pain to a certain degree.

Im now nervously flipped out in my bed wondering what has happend am I real?? Is anything real?? Is the music that is currently flooding into my de-activated flood gates real?? All this comming at once the thought of my burning stomach thinking that food poisoning be the only explaination in my simple confused paranoid mind.

Next im able to think but not able to control my body, where is my body taking me to, why can I only think and not feel or control my movement, (blank)(10mins which seems 200yr's later). My body stumbles to flip the switch of negative light. (thought returning to normal)

Oh jeez my stomach  (blank) ok theres the toilet goddammit I cant puke Im gonna die(blank)Now I have returned unknowingly to my domain where the box of flickering light is stored (strobe light) and the blanket of light containment is all set for visual abstraction.

Next I put my black blanket over my whole body not letting any light out. Then I combine the light emitter (strobe at full speed) with the blanket of light containment to bounce the light off the non stable fabric that is now a psychadelic tunnel of illusionary destruction in the form of purple red white and blue and some black and mostly grey. Sooner my mind drifts I close my eyes remove my glasses and stretch my eyelids with my eyelid muscles to make it so the skin blocking this visual box of madness thinner to make a snowy tv effect which soon turned of images of hell spawns with greenish grey wings and red eyes with various very detailed weapons and the whole time this is happening Im introduced to satanic sounds and sights which I dont go to church but yet still believe in heaven because its pretty stereotypical so to sum it up the mad flashing strobe is pulsing my mind and making fire shapes and weird illusions that where mostly dream like and un describable.

Next I came out of the blanket turned off my Kid-A cd and return to reality with me myself and my LAVA LAMP omfg the swirls of liquady green encrypt my mind with confusion so instinct pulls the plug out. Last for some reason I turned back on the flashing box from hell and have this very real clear image of my brain in front of me and this cold liquad metal being pushed through the top of it like forced through a small playdough cutter and filling up my black and white brain all while this is happening a very real feeling of what im seeing then(Blank). Morning.

P.S. what I learned from this experience was that this high is very hard to make happen again without very good funding and that marijuana is more than what people think.

[Erowid Note: 
Some authors report suspicions that their cannabis has been 'laced' (adulterated), in some cases, presumably with PCP. While this is possible, readers should be aware that idiosyncratic response to the effects of cannabis (usually higher doses) can lead some users to presume their cannabis has been 'laced'. There is no way to know if the cannabis in the report below was adulterated or not. Reports of plant material and cannabis laced with powerful synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive substances became more common starting in 2007.] 

One day me and my friend C were going to smoke some weed like we did every so often. I had bought a dime the day before.

Smoking it came with an unusual set of effects. Shortly after we had smoked it we were both seeing little slivers or crystals in our vision. It looked like everything we saw was broken down into little slivers. Also our hearing was incredibly strong.

We think it might have been laced, but it is probably just really strong stuff. I know from experience that there are all different kinds of weed, but this was something else.

Dabs

I am a college student who smokes marijuana every day. And I don't mean I have a bowl every night, I mean I smoke a lot of chronic often. My tolerance is without question extremely high. That said, last night I took a hit of hash through a hash piece. It was a good 7 second hit of incredible hash. It hit me like a ton of bricks. I had to immediately sit down I was so wrecked.

Then it got interesting. First, I was able to hear every conversation in a room. Its like my selected hearing didn't exist. I felt like I was getting sensory overload, similar to tripping.

Twice during a 3 hour period I felt like I was in a different place. The first time I imagined hard a future event, but it felt so real. The next time I had an incredibly real flashback to events from a few years ago. All this time I was still able to converse with friends in the room. 

Once it finally died down I realized without a doubt this was one of the craziest highs of my life. It was like one of the first times smoking again.

It was the 4th of July and I went to my good friend, Robert's house for the night.  When I got there he was packin' a bowl.  I had smoked weed before, but I NEVER thought weed could do this to me.  I smoked that bowl with him and I felt a 'normal' high (reality seen as a picture show, etc.) within a very short amount of time.

We watched the infamous, stoner's favorite movie, 'Half Baked.'  Our friend Kris came over after that and we smoked another bowl.  Then I put one together and we smoked it (I make a TIGHT bowl!).  Afterwards, we WALKED to Kris's house and I felt like I was floating, like my feet weren't touching the ground.  I didn't talk much either..I don't think I talked at all really.  But we got to Kris's house and went to the basement where the band equipment is set up and all.

Robert started playing guitar and it echoed in my head as I sat on the l33t0 couch watching Kris messing with the sound.  We decided to go upstairs, stairs, not a good idea, they don't look real.  When we got up there they supplied me with my own water bong to toke up on, plus Robert brought his bowl and Kris had Robert's water b-iz-ong too.  I smoked mine, and helped them smoke their's.

You know when you over-focus your eyes and everything gets blurry?  Well that's what happend, but it was constantly.  I just sat there and watched TV.  I didn't blink.  That's not even the beginning of the story though.  I got home at around 12midnight (my mom picked me up).  The next morning I had to get up at 6:30 to go to Hershey Park with my friend, Jamie.  Even though the high was pretty much gone, I still didn't feel 'myself'.

Everything that happened felt like a dream 5 minutes (or so it seemed) later.  We rode ALL of the rollercoasters and none of them scared me.  I was just like, 'Let's go for it.' Because I had no remembrance of it afterwards.  I saw a picture of me on one of the coasters and I was all 'zoned out' like I was just sitting at home like a lazy ass as usual.  I'm kind of upset that I got to miss the reality of the Amusement Park being that I don't get to go to them often.  But the feeling was great!  I had to literally hold on to Jamie because I wasn't aware of where I was, what I was doing, or where I was going.  The munchies hit me later though and I had to pay $20 in Hershey for a pizza!

This really didn't wear off until later that night when I was getting ready to go to sleep.  I must say it was great, but I wouldn't choose weed as a 'choice drug'. I like to know how reality works, I want to be able to dig deep into everything when I'm on a drug.  That's why I now choose to do Amphetamines as opposed to forgetting things and acting dumb.  But that's another story.  Everything is Eventual.

P.S.  My mom never knew that I was high, but the other night when one of my other friends stayed the night.  She thought we were high as hell and it took a lot of convincing for her to believe that we weren't.

The set and setting was saturday night, alone, off my meds (Risperidone, escitalopram and divalproex) and I was playing video games. Someone online told me they were tripping on DXM and I wanted to level up so I took one big rip. 

I set my pipe down and the effect started with a build up of euphoria that couldn't get stronger when my brother walked in my trailer and startled me and I told him I'm really high and all I was experiencing was ETERNALNESS and he laughed. He wanted too borrow my pipe and we couldn't find it so were going on a trip trying too find it when I joke maybe it dissolved into the cosmic void! When he found it and we started having a talk which I barely remember, he walked out we said our yadda yadda goodbyes. 

I walked outside smoking a cigarette and I felt like my thoughts were a bunch of fishes in the sea of awareness who's liquid was changed to weed juice and like the mind was a totally maluable object, and that I am a lightbulb of awareness as we all are. My high settled down and I wrote this in my journal midway between a buzz and a high.

my fingers + weed= bixsexually enlightened me

I had just smoked weed with a bunch of my friends earlier. I came home pretty late and thought I should try to fall asleep. I usually masturbate before going to bed to help me relax. To me, masturbating baked is just Divine. I was going through the usual things I fantasize about and I also recently saw The Dark Knight. I started fantasizing about the Joker, imagining myself as his evil sidekick/lover. I was trying really desperately to get off but it just wasn't working. I thought to myself, 'hey, I tell everyone I'm bisexual, why don't I think about some chicks?' I started imagining myself having lesbian sex with a girl who was a cross between Harley Quinn (the Jester Girl) and Catwoman. Then somehow they both morphed into me and I was literally fucking myself like two clones. Then as I orgasmed it dawned to me. The only way you can truly know if your gay is if you get off on the opposite sex, which I did for the first time. I've fooled around with girls before and I'm very open about my sexuality but this was the first time I imagined such a scenario on my own. Any girl could just kiss another and proclaim she was bisexual, but in reality that doesn't mean shit. What I had was a profound enlightening experience. It was truly amazing and one of the best sexual/spiritual experience I've ever masturbating alone.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

The first time I smoked I didn't feel anything. I can always remember what happens when I smoke. I never lose memory. Maybe time but never memory. My boyfriend showed it to me when I was in college. I was never pressured into it, I was always offered as something polite but was never chastised for declining. After a few times I let my body start slipping into what I guess I call high space. I love being outside when I'm high, the stars seems so much brighter, better somehow. I love to get lost in them. Music changes my high, it shakes my body and makes me smile a lot. When I am high I am not paranoid, scared, nor do I freak out. I smile a ton! I laugh, I can dance, and drive. The great part about my being high is the calm I feel. I also love the body tingle I get. Small movements feel like a wave of motion, it's really quite amazing. Being high is definitely better with friends, even if they don't smoke with you. Its nice to be around people.

A kind patron of the arts brought my band a sheet of cookies and a sheet of brownies both made with cannabutter to eat while recording a song. I hadn't eaten anything that day, and very little the day before, so I ate half of the cookies, and half of the brownies. The two batches of baked good had been made with 1 lb of cannabutter total, and each lb of cannabutter contained 1/4lb of trim, so I effectively ate somewhere in the range of an eighth of a pound of pot within the span of a few hours. 

Long story very short, my world was spinning non-stop, I felt very very nauseous (a few dry heaves but no vomiting) and I was capable of sleeping absolutely anywhere (and oh boy, did I sleep). Smoked a few bowls, and I was just thrown over the edge. Band recorded the whole damn song without me, and I didn't even remember what it sounded like in the morning. 

On the whole, not really suggestible if productivity is in mind. It was sort of fun, albeit, incredibly intense and a day down the drain (and I do mean the whole, 24 hour day).

We had a gram of hash that was hard to scrape into filings for smoking.  I've always been adverse to smoking anything, so I suggested we try making hash tea.

We wrapped the cube in a cloth and smashed it with a hammer with one blow.  There being four of us I heated 4 cups of water in a saucepan to a boil, reduced heat to a simmer, and added the crushed cube.  Unscientifically, I simply let it simmer until an amber colour developed, which was about 30 minutes.

I portioned the brew into the cups and we sipped slowly as we conversed.  It tasted slightly bitter but actually it was rather good.  At first, we thought the experiment was a failure.  But, as we continued to socialize there came a point within 30-60 minutes where we realized that we were already in an altered state.  It sort of crept up on us unawares. Most pleasant.

One night me and a few buddies were just driving and we decided to head on over to a buddies house to smoke some.  About an hour before we went over to his house, I smoked a bowl by myself of some pretty dank stuff.  Anyways so we go over there and I've never smoked out of a bong before so I take 4 good hits and WOW I've never ever felt like that before in my life.  So we walk to the dude's car to chill in and all of a sudden my heart starts beating so fucking fast.  This freaks me out.  At this point I didn't know weed could do that so I was like what the hell was that we smoked?  Well the dude says it was laced w/ PCP.....at this point I freak out on him and start yelling and shit but he says he was just kidding.  So at this point I could barely concentrate and my throat felt like it was trying to close(??) or something like that.  Scary.  I pretty much felt like I was going to die so I got very very scared.  So they drop me off at my house and it feels like I'm in a foreign place.  I try to eat a swiss cake and I can't even get it down because my mouth is so dry.  When I went to sleep that night I thought I was going to die.  I wake up the next day for school and I'm not high but I'm really like anxious and jumpy and all this.  My body felt realyl weird like all tense for the next week or so but then it went away.  Was it laced with PCP??? I don't know.  I don't think I want to know either.  All I know is that pot is more potent than some people think.  I've had a lot of fun with pot before but that fun was because I'd get stoned and all it would do is make me chill out and enjoy food and music a lot more but this was nothing like that.

First Times

I have been in a family where all my brothers have smoked weed. I have always wanted to know what it felt like and it was very easy to get in a small town where there was nothing to do but smoke or get wasted. My neighbor had been a smoker for years and he had just got this bong. He asked if I wanted to do some and like any curious kid would do I gladly accepted.

I lit the bowl, I lifted it up, and a sudden rush of smoke came into my lungs and killing my brain. I am happy to report that it was a magnificent feeling even though I almost threw up. After I took the one single hit I was 'high'. I knew I was high because when I walked into his house everything as I have seen before was in a different perspective. We sat on the couch to watch this funny movie. Then next thing I know I was eating a bowl of Fruit Loops laughing extremely harder than usual. It was late so I went home. On the way to my house I heard a train. It was if I was standing right next to it. I also heard birds right next to me. I stood outside for a while because my parents were still awake and I was way too messed up for them to see me. Finally when my parents fell asleep I went inside when my brother walked by me and said,'your high aren't you'. I didnt lie to him. He took me into his room and showed me a 'blunt'. We both went outside to smoke it and when I went inside I had a different 'high'. I sat on my couch not laughing and acting wild but I was calm and cool. I was in love with the way this green substance made me feel. I now stand here today and can proudly say I do not regret lighting up my first bowl of weed.

While I was on my 10 day leave after boot camp and before combat training, I stupidly decided to smoke marijuana knowing I would receive a urinalysis at the end of it.  About 4 or 5 days into leave I shared a bowl of mid-grade cannabis between two friends and myself.  At 8.5 days (1.5 days before test!) I was intoxicated from alcohol and took 2 hits from a joint of low grade cannabis.  Needless to say I felt like a complete idiot the next day.

From this point on I began drinking more water than usual and I purchased a 40 dollar system-cleansing drink from a vitamin shop.  I did not exercise or do much physical activity during this time.   I consumed the drink about 7 to 9 hours before the test, and drank a moderate amount of water after this.  About 30 minutes before the test I drank a large amount of water. When I took the test my urine was almost clear.

I passed the test and I am grateful for it.  I think I was lucky considering the short time between smoking and the test.

Before starting the report, I'd like to say that I dont have a very advanced english, so sorry about that.

Friday night, around 9pm, I was hanging out with friends, playing gta 5 and smoking some cigarretes, pretty chill, so we decided is was a good idea to meet with a friend who had cannabis, before we left the house We drinked some vodka, I drank 1 big shot, all my friends drank the same, and we left.

We reached this friend house around 10:35 pm and before started smoking, we had a beer, I almost drank it all myself, then we started smoking. I smoked 2 big hits of a very low quality weed (I'm from Argentina and having dank buds its extremely expensive, normally we smoke this thing we call 'prensado'). It took around 2 minutes to hit. 

10 minutes after it hit I was totally baked, barely could walk, and only could only say around 3 words, I think its important to say that I dont smoke regularly and I have a really low tolerance to THC, however this never happened to me, at the moment I was feeling extremely paranoid and my thoughts were very slow. I had to stop to rest a little bit on every block, it was imposible to walk in a straight line. My friends were helping me to walk, we had to walk around 25 blocks to reach my home. 

All my memories after we started walking just dissapeared, I remember I asked the hour a couple times, first time I asked it was 10:50, second time it was 12:35 am. My time perception was really distorted, and I dont know exactly why it took us so long to reach my home. When we reached my home I said goodbye to my friends and entered my home, I could not fucking describe how beautifull it was to throw myself to bed, all the paranoia was gone, it was all solved, it was beautiful. I eat something and sleeped feeling like god. 

The morning after I was still really buzzy, and wondering why the fuck 2 hits of a low quality joint hit me that much.

Walking home after smoking so much weed I felt like I was a big system, I felt like I was a robot so I had to consciencely tell my legs where to go with each step feeling like a earthquake of euphoric sensations.

After a minute I had audial hallucinatons. Sounding like waves of a harp like noise plus some weird bass/beat all in sync.  I was walking a few miles with fattest grin of my life, (this wasn't my first time or anywhere near) I tried to grab my face and physically change the smile, my face felt like rubber, I couldn't  remove the smile I was too happy. 

When I arrived home I made some cereal because munchies, it tasted a lot more intense and I could feel the chewing more.  I turned a call of duty game on and was utterly destroying the other team without even thinking hard, it was like my subconscious was focusing on the game  like my life depended on it but consciously I was in space, one of my best highs in my life,

I was just playing rummy and listening to some music with my brothers. We smoked two good bowls, 1 from each of us. I don't smoke often so I really felt it rip me up tonight. I felt like we were floating over the rummy cards as were if we were the cards being put down also! It was hard to concentrate and keep focus. I played a few wrong moves over the games due to going to space at the moment. Then I would laugh after realizing it and my brother would be unimpressed. We both would laugh at a few things over the games. I felt like I was on clouds. I do not feel like moving. I have a light feeling and getting ready to go to bed to float to some music while I drift off. phew was baked! I still am as I write this short after this experience. I am so relaxed now. Good times.

Weed is really the only drug I've tried. No hard drugs or anything like that. Now I'm 15...

Its a school night, I finished all my homework, so why not smoke a few bowls (out of a homemade bong thing)? I did that, and just sort of read a book until I felt it. When I did feel it I was a little jittery and couldn't focus on the book. I felt like just lying down, so I turned off the lights and did that.

At this point I felt calm and relaxed. I put on my earphones and listened to the band 'Rush' for quite a while. The feeling is amazing. Just complete bliss, and listening to meaningful music. I was transfixed in a way... Just lying down, sometimes touching my face because it felt soft for some reason, and enjoying the music. I laugh about me singing loudly to that music now, but I immensely enjoyed it. This just continued until I fell asleep.

This has never happened before when I smoked.. and it hasn't happened since. But it was one of the best times smoking, and I hope I can achieve it again sometime.

I will make this short. One night me and my friends got a hotel room and decided to kick it. Me and my friends smoked the whole blunt and start drinking again. One of my friends curled up and went to bed almost immediately after smoking the joint, the other one kindda lay down on the bed. Approximately 5 minutes after smoking I felt this intense rush going through my head and my heart start to beat fast as hell. I could hear my heart pound like crazy. I felt like I was losing my mind and almost wanted to kill myself just to stop what was happening. I couldn't really tell if I was feeling cold or hot, so I hopped in the shower and doused myself with water just to feel cold again so I would turn the water hot , and feel hotter , so I would turn it cold again - I felt like I was in hell lol. It finally wore off after a couple hours. It was one of the scariest moments of my life, I hate to lose control of myself so I will let off the weed for a while. thanks for reading

I have just smoked a bowl and as I am beginning to feel the warm onset of dope pleasure I am thinking about what Marijuana has done to me. I've only been smoking for a year and-a-half, but my life has definitely changed since that first waterfall. My taste in music has become broadened, I am a calmer person. I feel more generous and loving towards my friends. I think that in general it has made me a better person. I can see the beauty in everything, from a butterfly on a flower to the view of a night city from high up. However I do feel that Anti-Motivational Syndrome is a real thing, but I have tried to be a 'responsible' user and  always tried to complete my studies.

I had smoked weed on a couple of occasions before I decided to cook with pot. My friend 'K' had told that when you eat your pot you get a much different high than if you had smoked it, and I was eager to experiment. I searched the web for an easy recipe, and I found one that involved crackers and peanut butter. I chopped a fairly large nug (about 2 grams) of silver haze into fine shake, spread the crackers with peanut butter, and sandwiched the weed between them. I wrapped the 'Firecrakers' in foil, and heated them over a gas stove for a good ten minutes. After they were cooked, I popped one in my mouth and waited. After thirty minutes I felt nothing, so I ate the other sandwich.

About an hour after eating the first sandwich, it hit me HARD. I was watching Chappelle's show, And I noticed that I had an arm like a cat's. My watch became a stripe, my hair was fur, and my fingers were claws! I had never experienced anything like this after smoking, this was amazing. My high continued escalating to the point where I could not get up out of my bed, my legs had become part of the bed, like they melted together. about six hours after ingesting my first cracker, my parents came home,and I was still high. My mother came to say goodnight, and I was barely able to utter goodnight. I slipped into deep sleep and to my amazement, when I awoke, I was still fucking high. After sixteen amazing hours I started to come down. This was an experience to remember.

This was so weird. I thought I would share this with you. This was by far the craziest high I have ever experienced.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

Well, one day in July, I was at my swim club. I meet a guy. W got to talking and he said he had some dank nugs in his car. I agreed and threw in 5 dollars to compensate the cost. We approached his car. He packed the biggest glass bowl I had ever seen. We got to smoking. I didnt feel high towards the end. As soon as I got out of the car. That was when it all kicked in. My Beautiful vision of a bright day turned into a dark night. I got on my bike, and began to ride home. The color of the sky was changing with multiple different colors. As soon as I got to my home I realized that the high was extremely unmanagable. I went to my room,  turned on the tv and layed down. I watch a episode of family guy. As soon as I turned of the tv, I turned my head and my vision faded behind me. I closed my eyes for a little while. When I opened them up, I saw clocks all over my wall, everywhere. I went to sleep and that was it.

So here is the story I had quit smoking marijuana for about 6 months for probation and I was very excited about being able to smoke again.  A couple of my friends and I got together because we were all going of to college or starting to work.  So my buddy picked up a cople grams of purple haze and we used my buddy's bong that had an ice catcher which we filled with ice.  So we passed the bong around once and we each took our hit and started coughing like crazy and all of of a sudden I started puking my brains out.  I couldn't stop throwing up for a good 10 minutes and then I came back and sat down.  I took another hit and I began dry heaving for about 5 minutes really bad and then my body just went limp, I felt as if I were paralyzed.  But overall all I could say to my boys is  'thats some good weed' (thats what I said when I came back from puking).

I skipped out on class and went with some friends to smoke some weed. We were 4 and we smoked about 6 grams in total.

It was all fun and we were laughing for the first hour or two. Then 2 of my friends went home and me and the other guy went to mall to get something to eat.

After we ate, we went out for a cigarette through the emergency fire escape door. After we finished the cigarettes, he left to go home, I started walking to take the city bus.

I started to feel really heavy, I couldn't even scratch my head because my arm felt so heavy. I started to sweat but at the same time I was feeling really cold, I could barely see anymore, I could only see one thing and the backround was all black. For example, I would look at a car and it would be all I see nothin else. 

I just sat down next to the wall and curled up into a ball and just watched people pass by for about 2 hours.

When I got home I just passed out on the couch.

Last summer I was 14 (I am 15 about to turn 16 in 2 months) I tried weed for the first time and I loved it I laughed hours on end. After this experience I smoked more often about a few times a month. February of this year I started hanging out with this girl who bought a dime to 3 20's a day we would finish all of it and be high for hours I would go to her apartment EVERY single day and smoke and I love the feeling of being high from Marijuana. It is now July 2004 and I haven't been sober since February.

I have to smoke at least once a day or I get depressed and get in a pissed off mood I mean I know Marijuana isn't physically addictive but I'm addicted in a psychological way. Everytime my high comes down I always say I need more wanting to keep the high going of course. I have had other experiences with other drugs such as Alcohol, Shrooms, LSD, PCP, Coke, Xanax & Vicodin and I find Marijuana to have the best effects on me.

More than an hour of sleep close state. Can't perceive any sense of time. Sometimes waking up to the fact that my breathing had turned to be manual.  This occassion is covered with some kind of dream like vision of people entering the door. Numb hands, heavy heart rate, motorical funcions on.  I can hold the bottle but only with visual feedback. After drinking some water less physical hardness. 

4 hours of sleep with vivid dreams about people entering the door - leaving me sedated. Consciousness takes over about 3 times, dreaming patterned thought flows while awake.  After another 4 hours of sleep, waking up dizzy sober.

[Erowid Note: 
Some authors report suspicions that their cannabis has been 'laced' (adulterated), in some cases, presumably with PCP. While this is possible, readers should be aware that idiosyncratic response to the effects of cannabis (usually higher doses) can lead some users to presume their cannabis has been 'laced'. There is no way to know if the cannabis in the report below was adulterated or not. Reports of plant material and cannabis laced with powerful synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive substances became more common starting in 2007.] 

Last night I smoked some weed laced with, I didnt know at the time, PCP. This bong was crazy it costed well over 400 dollars and all I needed was one hit to send me flying around. I started to get a little confused/shocked feeling in about five minutes but the real effects didnt set in until about 15 minutes later. Normally I am a fun, giggly, talkative person when I am high but this was much different and I knew right away this wasnt just any weed. 

Sumblime was playing and it felt as if the room was swaying to the music and it wouldnt stop, almost like being drunk but in a weird way. I also found that during this time my throat was hurting intensely, it felt so dry but no matter what I would drink I could NOT quench it. I remember describing to my friend that my throat kept 'going up in the back all tight.' I think that I must have been clenching it or something I have no idea.

I spent a lot of time last night trying to sort myself out, trying to come down a little and figure out if I was acting weird and what my body was doing. But only after my friend pointed it out I realized my whole entire body was shaking and my feet felt like they were in small pools of water. (Now that I think back on it I might have been cold but I remember feeling hot.) I then convinced myself that my foot was asleep and thats why I was feeling so out of it and I kept telling my friends ' I figured it out, I figured it all out.' My body felt extremely disconnected, which made me feel a little bit stupid because I couldn't really control myself. 

Then about 30 minutes into it I felt drenched, I thought someone poured water on me but I wasnt sweating or anything. Then I sit up straighter and realized that everything looked so weird, I felt like we were in some sort of production like a music video. Then I got scared that everyone was judging me and thought I was the only fucked up one, I kept asking if anyone else hit the bong. I no longer felt in place, I felt outcasted and started to worry about every little move I made, I didnt want to look stupid. Then all of the sudden I just decided that I needed to cheer myself up so I said 'guys we have to think positively you shouldnt care what people think about you' apparently it was a really random statement because everybody got a real laugh but it really helped my trip get better.

After I started to settle myself down all I could think about was birthday cake, I had a bad craving to go to the grocery store and just explore but I had to go home. When I got up I felt a huge head rush because I hadn't gotten up that whole time and I felt extremely uncoordinated like I was drunk. 

Overall it was a pretty interesting experience that lasted intensely for about 5 hours but I still feel some effects today and last night I didnt sleep at all, or maybe I did. It was weird I couldnt tell if I was sleeping or awake and it didnt help that I went home alone. 

Today, I feel a little strange almost like I'm just at the very very end of a normal high. Groggy, incoordinated and a little awkward. And I can honestly say that I do not know how I got home but that my friend drove.

One beautiful Thursday night me and my friend...let's call him Jeff...we decided to go for a smoke. So we walked to the local park and when we arrived another 3 of our buds (malcom, des and ryan) showed up out of nowhere. So I asked them 'Are you guys here for the same reason we are?' They nodded. 

Malcom pulled out 2 joints each with .5g in them.  We lit them up and passed them around. It was very unusual. It didn't feel strong at first but it had an afterburn. About a minute after I toked I started coughing like crazy. 

After finishing both joints we decided to leave the area and continue to a new one. Malcom said we had to find the silver left from captain gold. At this point all 5 of us were completely stoned. This was REALLY good weed. We wanted to hit up my bong but we had no water. I then saw a little puddle of water left from the rain of the previous night. All of us were too stoned to care. So I filled it up and we hit a couple bowls. 

We continued walking down the path...I really forget where we went from there...oh ya...we continued down the path and I found a broken tv under a tree. I was very excited at the sight of this. I ran up and tried to rip a piece of the glass out, resulting in me cutting my hands up. 

We then found ourselves at a quickie but we only had $1. So we just bought 3 airheads. I forget where we went from there but we somehow ended up at malcom's house and Jeff had vanished. when we got there...we ate.

They listened to some music and I sat and thought. The 1st dimension is side to side the 2nd is up and down and the 3rd is forward and back. The fourth dimension is time, which for the moment we'll say time is a line of time, we can go forward in time and perhaps back in time. So the fifth dimension would be side to side on this plane of 'time' and the 6th would be up and down. The thought of this made me feel as if I had just figured something amazing out. Then I thought to myself that this must be the answer to time travel. The rest of the night was spent eating bread, white chocolate chips, mustard and hot sauce. As me Ryan and des walked home, we ran into malcom's older brother in his van. He offered us some sniffing tobacco. We all tried it. It felt kinda minty. I don't remember what happened after that but I remember listening to stairway to heaven by led zeppelin and I could hear the wood of the drum sticks hitting the drums. The next thing I remember I was in english class the next morning. But that must have been the best weed I've ever had. I'm planning to get some more.

Some time ago I embarked with fellow students from my University to Amsterdam to sample the local culture. I ended up speaking to another student from Manchester, who introduced me to Super-Skunk at one of the venues in the city. After taking our seats and acquiring a certain amount of the substance, rolled nicely into a 'doobie', I proceeded to smoke the joint. 

After a few tokes, I began to feel very odd indeed and very quickly it appeared as if time was going backwards. After that I stumbled back to the hostel, where I was staying, and began to panic. The chemical wore-off after a couple of hours and, thankfully, there was someone there who helped to allay my fears. All-in-all, an awful experience that in retrospect I was very unprepared for. That said, I am still inspired by Aldous Huxleys The Doors of Perception and look forward to experimenting further in the future. The more we understand the effects of all dopes, the better they can be applied in future.

I had been smoking every night for about 6 months, and had started smoking about 8 months before this night. I had had a couple 'bad' highs, the first time I really felt the effects, I flipped out to some degree, but it hadn't happened in quite a long time. 

I had about 3/4 a gram of some herb that I used to pack a bowl with, I got into my normal position, which is just sitting on my floor next to my open window, so I could blow the smoke out of my window, cause the whole thing was very under the radar, not wanting to get caught. Anyways I smoked most the bowl, and realized I could barely even hold the bowl anymore, and that the last 2 or 3 hits I wasn't even aligning the lighter and bowl correctly. I took this as a sign that I probably had smoked enough for the night. 

I must have went through my normal routine of covering everything up and hiding my bowl, but I don't really recall any of it. After this I, to great disappointment, realized that I didn't have my CD player in my room, and was gonna hafta enjoy this high music free. I was getting into bed, and thought I saw lights coming on in the hallway outside my room, which freaked me out, but I tried to remain calm, and go on with going to sleep. I turned out my light got into bed, fully clothed and with a beanie hat on, for some reason, and just sat there. I started to enjoy the music I was listening too, and then realized, there was no music playing, but in my head it was just as real as if I had my CD player on. 

at first I enjoyed it, but for some reason, it suddenly freaked me out, then the beanie I had on felt like just billions of needles all poking into my head, I ripped it off, but immidiatly felt the same sensation all over my body, and took off everything but my boxers. During this my heart had started beating very rapidly, and I began thinking unfavorably of death, and it didn't seem altogether out of the question. 

The music at some point had then turned into voices and noises. I could hear my whole family outside my door, all knowing I was high as a kite, and then I could hear my door knob rattling and shaking, and knew they were all trying to get in my room, I realized I was shaking uncontrollably, and instantly thought that the best way to avoid getting caught was to play that I was asleep. I became very still, and just waited for the door to open, and my family to burst into my room, but it never came. 

I realized none of it was real, and then went through two more similar experiences like the one that had just happened. I finally calmed down, and fell asleep. The odd thing was the next day, I looked back on the experience somewhat favorably, at the time I was terrified, but looking back, I enjoyed it to a degree.

Time: A little after sunset, still light out Location: Lawnchair in my backyard

So I'm in my backyard, just got home from a good day of blazing and walking around the forest. Decide to grind up a sesh before going inside. Drop two fat bowls out of my bong. Feeling right stoned so I lay my head back on the lawnchair and close my eyes. I instantly notice orange at the bottom of my closed eye vision, which shifts into a large circle, I now realize I am standing on a large orange sphere and can look around, looking up I see more orange spheres which reminded me of planets at the time and decide to jump to one of them, I then continued to jump between planets until I opened my eyes and went inside.

I have been smoking marijuana for about 18 months now, so I'd say I have reasonable experience with it. But something really weird happened a few months ago. Me and some friends were hanging out, and we decided to buy some weed. We bought a gram each of this new crazy hydro stuff that was in town at the time. We sat down, and I I whizzed it up, I felt excited that this would be a new experience. How right I was. We passed the bong around, and afterward I realized I should have only had 1 cone and waited, but had 3 in succession. It kicked in hard. I felt my face go cold, I was laughing hysterically, almost passing out. But did I stop there? NO. I smoked the rest of my gram.

1 hour later
I could not feel below my neck. I was kinda scared that I was paralyzed. Then I started rubbing my head against the couch and it was burning so I thought my hair was on fire.

All in all it was a crazy night. Still fun but crazy.

I am an autistic (Aspergers Syndrome) somewhat depressive young lad, or at least I was back in the sober days. My mind seemed like it was on it's own world, of course heavy autism and abusive parenting'll do that to me. I hadn't gotten very many friends, of course the ones I did have I was loyal to, and had known for upwards of 10 years. I was very argumentative and almost insane by most standards, though I had always been incredibly smart.

My family didn't seem to mind that I was interested in drugs of all kinds since early childhood. By age 13, my mother dealt LSD in her school girls bathroom and was an intense druggie since age 11. My father was an alcoholic, my step father had tried every drug that I know of, from Cocaine to Crack to Heroin to LSD, he'd been addicted to it at some point in time. My brother's fate was much the same, so it comes as no shock that an interest wouldn't scare them at all.

My first dose was on my 13th birthday at 3AM. I was the only one who wasn't drunk, but every time I had gotten drunk at that point I made an ass out of myself, so I wanted to steer clear of alcohol that night. Some of my older brother's friends had the idea to split a joint with me, and I heartily accepted. After 3 hits I was extremely baked. I later found out that my mother was a stoner while pregnant with me as well, so THC had already been introduced into my system years beforehand. I spent the time playing a Prince of Persia game I had received that year, when my ex-druggie brother walked in and asked me how I was feeling. What I was thinking was, 'Pretty good, but my mouth's a bit dry.' whereas what I said was, 'Get the penis outta your bum and start being Jeffrey Dahmer.' I was legendarily baked, and that was clear to my older brother at that point in time.

Skip forward to the end of that month where I try to get some weed from an Ecstasy dealer my brother used to go to. I got ripped off obviously, but I later found out that he had actually been chased out of the building by someone he had hit over the head with a wrench earlier that day, and also that some of my brother's friends had beaten him up for ripping me off, and so to repay me at lunch on a monday when I was walking back to school, he handed me a baggie with 0.5 grams of bad hash oil in it. This promptly caused the most awkward school day of my life, because I was in grade 8 and trying to figure out where to hide very potent smelling drugs. I put it in my pocket for the rest of the day, and although every single teacher knew exactly what I was doing and what was in my pocket (the smell of bad marijuana filled the room) but I was so far in every teacher's good books by default for reasons unknown (teachers always have and always will adore me for absolutely no reason) that they never said anything and let me go home at the end of the day without so much as a disapproving glance. My brother promptly taught me how to smoke oil, how to make  a pipe from a water bottle and how to make a bong from a water bottle.

Skip forward a week when my weed supply runs out. My brother decided to get me a 1.5 piece as well as hook me up with an amazing dealer, and another less amazing dealer that just so happens to be the drug kingpin of my town. I was planning on requesting instructions on how to roll a joint, but when I tried I succeeded.  Everyone in my family jokes that I inherited the ability to roll a joint from my mother, but I will never be able to roll the perfect joint like my mother can. (They have less imperfections than fucking factory made cigarettes!) From this point on things get royally fucked up!

I had started using weed as a coping method for school, and holy shit did I do a lot of it at school! I went to school baked every day for multiple years without exception, and I keep that record even today. At this point, I noticed a few things changed in my life significantly. Puberty is the only thing that compares to how many changes I went through at this stage of my life, only puberty was far more mild and these changes occurred literally overnight. I suddenly realized that I liked music, something that I absolutely hated earlier on in life, and I also noticed that I began to form genuine opinions of things rather than my mind being comprised of mathematics and fucked up algorithms without any real feelings towards anything. I had noticed that I felt genuine emotions and I learned to appreciate the little things in life. Instead of being constantly depressed, I was amused with my life and I was genuinely happy. I had never experienced true happiness before this point. It was truly a miracle.

The best trip in my life (no, I've never had a bad trip) happened when my brother's best friend came into town. It was a total shock to him that I had become a total stoner since the last time I had seen him, so as a token of good will (and because he had no way of smuggling that stuff to his new home) he gave me a mini pipe with a built in stash and resin holder (it's an inch long and 4 centimeters thick) and a pipe from Israel. It is by far the most awesome pipe I've ever seen, to this day. To celebrate these new items of mine, we decided to try them out. I smoked a full gram that day. We then went to my room after getting legendarily baked and we went into my room to play Halo. We played it muted, and we listened to every song The Beatles ever wrote. If you think orgasms feel good, you've seen absolutely nothing. Years of pain and depression all seemed to be forgiven when I realized that the world was fucking awesome and not only did all my troubles fade away, but every emotional scar I had received over the course of my life was removed, of course my mind showcased that moment to me during the best riff known to man. (When I'm 64 by the Beatles, the part where Paul goes, 'You'll be older too' is by far the most amazing thing that has ever been recorded in the history of music.) That 3 hour period will forever be known as the best moment in my life never to be topped and forever to be held up high as the meaning of existence and the sole reason life's worth living to the very last second.

Weed does have some amusing negative repercussions though, and here are a few of the more embarrassing things that weed has caused. I don't regret them in any way, and looking back on them, I see them as terribly amusing and well worth the price of admission.

The first one is one that continues to this day, but basically I would make an account on any website I could find, then go to a random part of the website and proceed to complain about everything being in English (in French) and how they should re-write everything in French. I've been banned so many times, it almost gets hilarious by itself. 

 The second time is one day, I had the brilliant idea of smoking 4 joints before going to school. I had been smoking for under a month, (2 weeks to be exact) and I was buying A grade weed. This stuff gets me fucked to this day and it was amazing that I was using that for practice. I went to school and fell asleep leaning against my locker only to be awaken by the Special Ed teacher tapping on my head and telling me I still had 10 minutes left until class. She knew I was on-top-of-the-moon stoned at that point because it was blatantly obvious. The only people who didn't notice were the kids who thought I was just some weird kid, so me being baked just registered to them as me being weird. (Grade 8) I went to my first class which happened to be double science, and I promptly started tripping balls, including a point where I completely forgot what my name was and so I decided I was Patrick Swasy for 10 minutes. The next class was math. We had a test that day, and being fucked beyond any inkling of a doubt kinda impairs my ability to do anything. It was at this point I blacked out and have no idea what happened the rest of the day, but apparently I had two more tests that day, and also apparently I got an A on all three tests I took that day.

That's weed in my life.

I have moderate autism (aspergers) and ADHD and smoking weed actually makes life better for me. Sometimes I am socially isolated and rather just be with myself, but some weed every 3-7 days makes me help understand it better. I'll explain one time that was amazing.

T 0:00
I pick up my little metal bowl and pack it, savor the smell and realize its only the beginning. I spark the bowl.

T+0:10
I am pretty high. I start to notice my surroundings, I stand up and laugh.

T+0:25
Wow, I think. It was creeper weed, I underestimated it. I started to notice talking in full sentences was getting to be a challenge, but it was fun. I was becoming more clumsy than I usually am. I am talking to myself like crazy, more than I usually do when I'm not under the influence. 

T+0:50
I'm having so much fun letting my imagination go wild with myself, it was like I was sitting there and facing another of me and talking to him. I decide that if I want to have more fun, I'm going to need to smoke some more weed. After that, I'm completely smashed, train wreck in the face.

T+1:25
I felt so retarded, as in mentally retarded. I feel so stupid, I felt helpless, but there was that feeling of fun still lingering there. I felt as if this was permanent for about 15 minutes, I was paranoid, but I still felt like it was fun. All of a sudden, my ears are in complete pain. (I have high frequency hearing loss, I cannot hear noises above 7500Khz. Any noise above what I can hear causes me pain.) I faintly remember that I had a dog whistler app on my brothers iPod touch, I must have accidentaly activated it. Fuck me, ouch.

T+2:00 I'm still retarded, I could barely talk, though It was hilarious. Anytime I tried to talk, It felt like my mouth kept tripping on its own words, so everything just sounded like jumbled blahs. I somehow managed to go downstairs and make a glass of iced tea. I don't know how I managed to do that the way I was. I started to feel like a kid again. I felt like I had the mentality of a five year old. Wow, It was getting interesting.

T+3:00 
I'm coming down now, but I still feel good, I'm sitting around thinking about meeting one of my friends, of the few that I have. I thinking about what we were gonna do. (He has autism too but he's 12 so I did not think it would be a good idea to introduce him into the wonderful world of weed, and I did not know how to handle handle him sometimes. You get the point). My mind was drifting and I went to grab a cigarette.

Autism and weed are a good mix for me. I've had other things happen but I don't feel like going into detail now. For others its a bad condition but for me, I love it. I never really cared about all the social bs. What I lack in social skills I make up in intelligence, and for me that is 100% true.

I was at job corps in San marcos TX. I was bored so me and some friends decided to smoke a joint. I smoked it with little resistance since I love weed. After About 10 minutes I felt the full effect of the weed. I always start to notice colors more when I'm high. It seems like every one is in a spirtual battle. The side they are on is showed by the color they wear. For example red means bloods. Yes I'm talking about the gang. They tend to worship the devil. Blue represents crip. They worship god and want to kill all bloods. Black represents the creater of the universe. When I'm high it's like I'm in a battle. My thoughts are project into other peoples mind. They know exactly what I'm thinking.

My friend and I smoked 2 pretty fat joints and were sitting in a parking lot when I had a revalation. What if air distorted images simular to water or heat. So I sat and contemplated for about 20 minutes and came to the conclusion that air causes our eyes to distort but since we have been living so long with air in the atmosphere that we have adapted in the way that fish adapt to seeing through the distorion of water. It would be the exact same if we lived in darkness for the duration of our existence. Our eyes and ears would adapt to the darkness and enable us to move around. This thought process tripped me out in a great way and I enjoyed the rest of my night trying to grab the air and hold it.

I baught a sack of schwag one time when I was a n00bie to marijuana, and I was about to go on a road trip.  I didn't have time to smoke the bag, so I poored the weed in my mouth, chewed and swallowed it.  It was about 3 grams I ate.  In about an hour I started feeling stoned.  During the next 8 hours of the trip I passed out several times.  Music sounded great.  When we got to our destination, I wasn't making sense to many people and didn't get a lot of the things they were saying.  I was VERY stoned.  After 10 hours had gone by since I ate it, I passed out for the night.  I felt kind of slow the next day.

For over six months I have enjoyed pot tea. I use 1/8 ounce pot and 500 milliliters of water. I bring the water to a rolling boil and boil the pot for 30 seconds. I strain it and let it cool and drink it. If I drink it all I will not drive. I usually drink 250 milliliters. I thought of adding a little corn oil or milk to bond with the thc/cannabanoids.

Setting: In my room with computer, when listening to music it's with headphones. I was chatting to a fellow tripper and good friend on MSN he was tripping on different shit, but he knew wot I was going through. room was dimly lit if computer screen is turned off. no-one was physically with me. 

Time: Approx 3:00am - 5:45am, I was VERY tired before smoking.

Before I start - this was my first time smoking bud (very young leaves with seeds) they have much more THC than normal, which is why only 2.5 cones did it for me. This trip is also quite unusual for cannibus and surprised me alot! All I did was relax and let the ganja take the reigns for a bit... enjoy!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, my experiences with Ganja before this day have been merely mellow experiences which get me in a nice comfortable mood, nothing could have prepared me for the MINDBLOWING PERSPECTIVE CHANGING experience this super Ganja gave me. I felt the trees encase my head, my mind. My brain was the soil for the plants, I truly felt that, and I suddenly understood what 'change in conciousness' meant... 

I'll start with probably the simplest thing to explain - flying :D. At the very beginning, sitting down (BEST position for tripping) my head was REALLY heavy, yet I was floating. This ain't notin like flying tho! Lets move to third person camera. He's sitting, eyes just fully closed while head tilted down and back bent down. Slowly his head tilts up and back with it, smile widening, eyebrows raising, laughing like he's on one a ride at a theme park. He looks like a damn fewl. hehe.

Back to first camera my head continues to raise (note: not I raised my head) back to normal sitting back in my chair position, then further back till I couldn't move it back any further. While my head has been moving back, I have been flying higher and higher. When my head tilted full back I was flying so high!! and I felt the falling/flying sensation, that tension. Hope you know what I mean. Laughing FIT while my head was in full back tilt. Could not stop laughing. Tried to explain it to my friend while having a laughing fit, which eventually reverted to a huge smile. :D

At one point I felt my hands were just automatically typing without me thinking, and the computer was responding to my messages. I didn't feel like I was chatting to a person anymore (this computer responding perspective didn't last too long). This is when I felt my mind seperate from my body. They were seperate entities with separate purposes. I had a vision of my dark mind and my dark body (separate), my mind remotely telling my body what to do. Wierd, hard to explain feeling. But it was actually quite profound. I would've thought a spirit/body separation would be more likely, which was half why it felt quite strange indeed. 

I felt a bit closer to the dude I was talking to while tripping, I started calling him 'bro' which I never usually do, and I felt it was totally necessary for me to call him that, cos we had this full on connection throughout this time. I know if it had been someone else, they would have had such a hard time dealing with me in that state.

I tried lying down on my bed. Getting into the totally relaxed mood, I started feeling and hearing my blood trickle through my body. I knew exactly which route it was taking cos I could feel it, and this was complimented my some subtle trickling noise and another sound (can't remember) for when it was being pumped by my heart. 

Although I didn't think it at the time, I'm pretty sure MOST of the reason I had such a good trip was because I was talking to someone who knew EXACTLY what I wanted to hear at the right time and who I could report back to every time I returned from a trip. I took for granted the safety he gave me, but now I realise. Also when my focus moved to my blood flow, I was told to keep off the blood, instead focus on energy flow. Right then I could see the doors leading to dark places revealed and I was lucky to leave before I entered any. Energy flow is a really positive thing to focus on.

The most puzzling moment was during the first peak. The lighting was dim as I had turned off my monitor. I relaxed (well, I couldn't really help that heh) and my eyes became very unfocussed, half-closed, in fact, almost closed. Then funny things started happening, the keyboard 'evolved' and so did the faint white lines on my adidas pants, and any other dimly lit stuff just became something really interesting. And I wasn't in 3D anymore, I was in 4D. I felt like my mind was pushed so hard, it was just on the verge of seeing clear 4D, but since my brain isn't used to it, it could make much sense of it. Still, it was very different to 3D - VERY interesting.

this wasn't the most freaky part tho. After a while of a ride through 4D, well actually it happened near the start too - displacement. Where I was in relation to everything around me changed. Quite suddenly at first. When I was coming back from the trip, my vision slowly gradually focused. And when it was back in full focus, I freaked! well not really, it was more a puzzled 'Whaaaat the fuuuuck!' (I was laughing while saying it, so there wasn't fear).

Now this is very hard to explain properly, but the best I can do is say I felt like I was in a mirror image of where I was before tripping. It was SOOO puzzling, I just couldn't believe my eyes, I thought I had come back to the wrong place, and I'd have to trip again, then try to return to my normal state. The keyboard was on the left of me now. HOW!!!!!! I definitely didn't move and yet it is true. I was seeing clearly, but my whole ROOM was rearranged as a mirror image. Even slightly different to mirror image. Now that was freaky. And it isn't the best description, but it'll have to do. All it took for me to regain a more normal (well STONED normal) vision and perception was rotate my head from side to side looking both directions.


Probably the most amusing dream/vision I had during this trip was this: I was flying through a jungle - one with trees that had the most vibrant colors in their leaves. All my favourite colors everywhere!! Then there was this HUGE orange cheesel and I flew right through it! It was siiiiick flying through that hole. Cos dey my fav snack. I think I told the dude I was tripping with that I flew through a cheetos, but dey phukin spherical hehe! 

Music - Sound VERY FUCKING DIFFERENT. Hard Bass kicks were very sounding soft, mellow and comforting to my ears. I wanted to hear some sub-bass though cos I felt that would give me so much satifaction - but all I had was headphones. Music becomes VERY 3D! It is much more free and real. BTW this is the first time I've listened to full on dance music with thumpin bass while stoned. Usually I'm listening to more chill music - dnb or mellow shit.

Music I enjoyed immensely while stoned:

vaio - Rapture (Deep Dish Remix) - This is a good one cos I played this not long before I got stoned. Played this over a couple of times, the kicks were very nice, I understood the singing a great deal more - the 'la la la la' parts I could even understand what she was saying there. (I have shit memory of the rest of the details soz)

HOUSE MUSIC PLEASE!!!! It's trippy because of the combination of the artists playing with these things: eq filter, resonance, panning. These three simple things together is the recipe for a headfuck on ganja!! An example of house music I played is roger sanchez - another chance. Quite an enjoyable house track, but totally trippy when ur fucked. I'll never forget the first 2 seconds of the track, the artist uses the recipe above to the max - kinda subtle since it's only the first 2 secs, but it literally moved me in the chair and my brain was being skewed by it. Made me real dizzy, it was so satisfying to understand and feel music so well.

Analog Pussy - Shperma Pornomatic, this song ALWAYS SOUNDS good, stoned or not, but when stoned it sounded alot 'warmer' and the 'waaaho!' vocals were really bloody enjoyable. amazing stuff.

The only thing I'm dissapointed about is I didn't get to try all the things I wanted, cos I wasn't thinking clearly. For so long I didn't even listen to music - but even then it was VERY fun and interesting. If I could add to the experience, I would have listened to the 'headfuck' directory of my collected Infected mushroom tracks. I know they would have fucked me up. I could try it next time, but I dunno if things will be as intense or the same.

I was tested at my worksite and failed miserably. Though I never go to work under the influence of any drugs. As a regular user using everyday I initially tested with a THC level of 90 ng/ml. Almost double the allowed concentration. After eight days clean I was re-tested at a level of 48.5 ng/ml. On the quick test I was deemed negative. I hope that these test results will help.

Two very close friends and I were staying in a large rented caravan/mobile home for four nights at a small campsite in the New Forest area of England.  The village we stayed in is a tiny, picturesque location complete with a nice country pub and village green, which is occupied by a few wild horses during the day.  Despite coming here twice before, we still thought of ourselves as strangers in this small, isolated, rural community.  It kind of reminded me of old Western films where three horsemen would arrive in a small outback town, causing suspicion and edginess amongst the locals.  Except our horses were bikes  we were there to go mountain biking in the surrounding forest area, you see. 

Now Ive set the scene, lets get down to the fun part  the night in question.  We started the evening getting slightly drunk in the caravan and smoking a few joints.  We then headed down to the village pub where we proceeded to drink some more (Jack Daniels as I remember), and make acquaintance with the local laydeez of the village.  Once closing time came we all headed to a house party just down the road from the pub and somehow managed to blag our way in.  There was talk going round of a geezer hanging around outside selling ecstasy, and my friend and I wasted no time in obtaining some of these pills.  Once we had these pills in our hands we began to get quite apprehensive.  It was to be the first time for both of us but there was no going back now so we downed them and had some cheap wine.  Roughly half an hour later, the effects were getting quite noticeable for me and I had the sudden urge to start dancing like a maniac in the middle of the living room floor of this guys house who I didnt even know.  My friend at this point was in the bathroom doing I dont know what so I went into the garden for some fresh air and a brief sit down.  

There were some dogs in the garden running around in an enclosed fenced area, and I was getting bored waiting for my friend still in the bathroom, so I decided to feed the dogs.  This involved me carrying armloads of canned dog food from the fridge inside out into the garden to hurl into the dog area.  And this is where it all started to get a bit surreal.

I remember making my way out into the front garden of the house and seeing a police car pull up outside.  This brought on a sudden, intense wave of paranoia in me and being the first person he saw, the police officer strolled up to me and started asking questions about noise levels, shouting, things like that.  I blabbered my way through this interrogation with some ease and the officer went inside.  At this point the paranoia really started to creep in.  I had a feeling that everyone was looking for me, for punishing me for every bad thing I had ever done in my life.  Although this might sound like a bad trip to you, I was actually enjoying it as I felt like a James Bond character  everybody looking to kill him, but always staying one step ahead.  The adrenalin rush was like no other I had ever experienced.

I was feeling overwhelmed by all the action and so I went back to our caravan alone to get some more weed to mellow me out a bit.  I did this ok but upon returning to the party I decided not to go back in but to head opposite to the village green instead, and watch the action from a safe viewpoint all by myself.  I sat under a tree in total darkness and began to roll and smoke a few joints.  After two joints I remember babbling incoherently like a fool and I must have collapsed or something.

I awoke and looked at my watch  it was 5am.  I headed back to the caravan where my friends were fucking around with the TV set or something and I sat down calmly.  I then burst into a full rendition of most of my favourite songs and went to bed.  The singing was especially satisfying as I was feeling like a rock star or something, and that was good.  I like singing when Im wasted anyway.

So thats that.  The next day I didnt feel too bad, didnt have a hangover, felt quite good actually, but a bit sick.  Im surprised I can remember so many details of this night but it was all good, like a chapter out of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

I had just gotten out of work on a Saturday night and I pulled my usual routine of calling around to see whats happening in my small suburban town. A friend told me to meet him at a park where a few of our mutual friends had gathered to drink and smoke, a girl, lets call her cindy, was sniffing vodka through her nose, several other girls were drinking beers, and I and a few other male friends were playing 20 questions.
The Only marijuana available at the park was bricked out dirt weed which i had acquired a quarter pound of the week before. I refused to smoke this as I wasn't sure what percentage of it was actually marijuana. Thus began the search for high potency buds. Within 15 minutes a connect had been established and buds were on the way, we purchased 3 dub sacks and a eighth for a total of 110$. I recieved my 20 bag and we departed for the park.

Once we got to the park the gravity bong was filled and it was time to get started, now, this was the first time I got a good look at this weed, and it was beautiful. the bong was packed up and as I lit up and started raising the hitter, the milky white smoke filled the chamber quickly and smoothly. I removed the top and went down on the bottle thrusting 2 liters of thick smoke deep into my lungs. I quickly was knocked out, coughing and heaving but still down for another hit. I repeated this 5 times until the bowl was kicked. and started my journey towards the basketball courts.

I paid attention to nothing anyone said. My life had turned into a documentary, like 'This is Your Life' and I had no control over what I was doing. I could hear my voice narrating the events as they happened and i had completely lost touch of reality. Due to the fact that there was a young lady at the park I had the previous intention of hooking up with, it was of upmost importance to keep in touch with reality and not look like a moron. I was shit out of luck, as i stumbled into the car and the music turned on my life became the music. My heartbeat was moving to the beat of the music and my mind was enthralled in the deep bass of the song 'SIOSOS' by the Spooks.

I tried telling myself i was coming down but the fact was I was in another world. I convinced myself the marijuana was laced with Acid or PCP, and i started to get visuals. This was the first and only time I have ever experienced visuals with marijuana use, and they were powerful. The stoplights were bouncing to the music and whenever something miraculous like this happened I would experience a 'Mindgasm' the only way I can begin to describe it would be if you were traveling at 2000 mph, flipping through space. Your world collapses and everything around you becomes unreal. It is a relieving feeling but if it occurs too many times, it could induce vomiting. We arrived at Wendys and i purchased a 5 piece chicken and a Biggie Fry. This was a very smart move. The food started to give me a grip on what was going on. Which was good. The documentary voice was telling me that I should play the roll of the 'shy guy' in order to play off the mind games that were destroying my sanity. So I watched out the window, experiencing several more mindgasms before we reached my car.

I drove my car home subconciously as I wasn't aware of anything but the road directly in front of me. Successfully dropped off the girls and headed home. I started to come down T+4:00 after the experience and was finally able to attain a deep sleep. The experience, although a bit nauseating at times, was amazing and enlightening. I will savor the remaining buds and hope to share this experience and pass on my story to others. I strongly suggest marijauna for everyone that hasnt done it yet, as it is a wonderful substance and has changed my life for the better.

So I've been quite a smoker for a time now but this would be the first time I smoked a real bong. It all started with that I went over to my friends house to smoke some ZeroZero (good hashish). We always just roll one joint not two, we roll the other one when we feel like we need some more. Anyway my friend is da bomb at rollin' joints, he really is, we call him the Professor.

So he made one and we smoked it, this is big papers, not regular so it's like maybe 1 gram in one joint. And we got stoned, after a while we thought let's make another one so we did and smoked that too, now we were really stoned. And then a couple of friends arrived with more hashish, and they made a water pipe, so we smoked maybe 3 hits of that pipe. Now we all were really stoned, more stoned than before. So we just chilled while talking and stuff, and then a friends mobile phone rang and he answered it. After he had hung up he told us that our 'drug dealer' was coming to visit us with even more hashish, he said that he would bring a bong.

And then my friend said that he didn't think that I could make it, smoking a bong that is, so I said oh yeah? let's make a bet, 2 dollars on that I can, he agreed. Then the dealer came and pulled the bong from a bag and laid it on the table, while he was mixing some hashish. He first took the hit, then it was my turn. He said just inhale like hell, and I did, and I thought this isn't that bad...then I heard his voice telling me to let go of the hole.

I thought oh my god I'm not done yet?

So I let it go, and there was so much smoke that it came up again without exhaling it. So I started to cough, and all my friends started to laugh their lungs out and I ran to the bathroom and just coughed in the toilet. Then it was over I went to lay down on my friends bed, I felt like something told me to go to the bathroom again, so I did. And just when I got in I puked my hamburger that I had eaten earlier right up, so it wasn't that bad because it still tasted like hamburger. But after a while I was soo totaly lost I was laying on the side on the toilet just trying to get things straight again, I was really tired. And then all suddenly I saw a big shining bathtub, I thought that it would be great to lay down there, but then I realised how 'junkie' it would be so I stayed where I were, near the toilet :)

After a while I looked up again and I was lying on the floor, but there were no bathtub there. I didn't realise that I was halucinating so I just walked to my friends again.
After a while me and my friend left, I don't have a single idea how I got home but I did...

It might not have been all that fun but it was an experience and I got a small idea how to smoke a bong next time.

I had never been so stoned in all my life. Of course, I had never really been stoned. I had been high more than a handful of times, mostly just contact highs but also a couple of times smoking up. Nothing, not even the experiences of my friends, could have prepared me for what happened though. It was crazy.

The week before this happened, I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed. I had been on painkillers for a couple of days, but stopped taking them a few days before the 'main event'. My parents were going away for the weekend, so I figured I'd have a house party, just me and some friends, and it ended up lasting a few days. Apparently I have a great backyard for smoking - nobody can see into my back yard unless they are standing in it, which is a plus.

Friday night before my parents left, two of my friends came over and smoked a little, and we ended up laughing on the basement floor for a good half hour, why I don't know. But the next day was even better. Saturday night, what a night it was. Me and three guys smoking in my backyard. Something none of us thought we would be doing - nobody thought they'd ever be stoned at my house, hell, nobody thought they'd ever see me stoned! Good girl gone bad, I guess.

We smoked so much I think I blacked out on my patio at one point. I remember someone waking me up and we went inside, to watch TV or something. That first time I really felt what it was like being stoned, I didn't say too much. I don't remember much of that particular night. I do remember solving the Rubik's cube. I can solve it sober in about 3 minutes, but I tried it stoned - it was the only thing I could focus on for whatever amount of time it took me to solve it. But it kept me in touch with reality, when everything else was wavy and jumpy and slow all at the same time. The volume of sounds kept changing and the only way I could keep it normal was if people kept talking at a constant rate. Strange.

I was having premonitions, jumping time, I don't really know how to describe it other than I saw something happen (pillow hitting a can of soda and spilling it onto the floor) before it happened. This wasn't the first vision, I had seen flashes of a man in a white tee-shirt in the woods on Friday night (before this party), that scared the bejesus outta me. Next thing I know, it's morning, and I'm still out of it. But feeling the need, the need for weed. Yes. So one of my friends (who had brought his stash for us to use) packed a bowl and we went back outside to smoke some more. That hit me fast, but not as badly as the night before, and it was a lot more fun. I definitely said a lot more this time. Even later that day I invited some more friends over and we smoked up some more.

It thundered that day. I kept yelling that the thunder was trying to get into my house to steal my pop tarts. I had a discussion with my friend about the difference between real soda and 'mind soda'. The whole time I had this incredibly distorted sense of touch. I was asking people if I was moving my hand because I couldn't feel it moving (though apparently it was moving). I knocked soda cans over and walked into a table and didn't even feel it. This feeling didn't wear off for days.

Wednesday, parents are back, I'm paranoid that the house smells like weed but nobody notices it except for me so I'm playing it cool. I cleaned up the mess from the party (over 30 soda cans, and the remnants of three days of the munchies) before they returned. But the feeling is still lingering with me. I feel fizzly. You know those fireworks that make the fizzling, sssssssssss, frying pan noise? That's what I feel like. If someone touches my arm with one finger, I feel it all through my arm, sort of like pins and needles only not as painful and a lot longer lasting. I scratch my face and then put my arm back down and I'm not sure if I ever really scratched my face. It's cool but at the same time freaky.

If I've learned anything from this, it's got to be don't smoke too much at one time. It's not as fun if you black out. And keep more food in the house. Munchies are bad if you have no food to eat (I think I bit someone because I was hungry). Some people say life is just a bowl of cherries - we say life is just a cherried bowl. Can't wait for my parents to go out of town again.

The story begins when my brother got back from college for his winter break and had brought back a film canister full of nugs.  His drug of choice had always been alcohol, so he wasn't that reluctant to hand the canister on to me for a small fee.  I gave him a 20, grabbed the canister, and left to pick up a few friends.

Once I had picked three kids up, it was about 8 pm and we decided to stop at a parking lot to light up.  My friend, Allen, brought his sweet glass pipe with him and I started to pack a bowl.  It was cold out, being december, so we stood in a circle to help stay warm and keep the wind from blowing out the flame.

I was the first one to smoke.  I lit up and inhaled deeply, being the experienced smoker that I am.  This had to of been the hugest hit of my entire life, because it forced me to double over onto the ground and cough the saliva up from the back of my throat.  I managed to pull myself up back onto my feet with the help of two of my friends.  The first thing that I did once on my feet was try to lick my friend Dan's face, since he was so close to me after helping me up.

After smoking, my friends thought it would be cool to see Lord of the Rings on it's opening day.  I hopped into the driver's seat and immediately realised that I wouldn't be able to drive us anywhere in my condition.  We all piled out and started playing tag in the parking lot.  I made sure that I didn't run too fast so that I wouldn't trip; it wouldn't have hurt at all then, but i would've felt it in the morning.

After tiring ourselves out a litte, we hopped back into the car and headed down towards the movie theatre.  At the time, I was an inexperienced driver and forgot to turn my lights on, even though it was pitch black outside.  On the way there, I think I see the turn off for the movie theatre, so I pull into the left lane.  After a few seconds of bumpy driving, my friend enlightens me to the fact that I'm off the road, which I correct as if it were an everyday occurance.  It wasn't until later that I realised how close to death we'd come.

Now I've read all of the Lord of the Rings books and was heavily psyched to see this movie.  After a few confusing happenings buying tickets and seeing friends from school, we get into the movie.  Even if I had been in my right mind, this movie would have been sweet, but after smoking what I had, it was nothing short of a religious experience.  I highly recommend seeing it even without smoking first.

This afternoon I had a really strange experience on weed and was wondering if anyone else has had the same thing happen. I have been smoking for about 3 years and I am now 17. Recently (the last 4 months) there hasn't been more than 10 days when I haven't smoked up. I had just gotten off school this lovely Friday afternoon and was looking foward to a nice big session. Me and my mate loaded a couple of cones and started toking. Now this shit I had smiked before. It was quality. It had so many crystals on it and it smelled really potent. Anyway, after the cones were finished my friend went to drop his car home and we were supposed to meet at his place in about 15 minutes to pick him up and go to work. I was sitting on the side of the road waiting for my brother to bring the car home when shit started happening. I was staring at the road in front of me and it started waving like water. I thought this was odd but cool and continued to stare in awe. What happened next was the most awesome open eyed visual display I have experienced. The outline of a cartoon character appeared and then continued to morph into various other characters and objects. I was probably watching this for about 10 minutes and I really was in a world of my own. I then closed my eyes and was welcomed by an amazing array of colourful orbs etc.

Anyway. This experience was not a bad one although it was very unexpected. Just wondering what happened and if anyone else has experienced this from smoking weed.

It seems that some people seem to have some problems or strange ideas as to how to smoke cannabis oil.

In New Zealand one of the most common ways of smoking pot is referred to as 'spotting', using the element of a kitchen stove in combination with knives.  I believe this is referred to as 'hot-kniving' in other parts of the world.

The best type of knives to use have non-metal handles.  Bone-handled knives work well, but be careful to not let the handle touch the element, otherwise you'll have a small fire-show in your kitchen :)

Turn the element on to full power (this works best with gas or spiral-metal elements) and place the knive as hard against this as possible.  Sometimes a round piece of metal (such as the top of a coffee tin) is used as a hat on top, however this is usually somewhat excessive for Oil.  It usually takes 5-10 mins for the elements to heat up properly (significantly longer with gas)

Take a small blob of oil and place it on the end of a needle.

You will also require some kind of tube for sucking up the smoke, I would suggest making a makeshift 'straw' out of the top of packet of cigarette papers or something similar.

Place the straw in your mouth, and with the other hand pull out the red-hot knife from under the element.  Move the straw towards the end of the knife and begin inhaling slowly.  With your other hand place the blob of oil onto the knife and rub it up and down a little bit.  The oil should bubble a little bit then 'poof' the smoke out.  Make sure you're inhaling a little faster for when it starts smoking.

It can take a few attempts to master the timing. But, with a small amount of practise, you can achieve near-perfect 'spots' with almost no wastage at all.

It may be easier to get a friend to do the burning (driving) for you, while you concentrate on sucking up all the smoke.

I had smoked weed about 7-8 times before this experience.  All of which I had been smoking 'shwag' (low quality weed) and had heard many times about how Kine/Skunk was much better and definitely worth the extra cash. I had also heard that weed, when ingested, gave a slightly different effect and that it strings out your high for as long as 6 hours.  I had ingested low-quality weed orally before, and didn't notice much difference from smoking it.. just a longer high.

I finally bought some very high quality weed for the first time and had only smoked it before.. never ingested.  Needless to say 1/2 of a joint of the weed would put me off my ass when it was smoked from... but tonight was a different story.  

I was at my apartment and my roommate was away for the week, so I decided i wanted to try to make some cool music (guitar player) whilst i was stoned.. and since i was alone I knew that i wouldn't be bothered.  I thought.. shwag was boring when i ate it... I wonder if this will be the same.... boy was i wrong.

I was sitting at the computer chatting with someone right after i had taken it and thought to myself.. it will be 30 minutes or so before this stuff kicks in... so i'll chat for a bit.  Well, 30 minutes rolled around and i didn't feel a damn thing.  I thought.. well shit, its gotta be coming pretty soon!  5 mintues or so after that my friend said something that made me chukle a little. I stretched out breifly & cracked my back and then out of nowhere a feeling came over me.  I started to laugh again at what my friend had said and after what seemed like 2-3 minutes i relized that i was laughing my fucking ass off!  I was laughing so hard i could barely catch my breath.  That time period made me ponder... I thought to myself... Jesus!..  I had laughed for like 3 minutes straight at a comment that wasn't even that funny.  It clicked as though i had forgotten i had eaten the weed 40 minutes ago... ahh i'm stoned now.  I wondered to myself.. I have never had week that hit me so suddenly like that... out of the blue.  

All of the sudden i remembered that this was the very high quality weed that i invested my money into.  'Woah' I thought... those guys must have been talking about kine when they said there is a whole new side to being high when you eat it.  

It all ten-folded from there.  I was experiencing feeling that I had never felt before when i was high.  Everything was blown way out of proportion.  I grabbed a handfull of chips and started to much on them and thought... my tounge feels awful funny... Hmm.   I chewing the chips i was eathing and started to move my tounge around inside my mouth.  It was the most odd feeling i had ever encountered. It was as if my tounge were partially numb, but its actions FELT inversed.  I would put my tounge on the roof of my mouth and think to myself - Big Al dude.. thats the TOP of your mouth you moron, but the physical side of me was telling me.. No Al... your on the bottom right now.  

I started thinking about actions such as these too much and it started to frighten me.  Subconsiously my tounge wouldn't sit still, like it was trying to confuze me and bring my attention back to what i didn't want to think about.  Kinda scary at the time...  -  I then started concetrating more on chatting with my friend online.  He was aware that i was stoned, but i hadn't explained to him yet that I had ingested kine for the first time.  

I started to explain to him the conditions of which i was under, but instead i ended up writing him a novel.  I explained in extremely great detail that i had ingested kine bud instead of smoking it.  He replied to me.. 'Woah dude... i know your a perfectionist, but why in the hell did you just type me 3 fully fledged paragraphs about how you ATE the weed and didn't smoke it' ... I tried to understand what he was relaying back to me.  My mind was thinking hundreds of possibilities of different things that were in the front of my mind at the time.  It was almost like listening to a song and breaking it down one instrument at a time, then splicing them back together but to make something new.  My mind was racing.  I thought to myself.. If i am thinking about all of the different sides/perspectives/shapes and forms of things, then how can i benefit from this experience.  

CLICK!  -  Music.  I immediately jumped up from my chair, typed out hastily to my friend that i would be back in a bit and rushed over to the guitar.  I stopped for reasons i couldn't understand, looked around the room, and became extreamly scared in the blink of an eye.  Sudennly i had absolutely no interest in music, but wanted to get back with my friend because i was feeling unsafe mentally.  I started telling my friend that i was getting freaked out.  He asked questions in a calm manner to me such as 'tell me what youre feeling right now'... I lashed out at him for no reason saying things like.. 'Fuck you dude... i'm scared shitless.. i feel like i'm gonna die or something!'.  He was calm through the whole ordeal, but i felt like i was going insane.  I started asking myself questions in my head very VERY quickly with answers to none.  'What if i do die'?, 'What if the police find this chatbox after i die'!? Then i thought to myself... wholy shit... i'm so goddamn paranoid i THINK i'm going to die.  That settled my mind and i was very releaved when i come to the thought that i was just really stoned.  Duh AL... your not gonna die, your safe.

After that my typing became very hyper... all of the sudden i felt like i had a lot to say, and i had to say it fast.  I made so many spelling errors due to speed and being stoned that my friend kept telling me - your not making sense.  It was all pointless anyhow, and i stepped back from my mind to think about why i was typing fast in the first place.  I had no idea.

By now i was about 2 hours into the high and my hyperness turned into hapiness.  Instead of typing faster, i started anylizing the text coming from my friend and could understand concepts much better.  I felt much better now, and then i noticed that the whole time i had forgot about my tounge that had been flailing around in my mouth without me knowing it.  I felt deathly sore in the mouth and my tounge hurt badly.  I grabbed hold of a mountain dew next to me and took a swig... WARM! Nasty!!! I thought... shit - i had better get a cold one.  I walked out of my room and headed to the fridge when i saw my roomate's cat sitting the floor. I looked in the fridge and found a dew, closed the fridge and saw something out of the corner of my eye.  It scared the shit out of me - I looked over quickly and saw it was the cat i had just seen.  VERY werid feeling like my extreme short term memory was going out on me. 

The cold dew was better, but still didn't taste that great. I sat back down at the computer and my friend said 'lets go play some starcraft' ... i was quite hesitant at first and told him that it may make me freak out again.. but he was in the mood so i went along with it.  I had an absolute blast. I was laughing my ass off the whole time.. commanding my men to kill eachother and whatnot.  It was such a great feeling knowing that i could put these charachters through hell and nobody would be hurt.  Needless to say we lost the game.  I had told my friend 'i think my high is coming down now'.   He departed and i logged off and went to sleep thinking of all the COMPLETELY different experiences i felt in comparison to when i had ingested shwag.

The whole week after that i had a different look on things...  everyone i saw and all the things i thought of were totally different than before.  This slowly decreased and i became myself after the weeks period was through.  I think it may have been what i would like to call a 'temporary life-changing experience'... i'm not sure.

The night started out ok, with nothing to worry about.  My friend showed up at my house with some brownie mix and the weed.  We made the brownies and called a couple people to see what they were doing.  Two of them couldn't do anything and the other one was pretty indecisive.  We went ahead and ate a brownie and start getting some sort of effects.  I must say that it didn't taste too terrific.  The stems and seeds tend to add a bit of crunchiness to them.  I think all we did at first was just laugh; nothing too exciting.  After awhile we ate two more, wanting better effects.  We soon started to get very confused about everything.  One of us would be talking and suddenly stop what we were saying, due to the fact that we just plain forgot what we were talking about.  This happened numerous times throughout the night.  Both our bodies were very numb, but in a pleasant way.  I almost felt like if I tried to get up I wouldn't be able to.  I guess I did, because my friend had to go home, so I let her out the door.  

I then proceeded get online and find something to do.  I hadn't been on the computer for more than 10 minutes, when everything went wrong.  I thought that my friend was still in my house, and when I turned around, she wasn't there.  I thought she might be in the other room.  This is where I thought I got up from the computer and searched around the house.  I was either thinking, or saying out loud, 'Where is ****, where did she go?'  The next thing that happened was I was simply sitting at the computer thinking to myself, 'Oh yeah, she went home.'  I thought that she might be hurt somewhere and didn't make it home.  I finally had to call her just to make sure she was ok.  

I also started to think I was doing all this stuff and then I would realize that I hadn't moved from where I was.  I felt so lost, and was really scared.  I kept thinking that something had to be wrong; I shouldn't be scared from just a little bit of weed.  I decided to lie down on my bed and attempt to fall asleep, which is what I must have done.  I also think that my heart was beating really hard sometimes throughout that night.    

When I woke up I felt like I had done a bunch of hard drugs the night before.  I looked in the mirror and realized that I looked horrible.  I'm still really tired right now as I write this; it's only the day after.  I'm not sure I'd want to eat another weed brownie again if I'm going to be thinking that I'm talking to people and doing stuff that I'm not.  Being scared and thinking that your friend might be hurt and you don't know where she is, can be really frightening.

One day me and two of my friends went into a nature center to smoke this new weed that one of the friends just got. This was the best stuff I had ever smoked! After only three hits, I went insane. At first I started laughing uncontrollably, which always happens. Then as we were walking through the paths, my vision started to blink vertically instead of the normal horizontal (when blinking). All the colors everywhere became very amazing and bright, but that was nothing. Now about five minutes have passed with straight laughter, and then I noticed that it sounded as if all sound was coming directly to my ears, and not traveling through the air. this was an amazing sensation to me. 

After we all piled into the van, we drove off to find a place to skate.  While we were at a red light, I went into a trip where I thought i was talking out my window to a ticketman in his ticket booth. While talking to him about who knows what, I remember holding onto a pet alligator and petting it. Then right before the light turned green, I woke up to find that my pet alligator had dissapeared! I yelled out to my friends,'where did my pet alligator go?!' as if they knew. Then I explained to them what had just happened while we were at the red light. They just laughed at me and we drove on. 

Then they stoped at a Hardees to get something to eat. They decided to keep me in the van because it wouldn't be a good idea to bring me inside, because I was still laughing non-stop. While they were inside, I imagined a rabbid bunny jumping out from behind a bush and attacking an ant. They came back to the van to find me still laughing it up. I told them the story, but they couldn't understand because I was mumbling and laughing way too much.

We found a good place to skate, but I was too tired to get out of the van. so my friends had to drag me out and set me on the grass. They skated for a while, while I just sat there watching them and laughing about the crazy noises I was hearing. Then a security guard came along and shoed us away. I was careful enough to keep it straight, but it was extemely hard. After that we just drove home and wait a bit till I came down, so then I could tell them my whole story and they could tell me what they thought about it.

I parked my car at the entrance to the Rainbow Falls bush track, and sparked up a joint of good bud. I thought I'd better leave my intake at 4 tokes 'cos I'd had bad experiences with weed lately due to spinal problems and weird skull sensations.

I do a lot of walking (while stoned) in the beautiful bush/river tracks around my area. It is a very healthy and enjoyable activity alone or with good company. The Rainbow Falls track runs alongside a beautiful river and is surrounded by native and introduced bush. It is one of three areas I frequent.

As I descended into the forest, I felt a deep respect for the ancient moss-covered natural rock walls, and emerged into the clearing where the huge falls can be viewed. The power was immense, and I felt the huge downwards force having an effect on me, but then I noticed the spray lifting up and floating away - forces balanced, and I picked myself up again. Some (Dutch? German?) tourists looked at me and looked scared and nervous - I don't know why (I don't think it was weed paranoia) - I looked normal and was wearing normal clothing - shit, I even smiled at them, but their reactions made me feel bad, unwelcome in my homeland. I tried to ignore it and made my way further down the track.

Passing more angry/frightened tourists who volunteered nothing but sneers and timid glances, I was starting to have a bad buzz. My spinal/cranial pains were playing up, and my mood was worsening. I continued down the track and came upon a grove of strange, ancient trees. Suddenly, it was all clear - the destructive force inside me was attacking me (I had been training hard in my Taekwondo all week), and possibly it showed through and scared the tourists on some level, too. I felt I had to give some of it to the trees, so I spread my fingers and let it drain out through my arms. This felt right. I also felt the trees reward me by soothing my mood and my body. It was like a trade of my destructive potential energy for their healing.

After this turning point, my buzz picked right up. I passed some American tourists, a couple wearing bright parkas, and greeted them as I did the others, and they gave me warm greetings back - they weren't scared!

I then decided I wanted to be close to the water, so I cruised down to the river and picked out a good place to sit on the flat stones in the middle. I sat there for an hour, basking in the gentle sun peeking through the canopy, contemplating the nature of water and the trade I had just made. I felt good to be alive. I thanked nature and made my way back up the track.

On my way back, I contemplated what things would be like if social structures were different. What if we still had Kings and Knights and Druids? Surely it would be fitting, I thought, to follow the ways of these majestic forests? It seems that as we've 'advanced,' people's minds have become blunted or desensitised to this underlying magic in nature, and using certain drugs is one way to recapture and experience this beauty - if only for a short time.

One day after work my friend and I decided to smoke some new kind bud that he just picked up a few days before. He told me that this stuff was strong, but being an experienced smoker I thought nothing of it.  We got to his house and his wife decided to toke with us. So I had a seat on the couch and he started to roll a nice jay. After rolling it, we proceeded to smoke this bad boy, of course passing it in session between the three of us. By the time the jay was gone I could not believe the quality of the bud, my head was seriously spinning.

This was different to me, most of the time I gotta smoke at least three jays to get where I was. He broke out his pipe, which didn't suprise me any, as I figured we were going to smoke more. He packed about 20 roaches in the pipe and me and him smoked them, and then he packed 2 bowls of the kind bud. Needless to say, I was baked, standing up not possible. We started to watch tv and got tired of it quickly. We ended up going and playing pool at a local bar, I could hardly make a shot much less order drinks. I ended up messing up the drink order and we all had soda. So we went over to my friend's house and sat there and played video games.

The buzz had begun at 11:00 am and we left the bar at about 12:45, and the rest of the time we played video games. I ended up looking at some of my friend's art that he had on the wall, and someone came over and started to talk to me. I asked them what time it was because I had to be somewhere at 4:00. They said it was 10:30. I said, 'What the hell, it's not 10:30, quit messing with me.' But it actually was 10:30 and I ened up missing some important dates, but oh well, I was too baked to care. We had been smoking while playing the games, about 4 more bowls.

Well, I guess I would have to say never underestimate the true power of good bud and always keep an eye on what time it is in case you need to be somewhere. I was almost in a time warp when I was looking at his artwork and the only reason I asked what time it was was because it felt like only 20-30 min.

If anyone is looking for some music to listen to when you're stoned, I have the perfect song:  'The End' by the Doors.  Let me tell you, listen to this song, and tell me if the same thing happens to you:

I was lying on my friend's bed, getting ready for the song to come on. The lights were out, except for a lava lamp in the corner.  The first few measures of the song sound like they are literally going in one ear, colliding with your brain, and then exiting the other ear.  Then Jim starts singing. It is like you're walking up the stairway to heaven. You can picture yourself walking up a golden staircase, with little angel children playing the instruments all along the sides of the stairs. All along the staircase there are trees of gold and candy.  Jim Morrison is like God, calling you to heaven. I picture myself wearing this white dress with sparkles all over, and a crown of flowers. Finally, you have reached heaven, and you hear birds chirping, almost like you're in a field of flowers. If you concentrate hard enough, it almost feels like you're flying.

Suddenly, the song changes. It's like all your sins have culminated, and 'God' realizes it, and starts you on your way to hell. The music gets creepy, and the birds die out slowly.  It felt like I was falling. I literally felt something pulling me downward.  Jim starts singing, only it's more like yelling. He is now more of a satan character.  The images in your head go from being white and gold, to red and black. The force that pulls you is so intense, it is the most amazing experience.

So, now that you all think I'm crazy, try listening to this song when you're stoned, and get back to me on the results :).

Originally searching for hashish, I was instead offered opium.  Knowing that opium is black or brown I contested the authenticity of this dark red solid covered in red powder.  Regardless I would try it.  The first time was with low grade marijuana in a glass pipe.  The effects were strictly cannabis.  I doubted the red rock at that point and was planning vengence.  Conversely, the next experience - same cannabis, same pipe - was eventfull to say the least.  The rock was not crushed and simply placed upon the cannabis.  Immediately after smoking I entered my car to return home.  It was night time.  Soon - approximately 2 minutes - my perception darkened and I realized quickly that I was in no shape to drive, but proceeded anyway.  Driving on a road I cover every day I couldn't recognize where I was.  I would see (hallucinate) a person running across the street.  This seemed real to the point that I reacted accordingly and hit the brakes.  Then I was convinced that I was driving in the opposite direction.  The road was well lit, yet I was having great difficutly  seeing the objects surrounding me and the road.  I feared I would crash.  

I returned home - I can't remember the details of how - and layed down.  I was suffering from visual impairment.  I began listening on my discman to URB vol. 1.  Strangely the only track I could listen to was Goldie's Innercity.  I attempted to listen to some of the others but was forced to return to Goldie.  The music sounded different; I could hear sounds I hadn't recoginized before.  The singer's voice had me hypnotized.  This was a euphoric feeling.  I had lost my anxiety over the strange new feeling and was now at ease enjoying the sound.  Remembering a friend's story of how opium helped him have intense sex for hours, I decided to masturbate.  When I finally ejaculated the feeling was too intense.  My body reacted as having experienced an attempted resuscitation with shock pads.  I felt my consciousness hover above where I was laying. Then I was enveloped by a black hole.  Everything darken and I felt asleep, yet fully conscious.  Throughout this experience I believed I might have been dying.  I did not fight, just passively accepted.  Suddenly I awoke and had reason to believe that only 10 minutes had passed.  

Indeed this was a frightning experience.  I am now aware of red rock not being an opiate, but have not an explanation for my experience.

This experience has many question marks. I still do believe that there was some reaction of some kind that caused it. However, the experience itself was really something else. I have never used LSD or any other psychedelics except for a pill of MDMA (Mitsubishi) two weeks before this experience. 
That night I went to my friend's house (who, by the way, is a doctor in psychology, with several writings on cannabis) and we decided to rent a couple of movies and smoke our way through the night. We cooked and ate as well as had a bottle of a horrible white wine. The joints were coming and going and by the end of the first movie I was really stoned. Everything was 'normal.' At that point my friend decided that we had to do this bong sort of thing he calls the drainer. So we did with a good amount of pure skunk each. I went well off at that point. Really really stoned, I crawled on the couch and we were getting ready for the second movie. 

Then I started shivering as if it was extremely cold. I had felt this side-effect before, so did not care much and it left quickly. At this point, instead of the movie, we started chatting, talking about how stoned we were. Suddenly I felt so strange. I could not really explain, but it was as if the effects of cannabis were strengthened tenfold. My friend asked if I was well. That was it, I just took off. I had no perception of space (including gravity) or time. I started calling out for help as I was drawn into a vortex of some kind, as everything was spinning around me with incredible force. I panicked and I felt like I was going to pass out. My heartbeat was strong and fast and I was breathing very hard. I could hardly feel my limbs, as they were all going numb and I got really scared at this point. My understanding of reality was also very different than usual; I cannot really define it. However, something was very wrong. I tried to focus. There was no way I could. I laid on the couch, which looked huge, and I was feeling like an insect on it. That was another effect - my size in space was no longer a constant, it was relative to my feelings. My friend offered to make me a coffee as I laid on the bed, I could hear his every move and every little sound. The sugar falling in the cup and the sound of the teaspoon was so annoying. I started feeling better. For just a few seconds. But there it came again, taking me into this vortex of paranoia and insanity. 

Weird thoughts start crossing my mind. I became a little bit aggressive, started shouting. I quickly called a taxi and left the place. The taxi ride was about 3 minutes. It felt like aeons passed. The taxi driver was talking to me and his voice was coming with echo. I looked at him and he was miles away from me. By then I was in my room. Had a shower, called my girlfriend and went to bed. The feeling was there, but I was coming down. I woke up the next day only to find that I was steel feeling it. It was completely gone by the afternoon. I had another joint then, just to check. It didn't came back, everything was 'normal' again. My 'normal' is a bit different than it used to be before that. I thought I was too close to insanity. I had no visuals of any kind except from faulty space perception and distorted objects. No closed eye visuals.

I am going to describe to you the effects of the first time I ever became extremely high.  Hopefully, this will help you decide whether or not to try marijuana.  I, as you will find out, suggest you do.

It wasnt the first time I had smoked marijuana.  I have, other times, smoked from both pipes and doobies.  However, the effect hadnt been worth the time spent smoking it.  I think, however, that this was because I did not know how to partake of the herb.  In other words, I was inhaling wrong.  One must breathe it in, not suck.  Inhale from your lungs, not your mouth.  Suck it down until it starts to itch.  You may want to cough.  Dont.  Stop the hoot, and pass the pipe off, without exhaling.  Suck in some air quickly, so that your throat doesnt itch as much.  Hold the smoke in your lungs, not your cheeks, for about ten seconds, maybe longer, and then exhale slowly.  Breathe a bit.  

I cant tell you how much to smoke.  I am lean, 511, 165lbs, I repeat, thin.  Doesnt sound thin, but I am bone and muscle.  No fat.  I think because of this, I need more to be very high, because there is less tissue for the THC to hang out in.

This time, I had about a thimble full of marijuana, chopped up.  Its hard to describe how much I had, as the common measurements (an eighth, a half-bag) change depending on where you are on the planet.  I had enough to make a small pile in your palm, about one inch high, one inch wide.  I got two bowls out of it, but that was a small pipe.  I was very calm, looking forward to the high.  This time, I decided, I would find out what it was really like.  It is important to be calm.  Dont do it if you are afraid of being caught.  I suggest doing it in a remote area, such as a campground, or your own home.

Anyways, it was the middle of winter, freezing cold (this is Canada).  My friend and I decided to smoke and go tobogganing.  We arrived at the hill, and were there alone.  We went to the bottom of the hill and I smoked all I had.  I should mention that the hill was large, and was actually a hiking path leading down the hill through a forest.  Above us was the steep path, and around that was forest.  At the bottom of the hill there was a lake (frozen) and there was at least one or two feet of snow on the ground.  As I finished off the last of the weed, I suddenly felt like something was trying to push me over.  Not hard, just like a wall of air pushing me softly.  This happened on and off, about three times, for about two minutes (I think).  I finished the weed and stood with my friend, talking about who would go for the next ride.  He had not smoked anything.  Suddenly, I found myself beginning to talk a lot, about nothing.  I was also talking quite loudly, almost shouting.  I remember that I was suddenly not cold, but in fact quite warm.  

At this point, mostly everything goes blank.  I remember a number of things, though, that happened throughout the next thirty or so minutes.  I talked a lot.  I laid down in the snow and slammed my head against the ice of a lake (we had been on the bank, and I walked a few feet onto the ice).  There was a lot of snow on it, but I managed to bang through it.  I think I was trying to make snow angels, but Im not sure.  Whatever the case, I didnt feel any pain.  In fact, it was quite fun.  Meanwhile, my friend was riding the toboggan down the hill.  I was shouting at him the whole time, saying really nothing.  I think I had my eyes closed, because I was very warm and I felt like I was sleeping.  At one point, he walked towards me and I jumped up.  His jacket had been rustling and I thought he was my puppy, who tends to rustle as he runs towards you to lick you.  Whatever the case, I explained this to my friend in a very loud voice, so that he would understand.  

One important thing to note here is that unless I concentrated, I could not simply say something to my friend.  As soon as I stopped concentrating, everything went blank again, and I fell around some more.

Another thing is the fact that I laughed.  I have never laughed so hard in my life.  My friend, laughing at me, laughed a lot too.  I fell all over the place, laughing in a million different ways, very different than my normal way.  A few times, I laughed for long periods of time, harder and harder.  I think the longest period was almost four minutes.  I could hardly breathe by that time.  The laughter is something you must savor.  It is amazing.  You have no reason to laugh, yet you do, hysterically, like a jackal.  I must emphasize that it is very different than normal laughter.  It is phenomenal.  You should have someone video tape you, because you will want to see it again.  You will laugh for the stupidest reasons, probably falling down a lot.  Therefore, I suggest you stand up, because you want to stay excited.  By falling down, you give yourself more to laugh at.

At that point, I laid back down (or should I say, fell over).  I then began to talk in every accent I can do, British, Yankee, whatever I could think of.  I remember thinking I had been speaking every language on earth, and I decided to talk to my friend in Chinese.  To me at the time, Chinese was a simple aye-aye-aye-aye.  I did this for a long time, slamming my head into the ice at the same time.

Then my friend offered to let me go down the hill.  This, of course, involved me walking up the hill, so I began the long march.  I remember feeling like my voice was a springboard.  This is very hard to describe.  My voice felt very high-pitched, so I was trying to force it down to its normal pitch.  I now know that I thought I was moving through at least fourteen octaves (if you sing you understand that only the best singers can do even eight).  My voice was very high, and as I forced it down, I thought it was becoming more like my normal voice (which is quite low).  But as soon as I stopped trying to hold it down, it shot back up.  I think I was in fact making myself quieter, not lower.

Whatever the case, the feeling was euphoric at this point, not really calm.  It took me at least three minutes to get up the hill, which normally would have taken only one or so.  I slipped a lot, since I was wearing Vans on a slope that most people would hesitate to even walk down, let alone ride a toboggan down.  When I got to the top, I then went down, very slowly.  I dragged my feet the whole way, without wanting to, and everything was very blank.  I could hardly see, and felt very mellow by this point.  I think I was beginning to force myself out of my state of mind.  When I got to the bottom, we decided to go.  I do not remember walking back up the hill, but I remember climbing a fence, and walking across a field, and thinking I was going to die of hypothermia, and thinking my friend was going to pass out. 

When we got to his house, I was still quite blank, and feeling quite calm and empty.  I ate two massive plates of stir-fry.  Then we watched TV for a while, and then I went home, no longer high.

The high is not an ecstasy high.  It does not help you discover yourself, nor does it help you solve problems.  Weed is not something to be used for depression, as after you are done, the effects are gone, completely, other than the memories.  You will not feel like a god, or a better person.  You will simply have laughed a lot.

I do not suggest driving, swimming, cycling, or doing anything that could be dangerous, while you are high.  I find I lose a lot of control over my muscles, and can hardly move.  The main effect is the laughter, and the blank feeling.  You feel like you are not in your body, you feel like you are sleeping, dreaming.  It is an amazing feeling.  The whole high, for me, lasted for about one to one and a half hours.  I cant remember exactly.  I think that if I had smoked much more, I would have been completely incapacitated.  As it was, I could hardly move.  I think it is impossible to overdose on marijuana, but you can certainly make yourself throw up a lot, I know.  I dont suggest smoking to the point that you cant think at all.  I have seen people who, when high, cant walk, and crawl instead.  A friend of mine crawled about three miles.  It took him a number of hours.  He doesnt remember any of it.

All in all, I suggest bringing a friend with you, who will not be high when you are.  Smoke enough to get you to the point that you feel comfortable.  Dont do enough to go fucking potty.  I recommend marijuana to all of you, before anything else.  Before you can walk, you must crawl.  Before you try E, acid, K, or anything else, try weed.  Its fun, quite safe, and cheap.  I rate it A+.

Once upon a merry little time, I was feeling rather sick.  I decided the best medicine would be some high quality grass.  So I called my friends over.  We rolled two decent sized joints and smoked them between the two of us.  Being a very inexperienced smoker at the time, I was very fucked up.  When someone tried to talk to me, their voice would echo in my head.  I kept having flashbacks of my childhood, hearing old phrases and seeing old faces.  After about ten minutes, my friends went home.  It was about 10:00 and the shit was just kicking in hard.  I decided to go to bed.  I put on a Floyd concert, turned out the lights and got into bed.  I closed my eyes and immediatelly I was transported to an alien world.  The lights from the t.v. created some of the most amazing closed eye visuals I had ever seen.  Then suddenly my bed lifted off the ground.  I had the desire to open my eyes because it was way too real.  But I kept them shut.  As my bed went soaring through the clouds, I realized that I was not at all sick anymore.  So I continued to enjoy spinning through a spiral vortex of color and thought.

Ever since that night, I've tried to get that high.  I've come close, but can never get that fucked up off two fucking joint now matter how strong they are.

The day before spring break, a friend and I decided to have a little smoke session over at my apartment. We hadn't smoked in over 24 hours, and no other drugs had been taken. Being a novice smoker at the time, my friend offered to introduce me to the gravity bong. There are several different ways to make a gravity bong, but we chose to use a 2-liter soda bottle with the bottom 1/4 cut off. 

Preparation included filling the kitchen sink with water, and cutting/burning a hole in the bottle cap so as to insert the bowl on top of it. These activites took longer than anticipated, so we smoked a bowl using a regular pipe as we waited. When everything was ready, we inserted the packed bowl into the bottle cap hole, heated it with a lighter to seal it, and set up the bottle in the sink, w/the cap on top. 

After a few hits, I had the rythm and technique down for obtaining extremely large hits. This continued for quite a while, and the bowl seemed to last forever. My friend was able to fill the chamber so full that both of us could get an enormous hit off one pull.

By the end of the second bowl, I felt somewhat tired. The kitchen seemed so strange as a surrounding, and the light intensity seemed different from normal. My arms and legs were too heavy to move, and I put my head down. The conversation with my friend stopped, and I sat with my head down for a long time. During that time, I was able to see scenes of mixed colors and shapes, that appeared almost as if I had made them appear. 

After a while I got up and my friend left. I went to my bedroom, and stared at a car poster with glowing headlights--this intrigued me for at least 5 minutes, and I was able to see things in the glowing headlights. Then I closed my eyes and saw shapes and colors again, except I could control them and make them do what I wanted.

This experience, different from my normal high, seemed to last hours, but when I 'woke up,' I called my friend and told him, and he said it had only been a few minutes since he had left. I haven't felt anything like that since then, but the effect sparked my interest in 'tripping substances.'

Upon arrival in Canada from Scotland, I was soon invited to try some lovely B.C weed going by the name of White Widow. The stuff was covered in sticky, white THC chrystals and was like nothing I had ever seen before. Having only smoked low-stength resin back home, I was well up for it as were my buddies. The smell was very pungent but very nice. 

As soon as we lit up, we could feel the good times roll. After a few strong puffs, we were all absolutely f**ked. My English friend thought he was an explorer and started to swim accross the front lawn. Needless to say, the hilarity sent us into huge fits of uncontrollable laughter. Then, when it eventually subsided a little, I honestly started to believe I was a monkey. I sped around the room like monkeys do making the kind of noises monkeys do. We thought it was hilarious although one of my friends wasn't quite so impressed when I ate all the bananas out his cupboard but hey, I had the serious munchies.

After we all calmed down, we got down to some serious munching accompanied by some quality music. The visuals and sonics were amazing. Trip Hop was invented for this drug.

I don't know if we were smoking extra strong stuff or it was just because we were new to strong weed but this has to be the single best drug experience if my life.

My friend and I had made our way over to a record shop to see a few local bands and stumbled upon a friend whom offered to sell us some weed. Being quite glad we ran into him we purchased a 15 sac and made our way over to the concert. 

After arriving there and staying for about an hour we decided to go smoke up with a few friends whom we conveniently ran into. We arrived at his garage and had a beer. Than he pulled out a bowl and a half ounce and started passing it around.  We left after what seemed like 30 minutes. 

We arrived at my friends house and smoked some of our 15 sac. Then found ourselves in his brothers bedroom listening to Ministry. I was wearing my SFX contact lenses which made my eyes red and yellow. I started mouthing the words to the song and air guitaring to it. My friend started cracking up and saying my eyes looked like they were on fire. He said he thought I was Satan and started geeking out a little bit, so  I decided to stop. Than started poking at his eyes but not really touching them. He grabbed his eyes and started moaning like I had really poked him. He said it felt like his pupils were going into the back of his head and down into his throat. I started cracking up but at the same time a sense of fear had come over me. So I tried to take control and decided that we go downstairs and eat something. We walked into the kitchen and he puked into the sink and repeated trying to puke when there was nothing left.

I was trying to control my laughter considering the fact that I was scared out of my mind. Yet I still managed to try to calm him down and myself as well. By now I realized we had to be tripping some sort of way. We had gone back to his brothers room and started watching TV. He had gone to bed because his head was spinning and he couldn't take it. I was overcome with fear of my friend getting this weird idea in his head and coming into the room and murdering me, so I locked the door. Than I heard a voice in the back of my head telling me to go do what I just thought. I was staring at a sharpened pencil laying on the ground than geeked out and threw the covers over my head. I squeezed my eyes shut in hopes to fall asleep.

I woke up a few minutes later to find myself in the same state. I went downstairs to get something to eat. Somehow I managed to cook eggs and wrap them up in a burrito with cheese. I sat down to eat it and kept on seeing someone in the doorway out of the corner of my eye. I just ignored it. After taking a few bites the burrito started to taste real bad. I looked at it and the eggs were all liquidy and looked like some sort of mush. I spit it out on the plate and threw it away. Than ran up stairs into the same room, locked the door, and forced myself asleep.
