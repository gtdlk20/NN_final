We stood around talking in his garage after we were done smoking for around 8 to 15 minutes when I began to feel a slight headache creeping up on me. Thinking it was just a migrane I paid no attention to it, untill I began to feel VERY light headed. I tried to suck it up but it soon began to become very disorenting and I started to hear a high pitched ringing in my ears at a very low volume. At this point I began to take notice of what was happening to me and realized that it was best if I just went back home and layed down for a while. Trying to keep face with my friends I said I was going to go home and get something to eat and maybe go to sleep which was partailly true. I said my goodbyes to everyone and thanked them for the smoke out and began my walk home.
