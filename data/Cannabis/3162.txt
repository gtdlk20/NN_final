Peter looked at the bag of potting mix that he had bought. It would supply his plants with nutrients for a while, even though most commercial potting mixes required additional nutrients for his hungry plants.

Too fine a mix would make the soil sticky or soggy, preventing ventilation and promoting the growth of harmful bacteria.
