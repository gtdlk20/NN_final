Fear is flowing through me and away from me, it is so strong, scary, I mean IÂ’m fucking dying!  I know it would be stupid to freak out so I keep my mouth shut.  I go upstairs to go to bed to escape this fear.  If I go to bed I won't have this fear tomorrow, yeah but I won't have this genius this power this knowing this, this, it.
