I was lying on my friend's bed, getting ready for the song to come on. The lights were out, except for a lava lamp in the corner.  The first few measures of the song sound like they are literally going in one ear, colliding with your brain, and then exiting the other ear.  Then Jim starts singing. It is like you're walking up the stairway to heaven. You can picture yourself walking up a golden staircase, with little angel children playing the instruments all along the sides of the stairs. All along the staircase there are trees of gold and candy.  Jim Morrison is like God, calling you to heaven. I picture myself wearing this white dress with sparkles all over, and a crown of flowers. Finally, you have reached heaven, and you hear birds chirping, almost like you're in a field of flowers. If you concentrate hard enough, it almost feels like you're flying.
