All my memories after we started walking just dissapeared, I remember I asked the hour a couple times, first time I asked it was 10:50, second time it was 12:35 am. My time perception was really distorted, and I dont know exactly why it took us so long to reach my home. When we reached my home I said goodbye to my friends and entered my home, I could not fucking describe how beautifull it was to throw myself to bed, all the paranoia was gone, it was all solved, it was beautiful. I eat something and sleeped feeling like god.
