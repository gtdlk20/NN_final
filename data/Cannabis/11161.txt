Turn the element on to full power (this works best with gas or spiral-metal elements) and place the knive as hard against this as possible.  Sometimes a round piece of metal (such as the top of a coffee tin) is used as a hat on top, however this is usually somewhat excessive for Oil.  It usually takes 5-10 mins for the elements to heat up properly (significantly longer with gas)
