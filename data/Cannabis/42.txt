It went on like that for the rest of the night.  Flipping either side of the panic attack on the Line of Wellbeing.  Even waiting for the Taxi outside Toms, I couldnt smile at Taya properly.  It was like I had forgotten how to express emotion.  I was still telling my body to do stuff right up until I got into bed that night.  I was apprehensive about going to sleep now, as my mind would be free to wonder without any visual stimuli, but after two or three waves of small to moderate panic, I finally fell asleep.  It had been a very scary ordeal.  I had obviously unsettled Taya, and for that I felt terrible.  She pointed out to me the next morning that I couldnt recall my address to the Taxi driver.  It wasnt that I didnt know it, I just couldnt stop thinking about the situation.  I couldnt get out of my mind-cinema.
