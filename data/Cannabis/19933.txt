It affects my memory.  Memories don't record that well. This afternoon I went for a walk to ferry terminal.  As of now I only retained segmented fragments of that walk.  It was if I was home then at the park with little or no memories of the journey between the two. This trend continued over my walk.  I remember sitting at the ferry terminal then at the wooden steps of the graveyard then the last 20 feet to home. The feeling of sun on my skin was magnetic. I was intaking sunshine. About 2 Km round trip.
