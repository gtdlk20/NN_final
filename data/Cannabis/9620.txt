After we finished, we went to a swimming hole by the waterfalls. This was very cool. On the way there, I was hearing my favorite CD for the first time, all over again. Every sound was a perfect harmony to my mood. It was beautiful. The water was cold, and the reflections of light on the water got my mind to wander. I closed my eyes and thought about breathing underwater, and floating in a tranquil paradise. Somewhere in this stream of thought my parents came to mind, and I began to feel guilty. This was a major bring down from my high. I quickly deminished the thought, but I couldnt get back what was lost.
