Needless to say, the aftereffects are possibly the longest I've ever had. The next day I woke just in time to rush to my first meeting with the local social worker, and If I wasn't experienced with psychedelics, I think the meeting could have been akward, since her face kept flushing and I occasionally heard 8-bit Nintendo-like soundeffects out of nowhere. But in my case, the meeting went well. Later that day I had no more visual effects, but the occasional odd sound still came once in a while.
