11:40 AM (T+00:40)- I was really starting to get a buzz. This was the cannabis that I knew, or at least this was what I thought at the time. This is the point where I started making the series of mistakes that made this high miserable. Firstly, I should have planned a little more and done this shit WELL before my parents were home so I could experience it, come down, and baseline before either of them even walked in the door. Instead, I gave myself about four hours, which would have been enough had I eaten a safe dose instead of something that even the most veteran eaters would pale at. My second mistake was calling my cousin. He had no knowledge of the high that I was about to descend into, and I intended for it to stay that way. My third mistake, and one of the worst, was bringing my dog, an 80 pound German Shephard. As long as I keep an eye on her, I thought, She'll be a good dog. Mistake # 4.
