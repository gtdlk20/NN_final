The eye was like there was a tear in the fabric of the heavens, and an eye was peeping through. It was female, and very pretty (I have a thing for eyes anyway). I sat up and looked at K's car, and the fractal persisted. I could see the 3D-block fractal pouring into the tire-area of his car, because that was the darkest part of his car to look at, where I could see it best. The cubes were pink/red/blue/green, but very light in color. Very similar in color to 'blips,' as people call them-a common effect of Psilocybin mushrooms.
