	T+10 minutes: My eyes open and I am once again inside of myself.  There is no hole in the roof of D's recreation room, all the wooden boards are perfectly okay, and I am quite confused.  I feel an incredible pressure in my body, and have no clue what to do with it.  I look at T, who laughs, causing me to remember how to laugh again.  As I laugh uproariously, the pressure in my body subsides.
