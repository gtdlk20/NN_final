Around this time, I was new in High School and beginining to question the authority of my parents and any official figure.  I was already interested in the human conciousness and any sort of hypnosis or meditation.  I read extensivly about OBE's and any sort of trance-like state.  It was a combination of this interest and the influence of one of my friends which led me to first try marijuana.
