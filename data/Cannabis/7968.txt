When I was sitting in the chippie, I was noticing that all the things I was looking at were going really slowly and if I looked from one place to another, it took a while for me to see what I was looking at. Also, I was looking at people walking past and thinking about their own lives, how different they were from mine, and then I realized that I had just planned out their lives for them... I had thought of that their partners would look like, their parents... what they would do for a job, what they were doing in town that night. Everyone I was looking at, all these thoughts came into my head. It wasn't overwhelming though, it was just nice. I could have stopped thinking at any time, but I didn't want to. If someone had started talking to me, then I could have come out of the trance and talked to them quite easily, without worrying about saying the wrong thing.
