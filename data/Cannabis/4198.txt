Some of these visions and images I saw with closed eyes were downright cartoonish, such as claymation-like figures moving about. Some of them probed the memory, such as repeated images of an old computer desktop screen my sister had back in the day, which I used a lot. Some were startlingly complex and intricate, easily rivaling the geometric patterns I witnessed on 1/8th of mushrooms. But all these were brief, no matter how vivid or amazing or psychedelic they were in fact. The high from this particular strain is fairly short, as well.
