We sat at the first bench we came to, which had a bush between us and the police station. We lit up, and passed the joint several times. I felt an overwhelming urge to stand up and walk, so we got up and walked down the path a bit, still smoking the joint. We got a huge amount of hits from this joint, it was packed very well. We sat down at a bench farther down the path, but then I immediately wanted to get up again. I decided I didn't want to smoke anymore, so I told her she could finish it.
