To this day, I have never had a similar experience, even with the other drugs I've tried since.  I have never seen any kind of visuals during the daytime, nor have I ever been able to achieve the same level of 'highness' as I did that day.  I believe that there was something going on with the virus in my system at the time. I was on week three of recovering from a pretty bad case of mono. I would give anything to reach that intensity again, short of having mono.
