The darkness was not as searing and it was leaving in the same form it arrived: A raging torrent collapsing upon itself. I then sat down and we began to play some WarCraft 3, stoned out our skulls. Then, as I slightly lean forward to find the nearest gold deposit, the hatred returns. My vision dies once more and I slightly turn to where Raz was at and I say, 'Dude...I need something to eat.' So, I feel my way around, looking out of what little splotches of vision that still remain and make myself to the kitchen. He points out to what they have, and I reach for the Simpson's Pop Tarts. Little did I know, I had actually grabbed a packet of popcorn. He laughs at me, as do I as I slightly read the words 'Pop-sec --' on the package. He then exclaims, 'Fuck man! Are you going to be alright?' out of pure worry after discovering the true magnatude of my condition.
