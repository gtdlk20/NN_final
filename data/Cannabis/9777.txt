So we stationed ourselves on my bed next to the window, each with our own joint and bowl ready. I turned on a Mars Volta CD. Simutaneously, we lit up our joints and inhaled. 2 seconds later, all 3 of us were coughing like crazy. It was a while before any of us could speak and when we did, the words that came out were 'holy shit this stuff is fucking strong'. The weed was simply INSANE.
