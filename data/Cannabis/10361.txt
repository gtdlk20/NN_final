So while I was walking I could feel my legs go sooo fast. I was a speedy walker.  Wen I crossed the street I hardly looked both ways. And finally made it to the shop.  After I picked out a brownie and this wierd cranberries crumble thing, I realized that while I was paying the cashier I had the umbrella over my head the whole time.  I just forgot to take it down wen I went in.  So it was too late.  I didnt even bother taking it down by this time.
