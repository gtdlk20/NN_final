I was concentrating on some magpies that were collecting sticks for their nests. I remember hearing them repeat their calls and I was getting the impression that something sounded odd. Before I knew it, the sound dissipated into the sound of the river flowing and I then realized that the magpies weren't even there, that I was imagining it.
