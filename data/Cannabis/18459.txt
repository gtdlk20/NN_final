If i just gave up on the first one I had, what would stop me from losing a second? A third? Hell, soon enough I'd have lost all the glasses. Aside from that there was this pestering tingle in the back of my mind just wondering where this amazing hiding spot was. Soon enough I found it by the TV from when BMF and I tried to get some music going in the DVD player. Having wanted to go outside for what seemed like hours, I finally said fuck it to everything, took a leak, and went outside to smoke with BMF, notebook in my hand. I had it in my mind that I would roll and draw and/or write. I had a great cigarette and talk with BMF about just how cool I thought he was, his reciprocated comment, art, clothing, people, all the usual. Then I started to talk and draw, and he told me that he wanted to go inside for a while. I told him that I'd stay out there for some time, and that he could join me again if he wished.
