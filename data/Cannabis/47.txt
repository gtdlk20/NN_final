As terrifying as it was, I am actually glad of the experience.  For one thing, it taught me a lot about my own mind (something Tom assured me would happen to anyone who takes any drug regularly), and for another, I know now that panic attacks are just something that people can go through, whether it be triggered by a particular frame of mind, or thought; or just a chemical fuck up in their brain.  The main thing is I know I can come out of it now, no matter how fatal it seems.
