T-0 hour, 1:00PM, I munch down the firecracker. It tasted somewhere between campfire, dankness and stale nutterbutter. The drymouth that followed was devestating. I had timed it out and allowed myself 30-40 minutes before my gym class (I was psyched) for it to set in. It crept up slowly, and I almost didn't notice it, but looking back, it started somewhere in the middle of gym, and that was the most incredible gym class ever. I don't think I did much beside stand there, but I thought I was in Vietnam, so it's cool.
