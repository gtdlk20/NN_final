Upon coming back inside to the kitchen to dispose of the apple and have a drink of water, I realized I was already on my way to being very stoned. Random, quirky thoughts popped into my head as I filled up a glass of water, things I can't even recall but surely made no sense, as if I was having an imaginary conversation with someone that doesn't exist. Now, when I went to my bedroom to lay back and watch TV, the real high started. I gazed in awe, that familiar open-mouthed stoned look, at the television set, which seemed unreal. Unreal is the only word I can use to describe it, it was simply strange. It looked as if it was stretching apart at the seams or something. I laughed uncontrollably at Conan O' Brien as he made jokes while interviewing some dumb guest.
