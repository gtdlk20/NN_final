Last night I got a good 4-5 grams of new weed. It had little blonde hairs, but they were nothing special, they were short and generic. Amazingly, this was the most stunning weed experience I'd ever had. I took 5 long hits out of a water bong a friend made for me. I wasn't expecting anything new -- but boy did I get a surprise. My memory went extremely bad during this experience, so I might leave out a lot.
