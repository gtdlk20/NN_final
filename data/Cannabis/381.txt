My mood for the evening was irritated boredom.  It was a Friday night and I was not at a party (the consensus of the boys in our hall was that a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night spent in the dorms was a wasted night Â– such is life at a University where the students are ashamed of being *demoted* to the rank of #5 party school in the nation).  I was planning to trek over to another dorm in an hour or two but I decided to smoke a little to pass the time.
