On the other hand I was able to close my eyes and see colorful swirls. After a few more minutes I was feeling as though I was in between worlds, or realities, that I was existing in the barrier between these realities. Behind me was myself and the physical existence, and in front of me was an expansive,(infinite?), reality filled with all sorts of images, stars, planets, beams of energy, expanding in all directions. All these things were sort of half-seen and half-felt. I then became aware of a bluish/purple form in front of me. It was undulating and morphing, but never took on a definite shape. The unique thing at this point was that the form and the space in front of me took on a fuller 3-d appearance. There was a lot of other stuff going on at this time as well, I remember a feeling of leaves at one point as well.
