I was absolutely loopy at this point, and I began spinning in circles on my friendÂ’s couch, giggling uncontrollably. It had hit him hard too, and he was acting strangely as well, pacing and speaking incoherently (or maybe I was too high to understand him!). We fired up Smash Bros. and neither of us could play well at all. Eventually, we settled in and started watching TV.
