The Experience: We walked from the college to Stoke Park and sat down in a fairly remote place in some nice lush green grass (there were a few people visible, but they were too far away to see what we were doing, or smell the pot).  After we sat down and got comfortable, I asked if the Skunk was Sensimilla or Super Skunk which he replied: 'No, just some really strong stuff I got from a good mate.'  I trusted him - he was going to smoking it too, and he's very experienced.  I looked at the skunk later on when he was crumbling it into his pipe: it didn't appear to have any strange crystals on it, and it didn't appear to be soggy.  However it did crumble really finely I seem to remember my friend saying.  Before we started doing the pipes we did have two Jays prepared by Dave, each of which we shared.
