I try to meditate before I use any of them, and get to a calm and serene state of being so that I am entering the experiment with the most light inside me as possible. As I stated before, I have a deep respect for plant-teachers--However, I am slightly biased towards cannabis, which I feel obliged to include in this report. Up until this experience, it has had little spiritual impact on me (that I have made note of anyway), though it has had a lot of aesthetic value-and sometimes the line between the two is minimal or nonexistent. This could be because I haven't fully allowed myself a full experience of cannabis, but rather have used it as either an experiment in the field, or to enjoy life with friends. I don't feel that either of these are negative, but it's not the road I feel is mine to walk down more than once a blue moon.
