Eventually, I made it to bed, and I layed down to rest. As I lay there, the vibrations subsided slightly and just hung there like an engine idling. The bed felt as if it was encompassing me, and I eventually had the feeling of not even laying on a mattress, but on a cloud. Suddenly, I started pumping my legs as if I was riding a bicycle. It wasn't voluntarily at first, as I am known to twitch like this at times, but I soon began to pump them because the vibration feelings were stronger when I did so.
