Last night I smoked some weed laced with, I didnt know at the time, PCP. This bong was crazy it costed well over 400 dollars and all I needed was one hit to send me flying around. I started to get a little confused/shocked feeling in about five minutes but the real effects didnt set in until about 15 minutes later. Normally I am a fun, giggly, talkative person when I am high but this was much different and I knew right away this wasnt just any weed.
