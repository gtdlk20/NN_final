This afternoon I had a really strange experience on weed and was wondering if anyone else has had the same thing happen. I have been smoking for about 3 years and I am now 17. Recently (the last 4 months) there hasn't been more than 10 days when I haven't smoked up. I had just gotten off school this lovely Friday afternoon and was looking foward to a nice big session. Me and my mate loaded a couple of cones and started toking. Now this shit I had smiked before. It was quality. It had so many crystals on it and it smelled really potent. Anyway, after the cones were finished my friend went to drop his car home and we were supposed to meet at his place in about 15 minutes to pick him up and go to work. I was sitting on the side of the road waiting for my brother to bring the car home when shit started happening. I was staring at the road in front of me and it started waving like water. I thought this was odd but cool and continued to stare in awe. What happened next was the most awesome open eyed visual display I have experienced. The outline of a cartoon character appeared and then continued to morph into various other characters and objects. I was probably watching this for about 10 minutes and I really was in a world of my own. I then closed my eyes and was welcomed by an amazing array of colourful orbs etc.
