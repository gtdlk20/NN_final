This is now 3 hours after smoking the CBD-rich flower. With all these feelings I asked them to phone for an ambulance as I was in fear of my life. They arrived and according to all my checks I was fine apart from there being weakness in my left arm which they couldnÂ’t understand. After they left and I started coming back to earth I felt drained tired and relieved that I survived this trip.
