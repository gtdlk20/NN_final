My hair is falling into my face and Hughie is asking me if I still need to puke. I moan and begin to cry. I cannot stop myself. I am thinking horrible things now. I am going to die. I cannot form any sort of words to tell him what I am feeling so I cry and moan like an infant. I am breathing heavily at this point and can feel my heart beating through my chest faster than I have ever felt my own or anyone else's heart beat. My breath pushes against the interior of the metal sink and reflects back on my face. I can feel it as if my own hot breath has become ice cold against the metal instantly, but it's not refreshing. I still cannot vomit.
