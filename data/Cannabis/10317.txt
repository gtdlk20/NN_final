A kind patron of the arts brought my band a sheet of cookies and a sheet of brownies both made with cannabutter to eat while recording a song. I hadn't eaten anything that day, and very little the day before, so I ate half of the cookies, and half of the brownies. The two batches of baked good had been made with 1 lb of cannabutter total, and each lb of cannabutter contained 1/4lb of trim, so I effectively ate somewhere in the range of an eighth of a pound of pot within the span of a few hours.
