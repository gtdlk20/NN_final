These thoughts pass and soon Im falling asleep, Im still looking at myself from behind and it's like Im asleep with my eyes open and what Im seeing is what Im dreaming.  I think the thought 'lucid dream' I go over what it means being aware that you are dreaming it has more significance than just this moment it is applicable to this trip it has made me aware of the dream that is life.
