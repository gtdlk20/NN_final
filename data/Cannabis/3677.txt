This was around two months ago and I'm still smoking.  My second experience was great and I managed to control my high completely.  Initially I just wasn't able to handle my high and I wasn't exactly prepared for what it contended.  I'm glad I didn't let that experience ruin weed for me, since I'm very happy with it now and no longer have bad highs.
