When the videos finished, BMF went back out to the trampoline and Ox but in an Xbox game and played. I watched him for a little bit, then went out to the trampoline. I laid there for a while, having some very weird closed-eye visuals that I can only claim to be from the lack of sleep. I mean, the rolls would have worn off somewhere around four or five, but it was eight in the morning. So, I just layed there for a while, then got kind of hungry and went to make some more Pop-Tarts. I made my poptarts and ate them while Ox did something on the TV that I don't recall. It was either still the game or just some show, I wasn't paying attention.
