I kept insisting to 'A' that I didn't like what this shit was doing to me and how freaked I was. My heart was racing and I actually asked her to call my mother. She reminded me how horrible that would turn out and told me to chill out. eventually I stopped blacking out, relaxed, and felt the normal goofy high from smoking weed that I'm now familiar with. Since then I've wondered if it was laced with something but it probably wasn't since 'A' wasn't affected at all. Others also say that first time highs can be very strange and intense.
