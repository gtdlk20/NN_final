When we had finished the blunt, we all stood around and talked for a bit. After about five minutes, my friend Sam asked me if I wanted to goto the chippie down the road. I went with him into 'The Town Fryer' and purchased some chips. As I sat down I was looking at the window in front of me. It had some fake snow sprayed on it around the edges and around some of the stickers that had been placed on it. I noticed that someone had written 'HENRY' in the fake snow and it got me laughing. I was sitting there laughing for what seemed like ages. My friend Sam came and sat down next to me and asked what I was laughing at and I didn't tell him because I thought it would seem stupid. So we sat there and didn't say anything to eachother. Even though there was nothing particularly interesting going on at the time, everything seemed really interesting to me. I was thinking, thinking, thinking, and everything lead on to a thought, which turned into another thought. It was really great! I had to physically shake my head to get myself out of this trance of thought. I noticed that most of my chips had gone and that I was chewing on one at the time, so even while thinking and thinking, I was still eating my chips and not noticing it!
