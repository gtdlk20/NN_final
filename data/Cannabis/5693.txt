This part of the day I remember in vivid detail, though it still amazes me how it happened.  I had made the walk from the dining hall to my first class enough times, I knew how long it took.  The walk to the building was about 13-15 minutes, and then it took another two or three minutes to get to the classroom.  I started the walk with about 18-20 minutes before class, just enough time to get there if I walked at my normal pace.  Of course, my normal pace was only normal when I wasn't as completely high as I was that morning, but the worry of being late to class barely registered as I turned my mp3 player on while walking outside.  I lit another cigarette once outside and started walking to class.
