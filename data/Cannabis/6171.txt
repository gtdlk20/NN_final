The next thing that was very intense, the light of the TV was on my legs, and my legs started to violently flash again like a fast strobe light.  My legs seemed to get a 2d, flat like a piece of paper look.  Then the 2d shape of my legs started to stack on top of each other with a small gap.  They stacked up in an instant.  They stacked up to what seemed to be right under my eyes.  While this happened each layer was still flashing rapidly.  I zoned out like this for about 5 seconds then snapped out of it.
