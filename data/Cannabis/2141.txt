I sound like such an idiot right now.  I think, in this temporary moment, Im trading my (hopefully) eloquent style of writing for a ticket into another place.  No, not Switzerland or Canada or Wyoming.  Those are flat trips.  This time Im vacationing in a 3d world.  I was a circle, but I was rotated around in directions I didnt know existed I became a sphere.  A circle cannot conceive of a sphere while it is a circle still.  But alas!  I can conceive of this being that Ive become, this world.  Ive been a piece of paper and suddenly lifted up into the air.  What is this air?  Except this feelingits familiar in a way.  Its like, the way things are supposed to be.  This is another spiritual level (god do I sound corny but I must go on).  Not different levels like in a staircase or building.
