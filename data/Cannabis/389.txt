It was a gigantic shock.  I could hardly believe it.  This was NOT what I had signed on for.  I immediately became extremely angry with Rick.  How DARE he.  What the FUCK was he thinking  not telling me what the fuck I was smoking.  I was going to tell him off the next time I saw him  no  punch the bastard out  kill him?  That was when the first onslaught of free associational thinking occurred.  I experienced a cascade of images.  5,000 . . . 10,000 different ways to kill someone.  StabShootRendTearCrushStabStabStabLiverHeartSpineShoot . . . Not pleasant.  This was NOT a good experience.  This is what the anti-drug crazies said would happen.  This is a bad trip.  This is a nightmare.  This is painful.  PAIN.  This is awful.  This is the worst I have ever felt.  This must be what torture feels like.  This is torture . . . THIS.  IS.  HELL.  That realization hit me harder than anything had so far.  I was in hell.
