Now, I have smoked like this many many times before, but something was different about this experience. Normally the fuzzy silly funny feeling erupts and rises until a fit of laughter amongst all who are stoned creates an enjoyment climax, followed by an insightful period of wondering, which doesnt last long before the menacing frenzy for food breaks loose. After the stomach is full to the point of bloating, heavy fatigue sets in, and the body begs for sleep. This time, it was different.
