In retrospect the shape of the experience is not all that surprising.  I can see where and how my most personal fears and curiosities were played out as I watched  mostly powerless  to stop or alter their effects.  It was therapeutic in a way.  Extraordinarily frightening in another.  I wasnt quite myself again for several days.  The bad parts were very bad.  But the good parts were good enough that Im curious to explore this altered state of consciousness again - with a prepared mind and a friendly environment in which to experience it.
