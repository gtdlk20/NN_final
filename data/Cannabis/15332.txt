It was a mind opening experience that I recommend, but as with any choice it should be an educated one. (I had researched a bit before the first time I smoked marijuana just to be sure.) I hope my experience might educate others on the potential effects of marijuana. Open your mind to new things and thoughts and as long as you think it through, you'll most likely come out better for it. We did.
