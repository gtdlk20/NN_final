About an hour and a half after we had first smoked that night, I noticed the effects were significantly coming down. We sprayed cologne on ourselves to cover up whatever was left of the smoke smell, then went down to get food and water, since we both had the munchies and some pretty bad cottonmouth. At about 10:45, my mom picked me up, and, feeling a very mellow after-glow, I went home, ready to go to bed.
