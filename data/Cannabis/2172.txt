At this point of time, I was still completing my semester, but she had finished hers, returning to her parentsÂ’ house and significantly cutting the travel distance between us. She came up to see me, my bitterness crumpled like paper, and we spent the rest of the time cuddling, which was much more physical contact than I had had with her up to that point. She came back a few days later, and we became more physically intimate this time. The intensity of the experience indicated to me that I truly loved her, and I was excited about the future. At the same time, she had a tendency to run away when things got too intense, so I was on my guard.
