For me, I have OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) which is an anxiety disorder where I can't quite worrying about stupid things no matter what anyone tells me, like if i am afraid that my hands have germs on them, and i freak out, yet I know it's not possible, the fear and such is so strong that i cant ignore it and wont believe my own mind.
