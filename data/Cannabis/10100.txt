Once we started to ride off the street lights started to feel like they were blinking and time would go on strangely. Every other second would skip. I didn't think I would get high but I did (it must have been some strongass bud). Then I immediately fell into this trance that I will never ever forget. I slumped over in my seat and fell into this coma-like state. I started have memories from long ago come back (early early childhood)! I started to think that life was all one big dream and everything is a pattern and that I've already lived this life and will live it again and again. I thought that maybe I had this feeling every time I got high and that I just don't remember. Whenever I had a thought another idea would come over it and make me forget. I would come up with a conclusion in my head about life, the universe and everything and why this was happening to me but another thought would come over that and tell me that it's all a dream, but then another thought would tell me that that was a dream too. This would happen for what seriously felt like millions of years. I was very frightened yet I could not do anything.
