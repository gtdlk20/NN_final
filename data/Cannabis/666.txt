Past drugs taken and When the Experience Happened: Acid, taken twice, last new years eve and the one before that (I have never experienced flash backs or HPPD). I've been smoking pot for about half a year now, on average 2 or 3 tokes on a Jay (tobacco with hash) every week, more rarely I have a big smoking session with Skunk in either bongs, blunts and pipes about every month or so.  I drink alcohol for social purposes only, and I don't smoke pure tobacco (unless itÂ’s in a hash mix).  Before this experience I had last smoked cannabis about a week from then.  This experience happened on a Wednesday, about a couple of months ago from now.
