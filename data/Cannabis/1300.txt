I am writing this to share some of my experiences with marijuana; a drug that is in my opinion, extremely under studied and highly misunderstood.  It was this very plant that first pried me from reality as I once knew it, unraveled the very fibers of my consciousness, and for that I am ever grateful.  It takes a drug-induced experience to truly reveal the potential of the human mind.  I sincerely believe we all have the ability to interact with a multitude of altered mindframes; each one unique, each one with something to offer, and we are deluding ourselves by refusing to accept this.  My endeavors with marijuana have taught me this; to limit one's consciousness is to deprive one's self.  Reality is essentially multi-faceted; there is so much more to life that remains unexplored by many of us, and psychoactives serve to inform us of these vast possibilities.
