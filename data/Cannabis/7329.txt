I made it outside and grabbed the bike.  The ride back on campus is probably about a mile but it is slightly uphill.  That bike ride home was the most interesting I've ever had.  Half way through I stopped M and kept telling him 'dude, this is so weird right now dude.  It's so fucking weird.'  He kept looking at me (not stoned) and saying 'nah man, it's fine, shut up.'  But as we neared our dorms I kept repeating the words 'near' and 'neat' in my head.  I found that they were cool words and I was excited to be near my dorm.  I kept repeating these words over and over again but that was nothing for what was about to happen.
