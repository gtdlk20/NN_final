I drove home later that night 2 hours later and the although I could see fine and actually feel my limbs at this point, the ride which normally takes 25 minutes seemed to take 5.  This night surpasses the 'highest I've ever been' as I can not even fully describe what was going in my mind when I was at my peak, all my friend could say to describe it was that 'you were gone'.  Once again I'm not sure if it was the weed or the days that had gone by since I had smoked, but that night was one of the most intense experiences I have ever had, and if I had a choice to repeat it I probably would.
