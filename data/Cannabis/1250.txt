12:45 still uncertain of the nature of the effects, but still think there's something there... Ate a ripe peach, a bread roll & a bag of Cheese & Onion... as well as another half tab. Well I gummed it again, to be entirely accurate, & now back to meditation & breathing. Drying hoodie is making amusingly entertaining drip splat drip sounds nearby. See, definitely something there...
