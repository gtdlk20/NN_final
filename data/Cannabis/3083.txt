I enjoyed just sitting and letting the high come and go, just watching TV and letting time slip away unnoticed. Of course I could have done something creative like play a musical instrument, or written a poem or something, but me and the weed both decided that just sitting and enjoying was probably the best thing to do at that moment. So that's what I did.
