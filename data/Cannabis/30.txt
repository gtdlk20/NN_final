As I stood up, the full weight of my state of mind hit me.  Even though I was doing and saying things, it felt like I was still in my subconscious cinema.  Rather than just doing things and saying things, it was like I was ordering my body to say and do things.  I could literally feel the delay in reaction and the messages coursing through my nervous system.  Like I was controlling an organic robot from inside.  I suddenly felt another wave of panic as I thought about my heart racing.  It felt like I was controlling how fast it was going.  The more I obsessed, the faster it would beat.  Naturally I thought back to the line of wellbeing.  I was right in the middle of it.  The fact that we were downstairs making a cup of tea was because I was right in the middle of it.
