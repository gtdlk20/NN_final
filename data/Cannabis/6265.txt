About ten minutes into the experience I was swept out into what seemed like space.  I was floating and I had completely lost connection with my physical body.  Then I came back, instead of floating in space I was floating in my bathroom.  I knew I had to clean up so I stuck my head under the shower, which seemed to partially ground me for about a minute.  I cleaned up my stuff and went back into my room.
