The first time I tried a weed brownie, I bought one off of one of my friends who had previously eaten some from the same batch. As he had not experienced any negative symptoms, I thought it would be safe to have one. I had been smoking herb in bowls or blunts for about a year. I expected the high to have the same effects as a blunt or a few bowls I expected the high to have the same effects as a blunt or a few bowls, ie. good mood, euphoria, munchies, laughter, sleepiness.
