This feeling was very odd. As it peaked, the effects became so strong that I thought I might be eternally doomed to this trance-like state. Everything I saw was in a freeze-frame. That frame would stay frozen for about 4 seconds and then I would see a new clip. This was my reality. Life was in frames, and I would see a new freeze-frame about every four seconds. If I let my mind go and tried to free it, I would be drawn in to whatever I was looking at. If I stared at the stars, I felt like I was being sucked into them. And when I stopped looking, everything became choppy and blurry for a few seconds.
