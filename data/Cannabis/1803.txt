T+0:50  Went back inside. Walking is very surreal, as if it is not me walking. I can watch myself walk from above in the sky, floating a few feet above our heads when we are outdoors. I can barely speak anymore, my mouth is too amazingly dry and water doesnt hydrate it, too many amazing thoughts to give voice to. I sat down next to the couch in the basement, and started to just look around Every individual object was just that, an individual jumping out for attention. People lost importance. Average OEVs and High level CEVs.
