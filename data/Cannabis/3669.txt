My phone rang and it was my dad.  We had a pretty normal conversation but I felt everything speed up.  I had trouble getting my words out correctly, and the tone of my voice increased.  I got through the conversation fine and resumed to the garage where my friend was taking another hit.  At this point in time I felt very nervous; almost paranoid.  I told my friend he needed to leave because my dad was going to be home soon, which was true.  I cleaned up all noticeable aspects that would suggest I was smoking.
