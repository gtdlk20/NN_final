+0:00 - I pour out ~30ml of the green dragon, slam it down and - in the first of several dubious decisions of the evening - head out to take care of an errand. I've just realized that my cell phone service has been cut off, which (somehow) disconnects my home internet as well, so I have to find an unsecured hot spot to send a few messages. The plan is to get back to my apartment before the brew fully kicks in.
