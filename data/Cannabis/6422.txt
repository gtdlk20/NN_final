It wasnt long before I made another trip into the bathroom to reacquaint myself with the toilet bowl! I tried to spew but couldnt and it was making me very uncomfortable. I gave up and headed back to the smoke filled room to lie on PiCs sofa bed. I was too annoyed to really take note of what I was feeling like other than extreme nausea. All I was thinking about was falling to sleep, which took its time!! While I was lying on the bed I felt I was falling down to earth from a higher place. I wasnt sure which was I was pointing or facing once my eyes were closed. All I could think about was how this plant had me at its mercy, I was nearly crying from the pain and discomfort that I was experiencing. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF CANNABIS.
