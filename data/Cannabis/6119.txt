Probably the most stunning part of the whole trip was when I visualized a splash of water very small and far away from me, then suddenly it zoomed up and slapped me in the face. Basically the whole way home I had my eyes closed, and I was just pissing off my 2 friends who had both had less hits than me. I sat down for about 10 minutes and just 'watched' the amazing fireworks display. After that the visions were fading so I decided just to keep my eyes open. We went to burger king and got some food, then we went home and pretty much fell asleep.
