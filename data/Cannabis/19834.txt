Written words too have an aura. The strength and nature of which depends on their meaning and the kind Â of people who have been using them for centuries. Their energy of intention is embedded in them and when spoken out loudly with the right intention and energy they have the power to act on the material world. This is the science behind magical spells and mantras.
