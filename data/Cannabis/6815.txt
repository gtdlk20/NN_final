I continued to go about the rest of the night, not fully understanding anything. I went into a well deep in a forest with my friend to drink. I took one sip of rum and everything looked a bit shaky. Then I told myself that being drunk and high just would not work, because I had to be home soon. I looked around the area. Last time I had been here, it looked simply like a small clearing in a forest. This time, I saw the well, the stone path leading from it, everything. I had a great fear that someone would come up from behind us and kidnap us, but I felt like this was simply my marijuana-infected body telling me this, not my knowledgeable mind. So I ignored it.
