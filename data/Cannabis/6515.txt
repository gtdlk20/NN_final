When we got to his house, we sat down in the basement, while Lukas and his friend Matthew played ping pong and the other girl Jessica and I watched. 5 or so minutes in, Matthew and Lukas decided to go leave for 10 or so minutes to go buy an ounce or so of weed. They gathered up 35 dollars and sent us to bring down water, a bubbler, and towels/bathing suits to the pond. About then our friend Mark arrived and waited while Jessica and I changed. Then we walked in the dark to the pond. We were having a bit of trouble walking through the brush in the dark, and Mark rescued us with a large flood light/flashlight and we went to go sit by the pond and wait.
