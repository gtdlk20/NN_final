The next day I walked to school, and felt the same high feeling by the time I had reached my school's double doors. I wandered around the halls until I eventually found my classroom, and ended up failing the math test I had to take that morning. I did not understand the math problems, and I had accidentally written off the paper and onto the desk a few times.  Naturally, I got about a 15% on the test. I found my friend who I had smoked with, and saw my handwriting all over her binder. Apparently I had written some incoherent words on her binder with a pen, and did not remember doing it.
