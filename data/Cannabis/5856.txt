We smoked through my friend's bubbler and the weed tasted of pine. Shortly after the first hit I could feel the muscles in my face and eyes completely relax. I was at a point where I very well knew I wasn't normal, but not quite high yet. 3 of us went through about 3 bowls at first. Now, we had already ordered the pizzas so it was only a matter of waiting. Quickly, paranoia set in. The phone rang and none of us answered it. As we ran into the room with the answering machine all we heard was, '...so I'll be there in a few minutes K.'
