Sumblime was playing and it felt as if the room was swaying to the music and it wouldnt stop, almost like being drunk but in a weird way. I also found that during this time my throat was hurting intensely, it felt so dry but no matter what I would drink I could NOT quench it. I remember describing to my friend that my throat kept 'going up in the back all tight.' I think that I must have been clenching it or something I have no idea.
