He didn't know how to roll except with lined paper and that is what he used. I helped do a 'cheater's roll', where one rolls the joint before putting in the pot and widens the opening with a pencil. We did that with two joints, and he lit it, and was going to smoke it all, and I couldn't resist, so I said 'Please pass that.'
