Weird thoughts start crossing my mind. I became a little bit aggressive, started shouting. I quickly called a taxi and left the place. The taxi ride was about 3 minutes. It felt like aeons passed. The taxi driver was talking to me and his voice was coming with echo. I looked at him and he was miles away from me. By then I was in my room. Had a shower, called my girlfriend and went to bed. The feeling was there, but I was coming down. I woke up the next day only to find that I was steel feeling it. It was completely gone by the afternoon. I had another joint then, just to check. It didn't came back, everything was 'normal' again. My 'normal' is a bit different than it used to be before that. I thought I was too close to insanity. I had no visuals of any kind except from faulty space perception and distorted objects. No closed eye visuals.
