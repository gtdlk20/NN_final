It was only a few months ago that I tried smoking some weed.  I had always been somewhat interested in it, but my family has had a long history of drug use, so I was always reluctant to engage in any illegal substance.  I had told my friend about my wonderments concerning pot and he openly admitted to me that he smoked.  He persuaded me to smoke some with him when my dad was away at work one day, and I, totally curious of its effects, just went with the flow.
