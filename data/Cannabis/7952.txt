This is where the experience gets interesting. As soon as I shut my eyes, things began to get weird. Slow, swirling colors and checkered patters decorated the darkness- I was experiencing closed eye visuals. This boggled my mind because never before had I tripped on pot, nor did I think it was possible. Yet, the colors were as real as the sky is blue, and I knew I was not sleeping. I could still hear the goings-on of the party, and I had not fallen into the semi-concious stage you experience just before sleep. Although tired, I was fully there and awake. Suddenly the twisting nonsense on the back of my eyelids took form - a black frame around a white scene. The whiteness was in the form of a convex square, like the shape of a TV screen. Suddenly, this screen began to host images. As the images (they were moving, by the way, kind of like movies- changing every 30 seconds or so) played, they seemed to be quite farmiliar. I then recognized them to be clips from dreams. Dreams I had had long ago, mostly between the ages of 2 and 5.
