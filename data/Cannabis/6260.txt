At any rate, cannabis has never made me stupid, or slow. Lazy, yes, but I have always been lazy to an extent. I have lost interest in some things, but not school. That may be because I go to school for something I enjoy doing a lot. Smoking does have its bad points, after all, breathing in something thats burning can't be healthy for you. I have problems with depression and anxiety. I know the chemicals in my brain that produce these emotions/feelings can and do interact with the THC and other chemicals in Marijuana as well as other psychoactives.
