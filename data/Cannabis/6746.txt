First it was a subtle feeling of woah where am I, but over a course of about 30 or 40 minutes i started to feel reaaaaaly trippy.  It felt like I was in a room, and the floor was ice, but I didnt feel my body.  My friends head started to glow as he took on a meditative position and he looked like a genuine buddhist monk (even though he is caucasian).  Every once in a while I felt like I was sinking into my body again, and would not be able to concentrate while in my body, so I'd leave again.
