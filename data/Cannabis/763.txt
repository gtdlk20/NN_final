We're driving back when the cookies kick in all of a sudden. There is an intense rush. Tingly numbness and a crawling skin sensation creep over me. A heavy buzz. It feels too intense for me. It'll never ease up that night. My mouth is absolutely parched but my throat doesn't want any fluid to go down, it feels uncomfortable swallowing. I don't always get this unpleasant body load, but this time I do. As we head back, delirium and unreality set in. I'm sure that I'm in a dream. Nothing matters, and anything is possible. I feel exactly as I do in lucid dreams (and it's the first time I become consciously aware of how I feel in lucid dreams - I so rarely remember them). It's an amused apathy in REM relaxation - leisurely surfing the theta waves and being led to meaning by some guiding force.
