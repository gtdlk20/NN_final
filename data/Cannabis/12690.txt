On the whole, this was a very positive experience.  I definitely had a new outlook on marijuana.  Before, I thought it wasnt worth the coughing and didnt see what the big deal was, but now I understood the power of its psychoactivity.  This is why when I went home the next weekend, I was not apprehensive when my friend Dan offered to have me come smoke with him and a few of his friends.  I thought it was a little too soon to smoke again but I hadnt smoked with Dan in about a year.  I met Dan at his house and we waited for some 3 people to come by (all MUCH more experienced smokers).  Somehow I was coerced into sitting bitch.  Im no short guy so it was that much less enjoyable.  They had some shit weed from Detroit and Dan had some hydro that he forgot at his house.  Dan broke up the weed very finely and placed it into a small glass bowl.  We clammed out mikes car to get an enhanced effect.
