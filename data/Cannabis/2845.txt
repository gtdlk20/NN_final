I'll describe my own experiences first. The first time was about the sixth or seventh time I smoked pot... I had smoked a lot more than this previously and not had these effects, but this was the first time I'd smoked after a beautiful Mushroom experience that changed my life (in a very good way... I will never be sad again). I was on an ironic spring break vacation with some college friends in Daytona, a city of pure 'genious.' My friend C and I smoked from a water piece on the balcony. The weed was pretty low quality and tasted like shit. I started gagging from some water droplets that had come through the tube (it was a very cheap plastic affair, this piece). I triggered my gag reflex a little and felt like something came up in my throat, but it stayed down and i felt better. Neither of us felt like finishing the bowl, especially since our friends seemed kind of put off by us smoking pot. We went back in and C joined J and J in some sort of card game.
