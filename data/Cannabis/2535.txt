Suddenly, Burger stopped coughing, sat bolt upright, withdrew his eponymous sandwich from his jacket, and started devouring it. Halfway through the last bite, he looked at the last morsel and started laughing his head off. Ramen, Chips, and I looked at Burger, then at each other, and burst into maniacal laughter as well. We clowned around for a while, making stupid faces at each other and watching Burger become progressively more stoned. At some point, one of us refilled the water jug and we passed it around; Burger held it in his arms and stuck his tongue into the bottle, apparently forgetting how to drink. Chips attempted to tug it from his arms, but Burger drew it closer and muttered, 'My baby!'
