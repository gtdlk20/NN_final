Jess and my twin had left, and Nat started to shift and sway while sitting against the wall.  After a few moments, she leaned against me and said that she was sorry for not kissing me earlier.  We then started making out passionately, and it felt wonderful.  The effects of the weed were at its peak, and every touch felt electric.  I felt like I was soft and floating over the bed, and her kisses were delecious.  I totally forgot that she had been feeling bad.  We started to get into heavy petting and neck biting, and we both ended up with our shirts off.  I stopped to take a breath and asked how she was feeling, and she admitted that she was starting to feel sick to her stomach again.
