I came back to reality and realized that 28 days later, that zombie movie, was on TV.  I felt like my eyes were bouncy balls bouncing around my sockets.  I couldnt move my eyes straight to something, if I tried to move them to the left, they would zigzag up and down until they got there.  I felt hungry all the sudden, I started eating crackers since they were right next to me.  All the sudden I felt almost like an attachment to a cracker and I started licking it uncontrollably.  I licked it and then took a bite, which felt like the ultimate ecstasy.  After that I dont remember much, I think that Phone both came on TV and I began to come down.  I woke up this morning on my couch with the TV still on.  I dont know why this happened but if given the choice I would repeat an experience like it without hesitation.
