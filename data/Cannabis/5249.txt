Time passed and I sat at the table not knowing what was going on.  I knew my mom wanted me home for dinner, and for that reason I was feeling not too good, cause I was way to high to even think of going home.  I tried to communicate this to the others, but I wasn't really able to speak.  Soon they noticed how messed up I was and decided to go into the basement so I could lay on the couch.
