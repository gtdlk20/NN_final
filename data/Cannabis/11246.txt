It was noon in Karauli, India, after a walking of the town, palace and temple, when our guide pointed out the street stall selling bhang.  As a firm believer in the salutary effects of ganja (having been a regular user-smoking- since the late 60's- I'm now 65) and not wanting to miss the opportunity of a cultural experience, I thought it would be worth trying.  After all, ganja is a holy sacrament in the Hindu religion, the favorite food of Shiva, the Lord of Bhang.  Plus, one portion costs only 5 rupees, or a dime (in Varanasi a portion of bhang was only one rupee!).
