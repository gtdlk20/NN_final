8:00 I laid in bed but this time I wasn't sleeping. Or I couldn't tell. My eyes were closed but I thought I was awake, yet I was dreaming. My eyes were closed but I thought I was awake, yet I was dreaming. My boyfriend was sitting on the bed and we were talking. I told him 'I'm sorry, but I don't know you, or I don't remember you, so I can't love you. Don't be sad, I don't dislike you, I just don't love you.' This went on for a while. Periodically I would realize he wasn't there, I wasn't speaking at all, this was all in my head. It scared me a little, but I had an overwhelming sense of calm. I didn't FEEL okay, but I knew that I was. Everything felt dream like. I heard music that I knew wasn't real. Everything seemed very bright, and yet I could hardly see. I laid there crying. Not sobbing, not feeling sad about anything, just tears constantly streaming from my eyes. It seemed to go on and on. We were having deep conversations. I was riding a bicycle. My heart was pounding, I could hear it in my ears. I could feel it in my chest and every so often it felt like it was about to burst out of my chest. Am I having a heart attack? No. Everything was going to be fine. Everything felt very familiar, like I'd been through it before, a long time ago. I already knew the ending. It was reminiscent of an acid trip, yet different.
