As I lay there on the ground, I looked up at Rayanne and Catalano, who were sitting across from each other.  They were suddenly in a diner in one of those predictable, beige romantic comedies starring Kate Hudson or someone, except the camera angle was rather avant-garde, since I was lying on the ground peering upwards (yet, strangely, I also felt like I had sort of an aerial view).  Catalano was the long-haired dude and Rayanne was the edgy chick that works in the library, and they were on a date.  I realized that I had been saying all this out loud when Rayanne said, Uh I dont work in a library..wow this girl must be really high.  But I didnt care.  So here they were in this diner with ketchup and mustard and shit and chatting away.  I got a little frustrated at one point and asked, If Im God, then why is this such a low budget film, huh?  Then I became someone viewing the movie, and Catalano and Rayanne looked through the screen at me.  That was peculiar; since when do people in movies look at the viewer?
