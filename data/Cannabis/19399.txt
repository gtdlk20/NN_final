So we headed toward another friends house that lives close to me.  His name was also Justin.  We relaxed there and I had some things to eat such as chips and ice cream. The second Justin looked a lot like Jim Morrison, especially with the hair and I kept thinking it was actually Jim and flipping out.  I could feel Mary Jane clutching at my brain, and it felt as though the weed lifted a blanket off my brain and I had so much more space for all my thoughts to go to now.... if that makes any sense.
