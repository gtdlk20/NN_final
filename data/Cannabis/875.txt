Music is my favourite art form while affected by cannabis. It's not hard to follow while high like cinema is... and its conveniant, and I suppose most importantly being high is like another option on the equaliser. In that listening to something while being high is completely different while sober (it can be better or worse), if there was a setting on the old EQ for emotional impact well you're just turning that right up to 11 and opening the flood gates. Ideas pour in and the music hits harder, we all know that already though right? If it's an album as remarkably well constructed as say 'Abbey Road' is then I think there will be a more pronounced sense of meaning to your trip.
