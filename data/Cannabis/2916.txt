Note: After last night I realize that I have an extremely low tolerance for THC. I have had trips like this before, but with this one I was in a fairly relaxed state, so I was able to try to remember some of it. There were hundreds pictures and philosophical discoveries that I am not able to remember. This is a little hard to believe I know, because all I did was take a few bong hits, however, a friend once told me that coughing can give you a better high, and now I think I believe it. I'm definitely not going to try any other drugs...if this is what pot does to me, I don't want to know what acid would do. : )
