Eventually the smoking started in Dannys backgarden. We took it kinda easy to start with rolling big joints with about 10 minute gaps inbetween rolling again. We was all having a good time laughing, joking and telling stories. The time was about 8pm and after the 5th joint I felt a bit giddy but it felt like my laughter was fake and I slowly fell into depression. Ive experienced and know others have experienced feeling down from smoking cannabis before but this time it was more of a strong feeling.
