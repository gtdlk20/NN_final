He was packing a very nice glass blown pipe, a lighter and a very nice bag of weed that garnished ooo's and ahhh's from everyone in the car. After a couple hellos and the packing of a bowl, we began to smoke again. This time it hit me like a ton of bricks. All of a sudden I felt pressure behind my eyes and the world began to flash and swirl. Everything was flashing black and white, but at the same time everything was swirling like lava with crazy psychedelic colors. We kept driving, I got a couple more hits from this very nice little pipe. By this time I couldn't move very coherently, nor talk or understand what anyone was saying.
