The setting was magnificent  A bright blue sky, with huge stands in the background which we imagined were full of cheering ecstatic fans, waving us on.  The horizon appeared to flat as if we were in a giant box, and it was painted on the side of this box.  If anyone has seen the 'Truman Show', the part where he is in the boat near the end and reaches the door in the wall which has the painted horizon on it; you'll know what I mean!
