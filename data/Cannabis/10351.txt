I remember my last hit, cuz it HURT.  I sucked in sooo much smoke. I started to cough really bad for about 10 minutes straight.  The worst part was, this is the point where my high started kicking in.  So everything was slow.  Every time I coughed. The pain was four times as long and noticably detailed.  It felt like someone was brushing my esophagus with a toothbrush made of knifes. I needed water quick!
