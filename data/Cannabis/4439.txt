So we began. Normally traveling this gas-line would take maybe 10min. To me and N, it felt like it took over a half hour literally. The time distortion was amazing yet it frightened me. I thought about going up to one of the nearby houses along the side of the gas-line and asking for a phone to tell my parents help, me and my friends are stoned out of our minds and dont know where we are. Luckily I didnt. One lesson learned: no matter how out of it you are, try to keep your cool, or, in Dave Chappelles words, keep it real.
