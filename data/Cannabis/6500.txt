My friend rises up and sits back down rather quickly...'what the fuck is going on?', I answered with a shrug thinking my little bug out would end soon.  I then started to feel the cold air entering my lungs and hot air rushing out, I sat there noticing the rapid heartbeat which made me more uneasy, my friend was having the same experience, gripping his seat he said 'I have to leave now'.  I looked at R and noticed that his NIN emblem just floated off his shirt...I grabbed P and we went upstairs, this girl had mirrors all over the fucking place, I didnt think we'd make it out.
