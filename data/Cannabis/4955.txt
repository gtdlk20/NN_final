I was able to legally purchase the 30mg pills, which come 12-to-a-bottle at the end of a long work week and am ready to hopefully get to experience being stoned on this new edible.  I opened the childsafe bottle, took one pill out and downed with with a little diet dr.pepper on a stomach that last had a meal in it 6-hours ago.  I have read the stories of people eating edibles and getting frustrated with the effects not starting after 30-minutes and then eating another dose only to have the first dose hit a few minutes later and then find it's too strong.  I started the stopwatch immediately after downing the edible pill.
