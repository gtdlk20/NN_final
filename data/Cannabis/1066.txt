All in all, this trip was extremely worthwhile.  Thats a complete understatement: its the first time Ive felt truly, fully alive, although I sometimes have a bad inkling in the back of my head that I just use marijuana to *trick* my mind and I wonder does that matter?  What is tricking; and is that sort of subjective experience any less real than generally accepted reality?  Alas, I am getting a bit ahead of myself.  At first, I was caught up in panic, but I attribute that to my confusion.  I plan on continuing recreational drug use and branching out to other psychedelic substances that will unlock other barriers to the dusty corners of my mind.
