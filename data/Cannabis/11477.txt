I looked over and saw my friend hyperventilating next to me.  I asked her to please calm down, feeling as though I was on the verge of freaking out myself.  As we walked out of the bathroom, I heard my friend say to me 'I feel as if I'm in a dream, and my alarm clock is about to go off any second.'
