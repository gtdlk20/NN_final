I finally did something I'd wondered about for years.  For quite a while I'd been a fan of the wake and bake, loving to lay snug in bed on a saturday morning and wrap myself in the comfort of a nice buzz.  Being sooo lazy, I would sometimes be annoyed that I would have to simply move my body from whatever perfect position my unconscious mind had established and expose myself to what on some days was the cold air in my room in order to light up, and of course not fall back to sleep with some burning object in my bed!
