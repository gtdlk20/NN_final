In the past I thought only deviants and outcasts do those things. Back in high school for example, cannabis smokers were those who had some delinquent behavior as well. Or at least those were the ones I could easily recognize. However I have read much about psychoactive substances from then, and I realized that they arenÂ’t the universal evil we are told it is. There are plenty of user types and reasons for use. I read something about datura and its effects in the past, and from then onwards I was searching and reading about psychedelics and other psychoactives and became more open to the idea of psychoactive use and stopped regarding all drugs as evil. I have also cultivated a lot of psychedelic plants, but I have never used them.
