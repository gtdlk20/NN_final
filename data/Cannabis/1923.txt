I obtained the magic mushrooms while doing fieldwork in the Transkei in South Africa. There they grow fresh in the coastal jungle, beautiful white shrooms with golden caps and just a hint of blue. One shrooms was over 25 cm in length Â– the cap was the size of my fist! I would dry them by laying them out on newspaper on the lawn, and the warm sea breeze dried them beautifully in about 2 hours.
