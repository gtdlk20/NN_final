Suddenly, the song changes. It's like all your sins have culminated, and 'God' realizes it, and starts you on your way to hell. The music gets creepy, and the birds die out slowly.  It felt like I was falling. I literally felt something pulling me downward.  Jim starts singing, only it's more like yelling. He is now more of a satan character.  The images in your head go from being white and gold, to red and black. The force that pulls you is so intense, it is the most amazing experience.
