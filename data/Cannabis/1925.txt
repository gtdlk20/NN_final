I decided to trip at home and to trip alone, which I love doing  it adds a whole other dimension to the trip. Because I was an experienced tripper I felt comfortable that I knew my limits and would be able to cope with whatever came my way. There was no chance of being interrupted, or having to interact with other non-tripping people, which I often find humorously impossible :) Once I had ground up the shrooms, I was left with a rather large dark powdery pile, enough to fill up a large cereal bowl. Im unsure of the exact quantity, but Id guess there was about 20 grams there. Normally for a strong trip Id take 5 or 6 grams, but this time around I decided to throw caution to the wind. This is not recommended except for the most experienced of trippers! And even then. WOW
