At one moment I was filling up my glass with water, at the next I was walking down the stairs and sat down in my chair. When I sat down I began to drink my water. Right after I started, my friends were laughing at me, I didnÂ’t know why and was tripping out to hard at them laughing to ask why they were laughing.
