After a while I again got a slight feeling that things are alive, have more depth and try to communicate with me, and also random words came to my mind. After 10 minutes, any effect had gone away. So I got quite disappointed and lit another joint at 11:12. The end of the joint disintegrated, but I still was able to take four good hits. This probably was from the potent ones with the bud material, because I started feeling more of the effects soon. At 11:17 words started again popping randomly in my mind, and also synonyms and similar-sounding words were coming up easily. For example I was thinking trunk and immediately after thought punk. Immediately after that I ran to the couch to relax and feel the effects. I forgot to say that the smoking took place at a room over my home, which is a part of it and stands atop the apartment complex. The room was dark at the time. The couch started feeling quite warm and inviting, and the blue cover over the couch was like a warm, purple blanket. I was curled like a ball on my right side and I started feeling my legs heavy.
