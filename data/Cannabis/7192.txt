Periodically riverboats passed lit for the night now, and Farmer seemed to lose his mind whenever one passed us.  He would leap out of his chair and run to the bank, once screaming at the Queen of Iowa.  Hey!  Can you hear me?!  He loved the moon, the riverboats, the sacred circle he believed we sat in, and the people who lived here before us.  Farmer would prove out to be a kind of mad mentor to us, a friend and gentle conspirator.  He was Wendell Berrys Mad Farmer  with a shamans rattle.  Thanks Farmer, for everything.
