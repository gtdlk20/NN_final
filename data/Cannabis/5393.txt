This continued for another couple minutes. I really was just freaking out about this, I just wanted it to stop. Then I got the buzz. Not like a cigarette buzz, but a really (now I love this but not then) strong sensation all over my body. It kind of makes me feel quivery, like my muscles are lightly tickled, it's great. But then I hated it. I got out of the car and walked around to meet my two friends who were blazing. I started to talk, and again, as I talk I kind of feel everything slip away for a second, and then I realize it just felt like I was doing whatever it was for HOURS. In one second. Then for a minute I feel normal. It kind of surged in and out. Then as it started to sink in and I felt more accustomed to it, I was in the backseat (we were cruising around now, it's nighttime) I'm just feeling myself, rubbing my hands all over my body kind of tranced out... it did feel different. I had no clue where we were going. It felt like no one was listening to me. People tried to tell me fake shit; I knew right from wrong, but I played along mischievously. I still wasnÂ’t really enjoying it.
