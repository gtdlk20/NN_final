I didn't know that weed could free your mind this way, and enable your brain to work completely. I've been in deep thought since this trip - next time, I will take a piece of paper and write all the things I feel and see. Drugs that affect consciousness are very appealing to me. They make me realize how much more there is out there, how many ways there are to see the world and use your mind.
