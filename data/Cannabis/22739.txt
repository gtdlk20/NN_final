At this point, mostly everything goes blank.  I remember a number of things, though, that happened throughout the next thirty or so minutes.  I talked a lot.  I laid down in the snow and slammed my head against the ice of a lake (we had been on the bank, and I walked a few feet onto the ice).  There was a lot of snow on it, but I managed to bang through it.  I think I was trying to make snow angels, but Im not sure.  Whatever the case, I didnt feel any pain.  In fact, it was quite fun.  Meanwhile, my friend was riding the toboggan down the hill.  I was shouting at him the whole time, saying really nothing.  I think I had my eyes closed, because I was very warm and I felt like I was sleeping.  At one point, he walked towards me and I jumped up.  His jacket had been rustling and I thought he was my puppy, who tends to rustle as he runs towards you to lick you.  Whatever the case, I explained this to my friend in a very loud voice, so that he would understand.
