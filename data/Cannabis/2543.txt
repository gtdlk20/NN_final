The air was filled with smoke and the beautiful fragrence of marijuana was in the air. I felt so good, to my suprise there were 6 people there that I didn't even know had entered the house. I knew only 2 of them I was a little tense being around people that I don't know. This cleared after I helped finish off a third bowl. I was in a state of complete euphoria. My body was numb and I was without a care. Thoughts raced through my mind, about everything that I thought was good in the world. I felt completely blessed. It was amazing. I was a little hesitant about smoking anymore, considering this was some really really potent stuff, considering I was wasted on 3 bowls.
