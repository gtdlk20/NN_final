I didnt really know anyone at the party and being of the introverted type; I just sat in my chair and listened on. A few people asked me if I was feeling anything yet, and I replied I didnt notice a difference. Soon after that though I did, things just seemed off. I completely lost the will to talk. I replied to everyones sentences in my head. Thats when it got weird. I started to feel lingering physical sensations. If I were to poke part of my arm, I would feel like it would pulse where I pushed it several times. I was also had a hat on, which I could feel pulsing at a regular rate with all the other sensations I had. This kept intensifying.
