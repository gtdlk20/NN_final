Suddenly the word newt became just as aggravating as being tickled and I begged him to take it back. Every time he said it or I said it the word only proved to send me back into a tickled frenzy. My laughter started to turn to full-out crying as I begged him to take it back but as soon as he hugged me and said hed take it back I just went right back into fits of giggles.
