I drove my car home subconciously as I wasn't aware of anything but the road directly in front of me. Successfully dropped off the girls and headed home. I started to come down T+4:00 after the experience and was finally able to attain a deep sleep. The experience, although a bit nauseating at times, was amazing and enlightening. I will savor the remaining buds and hope to share this experience and pass on my story to others. I strongly suggest marijauna for everyone that hasnt done it yet, as it is a wonderful substance and has changed my life for the better.
