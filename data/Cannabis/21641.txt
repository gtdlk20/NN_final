I had started using weed as a coping method for school, and holy shit did I do a lot of it at school! I went to school baked every day for multiple years without exception, and I keep that record even today. At this point, I noticed a few things changed in my life significantly. Puberty is the only thing that compares to how many changes I went through at this stage of my life, only puberty was far more mild and these changes occurred literally overnight. I suddenly realized that I liked music, something that I absolutely hated earlier on in life, and I also noticed that I began to form genuine opinions of things rather than my mind being comprised of mathematics and fucked up algorithms without any real feelings towards anything. I had noticed that I felt genuine emotions and I learned to appreciate the little things in life. Instead of being constantly depressed, I was amused with my life and I was genuinely happy. I had never experienced true happiness before this point. It was truly a miracle.
