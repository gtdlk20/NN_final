I had only slept for 3 hours the previous night which is obviously a big mistake.  I had trouble keeping my eyes open and I was a bit scared because one of my friends who is quite a sober person ate a few pieces of cake filled with 72 grams of weed and he was hospitalized after he fainted, haha. I obviously didn't want to faint and be hospitalized which kept me at bay. So I went home and lied down on the bed.
