The first time I smoked was when I brought home a little souvenir from a coffeeshop (Im from Amsterdam). I had my expectations, which made me very nervous. I only took about four tokes because I didnt like how it tasted. My heart was beating really fast, my mouth got really dry, I got really cold and my body was shaking. But I didnt feel like I was high.
