I started to become more lucid in the evening although I was far from crisp. I hung out with J. in her office for a while (she tried her hand at Tetripz). Two things of note here: One  television seemed not a surreal babbling idiot box but a gateway to sanity (with commercials that were just as annoying as when Im sober). Two  I noticed that even though somewhat sedated, feelings of depression, frustration, and jealousy would break through if provoked.
