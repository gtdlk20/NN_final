About me: I am 22 years of age, consumed till now cannabis (monthly), DXM (thrice), tobacco (a pack / two days), alcohol (occasionally  but on these occasions 500ml+). No medical history whatsoever. Psychology and arts student. Reports of pure cannabis use, show up in the Erowid archives  but I didnt read any that describe the profundity of my experience.
