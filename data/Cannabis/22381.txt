I started thinking about actions such as these too much and it started to frighten me.  Subconsiously my tounge wouldn't sit still, like it was trying to confuze me and bring my attention back to what i didn't want to think about.  Kinda scary at the time...  -  I then started concetrating more on chatting with my friend online.  He was aware that i was stoned, but i hadn't explained to him yet that I had ingested kine for the first time.
