What happened to me that night I am still not sure of. I have smoked much more weed than one blunt at one time and never had I had anything remotely simmilar happen to me other than just the normal 'high' feeling. I know for a fact that the blunt we smoked wasn't laced with anything at all. The only thing that I can figure is that my body was just completly exhausted due to me not eating anything all day and then going and putting weed smoke in my lungs was all that it could take. It was a very scary experiance but I learned a good lesson from it and I continue to smoke weed everyday with much enjoyment and not with one bad experiance say for this one.
