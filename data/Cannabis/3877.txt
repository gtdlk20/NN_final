I heard the Daily Show on Comedy Central come on so I sat up in my bed and started watching the TV.  Then suddenly something came over me.  The only way that I can explain this is that it felt like the top half of my vision was being blurred over my head (like my eyes were outside of my head and looking upwards, and the bottom half of my vision was trailing off to the lower-right.  It was by no means 'Scary' but it was annoying me because I couldn't see the TV.  After about 20 minutes of this going on (even while laying on my back staring at the ceiling) I eventually fell asleep and awoke the next day being somewhat groggy but happy with what I had experienced that night.  It was like a low-dose LSD or DXM trip without the sickness or the paranoia.
