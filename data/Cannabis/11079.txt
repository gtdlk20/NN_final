As we drove down the hill back into the city, I could see my boyfriend from the corner of my eye. But it wasn't him. What I saw kind of disturbed me in a way. It was him driving, but as a cartoon or something pretty close. I didn't want to look at him directly so I kept looking from the corner of my eye. This cartoon like hallucination tripped me out like crazy.
