It was a late summer day, and the sun was still in the sky. We (Me [male], S [female] and K [male]) had planned on going on a walk through the woods. We live in northwestern Nevada, so the woods were probably more like a treesy mountain range, rather than a dense and wet Oregon-style forest. I love trees and the outdoors. K grew up there, and S was going to move out there soon, so a walk through the woods sounded great. Me and K drove up there at about 6:30 PM, and S was supposed to meet us there within 10 minutes.
