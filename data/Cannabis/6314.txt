One day, me and three friends decided to share just one gram of weed between three of us (one friend didnt feel like it, and he would become useful later). We made no preparations and out decision was totally spontaneous. We went out behind the garage of a car repair shop and used a bottle to smoke out of. It was a dark night in early december, and it was freezing out. After about two hits, I felt a buzz coming on. On my third or fourth hit, I was feeling the weed very strongly. This high was different from my usual ones. Instead of being hyper and apparently hilarious to all non-high people around me, I felt mellow and peaceful. At this point I usually would've stopped and enjoyed what I had already, but there was so much more left. We went through about two more bowls before we decided to stop (I have no idea how a single gram lasted that long) but there was still more left after we were done.
