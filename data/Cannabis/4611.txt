I wasnt sure exacty what to feel or what was going on.It was so dark and smokey and just uncomfotable at this point as we all exited the shed. As I exited I took one big breath of cool fresh air and opened my eyes.I was immediatley aware of the change. When I would move my hands, arms or legs I would subcontiously know I was doing it but I couldnt feel myself doing it and every noise or sound would be surrounding me but very dul and smooth(if i can describe it).It was just kind of a numb and quiet word. This at the time was very new to me so it scared me. I remember that every time someone would talk to me I woud hear it but it wouldnt process in my brain for a couple seconds and my vision. Everything so different. I cant emphasize enough how much different and confused I was from the time I entered the shed to when I got out. When I would turn my head and eyes the view I was seeing would have to catch up to where my eyes went. Sort of delayed frames. I also found that I would continuously get lost in the most random thoughts I had ever thought of. Thoughts that I never would have thought of in a sober mind. Some very creative, some scary, some had nothing to do with life at all. It was just thoughts about random objects that would kind of morph into the next thing my mind would come to think about. The whole time for some reason I was very paranoid that we would eventually get caught and I woud get hella busted. I dont know why but I remember that constant paranoid thinking I had.
