It was 5/21/08 and my friend S and I had the intention to hang out at her cousin H's house and possibly smoke weed and we had discussed this at school and planned it all out. As soon as it was time to go at 3:00 PM, I met her outside the classroom and we walked off to her car and left for a place to get a bite to eat and then to my place to get some shit if I had any left. We got to my house and I found that there was only a tiny roach left, so I took that, a pair of tweezers, and a lighter. Now, this was some good shit I had thought, so I didn't want to waste any. We got in the car after saying bye to my parents, and we left to go to her cousin H's house. Little did I know what was in store for me.
