T+2:00 At this point I began to come down from the height of the high. I realized that I had plugged my clock in when I came into the room (when it is unplugged it resets to midnight), so the time showing on the face was the precise time since I had laid down, about two hours (it had felt like 5-6 hours). I found I was still very stoned, but I tried to turn on the TV to get back to reality.
