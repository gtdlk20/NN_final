When we were finished I hadn't even remembered smoking in the first place. I tried to walk and I felt like I was a dinosaur for some reason. I looked out into his back yard and it looked and felt like heaven. I felt so peaceful and calm. I felt so peaceful and calm. This was probably 20 mins after I first smoked. I heard this buzzing sound and it was so nice and harmonic.
