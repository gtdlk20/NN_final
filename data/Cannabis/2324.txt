This experience with Cannabis was exhilarating. I felt relaxed and hungry, I lost my headache, and everything I saw or did was new, significant, and strong. I slept well and was happy the next morning. I intend to smoke weed again, but not to make a habit or routine of it. Something this good shouldnÂ’t be dulled by frequent use.
