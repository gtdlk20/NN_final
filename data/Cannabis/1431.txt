9:45pm: My friend arrives and must have been pretty freaked out because she asked me if I wanted to go to the hospital. I was still swaying and shaking, and talking about my new revelation about reality. I asked her to take me to the hospital. However, she was afraid to take me there because of the consequences she thought I could face including loosing my college scholarship. For some reason, because of the social signals I felt she was sending me, I didnt trust her. I thought she was lying to me and was in fact planning to take me to the hospital and that Id probably live there for the rest of my life. She was asking me questions like what day is it and who is the president, surprisingly, all of which I could answer. When she asked these questions I suspected that she was assessing my mental state and or the urgency of taking me to the hospital. Then I looked out the car window and saw that we were circling around the hospital, driving around the block over and over again, (which we werent). Suddenly we arrived at her house, on the other side of town. I now conclude that I was experiencing some kind of paranoid delusion when I thought we were driving around the hospital.
