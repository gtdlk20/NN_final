We were flipping through tv channels, and too me it seemed like the channels were parallel dimensions, on one channel there was a cowboy, he lived on cowboy world, on another there was a cartoon. We watched that after 10 min of that, I got so developed in the story that I started crying when the main character lost his pencil, I stood up and ran to my friends room, flew to his bed, because by this time I had flying powers but didnÂ’t feel like using them much.
