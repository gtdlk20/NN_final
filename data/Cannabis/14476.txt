In his kitchen, we found two cartons of mocha ice-cream, which we polished off in a matter of minutes, the flavors being more intense than imaginable, as though our tongues were now holding a small world of impossible reality and depth.  We made our way to his room and watched TV. I began drawing and soon had come up with some very interesting sketches, most of them, although drawn with a blue pen, appeared to be sketched with black charcoal.  My trip was in full effect, for some reason which to this day I am still unsure of. I decided that black and white were the precursor to reality.  The lines that defined good and evil, truth or lie. I began to question the world around us and the false charade that had become of it.  Everything to me was a media and I used every medium near me to explain this. On the sketch I wrote 'Novus Ordo Seclorum,' a phrase used on the back of the one dollar bill, signifying revolution and the dawn of a new day.
