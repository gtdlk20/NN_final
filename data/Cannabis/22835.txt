The day before spring break, a friend and I decided to have a little smoke session over at my apartment. We hadn't smoked in over 24 hours, and no other drugs had been taken. Being a novice smoker at the time, my friend offered to introduce me to the gravity bong. There are several different ways to make a gravity bong, but we chose to use a 2-liter soda bottle with the bottom 1/4 cut off.
