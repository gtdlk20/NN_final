I want to share this experience for two reasons.  I think it can be valuable as a description of my success with a simple recipe for marijuana brownies as well as an account of my own experience.   IÂ’ve written the preparation first and described my encounter afterwards.  For reference, at the time of this experience I am 17 years old with drug history of mainly cannabis and alcohol with some pharmaceutical use and a single mushroom trip.
