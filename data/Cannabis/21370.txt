Then about 30 minutes into it I felt drenched, I thought someone poured water on me but I wasnt sweating or anything. Then I sit up straighter and realized that everything looked so weird, I felt like we were in some sort of production like a music video. Then I got scared that everyone was judging me and thought I was the only fucked up one, I kept asking if anyone else hit the bong. I no longer felt in place, I felt outcasted and started to worry about every little move I made, I didnt want to look stupid. Then all of the sudden I just decided that I needed to cheer myself up so I said 'guys we have to think positively you shouldnt care what people think about you' apparently it was a really random statement because everybody got a real laugh but it really helped my trip get better.
