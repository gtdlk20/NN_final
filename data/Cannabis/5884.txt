Riding in the back, it felt like a roller coaster. My stomach turned. I was honestly scared. So scared in fact that not only we were going to crash but that I was going to die anyways. I kept checking my heart rate, seemed normal to myself anyways. I forgot where we were going and where we were two seconds after we turned onto any given street. We were going to my friend 'Ian's'. When we got there all I did was sit on the swinging bench staring off. I think there were five people packed on it. My original friend I was with went to smoke more. Soon I considerably started feeling good. The 'dissociation-fuckedupness-trippy' part was at least gone. And yes I am serious about that dissociation part, I was in my own world for the first hour, thinking about how my heart was going to explode.
