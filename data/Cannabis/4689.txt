T-2.5 hrs, By some strange anomaly of space-time, we ended up in the cafeteria at what I can only assume was around 3:30. It was darkish in there, but I didn't mind, I was just chillin' on the table, minding my own business. My friends were talking about something, but sitting on the table I was just so gosh darn comfortable and so deeply occupide by my ruminations on the intacacies of life that I slowly drifted off to sleep. I fell asleep. I did. Right there on the tables in the school cafeteria after school had ended. I fell the fuck asleep. Shit. Clearly I was still way too high. I began to feel like I was drunk, almost, like I was falling slowly backwards through sand. I was dizzy, and felt a little weird in my belly. I jumped up (mistake), got SUPER lightheaded and shouted GUYS! I'm tooooo high! and they just stared at me and said Yes you are, you are so pale! and I said I know! I gotta go to the baffroom, aight they just laughed, and I sprinted over to an inconspicuous hidden bathroom to chill out.
