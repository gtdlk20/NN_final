I've been a moderate to heavy cheeva-choker for the past several months, and I seem to be more succeptible to the wonder weed's psychedelic effects than the average person. (If anything, my sensitivity to pot has increased since I began using it.) I often have hallucinations of a sort- although the visual 'hallucinations' are more like daydreams of such extreme potency that i actually see them overlaying reality. Yesterday, though, I had an experience which blew all previous highs away- and without a particularly large amount.
