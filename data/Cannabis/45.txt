Tom explained the situation in a unique and helpful way, the next time I saw him.  He said that when I freaked out, I basically fell over a cliffs edge.  The next time I smoke, Ill probably take a tumble down the cliff face again, but Ill find a branch and climb back up - if Im afraid itll happen, it probably will - but my experience tells me it doesnt matter if it does.  Then, the next time, Ill walk along, see the cliff and run away.  A few months down the line, Ill be dancing on the edge, possibly bungee jumping off it.  And in a few years I wont even see it as an issue.  Itll be just something that happened a long time ago.  I like that metaphor.  It makes a lot of sense.
