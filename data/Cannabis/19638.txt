Then I felt this sensation around my chest, I can't say it was a burning sensation. I don't know but in my mind it felt like something bright inside my chest in my mind it felt like something bright inside my chest. Then I felt like I floating above my body. Separated from my body. At that very point, it felt great. I never knew I could hallucinate like this on hashish. Though I have never done Heroin, Acid etc. I do remember telling myself during the trip 'Fuck I'm floating, really!' I was back and running after 30 mins then, though I felt pretty lazy through out the day.
