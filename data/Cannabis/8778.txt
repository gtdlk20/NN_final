Then something strange happened. Something I have never tried with cannabis before. I got sort of a hallucination! As I was standing on the dancefloor (unable to really move my body to the music by the way), the volume of the sound seemed like it got turned down, and I could only hear the bass sound, like a heartbeat. And the colors from the dancefloor light became very sharp, almost blinding me. Then my point of view got elevated to the celling, and as it did, I saw that all the people looked like flat cardboard people. Like sprites, in two dimensions, in a three dimensional room.
