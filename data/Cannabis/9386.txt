They rolled a fat blunt out of about a 30 of weed. We started passing it around the 4 of us and I was taking really big, monster hits. I wanted to get as much out of it as I could. I had about 10-15 big hits off of it, and a few shoties. It probably wasn't the greatest idea. I'm a tiny person. I'm only 5'2 and dont even make the 100 pound mark. But by then, I was too high to think about it too much.
