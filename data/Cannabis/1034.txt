I sat down at a table and put my earphones in. I turned on an Explosions in the Sky song, 'The Only Moment We Were Alone', and delved in. Before longer I had become truly immersed. My eyes were closed, and I could clearly see each note and beat in the song in a pattern that ran across my vision. My body high was so intense, and I began to feel so 'fuzzy' that I truly lost touch with all sense of touch. I had the overwhelming feeling of being lifted, and the visual song I was seeing began to take the form of a staircase behind my eyelids. Now, keep in mind, the patterns I was seeing were not detailed, realistic patterns, but only vague close d-eye images that I more knew the identity of than actually saw. As the song built up to the climax, the stairway moved faster and faster until at the climactic end, I felt an overwhelming sense of being thrust upward, and my visual conscience was blinding image of white. As the song ended and went to the next track, a very mellow, reverberating tune, I felt as if I was floating in a gravity-less void. Suddenly, I knew I was having what some may call an 'out of body' experience. Even more surprising, I felt a deeply spiritual connection with myself and my surroundings. I started hearing and seeing words in my head. They said 'Everyone and everything needs God.' 'God must come from you.' 'God is you.' 'God is all.' etc, etc. I was overcome with euphoria, and in my trance-like introspective environment, I felt like shouting and crying.
