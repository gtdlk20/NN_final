When I realized that these were the effects of weed, I started laughing. I laughed also when I unsuccessfully tried to get up many times and was falling back again, and laughed just because I was laughing about these things. I was happy. I was elated. I hadnt any negative thought or emotion. I slowly got up, and I was somewhat dizzy. I turned on the light, and thought that the effects were gone, but when I got outside towards the door that lead to my home, I realized how high I was. It felt like the whole world was substituted with an exact duplicate, in which things werent so normal. It felt like the whole world was substituted with an exact duplicate, in which things werent so normal. Returning back to the room, I stumbled on some abnormalities on the floor and thought I was falling. I knelt down and waited, believing I would faint and injure myself. I was also thinking that I would die or that the effects would remain forever, but thinking about how so many people have used it without problems and that no one died from weed, I burst out laughing for my silly fear. I was laughing with everything and so I wanted to hear similar things, namely, that high-pitched cartoon voices that talk and laugh super-fast. I took my smartphone and typed little happy voices in Youtube, and found voices of children. Of course I meant cartoons, but the algorithm of course couldnt read my mind. I again realized how high I was and started laughing.
