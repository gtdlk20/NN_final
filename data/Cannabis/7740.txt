I passed the bong and gazed at the curling smoke,  I looked beyond it, to a world where everything was made of the smoke and I was part of it, I was floating with it, and then he passed it to me again.  This went on for what seemed like all night but in reality was only about an hour and a half.   When he was fresh out of bud, I do not know, I just know that eventually the bong stopped coming to me and I fell into this amazing trance where it seemed as though the music was a part of me and it was swirling around me and I could have never felt better in my whole life.  From there the effects gradually decreased, my rollercoaster stopped and I eventually returned to my normal state of consciousness.  To this day I doubt I've ever reached a high so full as that, and I can hardly wait till the day it is upon me again.
