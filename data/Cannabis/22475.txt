One day me and two of my friends went into a nature center to smoke this new weed that one of the friends just got. This was the best stuff I had ever smoked! After only three hits, I went insane. At first I started laughing uncontrollably, which always happens. Then as we were walking through the paths, my vision started to blink vertically instead of the normal horizontal (when blinking). All the colors everywhere became very amazing and bright, but that was nothing. Now about five minutes have passed with straight laughter, and then I noticed that it sounded as if all sound was coming directly to my ears, and not traveling through the air. this was an amazing sensation to me.
