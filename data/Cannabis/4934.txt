I first tried cannabis when I was 13, the date posted, and became extremely stoned, with a friend, at the beach on a nice day. I liked this a lot. My experience was probably very similar to that of many who have tried good cannabis, and in that regard was nothing unique, until the time came that I could not put off urinating any more. I had, up to that time during the experience, registered an increasing bladder pressure periodically, but became distracted by surrounding, conversation (such as it was), much laughter etc, repeatedly so.
