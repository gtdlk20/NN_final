This time, it was a cop car; and life immediately turned into a game. In fact, life was the most fun 'game' I've ever played. It was awesome. I was the hero, and I had to avoid the cars, while interacting with everything. It was at that point that I realized that pretty much the whole walk home, I'd been seeing myself from behind, as if I was an invisible camera, following myself.
