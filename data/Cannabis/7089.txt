It was a fairly cold February day in the city of York, England.  Three male friends; B, L and R and I  had the week off from school as it was the half-term break, and decided to consume a tenth of cannabis each. B and I had usually smoked it, and had ingested cannabis before; R had ingested cannabis before and L had little experience of the drug. We had all eaten a meal before hand. None of us were on any medication of any sort at the time.
