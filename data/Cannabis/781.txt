First trip: 12:30 AM. I'm out on the porch when I realize I can see the visions I've gotten on previous trips if I shut my eyes. They're just like before, with similar motifs, but expanded into new realms. The textures, designs, and patterns are all familiar but there's so much more now. Last time it was rhombuses and a kinetic motif resembling a backwards 4. This time it's a W of detail, a letter that is the matrix for the intricate visuals that flash by in a rapidly-morphing cycle. One second it's a giant ski hill with trees outlining the lines of the W and a snowy path forming the alphabetic motif in negative space - now it's a row of bent urinals still conforming to the W shape, a colorful psychedelic alien plumbing system with flowing florescent waste fluids - now it's a neon escalator, Egyptian hieroglyphics with a desert backdrop, stone sculptures amid a city skyline, flowers, plants, forests, and on and on. The weirdest sights I've ever seen are flashing by in a never-ending stream.
