Considering my weight and my body fat composition (I'm 5'0) I was terrified I would never be able to pass a piss test.  When the job I was interviewing for told me they were going to test, I almost walked out, but I needed the job really bad.  I had planned to use substitution, but when my donor backed out on me I had to think of something quick -- test had to be that day.
