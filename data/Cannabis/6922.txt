I did remember to mark the time down, as I was informed it alters your time perception, and it had seemed like at least an hour before my sister called me over to the computer to fix something five minutes after I went into bed. Using the computer like this was quite an experience. I knew everything I had to do to fix this specific problem, but each time I went on to the step, I forgot that I had done it, and wound up repeating it several times. My typing speed was also greatly inhibited. Normally, I can do about 110 WPM, but on this high I must've only been averaging around 10. My sister eventually just told me to go back to sleep.
