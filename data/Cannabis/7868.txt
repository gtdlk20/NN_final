The neighbors had been playing basketball and since we had all the windows and doors closed you could barely even make out the sound of the dribbling ball. And this i find VERY interesting: My mind actually intensified the distant sound as though it was in my head! I began to feel as though i WAS the basketball. My mind's eye had completely taken over to the point that my conciousness seemed either to BE the basketball, or perhaps my subjective take on what it would be like to be the basketball converted to reality by means of personal expirience. At any rate, Evertime the ball hit the ground it was a painfull experience. I found this quite amusing.
