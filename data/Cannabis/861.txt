I had listened to the first few tracks of 'Abbey Road' the other day, an album I had not fully explored yet, and decided to continue where I left off, having just finished 'Oh! Darling'. The opening guitar riff gave me great pleasure and I proceeded to sit there quite content listening to my music and smoking my cannabis. The lyrics bore a great resemblance to my current situation, a state of bliss and comfort in the shade being described... yup I'm there.
