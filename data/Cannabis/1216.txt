This is my third time burning, and we're in Benny's car, waiting for Nick and Sam to arrive with the weed. When they finally arrive, John scoots next to me in the middle to make room for Nick. He passes the bag to John and tells him to start grinding. The smell is pungent in the air and I drink it in--the way it mixes with John's cologne brings back good times. It's always grossed me out a little how he eats the leftover bits raw. He sprinkles the grounds into the paper Nick holds, and all of us rag him for spilling. It's nearly midnight and Benny turns off the car light and turns on his iPod to watch a movie. Nick holds up two joints for all to see, lights up and passes one on to John, and then to me--it doesn't burn it's way down my throat last time, but maybe that's because of all the cigs.
