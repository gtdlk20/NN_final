Eventually, I came down all the way and passed out. A lot of what I did other than that is a blur. The experience was very intense. I have had 2 panic attacks before, the first being very bad, leaving me unable to smoke for months. As well in a constant state of depression and anxiety for several months. Thankfully, most of the anxiety has gone away. The second I managed to almost stop before it happened, leaving me with the weak after effects for a couple days. I'm not sure if what I experienced was a panic attack, anxiety attack or what. I smoked once today at lunch, I took 4 hits from a joint and I barely got high but at least I didn't have any problems. I think the experience as a whole was a good one, even though while I was going though it it was very intense an almost scary. Had I not been though something similar before, I would have really had a hard time.
