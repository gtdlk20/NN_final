Those who have used psychedelics or cannabis before would likely label this a bad trip. I decided to lie in bed, as I was paranoid that I might do something strange or my neighbour would notice something. As I lay in bed, I frequently got up to go and urinate  whether this was a nervous reaction or I was very hydrated Im not sure. After a while, I felt an exquisite sense of release and elation. As I left the bathroom and got back into bed, I felt the softness of the bed, my head on the pillow, the womb-like cosiness of it, intensely, as if, again, for the first time. This in itself was a heavenly feeling, particularly in contrast to the strange, unfathomable one previous. It felt as if I had gone through something, or more, got through it and reached the finish line.
