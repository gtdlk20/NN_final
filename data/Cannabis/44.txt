I decided to stay away from weed for at least a couple of weeks.  And even when I do take it, its only in very small doses, among people that understand my situation.  Even now, on a normal day and Im staring into space, and someone asks me if Im OK, I am taken aback for a moment and my heart rate raises slightly.
