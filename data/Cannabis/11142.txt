Overall it was very pleasant for a while, but it started to build a little bit too much.  This happens sometimes with me, I get too out of it and internally withdrawn into my own thoughts.  I was feeling like this when my friend left to go home and my brother went upstairs.  Im not exactly sure how much time passed, but Im guessing it was about 6:30, 3 hours since eating, when the most profound part of my trip (and I do consider this a trip) occurred.
