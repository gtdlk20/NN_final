It started getting late, so I rode my bike back to my real dorm which was across campus.  I had no problem operating it. The cold air bothered me.  I got back to my place, did a little more 'overloading' and then tried to sleep.  I was unable to though and ended up getting no sleep at all, I just couldn't fall asleep.  The next day after I gave up on sleeping and took a shower and ate breakfast I still noticed that I was slightly light headed and had a bad headache (easily cured with liquid Advil tabs).
