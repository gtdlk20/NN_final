Then we entered the station and it really went further very fast. So after a short while all was very funny and ridicolous. Walking was getting a problem because it was very hard to use one step for the other. Then we left the station again and get outside. We tried to talk to some people but we weren't able to do it - we only could make some noises and our converstion was getting more and more difficult maybe every 10th word was kind of sensible. 3 guys realized us and started laughing about us because we were behaving like robots - we just made noises and keep on walking. By the time one of them get the idea to rob us I got an unpleasant feeling and we went back to the station (btw we must have been crossing that station maybe 50 times that night!). Now I lost time and place control I mean I forgot in which direction we were heading and I wasn't able to speak one sentence because every time I forgot the beginning so it was no use.
