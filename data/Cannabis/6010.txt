I brought 1/8oz of pot off my dealer and I was told it was 'very trippy stuff'. I smoked 1 joint and a couple of bowls of this stuff with my mate R and got very high, my girlfriend then called up to tell me that a bloke called J had a free house and if we brought pot we could stay round his. On the way to his house I kept hearing arguments and fights on the streets I was walking past, I also heard my family calling me and got very paranoid. I kept repeating 'You're just tripping, it's not real, if it was someone  they would have come over to you, voices can't hurt.'
