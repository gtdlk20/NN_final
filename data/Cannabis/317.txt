The walk back to the car was kind of frightening, as the road seemed much longer and I was getting paranoid. I had just seen the movie The Village, and so had S who was making eerie comments about how those creature could be in these woods. We got back to the car, and pulled a futon out of the back of K's car/van/truck/whatever. We laid it out on the open field of dead pine needles and weeds. This is where it started to get weird for cannabis.
