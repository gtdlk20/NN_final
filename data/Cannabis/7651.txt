When we got home, I helped unpack and went downstairs to tell them that everything was fine and we'd be eating soon.  My sis was sitting there, carefully examining her hands as if she'd never seen them before and the guy told me to try breathing cuz it was so fun! They were both giving me weird looks. It turns out that I was rocking (while standing) the whole time and didn't have the ability to walk straight.  My complex thoughts and analogies about every situation didn't sound like that when I tried to talk...I only said about 1/2 of the things that I was thinking...which wasnt very good since that meant that I had a lot of incomprehensable sentences that I thought were excellent. :S
