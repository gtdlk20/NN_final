I then have a blank spot and I can't remember what personality attributes I assumed. But I seem to remember that what I was repeating changed to 'I wish me and L (my girlfriend) will be happy for ever.' Since I can't influence what L thinks I believe that I must have thought I had formed some kind of psychics link or had a transcendental moment in which those kind of things were within my grasp(!).
