After about ten minutes I took the nugs out. The water had a light brownish color and miniscule bubbles that looked like oil molecules were in the liquid. I drank the whole thing down and felt a mild, sleepy-like high for about two hours. Smoking is definately a better alternative than tea if I can do it without getting caught.
