Anyhow, we popped into his closet with another buddy of mine, E. We started smoking bowls, and having been sober for 3 months I was really happy and excited to be getting back into it. This was by far the most intense high I ever had off mj. Around the third bowl between the 3 of us I started laughing hysterically was barley able to get any words out. I was on my back I was laughing so hard, shouting out how I had found god in a plant and things like that. J and E decided I had had enough, I didn't agree.
