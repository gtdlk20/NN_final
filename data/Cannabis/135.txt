Noticable effects started after about 5 minutes and came on very slowly but stedaily increasing. I first noticed that my senses had changed. I was suddenly aware of my socks when I walked, they felt like they had a wrong shape or maybe they were too thick. Anyway walking became something I constantly would notice. The feeling in my fingers also changed, it was as if I had band aids on the finger tips. Shortly after that I started sweating lightly in the hands and neck.
