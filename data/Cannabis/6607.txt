I was sitting up on my floor and just fell down.  The white noise seemed much louder, and I could hear different sounds.  It soon became a melody that I could slowly change when I concentrated on it.  I tried to say something, and my mouth opened up and felt like it kept opening until it was about to swallow my head.  I was a little nervous at first.
