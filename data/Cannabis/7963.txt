After sitting with them for a bit, and having a deep conversation with them, I looked at the time and realised I had to be home. I got up and walked down to the bus stop and waited for my bus. Even waiting for my bus seemed like fun because I was just thinking of things all the time until my bus came along. I got on my bus and paid for my ticket. I sat at the back and started thinking again. I was thinking so deeply, that I nearly forgot to press the button to make the driver stop at my stop. I managed to press the button and the bus stopped. I walked out and thanked the driver and proceeded to walk home... thinking all the way.
