The contradiction, and the sight of my erection seemed very funny. It was unusually swollen and seemed to glow with each throb, a bit like a heat lamp. I giggled for a time, stumbled around a bit, then tried to piss, properly. At this age, in the late 60s, I had no idea about sex, what erections were for, or the mechanics/sensations of orgasm. All my learning was from a standard child-friendly pamphlet. I was still waiting for the 'special dream' that would signify my entry into adulthood, but had really not given it much thought.
