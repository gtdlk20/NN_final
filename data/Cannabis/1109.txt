Hughie is a DJ. He automatically went to his turn tables and begun spinning. The music volumes went up and down and I could see the music in my head as the beats and melodies changed, but I wanted to tell him to shut it off, it was far too intense for my mind to process. At this point I realized something was wrong. I had never been this far gone before. I had never in my life been THIS stoned. I had to tell Hughie something was wrong, but I couldn't find the strength to move.
