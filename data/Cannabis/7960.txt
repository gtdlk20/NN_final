I was back, and grateful for life like never before. Now I'm not exactly sure how I generated an out-of-body experience on pot, but anything's possible in the drug kingdom. Not only this, but I also learned some interesting information on the power of the memory. This experience gave me a great appreciation for life and the human mind, and as depressing and painful as the actual event was, it taught me the values of both and to appreciate them while you still can. Plus, you have to admit....out-of-body experiences are pretty damn nifty ;o)
