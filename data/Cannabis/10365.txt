Finally it was time to go in.  I found myself getting pushed and I almost fell into this 1 foot puddle.  So we got in and I was checked.  My cousin told me to run to the front row.  And I ran. I felt so stupid. Cuz I didnt really know wut I was doing. And the guard yelled at me for running.  So I started walking awkwardly fast.  But I made it! My cousin and her friends were ever so proud! Lol
