I wasn't that hungry anymore when I got the idea that my friend must be the devil because he rejected recognizing me and only sometimes I felt like he was back when he said: 'It's all cool - nothing to worry about'... suddenly two police men arrived and I got really angry cause that dumb woman really called them so we tried to leave the store and the police men were cool so all were cool... now I started coming down but then my friend wanted to drive and I jumped out of the car and took his keys cause I was afraid to die so we just hang out about another hour before I could accept driving home... after all this trip was really high and the following trips we made were more or less good but there were none what I would call a bad trip again... if I wouldn't have had that experience again I probably wouldn't use it anymore but now I really learned to use that stuff and we really had much fun but this is not the topic...
