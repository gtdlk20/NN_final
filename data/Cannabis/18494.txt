After I finished my poptarts and helepd BMF look for his phone some...not some...we looked for the better part of half an hour, maybe forty-five minutes. I finally found it when I went to go get my notebook out of his car, noticing his phone crammed into his boots in the back. I gave it to him, he checked his calls or whatever, and then we went back out to the trampoline. We laid there for some long length of time, and the next thing I noticed was BMF going inside. I then realized I must have fallen asleep, but for how long? A minute, an hour? Six? I went inside to talk to BMF about it and he said that he had just gotten up to go inside and told me, but figured I was alseep. I image my slumber as somewhere near ten minutes. Then I laid down on the couch to watch some more game playing by Ox and BMF.
