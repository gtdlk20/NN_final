As I drove I kept getting more and more disoriented.  I kept realizing that I was fidgeting an unbelievable amount. Then I started rapidly blinking involuntarily.  By the time I got home, it was like my whole body was in hypertension and I was just blinking, writhing, and fidgeting up a storm.  I sat down and tried to calm myself down, and I just started to panic more and more.  I kept catching myself moving my legs and hands(which were really shaking) involuntarily. My blinking had slowed down by now, but every time I blinked, i'd see a bright blue flash. By this time, I could hardly keep a thought in my head for more than a few seconds.  I felt like I was just insane and couldn't think at all.  Then I got all panicked, thinking I might never return to normal. My thoughts kept getting more and more messed up.  My attention span was so short, I could think about something, and it would instantly trail off into a stream of random thoughts. I doubt I was even capable of saying the whole alphabet.
