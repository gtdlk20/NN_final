Since that night I have not been able to replicate that high.  I have also not been able to get my hands on anything better than shwag.  I am wondering if the weed that I smoked that night was possibly KB, but I have no clue.  All I know is that every high I have had since that night has been a let-down, and I long for the wonderful feeling that was present that evening.  I will continute to attempt to locate some high quality weed, and attempt to replicate that nights high.  If all goes well, chances are I will become a 'pothead,' but would it really be so bad?  =)
