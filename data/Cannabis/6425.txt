I should note I've also suspected for a while that I may have a sort of allergy to cannabis because I sometimes get bad headaches and my throat sort of closes off somewhat making it difficult to breathe, talk, or drink water. Maybe that was a factor too. Maybe those are normal effects though, I guess I should do some research and find out. Anyway I finally just figured it was a very negative high, a totally wasted buzz that by this point was beyond salvaging so I went to sleep.
