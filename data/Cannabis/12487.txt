Now normally when I close my eyes, I either see total darkness or blobs of shape that I suppose are normal when everyone closes their eyes, these blobs have a somewhat dark purple tone to them, I believe.  Anyways when I closed my eyes, I didn't see any purple blobs, I saw different 'levels of red.'  What I mean by that is the colors of red were placed differently as to give depth.  These 'levels of red' morphed into what seemed to be a videogame being played right in front of my eyes.  The shapes were moving around very fast, and I soon realized that I was playing a Sonic The Hedgehog game in my head.
