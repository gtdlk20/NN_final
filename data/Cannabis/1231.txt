Breathing is hard, I'm shaking uncontrollably. I should call for help, because the vision behind my lids is greying, the lines and circles loosing their tint until my mind is empty except for one thought: I'm caught. I've disappointed my mother, what will I tell her? And then I realize that I really can't breathe--it's not coming to me. I want to scream so that I can get help and not go down in the stats as another OD--get a tube pushed down my throat to force the oxygen in. But I don't, and as the cold feeling of dread spreads steadily, building the pressure like a crucible, death stares me plain in the face.
