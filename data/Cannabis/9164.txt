Two hours passed and I was convinced that I had been sold some bogus edibles. No sensations or euphoria whatsoever. However about three hours after ingesting the cupcake I started noticing a little something, a tingling of the senses particularly in the extremities, I wondered if this was the beginning of something, over the next half hour the sensations grew more intense, interestingly especially in my genitalia, a pretty strong tingling sensation. By this point I realized that I was once again, high. It was a pretty euphoric feeling, I moved about the house still doing little tasks and enjoying the overall bliss of each moment. It was a pretty euphoric feeling, I moved about the house still doing little tasks and enjoying the overall bliss of each moment. Occasionally I would have a bit of confusion, similar to the situation where you walk into a room and can't remember why you went in there. I caught myself in this situation several times and found it so hilarious I would laugh out loud. I listened to some music, I found the sounds to be heightened, as if I could hear parts of the mix I had not heard before or was insensitive enough before to not hear them.
