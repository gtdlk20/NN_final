Next came the pipe, which was Daves (I imagine the largest amount of Skunk it can hold is about 1 cm cubed). This is when things can become a little more hardcore than the Jay smoking.  The wind had suddenly picked up, so we sat up-right and used the inside of our bags as cover to stop the lighter being blown out (this meant that I had to bend forwards to get my head inside the bag, whether this affected my lungs in a strange way I do not know, Im open to suggestions).  We both took some medium to large hits (I didn't use the rush hole) and I became gradually really REALLY stoned.  It was around the 5th hit (which was a very big hit, which I held in for about 10 seconds I think) that things started to go a tiny bit trippy (ish).
