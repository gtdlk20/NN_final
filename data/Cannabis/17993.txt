After that I don't really know what happened we listened to a mix of songs I had made especially to make u trip out. There was lots of techno and weird stuff like English guys singing. Then we got to the techno song called Marijuana In Your Brain this is when all the weird shit started happening. My spine felt like it was moving up and down through my back making it tingle, my head felt like it was flying off of my body into heaven, and my feet stayed on the ground which sort of scared me because I'm afraid of heights and looking down from the clouds was pretty high up, and I could see myself going through the ground all the way to the core of the earth. It was the craziest thing I have ever felt.
