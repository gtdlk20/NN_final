All in all, I suggest bringing a friend with you, who will not be high when you are.  Smoke enough to get you to the point that you feel comfortable.  Dont do enough to go fucking potty.  I recommend marijuana to all of you, before anything else.  Before you can walk, you must crawl.  Before you try E, acid, K, or anything else, try weed.  Its fun, quite safe, and cheap.  I rate it A+.
