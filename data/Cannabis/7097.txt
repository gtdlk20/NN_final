Time 2:30 - We had now reached the woods, by this time the paranoia levels had grown a little, and it felt as if everyone who passed by secretly knew that we'd all taken pot, but I was aware this was normal as I have ingested cannabis before.  We sat down on a log to roll a joint.  My friend R was now at the peak of his trip; which I would be at 3 hours later, and was walking around in circles biting his finger nails looking really freaked out.  He said he hated it and wanted to feel normal again; he was also worried that the trip may never cease.  We began to roll the joint; when a dog walker passed us, and his German shepard jumped up at the joint.  My heart stopped, as I had this notion that the bloke was an undercover policeman with a drugs dog.  He asked us rather unpleasantly if we were starting fires; which was a relief as I thought we'd been done for.
