Well anyway, after the end of 'End' came the long utter silence before the 20 second finale 'her majesty'. During the silence I looked back at the shadow, it was gone, I didn't see anything remarkable about it, in fact right next to me was where the shadow ended, the sun was in front of me not behind... the shadow was coming in from ahead, not coming out of where I was sitting (bear with me). Just as I made the connection to look towards the sun, and the breathtaking skyline... the hidden track 'her majesty' came on.
