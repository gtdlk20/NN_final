6:30 AM (?) - 12:00 PM - I sleep at this point, very deeply.  I awaken feeling good but with a slight headache.  I drink a few glasses of water and feel much better.  I go about the rest of this day as I would any other day.  I notice that smoking weed makes some of the oral dose feelings come back a bit.
