As we drove, When it was my turn to hit, I took huge drags off of the pipe and held my breath for as long as I could, with the hope that I'd feel something this time.  After about 3 times around, each time taking as much as possible I started to feel it.  This was after probably about 15-20 minutes.  I noticed that everything seemed to become extremely slow.  Like time had slowed down, but not really.  When I moved my head, my hair would move and it would move with normal speed, but when looking at things not directly in my face, things seemed ultra slow.
