I still have the green dragon, though, and I plan on using it, but in a much different way. Subsequently, I tried a much smaller dose (15-20ml) along with a few drinks and found that they mingled quite well - the alcohol buzz hits first, then neatly fades into the THC high, leaving no hangover since I only consumed a modest amount of each. This is, however, a recreational experience, which is a lot less interesting to me. It might also blend well with some of China's legal psychoactives (of which there are a surprising number), but that will have to wait for another time.
