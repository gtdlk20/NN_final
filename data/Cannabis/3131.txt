It was just another day, same as usual. I hadn't gotten too much sleep the night before, a little more than 4 hours. That probably was not a good idea, because I require a decent amount of sleep on a regular basis as to avoid having problems with my anxiety. One of my friends and I had stayed up until about 4:20 in the morning before I finally decided to try and get some sleep. I woke up, got high and proceeded to get ready for what the day had in store for me. The course of the day itself is rather unimportant so I'll fast forward to that night.
