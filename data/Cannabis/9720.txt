A brief substance history before the experience. Before today 2002 was the last time I had ever done drugs. I had been clean of any substance abuse for 15 years. My health has been getting the best of me for so long that I have been scared to do anything, much less have an eye opening experience. I made one mistake, and that was underestimating the potency of this strain. I was sick to my stomach for a good while before it passed. It was too much for me, and too strong. This weed was no joke.
