But my boyfriend was a pretty regular pot user, nothing crazy but very experienced. Still smart and successful with a good job. He knew I was depressed and bored and had 'clutter' in my brain. So he suggested maybe I take a couple 'candies' and it would help me relax and sort through everything in my head. And boy, did it ever.
