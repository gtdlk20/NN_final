This time I ate 3.6g. If I assume that the raw hash contained 20% THCA and if I also assume 100% conversion of the raw THCA to 9THC by decarboxylation, then the consumed edible dose in my 3.6g of chocolate would have been 60 mg of hash (slightly over a twentieth of a gram) containing about 12 mg of 9THC, most of which is then converted by the liver into 11 THC.
