Sitting over at my friend's apartment, I decided to, once again, attempt an oral dose of cannabis.  I have consumed marijuana in this fashion several times in the past but only to minimal effects.  My other drug experiences include, but at not limited to mushrooms, salvia divinorum, san pedro cactus, amphetamine, demerol and alot more.  I have, in the past year been sticking to natural psychoactives only, with an occasional low dose of DXM.
