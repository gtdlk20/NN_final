In summary, I now understand much better what a more typical experience is supposed to be. I understand that, generally, cannabis is far less dangerous than the legal barbiturates, tranks and anti-depressants that are killing off my father. While I don't find that it suits me personally, I respect those who choose to use it responsibly. After all, my second experience was pleasant overall because the person I was with had established rules and was very responsible.
