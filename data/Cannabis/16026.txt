I have smoked Weed in the past but, only taken like 3 hits or so. I was going to sell my friend a video game for $20 but instead he offered my a gram for the game. So I went over to his house. He had rolled a blunt for me. We went in the back yard and he lit it up and gave it to me. I took the first hit and inhaled. Then another and a third. It kicked in like 30 seconds. I felt like I did with previous experiences kinda dizzy, happy tingly. The blunt was barely even worn down I let him take a few hits while it settled in. I took it back and took 2 more hits, and a couple more and then the blunt was gone.
