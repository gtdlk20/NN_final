Moving my body, tapping my foot etc. makes the effect temporarily disappear. It is like a wild animal that will hide when you move or make some noise, but when you sit still, it comes back. I feel the effect could disappear just like that, any time. It is a thin layer lying on top of my normal senses. I feel the effect could disappear just like that, any time. It is a thin layer lying on top of my normal senses. If I suddenly got up and started to some mundane work, I might forget about the effect. But I am not getting up, I am sitting down, typing, and the effect is quite powerful.
