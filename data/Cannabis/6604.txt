It was rather time consuming, but one night at around 8.00 I made it.  I used half an ounce of Marijuana and was on an empty stomach.  Before I drank it, I prepared my room for it.  I consider Marijuana to be a spiritual thing for me, so I made it very comfortable on the floor and I put the radio on so it was white noise at a low sound.
