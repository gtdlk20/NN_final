His swaying action in circles was what interested me, suddenly the softened pain went for a little trip of its own: the pain started to pulse and it left that area of my head and entered my brain.  It felt as if the pain or 'heat' as I would like to call it now was travelling either along my arteries or neurones... At first I thought that the heat actually might have been the THC eating its way through my cells, and that now it was attacking my neurones in my brain.  And then suddenly I just thought: So itÂ’s the THC now?  Not the Dry Mouth or Red Eye?? Yeah right, its just your imagination... just enjoy the sensation and go with flow.  This changed my whole perspective... so what if its the THC, how can I stop it?  It was mainly this, and also my friend calming me down (apparently while that was all happening I was actually mumbling to myself and looking really worried) that made me start to enjoy the 'trippy' feeling going on inside my brain, it was like swirling and swaying around the inside of my head in a very slow motion, very pleasant and surprisingly relaxing.
