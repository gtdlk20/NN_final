He reminds Benny and I that we have to be quiet since he wasn't supposed to have people over and goes in first to make sure it's all clear. When he nods we follow, and I notice how nice it is--matching couches, entertainment center, flat-screen TV, and weights. I catch a glimpse of myself in a mirror and see bloodshot eyes and only slightly tousled hair. The table in the living room isn't bad, either, but we don't go there, because that's just asking to get caught. John tells Benny to sit when he tries to follow him into the kitchen, and after a quick-whispered squabble, Benny sits on the small couch. I let out the breath I'd been holding and relax when they work it out grinning--controversy makes me nervous, and we'd all be in deep trouble if we got caught now.
