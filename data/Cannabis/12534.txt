Then I was sucked into another all enveloping hallucination.  I was being roasted rotisserie style over an open fire by African Natives.  Where the fire should have been burning me, I felt only warmth, like an extreme concentration of body energy.  Eventually the feeling had enveloped my entire body, I felt as if I was in space again, only this time I was floating with warmth and body energy flowing through my body.
