I started taking off after a few hits. After about twenty-five minutes, I felt really tense. My eyes were feeling strange. And before I knew it, I was on the floor. I don't know how I ended up there, though. I was literally knocked down by the power of the experience - it reminded me of the first effects of mushrooms, a heart that beats fast, and a different level of awareness.
