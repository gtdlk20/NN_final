I finally got home and went straight to my room. I looked at myself in the mirror. My reflection looked distored. My skin tone seemed gray and my eyes really were bloodshot. I decided to lay down. I pulled my blankets and covers over me. The softness of it all felt so fantastic on my skin. I rubbed my leg up and down and laughed to myself about the incredible feeling. As I closed my eyes I began seeing visuals. I kept thinking something was trying to get in my room and began feeling extremely paranoid. Around that time I fell asleep.
