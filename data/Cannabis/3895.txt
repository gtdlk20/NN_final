So I looked away and lay back down and everything felt really slow and heavy then very fast, like everything was leaving a trail behind it. The speeds kept changing and my head was so heavy.  I wanted to move it but I couldnt lift it up without feeling like it was gonna roll off my head so I held onto my hair and physically lifted my head up.  I thought that maybe if I lay still and closed my eyes that it would stop, still being quite adamant that I wasn't on hallucinogenic so there was no reason for this to be happening.  Then I started seeing things flashing in my vision, really fast, like a really fast montage of shots in a film, slowly coming towards me and I felt like it'd swallow me up but I didn't care. And there were these patterns in the middle of it with these couple of shapes, predominantly pastel blues reds and yellows. I recognised the shapes, I think they were from a painting we used to have in our house ages ago.   Then I was thinking about moving my tongue and I can't remember why but I had to withdraw my tongue into my mouth because there was another tongue which was faster than mine and then there was this thing constricting my tongue, like a tiny lasso, or something.
