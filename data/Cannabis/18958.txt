1.. 2.. and I started feeling strange.. I was acting so different, I realised. But I could say to myself that 'I'm not high' 'I'm okay'. But with a look at the mirror, I saw my eyes half open, and bloodshot. I was having so much fun, we were listening to rap, and dancing wildly. I felt a little tired and sat on E's bed. He was sitting beside me singing. I lighted up a cigar and it's smoke got into my eyes, it hurt me so much and my eyes were all watery. I kept them closed for a few seconds and as I opened them THE WHOLE ROOM WAS FULL OF WATER.
