I ignored it and tried to get back to a good trip. I started packing more bowls, and I started to notice, when I would talk to myself, like just saying 'damn Im gunna get wrecked from this hit!' , I wouldn't say I... I was saying 'we' when I was talking about myself... I would say 'oh we're gunna get blazed' and I'm thinking... Who is we? It was like I started developing a different personality in my head. At this point I started getting scared.
