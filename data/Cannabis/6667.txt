A little boy was saying 'Stab you. Stab you. Stab you.' and I watched as his eyes melted off in complete fascination. But I was soon distracted again by the loss of my body and remember feeling odd and grabbing my legs a lot and eventually hugging myself. The insane thing is that I continued to watch this crazy movie file but had no idea what was going on at all anymore. My surroundings became only me and the screen in front of me. There was a vague awareness of others in the room with me, someone standing next to me and such, but that quickly left my thoughts.
