At first it seemed like nothing but a funny illusion at first, but as I thought about it later, I began to see the symbolism in it. I was thinking that it was now dark outside because I had eaten the sun as a result of innocent fun. Then it hit me: we  humans are eating away at the world around us. As we indulge in material goods to satisfy our greedy urges for what we percieve is happiness, we are destroying the true source of beauty and joy: our planet earth.
