At first, I was having a great time. I was really high and feeling really good. It lasted for about 20 minuites, when I started to get nauseous. I went into my room to lie down for a little bit, hoping it would take the nausea away, but it only got worse. I turned on the air conditioner full blast and stripped down to my bra and panties and tried to calm down. My heart was beating too fast and I was sweating like mad. I curled up on my bed and closed my eyes and tried to fall asleep but it didn't work.
