My dad has always been a better friend than father figure.  He's quite the character, and always a blast to hang out with.  We had his version of the drug talk when I was a younger guy and he told he that he had tried just about everything: meth, coke, heroin (once), shrooms, acid, and of course weed.  He then told me that all that was in the past and there's not all that much to it.  Later, when I got older and long after he and my mom had split up, he admitted that he still smoked weed occasionally, although that didn't really make me want to try it (I was very down on all drugs until that magical day I first got drunk).
