I was thinking to myself that, since I was stoned, I looked like one of the 'cool kids' and anything that I did was excusable because of this. With this in mind, I felt okay with the fact that I had no idea what was going on. A friend would come up to me and say hi, and I found it hard to talk to them. I could hear them perfectly fine, but my mind couldn't quite comprehend the situation. For example, someone would say 'Hey, what's up' to me. I heard the words 'hey what's up' but I didn't know at all how to respond to it.
