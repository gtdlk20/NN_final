It was as if I was hyper-alert to each thought as it came, and as it did come, it was as if some hyper-acceleration cleaned or swept it away. For example, I thought, Im not sure about my job situation, and then, it was as if this new coating on my thoughts said, Yes, okay, youre not sure about your job situation, thats okay; its okay to be uncertain, move on. And then, to whatever other thought arose, the same thing happened.
