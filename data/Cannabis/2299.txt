Everything went as planned, but my trip was much stronger than any previous trip Id experienced. Normally I can hold ganja smoke in for 3-4 hits, but this time I could only hold in the first one. I was persistent in trying to hold my breath, but I just kept coughing. Once the joint was done I assumed that I hadnt smoked well enough and that I would feel no high, but in about 30 seconds I felt just the opposite.
