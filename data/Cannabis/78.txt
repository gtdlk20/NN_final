Tom brought me my cup of Tea, and we all went back upstairs.  I felt like Taya and Tom had decided I was out of it.  Someone may have said something to that effect, but I dont recall.  Interestingly, this seemed to tell me to calm down and not worry, even though I was still feeling disconnected.  I sat down again, back in the bedroom and Tom started doing something on the computer.  Possibly continuing the episode of Family Guy, but I cant remember.  I was still looping every last 4 things that happened.  Tom said I seemed like I was over the worst of it now; but I insisted everything still felt strange and that things were repeating.
