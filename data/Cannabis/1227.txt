This statement is only half-true. I am awake enough to hear them and differentiate between the their voices, but not quite so much as to get up and prove them wrong. Besides, I add, if I got up I'd probably act even more suspicious, so this is the smarter thing to do. So I content myself with watching the patterns inside my head--the wavy lines of blue and green and purple and yellow on the sea of black. The skin-toned circles that signify where the heat is located in a triangular pattern, with dark lines making out my head and his thigh, separating the triangle into two different shades of skin--light and dark.
