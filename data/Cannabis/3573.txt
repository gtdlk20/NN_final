I found out that the high end posh dispensary not only had ridiculous markup, but also had very little product selection. I visited a much more down-market (one could say seedy) recreational dispensary. Ignoring the dreary location, I actually found it much better than the posh place. All the product was laid out in plain sight, so it was easier to wrap my head around. When I asked about absolute extracts cartridges, the 'budtender' just put all the cartridges on the counter and went through each one, explaining the differences. It was much more helpful and less intimidating than the posh fancy place.
