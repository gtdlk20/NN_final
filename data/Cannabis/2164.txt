I feel I have to provide some background story to where I am at this point to adequately express my experience with marijuana. Thus, I have divided this into three sections: Introduction, which provides the story and events leading up to my beginning with marijuana, Enter the Herb: which describes my second, but what I consider my first and most intense experience with marijuana, and The Aftermath, which describes how marijuana has affected my life on a grander scale. If you wish to skip the introduction and get to the experience, thatÂ’s perfectly fine, but it helps explain my state of mind going into the experience, which I believe to be a vital aspect of the use of any psychoactive.
