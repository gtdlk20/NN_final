As it became late, we decided to go back to C's cabin.  My friend P mentioned something about cow tipping.  Several people acknowledged that some friend of a friend or relative that they knew had gone cow tipping and thought it was extremely funny.  C noted that there were many farms around the area with cows.  B suggested that we go cow tipping.  It is now around 11pm on friday night.
