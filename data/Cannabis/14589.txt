I wound up finishing the rest of the binger in about 1 Â½ hits.  By the time I passed the bong on to be re-packed, I was completely out of my mind.  My friends, who were all still sober, were chatting and watching TV.  It was all I could do to sit there and keep my eyes open.  I felt like my brain was racing with thoughts and images faster then I could consciously process them.  The closest thing I could describe the feeling too is tripping on mushrooms.  It was very similar in that I felt that the individual compartments of my psyche had been suddenly thrown open and scattered to the wind.  I could either try desperately to gather them all back together, which was proving impossible, or else let myself go and have fun in the playground of my mind.  I chose to do the latter.
