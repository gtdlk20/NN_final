As with most folk experiencing cannabis for the first time I felt I had to re-learn how to do everything anew. Just walking across the sand dune to an area of bushes to have a piss took a fair amount of concentration. (As did attempting to talk, listen, and pretty much everything else.) Nothing strange, there, although everything was strange at the time. In a very good way.
