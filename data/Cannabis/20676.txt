We wrapped the cube in a cloth and smashed it with a hammer with one blow.  There being four of us I heated 4 cups of water in a saucepan to a boil, reduced heat to a simmer, and added the crushed cube.  Unscientifically, I simply let it simmer until an amber colour developed, which was about 30 minutes.
