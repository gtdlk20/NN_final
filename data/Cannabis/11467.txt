After school my friend and I went to her house, and then far off into a wooded area where all the potheads would gather secretly and quietly.  When I had arrived, the group consisted of my friend and I, as well as three other guys.  Even though I did not know the guys too well, they were nice and seemed to fit in with my kind of crowd.  My doubt had vanished when one of them complimented the Beatles t-shirt I had been wearing at the time.
