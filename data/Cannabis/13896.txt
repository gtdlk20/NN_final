Three hours before the test, I drank 5 LARGE glasses of water, ate a piece of peanut butter toast (the fats supposedly help), and took two caplets of Horsetail (Shavegrass is another one that works, dunno if they are the same or not) that I had gotten from my local health food store.  Horsetail is a diuretic.  Another good one is Buchu.  I also took two b-complex vitamins to give it some color.
