7.55 - I am, at the moment, filled with a deep psychological pressure to make haste and finish my work so I have time remaining to clean up my smoking tools, as well as a fear of being caught red-handed by a number of my superiors. I repeatedly picture them coming to my door in my mind, and they each, for some reason unknown, have face and body textures very similar to those of the Simpsons television characters. I must make haste to clean up, I will return.
