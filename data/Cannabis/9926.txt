Almost at the peak of my high, I switched on some hemi-sync music and lay down with my eyes closed. Withing a few moments I could feel a vibration in my fingers and toes, and a feeling that my body was preparing to lift off !! It was disorienting and a bit scary. And once fear entered my mind, it was over. Was I about to have an out of body experience (OBE) ? Perhaps I will try it next time around and might discover something.
