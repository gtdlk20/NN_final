Ever since (it's been a few months) I think about that night every day a few times a day and wonder what the fuck had happened. It was by far the most frightening yet interesting and enlightening moment in my life. I will never forget it. I don't know why it happened, whether it was because it was KB, or because I hadn't done weed in a long time or because I was scared and slightly depressed at the time. I promised to never to drugs again but that's bullshit because for 4/20 I bought some regular weed and have done it and it was like the old days (nothing weird). I also did Morning Glory seeds last night and the same thing almost happened to me once I entered a car. I can't fully explain what all I felt and thought that night but I wish everyone could experience some time in their lives. I had a kind of epiphany, I now am pretty sure I will grow up to be a world leader (maybe The World Leader)! It reminded me of Mein Kampf and what Hitler said happened to him after he got gassed in WW1. I lover marijuana and other drugs and hope they will be around for ever and that I can keep on doing them. I don't ever want that experience of Dec. 4th to happen to me again because I felt like I was stuck in it forever and forever. I will probably write a book about some time in my life if I can do it accurately.
