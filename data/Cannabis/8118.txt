I dont know if teleportation is a good word for it, but I dont think drifting is good either. Objects I looked at would often move slightly in one direction and then instantly zip back to their starting place. This accompanied me feeling like I was falling and frequently losing my balance. If I tried to sit straight up in a chair, I would feel like I was falling and eventually rest my head on the countertop, without trying to.
