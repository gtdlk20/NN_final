After smoking, I coughed and burped and, like he said, it tasted like milk. I think anyone who has smoked pot knows the feeling afterward. We walked up the stairs out of the ravine and it hit me as we were crossing the street, a lady passed us by and she looked like a pop-up book character. Nothing made sense. My friend who is short and stocky seemed evil and troll-like. I could hardly walk. At first it seemed like a video game, then a cartoon then a dream, or all of them all at once. To go where we were going we had to go through another, smaller ravine in my area. I for some reason was visualising/feeling a bouncing mushroom. I exclaimed to my friend 'I never knew you could feel like this.'
