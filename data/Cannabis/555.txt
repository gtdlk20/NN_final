'Here, put one arm in one sleeve, and the other arm in the other.' He told me. I tried but I couldn't manage to do it. It was like seeing a shirt for the first time. I couldnt filter my vision to figure out what I was seeing. There was just a mass of random colors and shapes. No dont just put it around you, put your arms in the sleeves. He said. I still wasnt doing it right and so eventually he just put the shirt on me. Then he got somebody elses sweatshirts and put that on me as well.
