The next morning was almost a disaster.  My mom called me at 9:30 and reminded me that we were going shopping that morning.  It took every ounce of effort in my body to not look and sound high at that point.  I went shopping for 3 hours and it was some of the longest and least decisive hours of shopping I have ever experienced.  I still donÂ’t know if my mom thought I was high.
