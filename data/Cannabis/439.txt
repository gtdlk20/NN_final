The previous year I had the chance to take some weed for myself. I cut some well-formed buds from my fathers drying crop. I technically stole them, as I didnt tell anyone, but I wouldnt have faced any major consequence if I was found out. My father doesnt give any to me, but he has given to some of his friends, and I was shocked to know that so many normal older people do weed too. He has encouraged me to grow as well and invest in a good vaporizer, but I still cannot find a good concealing place to do it. I wrapped the plant material carefully in kitchen paper, and put it in a small plastic bag. I had the chance to gather some new material this year as well, which I combined with the older stuff.
