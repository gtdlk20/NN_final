I walk out to the car, 'Oh shit, I must have been in there for ages' I thought.  My friends all look at me, and I say 'Here I can't remember what you wanted, so I got this' and I handed him the chocolate.  Then I mumbled, 'U guys wana just stay here for a while?'  They were like 'Dude were in a parking lot, its kinda sketchy.'  'Ok, I duno if I can drive though, I'm really messed up.'  I said.  So my friend says he can drive, and he drives everyone home, and then I get in the car when we get to his house.  I get back to my house, finally alone, and watch a movie. After this, I just drifted off into a peaceful daze, amazed by what had happened to me. The high wore off at around 6:00pm, but the after effects are lasting up to the time I'm writing this now, which is 9:00pm.
