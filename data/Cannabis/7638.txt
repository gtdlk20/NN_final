I'd always heard that eating Cannabis produced an entirely different effect than smoking it, so I went about experimenting on my own.  I cooked about 7 small/medium buds in 7 Tbsps of butter, by microwaving it to hot, but not boiling, then letting it cool for 15 minutes, then repeating the process for about 2 hours.  When I was done, it was a crystallized, almost icy mix, still kind of wet.  I ate the entire thing on toast with jelly.  The taste is a little strong by itself, so the jelly was a must.  I didn't strain anything out, just ate everything.
