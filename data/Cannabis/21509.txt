I must have went through my normal routine of covering everything up and hiding my bowl, but I don't really recall any of it. After this I, to great disappointment, realized that I didn't have my CD player in my room, and was gonna hafta enjoy this high music free. I was getting into bed, and thought I saw lights coming on in the hallway outside my room, which freaked me out, but I tried to remain calm, and go on with going to sleep. I turned out my light got into bed, fully clothed and with a beanie hat on, for some reason, and just sat there. I started to enjoy the music I was listening too, and then realized, there was no music playing, but in my head it was just as real as if I had my CD player on.
