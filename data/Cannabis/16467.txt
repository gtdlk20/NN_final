That Saturday morning I woke up and felt like smoking some ganj. I had never waked and baked before so I wasn't sure how much higher I would get. Now before I say anything else I want to tell you I had smoked weed about 300 times before this give or take. However, I somehow no matter how often I smoke can get little or no tolerance built up. I'm not complaining I actually like to save money.
