When I got to the grow site, I quickly looked around for people and climbed up the rock where my plants are growing. I planted the seeds and sat down on a log where I then had around 4-5 hits  of this really strong weed and I waited. I felt nothing much for about 20 minutes and I was wondering if it was doing anything, so I had 2 more cones. After the second to last puff I coughed violently and my head spun. I then finished the last puff and put my stuff away.
