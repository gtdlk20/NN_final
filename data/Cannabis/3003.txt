I was at a 'party' out in a field, and had a couple beers, nothing enough to even feel.  A friend held up a baggy of weed and a makeshift aluminum foil pipe and grinned.  We lit it up and started smoking.  I noticed no effects until it was almost all gone.  Then i just got real spaced out, stoned feeling, and things started moving like they were under a strobe light.  My friend said he'd had enough and staggered off (he was already pretty drunk), and I finished what was left.  After I finished it all, I kept getting more and more stoned.  All my coordination was gone.  Pretty soon I started seeing a red-violet colored random patterning appear evertime I blinked.  It would last about 1 second and then disappear.  I got into my car to drive back to my house to get something, planning to return.  I had no idea what was in store for me.
