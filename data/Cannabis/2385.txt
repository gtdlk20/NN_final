My kaleidoscope vision I spoke of earlier was back in full force, but this time these bright dots and patterns form shapes and all sorts of things, I saw people (from a side view) walking towards each other then they would step through each as if nothing was there.  Then the outline of my window frame started to sway and move like a piece of grass in the morning breeze, it almost reminded me of a mild mushroom trip but more intense and with a sort of twist.
