She was still way out of it until 3AM, and we were both upset.  I think that if she had a higher tolerance for weed, the whole night would have been more fun and nothing would have gone wrong.  I also contribute part of the experience to the medication she is on.  I would have had more fun myself if I hadn't felt so bad for her and empathized so deeply with her pain.  I genuinely felt like everything was wrong.
