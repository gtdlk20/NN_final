I'm not sure where to start so I'll just go in chronological order. That day I had just finished a math exam that I wasn't too pleased with when a friend of mine met me at my locker. 'Hey man, I got some chronic weed! You wanna buy?' he asked. I guess it was a combination of fustration over my poor math performance and looking for a way to cut loose after exams, but I purchased some of this fine ganja.
