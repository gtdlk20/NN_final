I went to my room and laid down on my bed, hoping to calm down.  But it only got worse.  I felt this incredible blinding pain in my head.  It was like my head was throbbing with agony, and every ten seconds or so all this pain would shoot up to the top of my brain, causing me agony.  I had already turned off the lights, and at this point I wanted to put my head under a pillow with the hope that this would somehow ease my pain.  But I couldn't do it because I was having so much trouble breathing I was sure I would suffocate.  This ordeal lasted for one terrible hour, easily the worst of my life up to this point.  After I had calmed down enough to breathe normally again I fell asleep for the night.  I woke up the next day and felt OK, but the experience has stuck with me.  I can't smoke anymore without worrying that another similar experience might occur.
