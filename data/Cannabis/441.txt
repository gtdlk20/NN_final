My first experience with cannabis was summer of this year, when I was at a trip abroad with some of my friends. We purchased just one blunt and smoked all from it. Until then, I hadnt smoked any tobacco even. I took two hits and honestly didnt feel any effect. Neither anyone else. I was shocked however when I learnt that a lot of my friends had done weed, because they didnt fit the weed user stereotypes. So probably there are a lot of weed smokers, however they dont talk about it with non-users for obvious reasons.
