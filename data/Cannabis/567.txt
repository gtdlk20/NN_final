It would be over??? I momentarily started to realize that I was shrooming. I was still very confused, but hearing that made me feel a lot less frightened. It would all be over eventually. I remembered that it was Friday, and I hoped that I would stop tripping before school started on Monday, but I was pretty sure I wouldnt. Time was completely distorted and I started going through what seemed to be hours in a matter of seconds. I was fast forwarding through Friday, and then Saturday, and then Sunday. The time for me to have to go to school was coming closer and closer and I was still tripping. In reality only a couple seconds had passed but I didnt realize this. As far as I was concerned, I was living hours and hours in moments. It was Monday morning.
