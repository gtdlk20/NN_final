After 20 minutes or so I stood up, took a few more tokes and decided that I was going to do some homework. The music in the background didnt sound any different, but it was harder to sing along with the songs. Even though I knew the lyrics, it took a little more focus to actually sing. Like my mouth wasnt automatically doing what I wanted to do.
