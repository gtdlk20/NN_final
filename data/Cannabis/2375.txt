I could feel the cold soothing water in my stomach and this cold feeling spreads through out my entire body, it felt so refreshing, like going to the pool on a really hot day. Then I noticed that my vision was really impaired. I havent really hallucinated on marijuana before, but this is as close to hallucinating on marijuana that I have ever been; I have a sort of kaleidoscope vision when Im in the dark, almost similar to a mild mushroom trip. I had this to an extreme, when I focused on an object I would see these little designs and patterns circling around the object I look at.
