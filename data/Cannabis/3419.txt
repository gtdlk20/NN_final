After admiring the little baggy of what she told me was a gram and a half (I had never seen weed in person before) we decided to head out.  We took turns taking hits (around seven each) and she became very high. Her eyes drooped and she looked incredibly tired. I on the other hand felt nothing and was pissed off because I wasnt even going to get high my first experience with weed. I was sitting on a rock at the time and looked down to swipe away a bug beneath me while it was her turn. As I brought my head up to take another hit, it hit me out of nowhere. I was high. I had never felt anything like this before. As I brought my head up to take another hit, it hit me out of nowhere. I was high. I had never felt anything like this before. I was speechless and couldnt form words. I was frightened and couldnt even make words to tell my friend what was happening to me. She nudged me again and told me to take another hit. I did so but didnt want to. My mouth wouldnt make words to tell her no. I ended up taking one more hit then finally figured out how to say no. IIIIIm done. I said in a slow slurred voice. She told me she was too and we went to stand up. As I stood up the high hit me even harder. I felt like I had bug eyes and more peripheral vision. I stumbled across the rocks and finally figured out how to walk straight. I was not enjoying this and told myself I would never smoke weed again.
