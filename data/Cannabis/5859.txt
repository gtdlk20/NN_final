All I can say is never over-indulge in weed you're not sure about. That night my mind felt like it ceased to function. Every word that rolled off my friend's tongues sounded beautiful. Every morsel of food tasted more delicious than I can remember. But an incredibly painful headache ruined my night and I will always be wary of how much I smoke from now on.
