Overall a very positive feeling from the drug, at some points I felt lovely/ laid back blissful, there was some mild confusion at times, though this could have been due to sleepiness & the fact I tend to get confused anyway. I enjoyed it. I shall sample it again in a single higher dose next time and hopefully in a better mindset.
