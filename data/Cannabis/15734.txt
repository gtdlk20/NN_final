By the time the smaller joint was roached the b-52 was still goin strong and we were trippin HARD! Tar was bubbling out the end as we finished it off, and we sat back and tried to get some real oxygen flowing in our systems again. I was blasted into the stratosphere. I started seeing spots and my heart was now beating so hard my chest hurt, and what started as a dull ache in my chest was amplified by the extremely high thc level and felt as if i had been shot or stabbed. I'm dead serious! My bro was reporting 'cardio' as well. They don't call marijuana psycho-active for nothing, And with this bomb shit and the amount we smoked, it was actually quite hullucinogenic.
