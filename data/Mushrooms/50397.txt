When looking back at this rough experience it leaves me with mixed feelings. The onset and euphoria were great but the part in between really wasn't. Stil I think it was mainly positive since it taught me some usefull things about how my mind works and what it feels like when it isn't working quite like it should. The mushrooms probably worked so strong because my stomach was completely empty. Interesting experience but the next time, a bit less though.
