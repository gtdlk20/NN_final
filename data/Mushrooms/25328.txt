On shore the forest beckoned and I followed a trail a ways into the woods.  I had to pee, and as I stood doing so the bushes swayed and melted.  I had the feeling someone was looking at me.  I turned my head to see what it was, and the bushes leaves had become eyes, and they were turning to absorb the sun.  Leafy arms reached out to me, I blinked, and it was over.
