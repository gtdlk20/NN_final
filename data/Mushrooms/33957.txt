As they inspected me and conversed among each other telepathically, I can see that I was the focus of their attention. Sometimes I could see their spirit bodies encode the shape of their physical bodies in soft flashes that came in and out of perception. They were tall and insect like, with thin and long arms. Although I stress, that most of the time they were there, their physical appearance wasnt definite, as their energy was like a holographic liquid. These beings were extremely sophisticated and operated on a way higher level than our own. I could see that out of the three one of them was a leader, and it was the leader who was doing something to my brain. It was kind of frightening, but I let it do what it was doing. The other 2 were discussing something in telepathy and I knew they were talking about me. Just didnt know exactly what. I noticed also that I could see them with my eyes opened and closed but to operate on their level of existence I had to use my third eye to fully visualize what was happening. After letting these aliens do something to my brain, the leader of them stepped back from my head and the three of them were staring into me or at me and talking amongst each other, I interrupted my friends conversation and said, Guys, we have visitors.
