Now it had really began, I started feeling very cold so I went and covered myself with the duvet and sat in the bed. Eyes started popping out in my duvet cover and the power sockets. I started being detached from my body, my limbs felt as if I was touching someone else. I let my head fall into the duvet which was covering my knees, and the travel distance  from the duvet surface to my knees felt as if I was moving my head around in an huge soft space. I opened my eyes and looked at the power socket, it was glistening wildly and was like a sly eye peering at me. I cracked what seemed like a devilish smile in this moment and this caused me to be afraid, I immediately closed my eyes and covered my nose with prayer hands so as to control my breathing and still my thoughts. This is the last time I had my eyes open for the next 2 hours roughly. I lied down in my bed and covered myself. My headphones still on, I delved deeper into nothingness. It felt as if I was completely inside my brain. Surfing on geometrical shapes of beauty and trying not to lose my balance and delve into terror. There were moments when terrors appeared to me but I managed to still the thoughts. I remember having my hand on my ribcage, it felt as foreign but the heart rate was an indication, as if I was commandeering a ship. The terrors looked like formless goo, they made underworldly sounds. Sometimes the music would terrorize me, but I thought that I would endure it and not look away.
