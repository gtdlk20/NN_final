I apologize for the lack of depth and detail in this report, I just wanted to convey that mushrooms just took many of the problems in my life, that I have been avoiding thinking about, shielding myself from maybe. It took these issues and has just spent the last 4 hours rubbing them in my face, made sure I got a real close look at them.
