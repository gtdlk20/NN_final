D and I rehashed our trip thus far, and he said I had kept saying werent we in the woods before?  When I thought about it, I realized why I had asked so many timesit still seemed so bizarre to me that we had started in the woods by a stream and had ended up in this house.  In fact, I heard myself say what happened repeatedly during the trip.
