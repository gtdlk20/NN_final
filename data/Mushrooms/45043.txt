I was truely more scared that night than I ever have been.  I realize that I almost took my life.  Fortunately all of the times I have done shrooms since then have been with many friends around, and when I felt much safer.  I am still aprehensive to take acid because I have heard of people doing unbeleivable things which have either killed them or someone else, or close to it.
