The original plan had been to lay on a table looking at the stars while I listed to the Dangerous album. I wanted the feelings that those songs evoked to wash over me while I was peaking. I'd already forgotten that that was the plan. However, I remembered that I wanted to listen to the Dangerous album so I was waiting for the perfect time to switch over. Luckily the next song on my list was Electable, which I've never had a liking for, so I decided to switch as soon as it started. While trying to navigate my music player and add songs to the now playing playlist, I inadvertently ended up spinning around a few times and managed to get myself lost when I looked back up. The familiar landmarks I was used to, such as the lake and the playground, were still there, but they were in the wrong places. It took me perhaps ten or fifteen seconds to reorient myself and figure out exactly where I was. The ease with which I'd managed to get lost surprised me and made me reconsider walking any further, but I kept going.
