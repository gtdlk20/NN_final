Back in the room now, perhaps 20 minutes later I was ready to learn more and I asked it to 'show me what you are without presenting yourself in human terms'.  This was something that I could bear for only a couple of minutes.  The most prominent memory is finding myself on a vast an desolate planet where no visible light (within the human spectrum of vision) could be found.  The entire planet was covered with life forms, something like fungi.  Each one living, sedentary and slowly moving but each one primitively and fundamentally 'conscious' the way that we consider animals and other forms of life to be conscious.
