Once we got to the basement, everyone was feeling it. I remember staring curiously at the couch in the basement. It was velvet and had a floral pattern that seemed to grow down the couch and on to the floor, meeting the stucco that had been melting off the ceiling. We began to watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a fucked up movie even for those who aren't on psychoactive fungi. I suddenly understood much of what the characters were going through. A green balloon positioned near a window cast its emerald colours all over the floor and walls. Halfway through the movie, B and D decided we should go for a walk. We left B's house about an hour before sunset.
