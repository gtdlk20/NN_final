Occasionally I would lapse in my childlike essence and become reminded of the more mature, spiritual connotation of the experience i was taking. Brief, upanishadic glimpses of context sporadically colored my childish revelry. I would regain memory of who I was, and that i was taking a well earned vacation from my usual perception, and then a profound spiritual oneness would wash over me and dissolve once more into childish laughter.
