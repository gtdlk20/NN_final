IÂ’m not sure how long all this went on, but I think I only spent about an hour or so in the bath. I soon began to feel tired. I got dressed and returned to lying on the living room carpet, listening to ambient trance music and smoking a joint. I could see wonderful waves of energy around everything, especially my hands, and these waves flowed and swished around constantly in the most exquisite ever-changing colours. I began to play with the energy fields around my hands, trailing them around and contracting and expanding the colours.
