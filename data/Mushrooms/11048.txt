I want to begin this post trip report by saying that I spent two hours contemplating my state of mind before finally deciding to take these.  My life has been very complicated the last few months and I wasn't sure that I was completely stable.  One type of person I have almost no respect for are those who abuse drugs and see them only as a form of minor amusement.  Although I have never taken mushrooms before, I understand that psychadelics are powerful tools and should be given the utmost respect.  The moment I decided that I would go through with the trip, many positive things happened that, although mostly silly, boosted my confidence in myself and gave me a feeling of safety.
