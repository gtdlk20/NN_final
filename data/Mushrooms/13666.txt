     The night that me and you shroomed, when we first got that ounce, I had a feeling that left me unsettled. It felt as though something was building up. I was curious about it, but I still fell subject to the hallucinations that every shroomer receives. My curiosity caused me to shroom again the next night, in order to find out what was going on. This time, as I sat alone in my room, my mind opened up to me a little. I began to think more with my mind than with my brain (metaphorically). I began to look critically at myself, and question how I fit into the system of life. I thought I was onto something but didn't know what. The shrooming continued. The morning we drove home for the holidays, I had taken a couple grams. I didn't dwell any deeper into my mind on this trip, it was a waste.
