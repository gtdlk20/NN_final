During my research, I had often come across that intention is important for a psychedelic trip. I suppose what this means is that you need to have set a search area in your mind, so that the relevant thoughts in your unconscious appear to you in your trip. My intention was not very clear to me, I had written some things down that vaguely tried to approach my intention, but if I am to warrant a guess with the prior and posterior information, I was trying to gain knowledge of myself, my fears. Particularly the fear of the unknown and ultimately death, which I think it contains. To create again and to beat death is a process that I am not familiar with so I am instead lost in a state of timid detachment.
