Neither one of us has any idea about what caused his bad dreams and reaction.  Before falling asleep, he had been extremely happy. I know from both prior experiences and talking about mushroom trips with my friends that falling asleep while on mushrooms can prove to be a very difficult task for some.  My boyfriend was tired and possibly fatigued when we had done the mushrooms, however, and perhaps this had something to do with it.
