For some reason, I felt cold, and wanted to go outside where it was warmer. When we finally found an exit from the casino, we ended up in an alley that didn't seem very familiar. We decided to circle the casino until we found where to go...and eventually we did. Unfortunately, we were trying to cross four lanes of traffic, and it seemed impossible to look both ways and try to assemble the information in my mind. We wandered down the sidewalk until we saw a bus stop and decided to sit down. Since we weren't too far into the trip, we contemplated the idea of jumping on a bus. But, thinking better of it, we continued on our walk. Passing the end of the hotel, we saw the swimming pool that was lauded as the 'best in Reno'. It looked like nothing more than a backyard pool with lots of scary looking old people and children.
