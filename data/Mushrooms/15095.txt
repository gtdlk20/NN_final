About five or six hours after the ingestion of most doses, the user reaches the deceleration or comedown phase, as the effects slowly begin to fade. In this stage, one may start to remember the concept of traditional reality, and feel like getting something to eat or drink. Often there will be an overwhelming urge to talk to someone and share what the user has just experienced as they come gradually back down to their pivotal point of consciousness. This drug shatters the mind into thousands of shards and then pieces them all back together one at a time. This can feel very overwhelming to the user at the time, and would be yet another reason I recommend tripping with a friend. It seems to help if I have someone who I can relate with.
