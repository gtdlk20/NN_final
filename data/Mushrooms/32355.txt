About 20 minutes had passed, we were moving our things, and I was tripping. One of my friends asked 'you feeling anything yet?' 'I'm a fuckin space cadet.' I replied. I was walking along these rocks, they appeared to be moving and forming a path right in front of me! 'Follow me! I know the way!' By this point caring all my equipment was too much for me. I dropped the case of water I was carrying, threw my chair down. I can't explain it, but it felt as if an incredible burden was lifted off my shoulders, it felt great. That feeling was very short lived. I looked over to the river. It was jetting different colours down the water. But the colours didn't move with the water, the whole river just jetted another colour, then another, then another. I looked at all the trees across the water. They were growing, shrinking, trading places. It was way too overwhelming, almost made me sick. Another one of my friends had set up a blanket on the ground, I went and layed down and tried to close my eyes to try escape all this. Didn't work. Upon closing my eyes, I saw a kalediscope of black and white swirls, but they were all in some sort of perfect geometric pattern. This was even more intense for me. My friends started to get concerned, I told them I needed water. They offered me some gatorade, but I wanted nothing to do with it. I needed water, and now. 'B' went and grabbed me a bottle of water, from which I dropped back down along the river. I grabbed the bottle and felt as if my quest had been fullfilled, but after drinking it, it did nothing. I layed back down, closed my eyes, and the intense closed eye visuals came back. I jumped up 'ants!' I shouted 'ants all over me! Get them off!' My friend 'B' asked my friends 'E' 'what is wrong with him?' E replied 'he's having a bad trip, my sister told me about this, we gotta just let him play it out.' Bad trip... The last words I remember hearing conciously, lingering in my mind...
