At about 330 in the morning, I got up from my bed, and walked around.  I went into the bathroom to spray my face with cold water but I was so captivated by the mirror that I had to leave.  I went back into my room, and laid down on the floor.  I thought for some odd reason this would help me come down.  All that happened though, was that I saw the box cutters I used for work.  I looked at them and contemplated suicide.  I even remember thinking that it was more effective to cut along the arm rather than across.  I was so close to doing something really dumb when I realized what I was doing.  It was not worth it to take my life because of some stupid feeling I had when I was in a mind altered state to begin with.  I laid back down on my bed and eventually fell asleep.
