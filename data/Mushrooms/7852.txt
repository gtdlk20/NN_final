I have some experience with psychedelics. Some 15 years ago, I more or less accidentally discovered mushrooms and it was a great, maybe life-changing experience. Life-changing in a good way. Within the next five years I was quite enthusiastic on psychedelics, tried some BZP, C-somethings, MDMA and Salvia, LSD but it either did not work (LSD) or did not catch me (BZP and Salvia). At one point I stopped doing psychedelics Â– that was approximately seven to ten years ago. It ended somehow quite abruptly. There was not bad trip, lost friends or finding Jesus. It just did not feel right anymore. There was not bad trip, lost friends or finding Jesus. It just did not feel right anymore. And so I had a good stash of psychedelics which I almost did not touch in all this years.
