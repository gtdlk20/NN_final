So, there's blood all over my monitor and desk. At this point, I realize that it is coming from my mouth, and that wasn't the universe I had been chewing on. It was my cheeks. Or maybe they're the same thing, really. I get some paper towels and clean up the worst of the mess. At least now I can see what's on my screen without there being lots of blood in the way. The dirty paper towels are shoved down the garbage disposal. (I find those the next morning.)
