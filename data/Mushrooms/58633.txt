We walked to the movie store and I returned a movie and I started feeling like I didnt belong in there and so did she. We left and started walking back to my apartments and to my suprise the ground was more vivid. I could see the smaller things more vividly more then the larger and it started waving up and down and side to side, what seemed to be a start of a good time it slowly went downhill. We got into my apartment gates and there was a long stretch of maybe 500 feet or so but it was like walking down a long hallway it looked a mile away. And for some reason I started feeling uncomfortable like everything I did wasnt right and I became slow and partially confused. I knew what was going on but I just felt like I wasnt all there. So we were talking and decided to go to the jacuzzi and sit in there. As were getting dressed we both noticed it took us like 15 minutes to put shorts on. (well in my case).
