I brought crayons and my journal to write in and I was glad I did. I had some intense thoughts about humanity and our existence. I felt a strong feeling of hate towards other humans besides my friends, for how they've fucked the world up.  I felt like shrooms were a tool for humans to use so we could see our wrongdoing and appreciate wildlife like we should.  I remember thinking many other things that I don't remember, but that I wanted to write down but I couldn't because my words were crawling off the page.
