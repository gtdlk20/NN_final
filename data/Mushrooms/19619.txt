Conscience moves on different layers, melts memories with visions, reality and imagination. It's like when you are drunk but ten thousand stronger. Then visions again. Colourful snakes moving in a beautiful pattern. When I open my eyes visions fade away. I understand I'm on holiday in a foreign country, but it reminds me of the travel with my parents when I was a child. I'm having memories of forgotten places, somewhere in the south of Italy, a beach town. Other images concerning circus, fairies, carousels. I think about Fellini and his love for the circus. I understand gypsy life as a possible way of living.
