I bought 15gr. of fresh mushrooms in a smart shop in Breda for 15Â€. As it has been a small 15 years ago (I'm 33 years) since I had shrooms I decided to take a less visual, more of a mind high type of trip. Which is why I chose Philosopher's Stone(s). Also, because I'm a philosophical kind of person and was expecting a lot from a magic mushroom named this way.
