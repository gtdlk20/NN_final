I have never been able to write with any linearity on 'cybin, except on subbs.  This trip was remarkable mostly for its lucidity.  I remained capable of clear, fairly-logical thought, and seemed able to move with more athletic grace than usual, and did not feel fatigue until well into the trip, maybe 6-8 hours after eating 8-10 fresh raw caps.  An altogether more manageable trip than I would expect to have on an equal dose of the usual mushrooms.  Be warned that I also felt more toxic aftereffects than on other 'cybins.  This may be due to their freshness, or to the fact that they were growing in cow dung and I didn't wash them.  I wrote this narration during the trip.
