I decided I wanted to smoke a cigarette so I got out and sat on a picinic table. I lit up a cigarette (smoking feels so good when shrooming). I was enjoying my cigarette until it started melting before my eyes. Not only did it feel like it was melting, but when I would put it to my lips it felt like the filter was dissolving into my lips. Generally I was feeling pretty, um, fungusy! I think my trip started to come down because I was restless and I wanted somewhere to go, but I didn't have anywhere I could go and I didn't feel like driving. I was getting really frustrated and I started getting emotional. I changed out one CD after another. I think that all this stress started to bring my trip down. Finally I decided I was alright to drive and I went home. I quickly slipped in and out of my moms room to tell her I was home. I went to my room and took my clothes off (this may be wierd, but I love being naked when I'm shrooming) and layed on my bed. I think once I started relaxing I could enjoy the end of the trip because I still saw some slight visuals and I looked at myself in the mirror for a long time (I like looking at myself because I have really light blue eyes and when they're dialated as huge as saucers it's trippy). I put lotion all over my body and it felt so good. Then I drifted off into peaceful sleep...
