Its after the peak at this point and my friends want to meet me for a joint. I walk around half an hour back to the lakes and meet them there. I was worried about socialising but found my speech fluent mostly and wasnt very anxious. They seemed worried about me getting back and I thought they were silly. I was absolutely fine to make my way back  I still had battery and google maps if I got lost. They seemed a little annoyed and I realised that everyone was probably worried about me back home because I hadnt been answering my phone and it was getting late. I realised that everyone was probably worried about me back home because I hadnt been answering my phone and it was getting late. They say something like its that time of the year where it gets dark really quickly, which I knew but for some reason that information didnt intersect with my expectations. They seemed a little annoyed and wanted to go in for dinner, so I told them to cycle ahead. I immediately followed my tracks back home, leaving the lake and re-entering the woods. I thought about the state of my friendship group and started getting really worried about peoples opinions of me, and got self-conscious about mistakes I may have been making without realising.
