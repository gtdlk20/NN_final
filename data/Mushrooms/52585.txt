I can't endorse the company enough. I sent them my order in the middle of the week, and I received my package 12 days later (including weekends). Not bad for an international order. (PF is in the US, I'm in Canada) Needless to say, although buying spores is perfectly legal in Canada and most US states, none of this was done in my name. (But that's just common sense.) BTW, I did this in October 1994, and many others have ordered since then, so the company is still active. [still going - July 95]
