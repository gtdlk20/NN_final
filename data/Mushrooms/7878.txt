After letting cooling it down, I drank the tea and was surprised by the good taste. Salvia and Rosemary  and even the purple color (from the spores) would have qualified it for a serious trendy drink! I thought that I had already passed the being agitated phase (where I usually feel uneasy and unbalanced) and would go straight into the being relaxed phase - but that was a misconception. It was the same three stages of: 1) being agitated / 2) being insightful / 3) being relaxed.
