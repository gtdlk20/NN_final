I have found the last two times that i have used mushrooms (less than 2 grams of penis envy mushrooms) that i have had an eye opening spiritual experience.  I discovered a lot about myself, and I learned a lot about the world around me this past weekend.  To me, using psychoactives is a very rich spiritual journey.  I have had scary trips too, but in the balance of the universe, there is no positive without negative.  I want anyone who reads  this to be very careful and extremely responsible when using drugs of any kind, Take care of yourselves, and thank whatever God you pray to for these wonderful gifts he/she has given us. Oh, and don't think too hard or you'll have a crappy trip.
