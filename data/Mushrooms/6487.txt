I got half way through my cup before I felt it starting to come on strong, so I put the rest aside. The young dude started acting kind of agitated and soon said he was leaving. The rest of us went and sat down in the lounge-room to try and relax, I think someone turned the TV on to try and return to some semblance of reality. The peak was mindblowing, harder than any mushroom peak I had experienced before or since, it literally felt like I was being propelled by a rocket into hyperspace. I was trying to grasp onto the carpet to try and prevent myself from physically launching into orbit. I remember there was some banter regarding the young dude, on his first mushroom trip, who had consumed more than all of us and was currently wandering the streets.
