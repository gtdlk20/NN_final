At 13h40, I felt tired but not enough to fall asleep. I took a bath for about fifteen minutes. My closed eye visuals were intensifying with each minute. My body is beginning to feel hot and clammy. When I got out of my bath, I started to watch My Neighbor Totoro. To my surprise, I had a great deal of mental clarity. While my opened eye visuals were not too intense, all my colors we richer. When the credits were rolling, I smoked a bowl and then went for a drive.
