It opened up my eyes, that life isn't as perfect as it seems to be. I see the unfairness, of how some people work their whole lives to achieve something, that a person like Bill Gates can get within a day's work. It also made me realize that there are no bad people in this world. There are only those who were taught wrong, and chose to follow that path because they don't know any other. They were never taught it and are stuck with that. Look at criminals, they didn't just up one day and say hey I think I'll start killing people today. It's the experiences in their life that led them to believe that killing is right.
