I began to feel happier, and decided light was the only link to keeping me happy, and that I would not be safe with the lights off. I danced and reached for the ceiling which seemed closer than it has ever before, and began to be happy. My hearing became extremely amplified, and I could hear things with very little trouble. I switched from the preselected trip music to the radio, and turned the volume down to the lowest setting. The sounds became too loud to tolerate, and I held the earphones in my hand like a Buddha. I began to pace back and forth in the light, and made the most enlightening realization, at least to myself, 'everything has purpose and everything has power', and exactly in that order. Uttering this pleased me and made me feel very happy.
