I meet up with A and Z downtown, we follow Z to the house of the guy who's hooking us up.  This guy was real chill, we sit in his living room and get stoned; he pulls out a book and starts telling us about the particular variety he had (hand picked).  At this point he recommends making a tea with this particular mushroom, I protest that I'd rather just 'crunch em, fuck the taste'.  he takes us into his basement where he pulls out these stuffed ziplock sandwich bags (supposedly it was an 8th, but I'd never seen a shroom bag this big), and hands them to us; I note uppon inspection that the gods flesh contained within was in perfect condition, this guy really cared about what he does.  These were also a totally different varity than mushrooms I'd had before; I'd only tried quarter-sized fat caps with short stems before, these had a long stem made up of a cross shape that got fatter towards the cap which was no bigger than a dime.
