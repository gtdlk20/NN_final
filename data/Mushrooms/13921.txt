Soon after this warping effect of sounds and severe color distortion set in, my girlfriend stood up suddenly, finding a rainbow shaded blanket and put it around her. She began to dance around the living room smiling. At first I was angry that she was fucking with me THIS bad, but soon was mesmerized by the magnitude of the situation. EVERYTHING was significant and I lost grasp of reality. I began to believe that I had tripped myself into an alternate reality, and that M dancing around in a rainbow cape wasnÂ’t actually occurring in the real world and that in actuality I was laying on B's couch curled in a ball.  These ideas were shut off as I saw the blanket being wrapped around my body and face. My sense of sight seemed to transfer its energy to my hearing, as suddenly I could see words. That is right, I could see them. They floated around the color red and twisted themselves into my ears reverberating and echoing until all sound was complete babble.
