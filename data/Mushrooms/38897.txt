A few hours into the shrooming, I started to not enjoy my experience any more. The mushrooms were very fresh and potent, Scott told me before-hand. And boy were they ever. I was flipping my ghord. I saw amazing shapes, colors, visuals, and my mind felt as if it tapped into some sacred quantum realm of reality. I felt as if I was traveling into deep space, kind of like 2001: A Space Odyssey, but something much more personal. Drugs are a very personal experience, even though your friends may be right there. You made a personal decision to do this or that drug, and only you alone can cope with/survive the consequences. I find this is the best but also the worst thing about drugs. It can feel like the top of Mt. Everest, but coming down can feel like the depths of despair and gloom. This is the main reason that I personally cut down my use of substances to an almost non-existant level.
