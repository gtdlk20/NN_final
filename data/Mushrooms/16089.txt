We arrived back home and stopped to pick up my friends car. I got out of the car to piss and realized I was having some crazy visuals. Patterns of tree leaves swaying, the road stretching and melting etc. We decided we needed a little bud to chill out so we called up our friend. We drove a few blocks to his house and he threw us a gram out of his window it was pretty funny.
