I went in the bathroom to be alone and away from everyone because thats all I wanted at the time. I went in the bathroom to be alone and away from everyone because thats all I wanted at the time. I still thought people were looking at me because I thought there were cameras in the bathroom. I stared in the mirror and my face began to turn into satan and it started talking to me. I have no idea what it said though. I started waving my hand around and it had these beautiful colorful trails on it. The whole world was lagging. I went back out into the restaurant and there was this family eating food. Heres the fucked up thing. I dont know if they were just in their halloween costumes or if they were just seriously scary looking fom the shrooms. One woman looked like a giant hulking beast and was shoveling tacos into her mouth by the dozen. I kept staring at her and she kept giving my this really dirty look. I would look at the walls and they were just changing colors and there were crazy patterns on them all. We left taco bell.
