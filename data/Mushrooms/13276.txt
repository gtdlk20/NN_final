This was the first time I consciously realized that I was having closed-eye visuals.  I was probably having them before this point (which was only 90-100 minutes into the trip), but I still donÂ’t really recall what happened when my eyes were closed.  These CEV were blue and green lightning bolts (or something similar) and they seemed to criss-cross over and over, creating an infinite pattern of continually striking lightening bolts.
