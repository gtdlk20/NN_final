I kept looking over at the couch to stare at the patterns on the couch. Were they moving...? I couldn't tell... I wasn't sure if the mushrooms were already working or if I was just really stoned or if I was psyching myself out in anticipation of the trip. I started to feel all numb and silly and I started at laughing at things that weren't really funny. I also started shivering... For some reason I always get really cold right before I start tripping on shrooms or ecstacy. About 15 minutes after drinking the tea, I was rolling around on the couch, not sure what to do with myself. I was a nervous wreck! Confusion set in quite heavily and my brain was racing. The walls turned pink and these green wormy-looking things were dancing around.. The room was growing and shrinking but I couldn't concentrate on any one thing for too long. Some other guys who were there (who were not shrooming, just stoned) were watching Swan Lake on tv. The colors and all the dancers moving in unison were just too much to look at. The music was also affecting me. When the music would climax dramatically, my hallucinations went right along with the music. At one point, I went to explore the bedroom but left when nothing really caught my interest. As I walked back out into the living room, I must've entered at a dramatic point in Swan Lake because the music swelled in a threatening manner. It was very frightening and I ducked, covering my head and looking around nervously. Apparently, everyone in the living room found this rather amusing because they all started laughing at me.
