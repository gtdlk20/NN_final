Its kinda hard to put into words the experience of going through an ego death type experience. I like a quote that I found. Its like being lost on a boat in the ocean. Then ocean starts to slowly disappear. Then the boat disappears. Then you disappear. I slowly started to forget and detach from my sense of self. It felt like insanity. I literally felt like I was dying. My heart was beating out of my chest. I had that sense of impending doom they talk about. This was no joke. This wasnt just some ego loss but a full on physical feeling death. As was laying there on the verge of a panic attack I somehow remembered some of the advise I read online. The only way through this is to just accept it, if I try to fight it and I cant let go it will only get worse and worse It was absolutely terrifying but I was finally able let go. Time started slowing down and stretching out like my final moments were lasting an eternity. And then I died.
