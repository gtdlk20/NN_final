We didn't speak much except for the odd change of music when someone didn't like much the song, and I just simply 'next' it as the list is pretty good. At 2.45 some of us had some pasta, chocolate and apples. The playlist had finished and I played it again with less volume, to continue the trip and slowly ground. We ended up drifting into sleep and waking up around 5 am to go properly to bed. Woke up a few hours later and had a good breakfast and a walk; felt really happy and so did all my friends.
