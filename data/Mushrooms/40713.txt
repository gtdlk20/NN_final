So now that you know I am no lightweight, let me proceed with this insanity.  A friend of mine earlier in the year gave me about 18g as a Christmas present thinking, like me, that shrooms may be a good warm-up before I go running off to the jungle and spending thousands of dollars.  I took 1.7g and nothing happened.  I had heard quotes from Terence Mckenna saying that the problem isn't in taking too much but, too little.  He suggests 5g.  I figured at 6'2' and 240 lbs. I'd better take 6g but in my next two sessions I took 8g instead.
