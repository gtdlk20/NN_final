I giggle, and play tricks on a friend sitting next to me, I whisper his name, and I see him looking around and then laughing thinking its the shrooms, I do it again a couple of times untill he notices its me. It was pretty fun. Then the song that would be the theme for the whole night in the end. 'Atom Heart Mother' I explored my mind, my most deepest thoughts, I began to feel as if I wasn't me, and we lived life as something completely different than human beings.
