Back in the house, the living room looked like a jungle. Vines and flowers and leaves were growing like crazy from every angle! The tables and chairs looked like trees and the whole room emitted this tropical orange glow. It was insane... I felt like I was going insane because my mind was still racing. Things were just going by so fast, I almost couldn't handle it. So I took refuge in the kitchen and found a wonderful companion...my friend's dog. She had this positive energy all around her and her warmth and friendliness instantly eased my discomfort. I spent a long while petting her and tripping out on her fur. I even started crawling around on my hands and knees, following her around. Eventually I lost track of her and got really sad. I was gonna miss her...
