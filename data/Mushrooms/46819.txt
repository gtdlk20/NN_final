After setting up our tent and dining on some grilled steaks, James and I decided to munch on the shrooms. It was getting late, I'm not sure what time, but as the sun set we munched on the caps and within minutes the whole island was completely enveloped in darkness. The mushrooms hadn't kicked in yet so we knew we had some time to get our storm lamp lit. Unfortunately, the winds coming off the ocean were so strong the flame refused to remain. We didn't have a flashlight either. We were still buzzing with the overwhelming isolation of the place that we didn't care. We held hands and let the night begin.
