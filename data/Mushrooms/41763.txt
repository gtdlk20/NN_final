Some months ago, three at least, I was given a small pakage of dried mushrooms by a dear friend of mine which, when weighed on a crude, home built affair, came in at just about 1.3-1.4g. This packet sat in a box, just waiting for me to find the proper time to consume it's contents or, rather, that is what it did up until midnight on new year's eve, 2005->2006.
