After returning to my warm, friendly chair and reveling in the wonderful music and sounds and colors for some time, my persistent smile began to give me a slight headache.  I felt like there was a cross drawn on my forehead and two little accent lines on my temples, illustrating where the pain was beginning.  Something like this: <  +  > across my forehead.  It was minor though, and I didnt let it bother me.  At some point a thought entered my mind: 'Im tripping.  This is like when I was on acid.  I hate tripping.'  I couldnt ignore this.  Until then I had been thinking about how in control I was feeling and how much I was convinced that I wasnt tripping.  I realized I wasnt at all in control and that I was tripping harder than I had before, completely unbeknownst to me.  I pulled myself together.  I stopped seeing patterns and sparkles and cages that werent there and I focused on the concrete things that I was sure I knew.  'Maps do not flap without any breeze, India does not crawl across globes, bookcases do not bend and pictures do not change colors.'
