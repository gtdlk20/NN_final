2:30pm Â– I meditate, then talk to my friend Z, whom I consider an urban shaman to some degree. Speaking with him about the spirit world helped me accept what had just happened to me.  I smoked a bowl of very good marijuana to help me control the trip a bit, as McKenna has suggested in his lectures. I feel apologetic to the mushroom. After the experience with the voice, I was admittedly afraid to continue the trip.  But I can't stress this enough, the voice was NOT from my trip! I'm convinced that I either heard a spirit, or I'm schizophrenic.
