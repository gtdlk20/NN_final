I cannot explain why this happened, but it did.  I have heard bad stories of the past of that pub, that it used to be a drug and gun running pub, and that in the 70's there were blood-baths there between the bike gangs, that people were murdered, etc etc.  I don't know if these stories are true, but my mother couldn't believe it when I told her that it was my local.  Maybe there's bad karma there, maybe not, but I only found out about the places history AFTER this trip anyhow.
