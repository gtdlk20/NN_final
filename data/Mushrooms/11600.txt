We ate them at 1:17 a.m., on top of Cocoa Krispie treats, which the guy provided (which was awesome, they are perfect for balancing the taste and almost covering it up.  Mushrooms don't taste great dried, and this was the first time I ever had them wet.  They are even less tasty wet. But the krispie treats...best thing to dull the taste!)
