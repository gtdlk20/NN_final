Jam was playing and I remember looking at my shadow and dancing using him as a guide. In fact, ever since I'd started walking, I'd been having fun moving my legs in rhythmic patterns. I had been doing a dancer's walk across the entire park. I had to stop my little dance very quickly though because the nausea returned. I reminded myself that I'd had no experience dancing or even moving around on psylocibin before, so I should avoid sudden movements. I had walked to another table and remembered that I wanted to lay down on it to watch the stars and listen to music, but just then I got a call from my mother.
