My thought pattern was very fast, almost instinctive. There was no need for words. Forming words was too slow. I was just following a rapid succession of thought-clusters or impressions complete by themselves on various subjects such as medicine, art, relationship with my loved ones, etc. Just trying to write down some impression, the act of writing, those beautiful and gracious patterns, different hues of the ink on the paper, beauty and meaning of the words made me think that writing was a form of art or miracle.
