After this incredibly delightful experience, we walked out on the balcony overlooking the yard.  It was winter and a fresh blanket of 2 inches of powder had fallen the night before.  The cold seemed to return us to a measure of sobriety as we could not understand why the world outside wasn't nearly as fucked up as the inside of the house seemed to be.  The snow was fascinating.  It looked so uniform, so comfortable, and the feeling in our mouths was that of pure joy.  We quickly retreated inside and W and I split up.
