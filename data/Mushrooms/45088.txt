Then I'm sitting in the car with some friends and while I'm completely hung up on this crazy body trip I look at the time and I cant tell what time it is. The clock looks as if it were in chinese. I began to get excited and then I began to laugh uncontrollably about nothing and it felt so good.  Then me and my best friend are riding in the bed of a truck, and thats when I really started to trip. I was looking up at the sky as the wind blew through my hair making it feel as if it were straw, but I didnt care so I just let it go.
