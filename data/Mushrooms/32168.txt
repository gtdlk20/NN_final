We laid out our towels and sat in the shade that the surrounding trees provided us. This area was almost dream-like. The grassy paths all around us seemed to go on forever, the trees seemed to reaching towards the heavens and the variety of colors that the flowers provided brightened the area even more.

The first shape was a ferocious dragon, fire gushing forth from its mouth, but it soon became a peaceful baby dragon resting just as I was. The clouds continued to change for a while as we all rested in silence.
