In a similar fashion to how I approached the forest, I left it, walking back through the deserted festival grounds.  It was about this time that one previously-ignored fact occurred to me:  I was thoroughly wet.  Although my mostly-waterproof wool cloak had kept parts of me mostly-dry, the majority of my clothing was soaked through.  I decided to head to the pub-tent set up on the grounds near the campground entrance, where the diehard Festies who were staying to the next day were busy bantering and drinking.  While my sopping condition seemed to raise a few eyebrows, I was mostly left to my own devices.  I recognized my friends there still, and I grasped what they were saying and was able to respond appropriately, but I felt like I was removed from them.  I still felt like I was in a spiritual plane next-door to our physical one, and that this ability to talk to my fellow humans was highly unusual.  It was possible, but it felt very wrong.  I didn't say a whole lot about my journey to them that night, but it was obvious from the few things I did say that they didn't comprehend a word of it or why it was important to me.  I left them after only a few minutes, and went back to my tent.
