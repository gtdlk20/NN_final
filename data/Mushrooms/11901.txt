I am attending college and my day started normally, classes, lunch, and a return to my fraternity for the rest of the day.  It was around eight o'clock in the evening when a member of my fraternity approached me and offered to sell me 1/8 of shrooms.  I acqueiesed and convinced my friend, R, to buy some of his own.  Roughly ten people in my house bought and consumed an eighth of mushrooms each.  R and myself ate the shrooms at roughly 8:30pm ignoring the fact that it was a Wednesday and we had classes tomorrow.  For an hour there were no affects.  I figured I'd been robbed, but I decided to give it time and go visit my friend who was strumming his guitar in his room.
