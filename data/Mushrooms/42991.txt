Thirty minutes after ingestion, both of us still felt nothing and we concluded that we hadnt taken enough. After sixty minutes there was still nothing. I tried my hardest to convince myself I was off baseline, but knew I wasnt feeling anything more than placebo effects. Eventually we just grew tired; Zulian went home and Peter went to sleep on my couch. As I lied in bed, I still stayed awake for a short period of time, still filled with traces of anticipation in undying hopes that the drug might yet still sneak up on me, but to no avail.
