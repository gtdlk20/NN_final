Not very profound but astoundingly fun was another perfect example of inside out. I was gesticulating with a black and mild and I noticed that when held up to the sky it was monotone, however when down against the ground you could see the little white filter. Up: theres only contrast down: when theres no contrast! and Down: theres only contrast up: when theres no contrast!
