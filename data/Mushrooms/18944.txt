Around 4 am, the three of us went out into the living room where we smoked more weed and sat down, subjecting each other to our drug-induced thoughts. I was STILL tripping a little..I watched the doors grow big and then small. I watched the walls breathe and the textures on the ceiling spin and change colors. Even when I closed my eyes, I couldn't escape from the hallucinations. Intricate patterns formed behind my eyelids until I grew bored and prayed I would fall asleep soon. Finally around 5 or 6 am, the weed was putting us to sleep and my boyfriend and I retired to the bedroom where we slept until noon.
