Then I turned away from her and looked to the tree.  Again, like with the stars, I became rapt with some odd power that overtook my entire body.  It screamed into me and I stared at this tree as it froze with a solid sheet of ice over it and then turned into a face of an old man, quite like the stereotypical god image with the beard and heavy brow.  We communicated for a while through our minds and expressions and then he turned into man, many faces.  They were all staring at me when one of them looked at me as though I had stepped on its toes.  I turned and ran away.  Not remembering this I had in that time thrown the car keys at my friends because they were cold and needed to get warm. That was about the only rational thought that anyone had all night.  They were now sitting in the car and I approached it with an intriguing curiosity.  I passed the car and looked again to the sky.  It spoke to me.  When I finally did approach the car I opted for the passenger side as my best friend was in the drivers seat and his goofy faces and hysterically fast moving manner was pissing me off.
