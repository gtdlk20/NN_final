Gratitude - I realized how amazing this human system is. Specifically, that its not easy to fuck it up. I can tense up, change how I breathe, and in advanced situations, more physiologically surprising changes can occur. But I cant kill myself by imagining it - the mind has amazing control, but not full admin rights to wipe the hard-drive. This was an actual fear of mine. SO a new concept I have for myself is levels of admin rights to our physiology - I can ask for more, with practice. But I cant reverse peristalsis with mind alone, and if I could, through practice, probably Id have no desire to while tripping (just like I had no desire to drown myself).
