Next thing I knew I was stood in front of the bathroom mirror screaming at my self and laughing uncontrollably as my face morphed into that of an old man, then back to a young child. I clambered into the bath and lay there for a few moments. Suddenly I became intensely paranoid that my sister would soon be home any minute. I was a gibbering wreck, in no fit state to deal with my sister! I asked S the time and he informed me it was about 2:30. A entered the bathroom and she immediately enquired as to why I had a trickle of blood running from my nose, to which I had no reply and I still have no idea where it came from. Again  I asked the time, about 30 seconds after I had last asked. I had no concept of time, and for the next hour or so I was asking my friends every few minutes what the time was. I was becomingly increasingly distressed and at one point I punched S in face, which was a bad idea considering he is 66 and about 19 stone! Thankfully S realised that the shrooms had fucked me up and I couldnt control myself, so he didnt retaliate or hit me back. I am so relived to this day that I had such understanding friends, because with the wrong bunch of people things would have gotten very ugly.
