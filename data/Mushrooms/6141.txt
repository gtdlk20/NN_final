I then came to the realisation that what had just happened was a Spiritual Revelation. A Spirtual Journey of looking into and learning from ones self w/ the vehicle being a natural entheogen. I was still a little troubled though, because as I mentioned I watched myself disperse, fearing that maybe I had lost part of myself.  This feeling would soon dissipate over the next few days as I realised that my spirtual side had reentered without my physical self knowing. I know this because since then my spirituality has grown tremendously going forward from that experience.
