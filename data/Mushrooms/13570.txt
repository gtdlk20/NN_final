Then we came upon graffiti on the bridges and stone walls. My girlfriend looked at the art and it spoke to her. She marveled at the movement she saw and the underlying implications. I looked at the same art and felt the ability to make it move; I felt that I could let myself get lost in the graffiti and see it surprise me, but I didn't want to because I felt that that was a waste of this power I had. I felt that I had an especially visceral sensitivity to my surroundings, but I didn't want to waste this sensitivity on some paint and a brick wall. I wanted to see and feel the energy of nature: mountains and trees.
