Then my mind went even further and I started babbling about how I thought we were like two continents, or tectonic plates. I thought his dick inside me was like the shelf of a continent rubbing against another one, and I believed this was how earthquakes happened... That the two of us made a planet together. It was fucking nuts, like I said. He couldnt follow me in this revelation, and thats when he saw that I was peaking. His was beginning to wear off (or so we thought at the time). So after I finally let him see my face again, and had stopped crying, we laid there a moment. We looked at the clock.. and wow. We had sex, non-stop, with a fluent and not-at-all breathless conversation the entire time for more than an hour. When I say non-stop, I mean that neither of us came or took a one-minute break to catch our breaths. We had sex for an hour. We kept rhythm to the music and the waving air in my room for a straight fucking hour. And neither of us complained about being sore.
