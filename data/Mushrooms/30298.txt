9:50  I walk up the trail to find my friends but find myself alone as one of them has left the woods and the other has only journeyed deeper to find himself. At this point I am somewhat nervous. I have never eaten this many shrooms, and still upset from what just happened, and the trip is really starting to kick in. plus, Im alone in the woods and its dark. The stars begin warping and the moon is changing colors rapidly, and all around me the earth is breathing as if to tell me it is just as much a living soul as I. The negative energy starts to effect the visuals, and a tree about 200 feet up the path starts rolling towards me with furious speed. Never had visuals like that before. I decide to walk back to the house and join a friend who is tripping there alone. He also hasnt eaten shrooms before.
