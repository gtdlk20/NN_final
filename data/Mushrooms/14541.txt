I quickly left the room and went back outside to where my friends were. When I came outside the rest of my friends were definately feeling the effects. The other kid who ate the eigth was seeing some crazy stuff, I don't remember what exactly. Anyway, sitting there in my chair, I looked around, at the fence, at the grass, at the house, all of which started to move and sway much similar to the mushroom I had seen earlier on the computer. Again, I attempted to light a cigarette, and again it broke. I gave up right away on that. At this time my mind was going insane, I started to talk and mumble. I tried to explain to my friends what I was seeing but they were all getting annoyed at me. So I sat there quietly. That's when things went bad, very fast.
