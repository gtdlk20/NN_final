I do remember my mind was in a way 'racing', like I had ADHD or something. Perhaps this was due to the medicine's ability to remove a sense of time from my consciousness, but it seemed like I would have a thought - deep realization, an intense focus on something or someone, or an idea, picture, feeling, or color - and it would give way fully to another totally different one, again and again.  And my brain was unable to keep focus on an object for too long.  It was like watching tv while your friend flips channels excessively. Not that this bothered me that much.
