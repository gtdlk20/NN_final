I put the dried mushrooms in a tea bag, letting it steep for a good 10mins in a mug of hot water paired with a bag of ginger and lemon tea.  After drinking, I steeped it again for another 10mins with the warm water left in the kettle from the first boil.  Pretty simple but it made a huge difference for me.  Very little nausea and no noticeable loss in potency.
