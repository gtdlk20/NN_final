A hand crawled up my back and came to rest on my cheek. The mystery hand belonged to a mystery arm, which in turn belonged to...an angel. A beautiful angel dressed in white garments. An angel with long, flowing dirty-blonde hair and facial features that were distinct and strong. An angel I was sure I must have been hallucinating, but wasn't. We looked each other in the eye, and our souls embraced.
