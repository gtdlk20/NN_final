I stared in the mirror for a long time (for one I always trip on how my eyes look when I'm shrooming) and then started dancing around my room. I was dancing in the most fluid fashion, simply letting my body flow. I felt unrestrained, I felt that I was letting my spirit free from being bound down so long. I had also lit incense all around and the smoke was totally tripping me out. I could see it hovering just at eye level with me, it was an extremely cool visual. One startling experience, as 'The Fungus Among Us' CD came to an end, my three disc changer went on to the next disc. An unusual noise, a noise that surprised me, yet excited me started, and an unfamiliar CD started to play, but the words and the music sounded so beautiful, I could definately relate. This might sound corny, but the next day I discovered I had been listening to the Stroke 9 'Nasty Little Thoughts' CD. This might sound cheesy to some, but trust me, I had a totally religious experience over it.
