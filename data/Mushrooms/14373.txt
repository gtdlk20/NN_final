In between we talk and share of course but this is so intense we just go to place after place. I find myself walking downhill a beautiful meadow. Colors are so bright and full its amazing. I have no language but I feel like everything is in a communicating state I am everything, I feel everything, its like before time, maybe how animals experience the world. Truly beautiful and harmonious. I am everything, I feel everything, its like before time, maybe how animals experience the world. Truly beautiful and harmonious.
