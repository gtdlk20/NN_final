We return and I watch as my friends jump across the rocks trying not to fall. The mushroom tells me to take the time to undo my shoes and wade into the shallow water. I call out to my friends what and why I am doing this. As I am undoing my last boot the other falls into the water. I take it all back! I call out my friends and myself all laugh even if it was at me. After I cross I collect my notebook and a pencil and start writing answers to questions I had had. I see my four other friends knee deep in the surrounding lake, I wonder why they arent doing anything. They are playing music on a speaker. I walk towards them tapping my pencil. Asking and joking with the mushroom until I reach the end of the rock and come across the water. At this point the question Is there anything else out there Was just answered with the most hilarious and obvious answer. The mushroom refers here to my past research into DMT. After this Im laughing and I hear the song my friend Jim had composed and recorded himself (Very Tame Impala inspired).
