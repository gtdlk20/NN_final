Soon a new phase of the trip began. We could actually talk again and the most amazing realisation came to us. The main points were that people are sad and unhappy because they are so caught up in their petty problems and trying to outdo everyone else. The point to life is to give, unconditionally, and increase the overall good. One never has to be afraid, ever, because death is all around us and it's not bad or evil. If one thinks of oneself as ships on a vast ocean. The ocean is universal energy and life. When we die all that occurs is that the ship fills with the water, the universal life, and we are absorbed into it. In dying we are transferred into the universal sea of energy. This one realisation has removed my fear of death almost entirely.
