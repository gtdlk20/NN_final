I had never been to a reggae fest before, but i was excited to go and even more exited about the probability that we would find some mushrooms there. Mushrooms were my favorite thing in the world and it was so few and far between that I got to take some. I had priorly only eaten mushrooms three times before that and it was in fairly small amounts. (Less than a half of an eighth.) But I had taken a large dose of acid prior to that. (Seven or eight hits at once) I had never experienced a 'bad trip' before than either.
