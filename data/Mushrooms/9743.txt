I then got up and went to the toilet with K and we just started talking and laughing and being happy and telling each other how beautiful we were. And I looked in the mirror and saw myself, and it was the strangest thing ever, it was like it wasn't me. I felt I was someone else looking at me. Then L came up and K and myself started talking to her and we shared such powerful moments together about what L was going through. We laughed, cried and reassured each other, and I can honestly say, this experience has created a bond amongst all 5 of us that is extremely powerful. It only cost us 450 Baht each, and it lasted for only 5 hours.
