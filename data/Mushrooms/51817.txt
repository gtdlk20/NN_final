Psilocybe mushrooms do, indeed, have a mind-altering effect when smoked!  Like most folks, I've been told repeatedly (even by Paul Stamets himself) that smoking psilocybes destroys the psychoactive ingredients; however, at the urging of this visitor, who kindly offered his supply, we agreed to try to smoke some.  After placing a small amount of powdered mushroom in a one-hitter that could have been used for smoking MJ, we lit it up and inhaled.
