Some background information about myself: I am 17 years old with no current mental health issues and am in good physical health. About a year ago I was on the verge of losing a battle with depression and suicide but managed to excavate myself from those foul depths in due course. I now consider myself to be in fine enough condition to experiment with psychedelics.
