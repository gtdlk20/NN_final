I finished the week really angry and was convinced that they will lay me off (what turned out to be a misjudgment). I spent the day doing groceries, picking up mail, etc. There was an outdoor goa party only some 5 ks away from my home, it was great weather so my girlfriend and I decided to go to the party by bicycle!
