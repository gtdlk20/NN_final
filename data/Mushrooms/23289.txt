That couch is so darn comfy, and the sun is starting to set. I stick my legs over the couchs arms. My chemistry is being meddled somehow, it feels like Ive shifted upwards but it might be my excitement. I check the lamp, still normal. I glance up at the roof where it splashes a small circle of light and see that its turning? Yes, clockwise, then counter-clockwise, just a little.
