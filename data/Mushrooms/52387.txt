WOW!! Much better. The richness of the colors in nature seemed holy in comparison to manmade objects. The patio furniture by the swimming pool seemed like a nightmare out of a Tim Burton movie. I felt very strongly that their revolting plastic 'fakeness' had no place in this world and was only our pathetic attempt to soothe our misled minds that simply refuse to acknowledge reality as God intended. I felt as if I were part of the spectrum and that the wave surging through me was now frequencies of color, and I was a part of them. I imagined that if I cocentrated my will, I could simply point to the pool chairs and burn them from existence.
