In October of 2012 I came across the opportunity to take 5 dried grams of psilocybe cubensis, the more commonly used variety of magic mushrooms.  It is now one year later and I feel it important to document my experience for my own reflection on this life changing event. Entheogens are organic hallucinogenic myconids and plants with the capacity to change our value systems and perspective on reality. They possess the capacity to take anyone with the right state of mind onto altered states and higher levels of consciousness, if only for a limited time. These plants are considered by many experts, such as the late Terence McKenna, to be alive and conscious, direct representatives of the plant and myconid kingdoms to the human element of the overall One consciousness.
