Anyway, it had been a while since my last trip, probably about a month I guess, and I thought a little solo tripping session might do me good. So one fine saturday in April I went off to the city to buy some mushrooms in my regular smartshop. I spent some time talking to a smartshop employee while enjoying some MJ, and I talked about how I never really got to a good trip-level on a single smartshop dosage (30 grams fresh cubensis) and therefore often had to buy 2 to get off right which meant paying twice as much of course. The guy from the smartshop was sympathetic to my situation and helped me out. He added a few extra stems and caps to my portion of shroomies without charging (or weighing) it. I thanked him and went home with about, oh I'd say about 50 grams of fresh cubes.
