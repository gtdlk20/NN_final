I keep thinking I see a huge swarm of police officers coming towards me, and then they rise up in into the sky and float away. At around now I experience the peak of the trip, and lose all concept of my body or where I am again. I feel my mind traveling all over the place at high speeds, being absolutely assaulted by the music and taking each sound as a stimulant to push me in several directions. I find myself staring intently at the night sky, with a full moon and clouds undulating. This loss of self brings me immense indescribable pleasure, but something keeps driving me to look down. Each time I distract myself from the perfect open sky I see dancing jesters and knife armed clowns. I lay on the ground and close my eyes, feeling as if I melt or sink into the ground and lose all concept of time and space.
