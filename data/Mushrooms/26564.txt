Amazingly enough, me and 2 friends managed to procure '20 grams' of mushrooms which we decided to consume the following weekend. I say 20 grams loosely because these mushrooms were sold in chocolate chunks, with each containing '2 grams of powdered dried psilocybe cubensis.' Obviously, the dealer took some liberties with his measurements and I suspect from my visuals that they contained about .75-1.25g each. One member of the tripping party ('T') had taken shrooms 3 times before while the other ('B') was a virgin who had first smoked weed only a week earlier.
