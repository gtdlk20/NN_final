One of them, an annoying little pill-munching cokehead who we had attempted to raise from schoolboy-ness into the ways of ganja, shrooms and righteousness but had fucked that all off for chemical class As and had a delusion of being a big time dealer, completely ruined our trip with his unneccessary whinging about how 70 wasnt nearly enough, after the experience we were having on 70 and 50, this fucked with our heads and pissed us off. He also kicked off for no reason when we suggested that they come out to meet us so we could all trip outdoors. We decided that if he was there, being like that then we was no way we were going to meet them. This led to a very dark and depressing 45 minutes of wandering the streets, tripping, trying to squeeze some kind of plan through the psilocybin in our brains.
