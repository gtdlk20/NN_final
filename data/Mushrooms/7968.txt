After a while of this 'B' burst into the caravan; understandably he had come to look for me. It was impossible to tell how long IÂ’d be absent from the group but obviously long enough for him to mount a search. He insisted that I come back into the house; I was surprised both by how sober his words sounded and by how eloquent my response was. I told him I was going to stay in the unlit caravan for a while longer. He was very insistent I join him. We had something of a standoff for a moment; he then accepted my choice to rock back and forth in a dark corner and went back into the warmth and camaraderie of the cottage.
