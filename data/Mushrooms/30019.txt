After that first burst of static (these happen to me every time I eat mushrooms), the sky began to look very beautiful and I looked up as I walked.  I began to run, which felt like flying.  I couldn't feel my legs, but I could run as fast as ever and the wind rushing past my ears was exhilerating.  When I started to lose my breath, I slowed to walk.  I was approaching some irrigators in a corn field and I had to time it and run a bit more so that I wouldn't get sprayed.
