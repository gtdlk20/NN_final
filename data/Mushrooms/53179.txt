Ei then returned from the dead and we trudged onward towards the expanse of ice, with some scary moments when going down a hill which has drifts of up to a foot of snow in parts. We reached the lake, and were mystified by a strange field around us covered in positively alien geometric shapes: triangles, pyramids, circles, octagons. We were also a bit unsure about where the land ended and the ice started, so we erred on the side of caution. Ei flopped into the snow again and we went to explore the mysterious shapes, which turned out to be a miniature golf course. Pretending to be a golf ball and walking around the course was amusing.
