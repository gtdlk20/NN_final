I excuse myself to the bathroom; the nausea is building and I'm thinking that a good purge session might be in order.  Once in the bathroom, though, it doesn't happen.  By this point the whole world is full on 'Waking Life' style, with every object in my vision moving and floating independantly of other objects around it.  I'm get a little worried at this point.  I stay in the bathroom for a little while rolling around on the floor, I didn't know what else to do.  The trip turns inward.
