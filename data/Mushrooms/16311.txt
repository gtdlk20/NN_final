That was before the Hubble telescope came out, but now the images that are returned from that device--one of the greatest built by man--remind me of what I saw. I was looking at a galaxy. It wasn't the Milky Way, but another. I was immediately enthralled. I wanted to see if I could have an effect on what I was seeing, so I reached out with my 'hand' and 'flipped' it through the clouds of gas at the edge of the galaxy. I had to zoom in closer to a cloud of gas, the clouds that stars form from. I watched the birth of about 6 stars that would've formed anyway. My interaction speeded up gravity and I was able to watch the birth of multiple stars from my interaction.
