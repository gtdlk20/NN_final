The next thing that happened was incredibly hard to explain. I thought about myself being born. I lived my life over again through my head and realized all the mistakes I've made. I told M and T what I was feeling,  M completely agreed with me. We all wanted to go upstairs and hug his parents, but thank god we didn't. I realized that my parents love me and I've been giving them the cold shoulder for the past few years, we haven't been honest with each other. I then wanted to know what it was like to be dead, just because of curiosity. I told T and M that I would kill myself in the morning to know what it was like.
