This is when I really started tripping.  The first major change in my perception was the sound.  The only sound in the room was the whir of the ceiling fan.  The sound coming from the fan seemed to be getting louder and louder, and within seconds seemed like it was coming from a loudspeaker positioned right next to my ear.  The sound was so loud it was almost overwhelming.  I started to giggle uncontrollably as I realized how amazing it was that a piece of chocolate was doing this to me.  The sound was still overwhelming my brain, and I couldnt find the consciousness to focus on anything else.  The sound seemed to morph and soon, it resembled a waterfall.  I closed my eyes and tried to turn down the volume of this raging waterfall, but it was no use.  For a second I panicked, wondering if my sense of hearing would be stuck like this forever, but I soon forgot what I was even panicking for.  The mushrooms seemed to be pulling my brain from thought to thought, not allowing me to concentrate on any one perception or idea.  This is about the time the visual hallucinations started.
