Suddenly again I am pulled back to reality, this time I hear my friends saying that we're all mad!!! This infects my brain like mushrooms and touches my inner nerve... I suddenly realize that I am mad, im crazy... I start to laugh uncontrollably, and start saying words that dont make any sense... Until I stop and fall into the couch... my body is telling me that I am tired, and somehow its demands are fulfilled (for 3-4 hours now I have not felt my body I have been outside of it for so long)
