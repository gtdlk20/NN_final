After an hour of ingestion (in which time we had ventured the shops to pick up some chewing gum and some spare clothes for my friend) we were back in the house where we first ingested the mushrooms. Firstly, I remember distinctively the way in which my body felt different. Almost as if gravity was gently pushing and pulling my body this way and that. This was followed by some very pleasant euphoric rushes, which reminded me of those experienced from coming up from ecstasy pills. We all began to feel very humorous, laughing randomly for no reason at all.
