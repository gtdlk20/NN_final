At some point in time I felt the need to void my bowels. There was a rumbling, grumbling going on inside my intestines, and I felt that there was some cleansing to go on there, so I stood up to make my way, a little unsteadily, towards the toilet. Exiting the round room was walking from dim light to full-on darkness. There were no lights on in the hall at all, only a faint ghostly light that seemed to be coming from the end of the hall. Blindly, with open-eye visual static already blurring my vision, I stumbled down the three stairs and felt my way along the wall until I reached the bathroom.
