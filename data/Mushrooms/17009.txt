Upon arrival, I settled my luggage into my friends dorm room and then headed next door to pick up the mushrooms. I met some of his friends and we chatted for a bit, then we all ate the shrooms. We stayed in his neighbours room for a bit, but I began to get uncomfortable with the hosts dominant behaviour (he forbid anybody to speak, as it might ruin his high) and so I left. I got some fresh air and began to feel a little dizzy. I was a little frightened as I did not expect the facial twitches which came a little after the dizziness. I walked back to my friends dorm and he was a little upset because I had left without telling him, and he had been searching the halls for me. I said to him, 'Let's just go relax in your dorm, watch the tube and enjoy the trip' and he replied 'that's all I've wanted to do from the start'.
