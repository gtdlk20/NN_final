I began to think about my mother, our relationship is strained and I normally find it very difficult to think loving thoughts toward her. I was given a gift of realising how a gift I had given her at Christmas was so much more than just a nice dress. I saw that I had made her feel beautiful and lovely and that is where the joy is. That made me want to do more nice things for people.
