I keep trying to escape the pressure of everything, and keep thinking to myself 'I wish I was asleep' or 'I wish is was a bright summer day and I could just lie in a feild' I'm tripped out by the thought of society and culture how we no longer shape them, but rather they shape us, which is a frightening thought to me. The thought that I have to live up to what someone else wants for me is horrible, and I want to escape it, but the mushrooms push keep pushing it back to the forfront of my mind, assaulting me with it, forcing me to accept what's around me. I feel like I want to die for a time.
