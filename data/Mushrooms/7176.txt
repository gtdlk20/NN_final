Fully prepared for whatever those UV rays might throw our way we continued our journey playing in the jungle gym for adults that the canyons provided us with.  Both feeling a bit hungry, we stopped in the theater for a bite to eat.  The setting was a large open partially shaded space where two narrow slot canyons opened up.  We played with echoes and made small talk of conspiracy theories and technology, happiness and depression, and I attempted to gain an understanding where he had come from and what he had gone through in life.  This trip provided me with a better understanding of my own independence and strength.  It is quite nice to be humbled and empowered in the same set of brief moments.  I also gained a better understanding of the workings of Rs mind, which was something I was very much hoping for.
