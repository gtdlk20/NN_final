When I finally snapped out of it, I realized that #2 had climbed into the tree and was just sitting on big branch, straddling it and swinging his legs. He had taken his shirt off, and looked so perfect and natural sitting there, that I referred to him as Nature Boy. Nature Boy was an artist, and he decided to get some pen and paper he went inside. I didnt notice him again until I stood up and walked around a bush to see him sitting in the sunlight doing his thing. I approached him much like I would approach a deer in the woods. I didnt want to disturb his symbiosis with all around him, so I quietly asked for his permission to join him.
