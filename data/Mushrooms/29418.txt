They were stronger than me and keeping me from doing some of the silly god things I wanted to try out. I wanted to look in a mirror and see if I could change my appearance in the mirror, but there was no mirror in the bathroom. I got very mad that I could not make a mirror appear by magic. Honestly I think it would have helped to see how awful I looked.
