Colors looked like something out of a blacklight poster and had incredible vibrancy. Then fear and paranoia took over. I started to get panicky and I tried really hard to relax cause I knew that only I could beat the bad trip. I walked around the apartment and a huge MU tiger that was on the wall started to pop out like it was a hologram and started to bite at me like Pac Man as I walked by it. One friend came in and talked to me and I told him what I was on. He laughed and told me to come back to the other apartment so everyone knew why I was acting weird.
