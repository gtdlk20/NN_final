A Claritin-D Claritin/pseudoephredrine-like speedy feeling set quickly at 11:50 (T+0:15), just like last time but a little earlier.  I think this contributed to the anxiety I felt -- anxiety over what the coming hours would bring!  It was identical to the feeling you have when you're agonizing on whether to ask someone out on a date.  However I felt no nausea or other ill effects.  My girlfriend wanted to go shopping; I welcomed this but I wanted the effects to set in in familar surroundings, so I procrastinated and suggested we wait. By 12:25 (T+0:50) I was starting to see some subtle liquidity in the ceiling and I felt some gentle disassociation. At 12:50 (T+1:15) I had predicted that I would be nearing the peak, but the effects had only intensified slightly by this time.  I was thinking, prematurely, that might end up being a weak trip. I agreed that we could now go to the store.
