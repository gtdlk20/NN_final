This was pretty spontaneous.  I've always felt much happier planning out my trips.  I like to make sure I'll be in a place where I won't hurt myself or have any reason to talk to law enforcement.  (I think cops are doing important jobs.  I don't think of what I do as a crime - so it would be a shame to waste resources like that.  Also, bad vibes, me being scared shitless, etc.  Just would rather not.)  The setting we were in was rural/suburban - we walked on a busy main road, populated with houses on either side.  I was looking for a field or a park to relax and be comfortable in.  As we walked on, I felt familiar vibrations in my limbs, and a change in my vision - more contrast, slightly brighter, slightly blurrier.
