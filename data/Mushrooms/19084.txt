Pete was as experienced as me with the use of psilocybin, although he hadn't experimented with other psychedelics as much. I trusted he would remain one of the most stable members of the group, although I had never tripped with him to such an extreme before. Andrew was an old friend, who although had only turned on to drugs in the recent past, had already seen his share of strange shit. Most of all, I considered him a reliable companion, but I was somewhat concerned for him knowing that mushrooms had often made him quite ill. Bryan was a character whom I didn't know too well, but who seemed to be a good guy judging from my previous experience. He had also not been into drugs for too long, but had apparently established a reputation as a pothead at his school. Being a massive rugby player with a promising career in front of him, I liked having Bryan there in case Phil got out of control, but I only hoped that we wouldn't have to control Bryan.
