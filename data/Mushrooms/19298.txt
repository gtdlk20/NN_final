We talked for awhile but the words seem to dance and echo around in the room before I could hear or see them. At one point, I didnt know if I saw the words or heard them! That has also never happened to me before. Sometimes I couldnt hear at all. I also remember that the music seemed to be coming from somewhere VERY far away. I sat next to the speakers but the sound didnt come from them, I was sure.
