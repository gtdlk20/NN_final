I think of the peak as 'The Download'. I was hurtling through worlds and landscapes of information. Two three dimensional shadows hung in the air in the air in front of then beside me. Initially it was overwhelmingly rapid, and I felt concern about freaking out. I relinquished my fear and relaxed into it passively letting them pour the information into my head. By doing so the CEVs melted through and into me, becoming a 360-degree experience in which I was enmeshed with what I perceived. The clear light circled and arched around the edges of everything. I can recall with clarity a scroll rolled down by two 'Greys', an absurd mix of ancient and futuristic connotations. Along with the ideas in the Pinchbeck book, the new laptop, with its CD burner, Amy had just bought, definitely influenced the theme of downloaded information.
