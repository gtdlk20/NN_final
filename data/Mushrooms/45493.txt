We got to my place at around 11 and my parents were out for the night which was definitely a good thing. J and I ate roughly half the bag each while K ate one small stem and cap. It would have been a smart idea to consider the amount we were eating because J and I had only eaten 2.5 grams in the past. K found it very hard to eat his share so we ground it up and he ate it in pudding.
