T+2.5hrs I have now noticed that my voice does not sound like my voice, at least not as I know it. This thought is very new to me, and slightly troubling. I contemplate why I sound the way I do, and I don't I hear it like this all the time? Is this the way I sound to others? I don't neccesarily enjoy the sound of my voice all too much, and can't see why other people would. I contiously make an effort from this point in not to talk for most of the night, not wanting to the here the foriegn sound of my own voice any longer, though I do end up talking quite abit later on.
