Keep breathing. Focus on the breath of life. I call out in the darkness. Lisa are you there? Silence in the darkness of nevermore. I hold my breath. Keep breathing? I am fragment walking in the desert of solitude. Watching the waves above me. Waves waves waves. Fear is the mother of endless darkness. I taste the metal in the mouth of the universe. Interrogation of the one name in space, interstitial space touching the relentless void of silence.
