When we got home I was talking about drying them to save for off-season, but in being care-free and flush full of bravado we decided to cook them all up into one big brew. We crammed them in a pot then poured water boiled from the kettle and poured it over them, letting them steep for twenty minutes before serving. We poured a cup each of the thick, inky, blue glug and mixed it with spoonfuls of coffee and sugar. After we had arrived home someone I knew, a kid two years younger than me, had arrived and was really interewsted in trying the mushrooms.
