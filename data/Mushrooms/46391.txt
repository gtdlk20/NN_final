We decided to stop watching the movie and i walked into my room with the walls rippling and pulsating and then put the rest of the mushrooms in a ceramic mug and ate them all. First, I changed my shirt and then went out of my closet to find my friend with enormously dilated pupils. I told him and helloked into the mirror. He turned around with a devilish grin and crouched down hopping as a frog. For a a few seconds he really transformed into a frog. Once this odd transformation had ceased, we put on dark side of the moon. I saw gyrating patterns similar to a kaleidascope of all different colors on the ceiling and my mood changed rapidly to a perfect, jazzy calm.
