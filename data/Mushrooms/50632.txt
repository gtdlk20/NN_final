Soon my friend, my boyfriend and I all went out into the big backyard. Nature is incredibly beautiful on mushrooms... I was walking on the grass, watching vines grow, twisting gracefully out of the ground and wrapping around everything. The rose bushes glowed as if they were electric and trees and leaves were huge and exaggerated, looking very much like something out of 'Alice in Wonderland'. I couldn't resist touching the roses and once I did, they fell apart so easily in my hand. It looked as though the petals were turning into liquid and melting into my hand. I walked to the very corner of the yard where these thick bushes met at an angle. I stared into the bushes and I swear I heard a voice calling me into the darkness. The branches seemed to beckon with their thorny fingers and I went running back into the safety of the house.
