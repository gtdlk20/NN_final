We went into the little rooms in the bus depot and I looked on the ground and it looked like green algae or some glowing material was crawling everywhere. I thought i was in a subway train because all the bulidings were moving very fast. Then I started tripping out on some green poles, the colors seperated into 2 faded green bars and turned into a cubed 3D shape. We started walking out of the bus depot and we went to a place where teenagers hang out. One of my friends came 2 c me on mushrooms first time and she was laughing her ass off. One of her friends gave me a flower and i took it, and it looked so amazing. Some green glowing material fell on my finger and i flicked it off.
