I answered all there basically irrelevant questions like, What kind of drugs have you done in the past?, What got you started into drugs?, Where do you live?, Whats your phone number?, Have you ever been arrested?  But when they attempted to ask me questions like, So, how long have you been growing Psychedelic Mushrooms, I simply sat back in my chair, and said, (NOT A GOD DAMN WORD).  The only other things I really answered were questions regarding the information I had already given them.  Such as, So whats the name of the guy you planned on giving the equipment too?  I said, Im not going to give you his name, its irrelevant.  And then we would continue talking again, and the agent would try to be tricky, he would slowly bring up our friend again in a subtle way and say, Oh, yeah.  So what did you say his last name was again?  And of course that didnt work, and I said, I didnt give you his last name, I didnt give you a first name, I didnt give you any name.  You can always tell when they get angry: when there little tricks dont work, because then they use there only other trick which is threatening arrest.
