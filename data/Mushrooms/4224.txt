When the movie ended and the soundtrack in my headphones faded away, so did the otherworldly voice and visions. I got up from my couch and turned on the lights. Despite only a little under two hours having passed, in that moment I felt like this trip was essentially over. I felt moved to go about straightening things up in my apartment. The trip, however, was clearly not done with me. At one point I was in the middle of my kitchen, staring up into one of the recessed lightbulbs in the ceiling, completely entranced by it for who knows how long, only to snap out of it and find myself holding my cats full litter box in my hands. I laughed at myself and was like, What am I doing? Why am I doing this right now? Nonetheless, I somehow finished the job of cleaning the litter box. I dont remember how long this strangely distracted straightening up went on or what else I did.
