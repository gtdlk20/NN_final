I was leaving a party at the end of the night, and coming down from the effects of ecstacy (half-cap) and marijuana (LOTS). I wanted to keep awake for an all-nighter adventure with my friends, so I figured 'hey, why not try smoking some?' I'd done it before when it was mixed with weed, and that was kinda fun but nothing like being stoned or high on mushrooms after eating them orally. It was a very laid-back experience with mild visual changes in lighting and perception.
