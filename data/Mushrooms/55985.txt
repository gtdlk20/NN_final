After the initial effects of the mushrooms our minds transitioned from light thoughts to the profound revelations that the drug provides.  My friend, began to become uncomfortable with the blur between his ordinary life and his mind on shrooms.  According to him, he felt so normal physically except his mind was racing and he hoped it would stop.  This effect peaked at about 11, or 150 minutes into the trip and what I would describe as the the climax of the night.  Having never directly experienced this fear I cannot completely relate but from what I have read it is not an uncommon feeling.
