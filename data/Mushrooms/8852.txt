Then we took out the music  again, commenced drawing.  Then all the sudden someone walks out of a door and smiles and says hi to us. He kinda laughed because IÂ’m sure we looked odd. The location on campus was really random and we were listening to beatles, drawing and it probably smelled like weed haha.  We loved that he had come into our world we felt like he was a part of it now, so we had to give him a name.  We decided he looked very elf like with his jolly beard, so we named him buddy the elf.   He came in and our of our fantasy land without even knowing it.
