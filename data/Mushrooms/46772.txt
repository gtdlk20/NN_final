At his dorm we settled in front of the TV and began to watch the tube. We watched Teletoon, an all animation channel. It was playing Aqua Teen Hunger Force, which is very surreal even when not on mushrooms. As we watched, I began to feel like a child again. I started giggling at everything that happened, with the wide mouthed expression that a child would have when he's being amused by a game of peek-a-boo. Now I'm a big guy, so I can only imagine what this must have looked like to my friends, but they were off in their own worlds.
