At 7:30 I hastily ate the whole bag and was hanging out front of the pizza place where I know almost everyone that works there. I started to feel it around 8:00 and saw an American flag start to do weird things like go up and down like a set of blinds for a house. I finally got away from the shopping center walking with some of my friends that were looking for something to do. On the walk to the bike trail everything started to turn red and I started to hear the ringing in my head that I have heard before, the shadows were back, the colors and the constant movement were here again. It felt good. Finally our ride showed up and I hoped in the car, and we headed for some chick's house where the driver had to drop something off and pick something up. The drive there was amazing, it felt like the road was so much longer and took 5 times as long. By this time I was really starting to come up and the road and everything around me was so crazy looking.
