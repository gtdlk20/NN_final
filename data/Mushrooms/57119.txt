I have only done mushrooms twice so far. My first experience was good, but not great. My second was one that I will never forget. It was me, my boyfriend and my two roommates that ate the mushrooms. We each had close to 3 grams. About 2 hours after we ate them, none of us were feeling the same as we were the first time we tripped. We had a great body buzz but other than that, nothing special. The others that I was with started being negative, talking about how they weren't feeling anything and the shrooms must have been bad. I started feeling kind of down because I was experiencing more visuals and was tripping more than they were. So I decided I wanted to go outside.
