Shortly after making my sandwich, I was talking to my friends Scott and Bunko (both of whom were present for my munching of the blue), and they said that my pupils were huge.  I knew this as I was starting to feel the most screwed up I've ever been.  The camp director Manny, came up and talked to me, and I freaked out.  I told him I forgot my swimsuit, so I went back to my cabin but picked up my had in a terribly worthless attempt to hide my messed up eyes.  I made a quick trip to the bathroom, which turned into a long one because it's really trippy to pee on mushrooms when you think about what's going on in your body.  This, paired with my extended look in the mirror because of the difference in my appearance took 3-5 minutes.
