Upon visiting this site for the first time and reading other reports i became curious as to the truth to this matter.  Any previous experiences i have had with smoking mushroom dust has always been at the same time as eating them, for instance smoking a lil dust on a bowl while waiting for the ones i ate to kick in, naturally.. basically getting a body high which blended right into the body high i got from the onez i ate, thus headin right into a normal shroom trip.
