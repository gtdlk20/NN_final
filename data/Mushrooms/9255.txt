Around the 1 hour mark I started to make out with my gf, slowly easing into the trip. I did not intend to have sex with my gf before the trip or when preparing for it, it didn't even really cross my mind, but that was what was happening, and I was instigating it. We kissed in a way that seemed as if the mushrooms were guiding us in a rhythm. We kissed in a way that seemed as if the mushrooms were guiding us in a rhythm. I have had sex on mushrooms a couple of times in the past, long into the past, so I had pretty much forgotten what it was like. But to spare you all of the details, it was very intense and intimate, and around 1:40am we had to stop because our bodies were physically tired and heavy from the mushrooms, and things started to become a distraction. However, the sexual experience was really profound and there was a strong connection between us that I feel only the mushrooms could have brought on. Not that we don't have a strong connection anyway, but this was different.
