Biking back we passed some horses who looked extremely beautiful and majestic, and I thought of the wild horses who roam in the Eastern U.S. When we arrived back to campus, Dan went to go eat, and I went to this park to sit, think, and write about my still-occurring psychedelic experience. I wrote this at the park, Clouds are amazing. (It was dusk, and there are overlapping light purple and dark blue and gray ones) 1st hand experience is key, oh shrooms are amazing. We sort of have the ability to see like this inside of us, but shroos help bring it out. Haha, its 7:11. I took them at 3:35. Time is distorted. Oh, writing hardly does justice to experience. People will appreciate nature, if they are shown the way. Disclaimer: Never underestimate the pure wonder and amazingness and mystery of life! My friend Sam asked me how it was and I called the experience, extraordinarily and unspeakably profound and valuable.
