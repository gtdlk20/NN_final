I pleaded my dad to let me quit, but he said no. I was pissed at this. I knew I needed to get high somehow, but I didn't know how. Then I noticed the bag of mushrooms in my dad's room. I snuck in, opened the bag, and pocketed some. I went for a walk on a golf course, deserted since it was mid-October, nowhere near the tourist season. I ate a small stem and a cap, waited a bit, and walked back home. When I went back to my room, I started to feel funny. Everything seemed different somehow, I noticed a pulsing, static-like pressure in the back of my head, and I spent a half hour laughing my ass off making funny faces in the mirror. When my dad opened the door is when things started to get messed up.
