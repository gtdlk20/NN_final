It was one of the strangest feelings I've ever had. Even though she wasn't in the same state of mind (or the same zip code) I seemed to know what she felt last time she tripped. It seemed as if the Goddess cast her over me in order to confort me. She knew I had not yet comprehended the transition and I needed something familiar to reconnect with reality. I felt as if I was cleaner than I had ever been and it no longer mattered.
