With all the detail I have described here I might have hit about half of what actually happened that night; the guy who sold us reassured I would 'freak out' with these, I did.  This trip was totally different than any other shroom trip I'd had, it was much more like what I've heard acid to be; although why it made my muscles stop working was a mystery.  It was the most incredibly mentally enriching experience I've ever had; fast enough that I could live my life a thousand times a second, colorful enough that green suddenly became the representative for all color, musical enough that the keys of G and D (which I was using for a lot the guitar work I was doing that night) became everything, and emotional enough that I became myself after seeing everyone else as myself and was quite literally brought to my knees.
