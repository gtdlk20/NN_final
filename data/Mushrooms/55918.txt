These were some fuckin potent shrooms. Kicked in real fast, and it was good at first, laughin my ass off the way shrooms usually make me do, started seein cool lookin geometric shapes on the walls that were always moving and changing. Usual patterns. We were watchin dumb and dumber and the people's noses, mouths, eyes and ears were sectioned off into squares and popping out. I was laughin at that for a while, but after a while it got a bit annoying for some reason.
