I washed the mushrooms down with water, which I continued to drink for the next 30 minutes.  At this time I had expected to begin to feel the oncoming effects of the mushrooms, and I decided that I was beginning to feel disoriented.  I knew the effects that alcohol had on me, and I certainly was not feeling as sloppy or incoherent as alcohol made me feel.  A friend pulled into the driveway, and I began to talk about my experience with my housemate.  This was strange to me, as I wasn't out of touch with reality.  I began to try to explain the ever-increasing visual distortions and patterns I was seeing, and I focused on the friend's car.  It was a great land rover, and I was totally drawn into it, forgeting my conversation.  At this point I knew that I was fully under the influence of the mushrooms, and I went inside to study some objects that were textured and patterned.  Looking at a persian carpet, I saw the patterns morph and vacillate.  I placed a small object on the rug as a reference point, and it moved and swirled with the patterns.  I looked at wood grain, and found it vastly entertaining.  The lines moved fluidly, and I suddenly realized the basic fact that the wood had once been alive.
