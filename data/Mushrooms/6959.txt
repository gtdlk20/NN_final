The end result though (at least so far, we havent been contacted by the agents yet) is she moved out, into my house.  Her mom said she forbids her to date me any longer and of course that wasnt going to happen because we love each other.  We are very happy living together.  We both have jobs and are both attending college.  We havent been using any drugs recently, just because we want to be clean from all legalities until this thing blows over.  I pray that things do indeed just go away; maybe Im being stupid for even hoping that.  I never would have guessed that just having the equipment could get me and the one person I care for the most in so much trouble.  I had always preached to myself that I would be fine as long as I wasnt directly breaking any laws.  I guess I was wrong.  It goes to show you what can happen, when people who are biased against those who are interested in entheogens, react.  I dont know what exactly my point was with this story or what you should take from it.  Im not even sure about anything right now myself.  I guess though, I wrote this just to warn people.  Be extra cautious with anything and everything you do, illegal or otherwise.  You have to ask yourself, is what I plan on doing worth having my freedom taken away, regardless of what you feel deeply in your heart to be honest and morally correct.
