About 45min to an hour later everyone was starting to have visuals, and also felt a bit queasy. I didn't, but I had taken less, as one of the dinner guests was taking it for the first time and I wanted to be somewhat sober for him (he was fine, had a great time). Lana became rather upset, said it was too much, and I suggested she relax her muscles, drink some water and move around to help flush it. She stood up, remarked she felt a bit better, and John stood up with her. We were both watching her. I was asking her to relax when John locked up and fell over, hitting the ground like a statue. He lay there shaking and stiff, for a few seconds, then snapped out of it. From when he locked up till when he came to took about 10 seconds. When he got up he broke out in a sweat, which lasted a couple of minutes. He tried to describe the experience then, saying the only comparable one was when he had cut himself deeply and passed out after examining the wound.
