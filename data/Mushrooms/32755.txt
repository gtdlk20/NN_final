Ive experimented with shrooms a few times and also mescaline but this was Neils first trip. He seemed to place some kind of irrational comfort in me being there, as if I knew what I was doing and would help him out if things got difficult. This couldnt have been father from the truth. As what I realised is that Id never really tripped before. I had experienced different states of mind before but nothing like the place we were about to go.
