My friend and his father were discussing, I think, how Google works when I began to really notice what was going on around me. My initial assessment of the situation was that I'd died and whatever spiteful omnipotent being was out there had sent me days or weeks into the future to perceive how my friend's family had dealt with my death in their house. I thought I could see them but that they couldn't see me.
