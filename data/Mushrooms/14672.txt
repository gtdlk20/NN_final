Several lifetimes later, I stood before Mother Mushroom. Though outwardly expressionless and unmoving, I could feel Her smile upon me. I knew, now, that this was what the whole journey had been building up to. In my new state of being, after the gathering, after the self-observation, it was Mother Mushroom now who could give me what I needed, that final clarification of Soul, that final gift of Love. And so She spoke to me in words I cannot translate, for they are words without language, words of the Ageless. But She shone all life and light into me, touching me directly in the heart and filling it with her love, for longer than one could count in the mortal realm. When She was done She released Her embrace of me, and smiled with assurance as I floated away without grounding. She told me that this was just one of the many, many lessons I will encounter in my journey of self cultivation, and that I will see Her again someday.
