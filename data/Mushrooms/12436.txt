We are at the dawn of the age of the genetic revolution, the nanotechnological revolution, and arguably have passed the computer revolution.  I believe that with the advent of cloning, humanity will have to reconsider the value and meaning of human life and all life; I believe a paradigm shift in belief systems will occur.  Our world is developing at an ever-increasing rate of speed.  It seems like humanity is building toward something, some purpose, and that pinnacle of achievement is nearer than ever.  I feel it will be reached before the end of the twenty-first century.
