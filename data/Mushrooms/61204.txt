After the ingestion it did not take long for the effects to take in. I started off with severe nausea and discomfort, probobaly due to my hang over from night before. We left the house and went to the beach, where the waves and the faces of people were so harmonically outlandish. By this point i was experiencing a total connection with my friend, we spoke and it made sense completely. We came to the conclusion that people are too busy running places and never stop to think and enjoy the moment. it was as though we were in a time warp where everything just stopped and we were there seeing all of the universe, the big picture, the evolution the history, everything made sense, the small details, our purpose in life, best trip ever. LOVED WHAT THE MUSHROOMS SHOWED ME ANd my Friend, BIG PUPPY>
