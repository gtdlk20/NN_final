Now, to the actual trip in question. I was back at my parentsÂ’ house for the weekend. I had tried cleaning my dorm room, but it still felt too dirty and cramped. I felt like the room I grew up in was a nice alternative with much better energy. I had ground up my remaining 4 grams of mushrooms, as I had recently read about taking them in a lemon shot. After taking a shower and letting them soak in lemon juice, I downed my little magic concoction at precisely 9:00 PM.
