Once inside I wasn't hungry but I was affraid to lose J and W so I stayed with them in the cafeteria.  Indeed it was very bright with lots of interesting colors to look at.  I did feel small and had the sense that the hall was massive so I pushed my back up against a coke machine and patiently waited for W and J to get their food.  They were getting something from a grille-type place so I was glad that I got to watch the fire.  W said that there was a moment where he thought I was freaking because he said I just stood completely still looking at the flame grilling a burger.  When W and J got their food I asked if we could sit by a window so I could look out.  We got the best view I've ever seen.  I sat on a comfortable brown leather chair looking out of a huge bay window over the Shenandoah Valley.
