Shortly after it didn't really matter how far we were away from other people at the park, the level of acuteness in our senses made it seem like we could hear them as far away as we would travel. Comparing maybe a quarter of a mile's distance to 3/4 of a mile, there seemed to be no loss of sound. My senses were sharp, albeit inebriated. I felt like the happiest/smartest drunk in the forest. We then came upon a fallen tree that took on a form that was very sad. The tree had looked like it was in pain. It didn't have much of a 'face', but it seemed it did have a painful looking frown, more like a human expression of death. The tree was covered with other flourishing plantlife that made me think in my mind that it was a sign of nature moving on, turning the pain of past death into a blessing of new life. Later on the path, we came to a bridge, by this time my girlfriend and I were hysterical with laughter. She decided it would be a good idea to lay down on this small bridge on the forested path, which I found hilarious. I joked with her, half-seriously, 'We must not lay down on the Nature Trail.' In response, she simply laughed saying, 'I don't fucking care, people can walk around.' I hadn't noticed the last time I had done something like this, but this time I noticed that my skin becomes very pale as well in response to the poison. It kind of concerned me, but with previous experience, I already knew that at this level of dosage, I should be just fine. Then, I began to think about my partner's welfare, but i also thought about how I started at this dosage. Still, I would remember to periodically check on her and ask if she felt okay.
