Whats this?? Snow! Snows awesome. I felt a strong desire to eat some of the snow. It had a crunchy texture and was cooling in my mouth. Does anyone else want to eat the snow? Goopstar told me after the trip that him handing me the snow was an attempt to get me out of my mind, to stop me from analyzing everything and get me to focus on some physical sensation instead.
