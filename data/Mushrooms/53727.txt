    I went to town and rented another movie, and at about 7 o clock i began watching. As the previews rolled by, i noticed the lack of anything else to eat with my shrooms. All i had left was pop. So i took a piece of paper, folded it in half the long way, and poured the dust in the fold. I funneled all the dust into my mouth as i tipped my head back and took a swig of my coke. The combo fizzed unexpectedly, overflowing in my mouth and spilling approx. a gram of fungi. I reluctantly swallowed the remaining mix, and grimaced from the bittersweet taste. I continued watching my movie and didn't notice any differences until the ending, when forrest gump's face began to ebb and flow in tiny ripples. I looked around the living room, at the setting sun, and felt a visual equivalent of sexual arousal, i wanted to intensely observe my surroundings all i could.
