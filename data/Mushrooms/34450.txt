Anyway at about 8 I am comming down from my trip. All I am thinking about is how much of a lifechanging experience this has been. My friend D and L are still trippin hard, so they're just walking around looking at everything, talking about space and the earth and heaven and hell. Me and J are still in the garage knowing exactly how they're feeling and what they are seeing. I feel so connected to J on a different level than I ever have before. At about 9 my friend J and D go home and Me and L are sitting in his garage with his Step Dad talking about Life. At 10 I went home. I went home with the most amazing life changing experience I will ever have. And I know that D, L, and J also had that same life changing experience that I had, and will never forget it. All four of us feel we are now connected, closer somehow than ever before because of this experience. I feel that Mushrooms are Earth's way of letting Humans know about itself.
