by now it was 5 or 6 AM. I drank a little water, not because I was thirsty, but because I figured I should. I felt the water in my mouth, but it seemed to dissapear as I swallowed it. I couldnt really feel it go down. Then I attempted to eat some banana bread. At first it tasted really good, but as my saliva soaked into it, it became disgusting. I felt no urge whatsoever to swallow it, and pondered over the concept of consuming food for a while before spitting it out. Then I headed upstairs to my room, sat on my bed, and looked at the wall which was covered in crazy shadows cast by abnormal lightbulbs in my lamp. Green and purple patterns flowed through the shadows and followed the countours of everything contrasting my white bedroom walls. I spent an hour or two observing these patterns in various parts of the house, took a piss, and felt almost depressed that my trip was fading away.
