To get up to their house, you drive steeply uphill from the city and lake below. At a certain point in time, we suddenly found ourselves in the forest. The road narrows and continues upward through cedar, hemlock, birch and aspen forest for another few kilometres. The forest is moist and polypores abound on rotting birch trees. We couldnÂ’t make it all the way to the top in our van, due to the steepness and slushy conditions, as there was still much snow at this higher elevation, so we parked about 400 metres down the road and walked the rest of the way up.
