After the fire, when I went for the beer, I could not shake a burning desire for the guy to come to the pool and hang out with us (me, my sister, and my boyfriend).  I kept looking for him at the gas station.  I didn't know why:  I am faithful, my boyfriend was there, and I was not physically attracted to the guy.  It was not because I wanted to flirt or pick him up or anything, I just felt a strong sense that I needed for him to come to the pool.
