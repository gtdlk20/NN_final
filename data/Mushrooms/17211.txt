Anyway, it has been two years since I stopped doing drugs, but I felt the urge for some wonderful experiences. I stopped taking my anti-depressants 2 months before, because I knew that would interfere with any kind of drugs. I decided on shrooms, since it's natural, I liked that idea. I live in Holland and shrooms are easy to purchase here. I just went to Amsterdam (35 minutes from where I live) and bought Hawaian Shrooms, dried. Dried shrooms are actually illegal, even here, but they had them anyway. I went to a friend's home and we both had 10 grams of the rancid-tasting mushrooms. It was quite strange, but it was working almost immediatly. I felt a strange, tingling sensation in my mouth and then a euphoric feeling in my whole body.
