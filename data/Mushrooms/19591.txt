It was a sunny Nantucket day when I ate psilocybin mushrooms.  It was late July, pleasant, and I felt positive and adventurous.  I was curious as to whether the fungus could produce hallucinations or psychological changes.   At 3 p.m. I ate 7 grams of psilocybin mushrooms, chewing half very thoroughly.
