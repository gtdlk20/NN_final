I stood around, socialized, and waited anxiously for the mushrooms to kick in. Nothing really happened for about an hour. At our house, we have a dance room with a colorful disco ball style light hanging from our ceiling, and the first thing I noticed was that the lights were trailing a little bit, and the colors seemed very prominent and beautiful, moreso than normal. I then proceeded to walk into the kitchen, and that was when I knew the mushrooms had hit me full force.
