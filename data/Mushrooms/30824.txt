Eventually I was feeling spry enough to drum, so I got up and started rambling on about society and being free, and moving on, I danced under the moon with great joy to the rhythms of Tupac's 'killuminati' album. I truly felt alive, for the first in a long time. And I no longer wanted to despair, I didn't want to lose touch, I wanted to be, a part, a living -breathing and beautiful part of the world, a world that loves me. Throughout the night I had a constant thread of thought that would relate to the indigenous people, the ones who have used older, more sustainable technology. Truly believing that they understand these things, and that we the white people are actively destroying the world.
