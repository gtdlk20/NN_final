Then my parents got back and the adventure began, now my parents are of the strictest of all and smoking or drugs of any kind was certainly not aloud, But seeing as I was on them anyways I figured who cares, so I moved up out of the basement in my room were I continued to smoke, door wide open, then the shrooms kicked in and hard, I slowly felt my self falling out of one world and passing into the next, I felt my self seeing things that cannot be written things of unimaginable meaning and beauty, and yet I felt still that I had not reached the level of beauty and true reality that I was looking for, so it was then that I began to smoke, again.
