I picked up a ticket for the concert the next day and the next day, a couple of hours before the doors opened, Peter sent me a message asking if I wanted to do mushrooms at the show.  I replied right away with a, yes. It hadnt even been a question. I could feel this was the right time. I had the following three days off and was ready to see what kind of magic and secrets the drug had locked away, or so I thought. I called my friend and we made arrangements for the night.
