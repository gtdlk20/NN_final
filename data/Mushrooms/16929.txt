Eventually we calmed down and decided to walk back to my car and listen to some music. First, though, we had a few very important tasks to perform: To find the cd, eject the current cd in the cd player, and put the correct one in. I know it sounds ridiculous, but that was one of the most confusing things I have ever attempted. As soon as we got into the car, we were beginning to go a little crazy. We would both just drift off for a second (or minute), then begin laughing in fits like I've never experienced before. Just insane. I still laugh thinking about how funny everything was. I don't remember even really talking at that point, just laughing.
