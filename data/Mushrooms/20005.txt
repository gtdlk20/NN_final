After putting on some loose-fitting clothes (yet another measure I took to ensure an optimal experience), I began chatting online, waiting for the core effects to commence. Within no more than five minutes, I began to feel deeply out of place, as though I were caught in between states of consciousness; a sort of mental limbo. Suddenly I found myself focusing on the words on the screen with a great level of intensity, not really knowing why. Within a few seconds of focusing, the words began to very flicker and shimmer ever so slightly, and I was caught by surprise. Suddenly, the slight shimmering grew dramatically in intensity, within no more than a minute or two (by now it was 11:20PM) the words were mutating wildly. I had experienced a similar effect on my first trip, but this time it seemed more intense and otherwordly, perhaps because of the alarming rapidity of the onset. The melting, shimmering movement of the words was most certainly rythmic in nature, and seemed to follow a set pattern. I was overcome with the mathematical precision of said visual distortions, and felt sheer excitement. What really gave me a strong mindfuck, though, was that the pattern of distortion was unmistakably identical to the one I had witnessed in my last trip. I had scarce time to enjoy this effect, however, as my experience soon became several times more intense.
