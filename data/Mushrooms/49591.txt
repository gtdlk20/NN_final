Then at that moment I felt as if I was a detective on a mysterious alien planet and I was sent to search for life, and I began walking around my house and outside the trees looked like 50 foot tall shrooms that extend into the evergoing sky. By this time I was very confused I didn't know where I was in my house and I had no coordination at all. Then I began to 'peak' I guess you could call it, as I fell into a very tranquil stare at the Jimi Hendrix poster on my wall I began hearing faint guitar music and then I saw in a large array of colors Jimi Hendrix standing outside the poster, at that point I thought to myself is this real? am I real? at that point we all started to scare ourselves because we convinced ourselves that we weren't real and that we were mushrooms and God was going to pick us and that's when we would die.
