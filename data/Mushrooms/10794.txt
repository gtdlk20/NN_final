03:30: I feel like IÂ’m born again, more complete and wise, but still with so much to learn. I start again to look at the ceiling, and the eyes were still there. The most understanding and loving eyes. And they were all over. I was extremely overwhelmed by them that I started to cry. It was just a thing that seemed so natural and helping. I think I cryed for almost an hour, crying and talking to the eyes. About everything that was on my mind, about everything that made me sad or happy. From time to time, for a short while, the eyes got a figure too. Then the faces vanished and they became the way they were before, only eyes. The most amazing eyes ever.
