Finally, about 4 hours in, my sister suggested we watch the rest of Inside Out. I agreed. It was absolutely perfect. Its my favorite movie, and I knew it really well. I began to think that the entire meaning of life was this movie, and that perhaps I had willed it into being because it was such a perfect movie, and was perfect for this trip. It seemed to speak directly to me, sometimes seeming to answer questions I had right as they came up in my mind. I thought that perhaps sometime in my future Id use a time machine to go back and make the movie so that it would be there for this trip. I believed that life was created by our desire for it, and that Inside Out was life itself. I believed all of these things in various degrees moving from one belief to another without thinking they contradicted each other.
