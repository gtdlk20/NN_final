Just after I took the mushrooms I made my bed a bit, lit some candles and put on some music (Andrew Bird - Noble Beast). After about 20-30 minutes I started sensing that something was coming up and I sat on the couch. Some 10 minutes after that the earthy tones of the living room, my brotherÂ’s paintings on the wall and shapes around me in general became quite a bit more beautiful than they usually are. If I closed my eyes I could see wonderful shapes and patterns, intricate and moving. I was touched and some tears rolled down my cheeks.
