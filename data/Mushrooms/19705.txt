After about 4 hours we decided to see somewhere new. We tried to walk downtown, but after about 10 minutes of being around some people and houses, we couldn't stand it and decided to get our hippy asses back to our meadow. We started sobering up and had a little picnic with apples and oranges (THE best apples and oranges I've ever eaten). We started to realize that there were nasty bugs and spiders crawling all over us and biting us.  We got a little freaked out and walked back to the resort.  Once in her house, the doors, cabinets, and everything seemed to have a life of their own and were breathing.  We felt like smoking some weed, but we didn't have any.  We took showers and walked around the resort a little more. The body high was gone and almost everything was normal; this was about 7 hours later.  At about 12:30 that night we noticed that things were still tripping us out and we couldn't understand it.
