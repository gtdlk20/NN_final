I gained the most about myself this trip which is another reason I think the experience is so important.  I think there are parts of myself and of the world that I will never completely understand.  I think our minds are almost too powerful to understand without the help of hallucinogenic to really open our minds and break down our thoughts a little slower than we normally would.  The details of life are beautiful, and mushrooms allow us to slow down and really take note, and appreciate them.  A quote from our trip its a crime that its a crime to do these things.
