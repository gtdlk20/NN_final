It took us half an hour to walk 10 metres in a small park.  I was peaking out around T+ 1h 30 min, and I started throwing up.  Like everything else, throwing up was the most intense experience of my life.  I got this weird body high, where I was buzzing all over, and I felt really cold but I couldn't decide if I was actually really cold or just really high, and it confused and frustrated me.  We tried to take the bus back to my friend's house, but it took us about 20 minutes to remember what we were doing long enough to reach the bus stop.  The wait for the bus was incredibly long, experientially, though only 10 minutes in reality.  The visuals were beginning to subside somewhat, but everything was still crawling around.  I was listening to a sober friend talking, but it was like I was watching TV without paying attention - I could hear all these funny sounds, but I had no idea what they meant, I could piece them together.
