 Well there we were. Just me and My friends on a normal friday night trippin our balls off, talking the shit, and just havin a good old time. We ate the mushrooms about an hour and a half before sitting around the campfire. We were searching for spiritual findings but all we found was astonishment. As I casually poured myself a drink I noticed everyones faces were aging into a zombie like corpse. I was thinking maybe they are trying to tell me something like my life is going in the wrong direction. So I pondered on that thought a while while pouring my 8th shot of GoldShlager and realized I was right I need to completely change my life, stop being an asshole to my parents and brother. As the flames sparked into the air my friends and I conversed about the very distant future and what lies ahead in certain phenomenal machinary. My hands felt as if two baloons were attached two them making my arms float up in the air (gave me thoughts of the wall). The flames were beautifully intertwining with each other in psychedelic swirls of uncertainty.
