I was told two grams was a lot of fun, and that three grams could get intense. I didnt care. I was naive and ignorant. I was out in search of the intense trip. I got home and debated what to do as I cleaned up my room so that Id have a more comfortable environment to trip in. Almost immediately I received a message from my friend, Peter. Earlier that day he had stopped by my house to pick up some mushrooms I had been holding onto for him, and at that time we had arranged to trip that evening.
