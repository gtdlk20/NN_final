It was May 28, 1996.  The Grateful Dead were playing what would be their last Portland performance before Jerry's untimely, yet unsurprising demise. By happenstance, the concert fell directly on my 26th birthday.  My ticket was a gift from the friends who attended with me.  Along with this they were going to seek out suitable drugs to accompany the experience.  None of us were virgins to the psychedeilic experience; however I was not ready for the extra portion which I was afforded for being the birthday boy.  As is the tradition with dead show, we arrived several hours early to experience the carnival/ freak show environment that is omnipresent, and of course secure our party favors for the day.  The latter of which is prevelant and nearly unavoidable.  We soon settled with a bedraggled, dreadlocked and dirty deadhead on an undeterminable yet healthy looking bag of fungus.  We all quickly consumed our portions.  After a slow half hour of people watching, we made our way to a local bank machine to obtain some spending cash and prepare to enter the concert grounds... this is where things begin to go whacky.  I first felt a numb confusion. A wave of fear and anxiety which was a doozy of a first step.  I immediately was struck with the urge to make myself vomit. I struggled with this for about ten minutes, yet no matter how far I jammed my fingers in my throat, I was unable to dislodge the stuburn poison which was running rampant through my troubled body.  The only recourse I had was to try and 'ride the wave'.  My friends began to notice that I wasn't on their giddy train of light, mind alteration... quite the contrary, I was slipping over the edge, I was infact teetering, staring into the void, not sure or capable of deciding what to do.  Although slightly worried, they thought time would bring me right, and took my hand and led me back toward the show.
