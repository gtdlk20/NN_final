It did me no good to reflect on 'the emanid of ansklrj is sooo ahiutou' At least not then. I began to see geometrical shapes on my body, as if my previous life was being revived. I heard the sounds of ancient Asian gongs, and pondered the possibility of Cubensis originating there. As the experience progressed, something very new occurred to me. My long embraced spirit teacher, the Wolf, became me. I became Wolf. Suddenly I WAS a wolf. I was playing in the snow, and I could see the rest of the pack in the far off distanceNO words can do this experience justice. I could feel the cold barely penetrating my fur (fur I could feel!) I could smell the freshly killed animal, see my burning yellow eyes, hear the howling, that magic howling reverberate through me
