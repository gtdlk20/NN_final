A few feet away from me was a very large object that looked like a washed up giant squid - the waves were crashing over it in big sprays. I couldn't tell what it was and I was afraid to get any closer. To make things even more enigmatic, the lighthouse only showed us 1 second of the object in pure light, and then for 2 more seconds it was completely dark. James and I were really scared. I needed to know what this object was so I grabbed a stick and slowly made my way closer. Each time the light beamed on the washed up thing it looked like something different - a severed horses head, a bag of bones, an octopus. Finally I got close enough to poke the thing. It was hard but gave a little, it reminded me of a body, of flesh. As I looked closer as the light hit, I saw intricacies of fabric and then realized it was a rug - a rug burried beneath the sand that was slowly being uncovered by the tide.
