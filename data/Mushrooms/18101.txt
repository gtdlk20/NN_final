Well, I started getting into this whole mushroom growing thing a while ago, and am experimenting with many different ways to grow. I started with Ecuadorians since I read they were easy to grow, potent, etc. When I get a good bath of these (my attempts so far have been pretty under-par) I'll move on to B+ and Hawaiians and what not (trying to find my favorites).
