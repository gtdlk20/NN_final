I thought about how someone had remarked it was disgusting outside. By this point I realized that I was obviously not Dexter, nor a serial killer. So why was it disgusting outside of my tent? Had I been tripping so hard that I trashed the campsite and didn't remember? This seemed like a very real possibility. The pain in my stomach was starting to diminish so I decided to get out of the tent and take a look around. It was night by this point, and there were only a few people at our campsite. I did not know them well, they were friends of friends who were camping with us. My friends must have still been at the festival. Looking around, I could see why people thought it was disgusting, our campsite was indeed a mess. Much to my relief, it wasn't a mess I created. There were beer cans, empty bottles, and solo cups everywhere. Food was left out on the table, dirty dishes everywhere. Some of the other people at our campsite must have gotten drunk and forgot to clean up after themselves.
