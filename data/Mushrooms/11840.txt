T+10mins I go downstairs with the others and we all chill out in the living room watching TV. I believe we were watching the Hockey game. I don't remember who was playing, and for the next little while, I didn't really talk to anyone very much. Just little things here and there. To be honest, I was trying to keep my mind off the shrooms, but I was very anxious, and sort of excited. I don't use much often, so it's always like the first time with me, it would seem.
