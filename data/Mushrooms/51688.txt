A sense of rationality did overcome me at that point and I opened the door, got in and we drove off.  Driving up to Tiff's house I looked at my skin and saw the ivy crawling all over it. The trees outside were changing colors and the road was swimming away from us.  We made it safely, I don't know how, and went up to Tiff's very happy room.  I looked into the mirror and saw my face melting everywhere.  Lucky that I was in Tiff's home as it was my second home for the previous year and a half.  I could move my face like it was clay and all of her feminine condiments were swimming atop the counter.  They were ebbing like the ocean.  I went into her room and sat on the floor.  Ian was on the bed hoping for nothing more but to be sane again.  For some reason it didn't hit me that anything out of the ordinary was happening.  I was playing with Tiff's miniature poodle and it was jumping to and fro leaving itself all over my hands.  The floor was ebbing like water and I had the most tremendous sense of comfort and warmth.
