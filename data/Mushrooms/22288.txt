I laid down and felt a loss of reality, I held Jeff's hand and asked him if he liked mushrooms, he told me 'sometimes.'  And I knew exactly what he meant.  He meant that he did enjoy experiencing new thought patterns but at times it can be overwhelming, but it is something that you have to go through in order to find understanding and our ultimate goal of something like enlightenment.  This all came through mentally.  He kept telling me that he is 'on my side' and I also knew what he meant, but it is a twin thing, and it's very hard to explain.  I kept asking him strange questions about reality, people, objects around us, not really caring what I said, just saying what came to mind, forgetting what was 'embarrassing' or not appropriate.  I am glad I have such an open brother who is also my best friend who is willing to listen to any crazy thing I have to say and even respond to it in an understanding and accepting way.
