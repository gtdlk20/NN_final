So, we decided to chill for awhile. We laid on my bed under this sparkling tapestry I had hung from the underside of my roommates bed (bunkbeds; Im on the bottom), and watched the string of lights above my bed glitter when one of us barely moved. We laid like that for about an hour, watching the minutes on the digital clock change slowly. I asked how he was feeling, and he said he just felt buzzed, like hed had some hard alcohol. I agreed that my limbs were a little different feling, and my stomach was a sort of uncomfortable, but I wasnt seeing anything. We talked a little while and looked at each other to see if one of us looked any different. We both looked the same as usual. We turned to look at the wall, and we were somewhat happy to find that the mushrooms were just beginning to kick in. The woodgrain on my closet was beginning to wave across the doors. It looked like my closet (and my roommates) had a shimmering Zebra-striped pattern that seemed to creep across it, stretching to the other side of the room. We just looked at it for a couple of minutes and smiled, and then we turned back to each other. At once I felt like I had never experienced gravity, and I felt as though I were sinking into my bedding. My arms moved slowly upward in the air, to touch the tapestry, but the air felt thick, like honey or tar. I want to kiss you, I said to A. So he smiled and we kissed, and it felt good. Lips felt warmer and softer. We soon decided that clothing was horrible and restraining... unnatural. We got out of our clothes as soon as we could. We even tried to take off our necklaces, becuase they had felt just as alien to us. He crawled on top of me and we kept kissing.
