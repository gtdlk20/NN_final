When we got to the girls house I waited outside and I kept seeing animals that were all black, like shadows down in the middle of the road. It was around 9 now and I started to feel quite sick to my stomach, but didn't puke. When I got back into the car, my friends all looked purple and it felt like we were driving incredibly fast, but we weren't. A very odd thing happened in the middle of town at a stop light, I was thinking. See, I have had piercings for the last two years, I had 2 holes in each ear stretched and my nose had a ring, I started to feel that I didn't want them in anymore. So, calmly I rolled the window down, and said, I don't want to be restricted by metal through my body, and tossed them out the window. My friends looked at me kinda weird and asked, are you gonna regret that later? I said no, and we kept driving.
