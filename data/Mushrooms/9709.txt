There were so many questions I had for Friend #2, but whenever I would get the urge to speak, something would hold me back. My mind seemed to answering the questions for itself. As time passed, the leaves on the trees grew brighter and brighter, filling my heart with so much joy. The trees also seemed to be breathing, releasing a nice cool breeze whenever they exhaled. I was like an infant observing all of the wonder of the world for the very first time.
