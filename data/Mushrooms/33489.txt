After ingesting the tea, my SO and I walked to a nearby park, because I had been hoping that a nature-like environment would be good for coming up. The effects came on VERY quickly, I felt a slight 'whooshiness' as I crossed the street into the park not 200 feet after exiting the house. This feeling built up gradually. I was still extremely anxious and uncomfortable, and we sat on a bench while I shook my leg an anticipation and tried my best to enjoy myself. I tried to joke about things going on in the park but it didn't really seem to help.
