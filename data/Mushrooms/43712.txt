-long after the laughing stopped I thanked God for the experience and asked that he protect me from self harm and embarressment. I heard a voice from the back of my mind say 'I am your only God' or 'I am the only God you've ever known.' I realized that this voice was all the laughing voices talking at once. It brought me great joy as I had been long having trouble choosing a religion and understanding my own internal dialouge vs mysticism.
