One of the things I've always loved about the couple times in the past I've had shrooms is that I can kind of sit back and examine myself and pick at my flaws and figure out how to correct them.  None of the usual barriers, none of the resistance to looking at my flaws.  I have done a fair bit of self-healing since I found shrooms.  They even help me to mold my personality to get rid of some of my more undesirable traits.  I was laying up in my bed with my wife thinking about my life and I realized that I really could see how to really turn my life around for the better.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm not some loser, I'm an IT guy that makes almost 6 figures, so I have some things going for me, but I do have some self destructive behaviors I picked up from being a neglected/slightly abused kid, and as I'm laying in my bed, I'm seeing this plan lay itself out before my eyes showing me how I need to start developing focus and take control of my life better.  It's kind of mind blowing and I realize that there isn't any way that I'll be able to remember it all, so I decide to go downstairs and write an email to myself.  Reordered a bit to put it in an easier to understand timeline.  :)
