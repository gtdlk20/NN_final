So I headed to warmth and felt a twinging regret in the back of my mind that I was giving up on facing pain. I was seeking warmth. That thought nearly brought me to tears. Because I honestly desire warmth, both physically and emotionally from those close to me. But I don't receive any, emotionally at least. I put up a front of being cold and callous, of enjoying the pain of windswept bitterness, of scorning the vulnerability that comes with love and yet I still pursue it whenever I'm given the chance. I'm living my life seeking warmth and pretending I enjoy the cold.
