Up to this point in my life I had been given numerous opportunities to experience the world of psychedelia.  I was in college at this point in my life and just coming to terms w/ who and what I was.  I'd taken many psychoactive substances including but not limited to Pot, LSD, Shrooms, Alcohol, LSA, MD(A,EA,MA) Etc.  Just to have a blast, and go away for awhile.  Not the correct path for me as I will soon learn!!
