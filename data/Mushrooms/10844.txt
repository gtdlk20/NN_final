My friend L asks me what it's like, I say ' I can't even explain it dude, the only way I can only explain it using one word, beyond. I am beyond thought, beyond reality.' My friend L is scared when I say this because I don't usually talk like that. After that All 4 of us decide to go outside and sit on his halfpipe. It is about 5:30 and Im defenetly trippin balls. When I step outside the shed doors the first thing I look at is a tree. I feel like Ive known this tree my whole life, as a friend almost. It looks like its branches are comming within inches of my face and then sucking back into the sky.
