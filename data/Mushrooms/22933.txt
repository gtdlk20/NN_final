I really don't want to defile my trip report with a description of what came out of me, but I do remember thinking that shitting your bowels out is just as much a part of life as dancing in ecstasy. While in the bathroom, I stared at myself in the mirror some more and thought about Yang (my dealer). She's facing her own problems, which are worlds away from mine, but I can still relate to the malaise she's going through. It's different, but it's having similar effects on her life. She has a destructive relationship with sleep and she's also searching for escape. I don't want to sound presumptuous  because I don't know her, but I feel like she also struggles with the issues of identity and self-acceptance that are at the root of so many of my ills.
