Anyway, after clearing my head I tidied up a little and got my silent, dark room readied with headphones, blanket, pillows, and cigarettes.  Then I took a hot bath.  I find this helps ease me into the severe boundary dissolution of the psilocybin trance.  It also helps combat the chill.  During the bath I got the first alerts.  My limbs began to take on a strange jelly-like quality and there was a sense of something large looming on the horizon of my consciousness.  I carefully exited the tub and dried off.  By the time I was dressed, the walls were trembling, and I chanced to smoke one last cigarette while I still knew how.
