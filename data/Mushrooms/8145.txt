Some guy I didn't know came into our campsite at one point, asking if anyone had weed that he could buy. I told him I did and that I could sell him some, but that I didn't know where the weed was. I guess one of my friends did know where it was, or I told them where to look, I don't remember. But my big bag of weed appeared and was now in my hands. It felt absolutely weightless. What is this green stuff in this bag? I forgot. But this strange man wanted some of it, so I gave him a little bit. He gave me this weird looking piece of paper with numbers on it in exchange. I had no idea what it was or what I was supposed to do with it, but my pocket seemed to be a good place to put it.
