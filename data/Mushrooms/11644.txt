I wasn't sure what to expect, but as we came around a corner, he told us to be quiet, the oracle was up ahead. We came through the trees and there was a massive, old, overturned tree. It had beetle-eaten patterns all over it and what looked like a giant face. One of its eyes had exploded in a lump of wood and bark, but the other was still intact. Our trip-sitter told us it was the 'eye of sight, and the eye that has seen.' We stayed with the oracle for about an hour, touching the bark and looking at all the patterns and grooves. After hiking for about 7 hours, we headed back to my apartment and drank beers until we all fell asleep-which is, by the way, the absolute best way to end a trip.
