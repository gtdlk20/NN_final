During the summer of 2013, while on a mountain climb in Alaska, I had a minor epiphany. As the writer CS Lewis describes, a moment that contains all moments. Days later, as I analyzed the experience, I became convinced that there were issues in my heart that needed resolution and clarity, I knew that these issues were connected with my Clearlight-years. Since I am a very private person, and wouldnt think of asking for advice from someone who had never taken LSD in a serious manner, I decided that the only way to gain resolution was to take the magical mystery tour again and to go deep enough to jar my paradigm.
