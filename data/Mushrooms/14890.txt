I first used magic mushrooms (p. semilanceata as it happened to be) in 2002, at the beginning of a long and strange journey that 'ended' some years later.  Really what happened was I went on various pharmaceuticals starting in 2005, hoping to be able to 'fit in' more, and to numb the pain of recent losses, all it did was give me a lasting case of tardive akathisia.  No pharms since late 2015.
