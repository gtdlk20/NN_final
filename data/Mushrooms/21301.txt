After what seemed like an hour (its a mile drive), we got to our destination, and found she still wasn't home, so we decided to smoke a little bit more weed, since the mushroom effects were tapering off (this was a couple hours after taking them.) After smoking, the effects of both the weed and the shrooms came back hard, my mind was completely buzzed and exhausted at once, we couldn't do much besides sit and trance in and out, talking a little bit too.
