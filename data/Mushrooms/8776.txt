12:00 am Â– I can see now, but the visuals are still insane. I am astounded by what I just experienced, and am filled with a huge amount of energy for some reason. I feel like a wolf, a master of my own being. I laugh and entertain myself reciting trippy poetry off the top of my head. My friends return from the woods. I can hardly talk coherently unless its something outlandish and trippy. The walls of the house appear to be coated in red, sweaty skin. I am still surprised by how powerful these shrooms were. The rest of the night is occupied with a seven foot bong and lying in bed unable to sleep.
