The night started out normal, interesting textures that looked like they were constantly moving, music was moving these colors.  About 3 hours into the trip I look over and realize that my friend was goo-ing and gah-ing like a baby and I realize we were in like a babys room of some sort. I was on Pandora trying to play Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd that my friend kept requesting and requesting only all I could see was my computer seeing, No, thats not what I want. Which I interpreted as the computer telling me that I didnt want to be comfortably numb.
