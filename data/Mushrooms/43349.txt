People in their normal behaviors are two dimensional. They perform all these actions that society deems normal. When visiting another world on a psychedelic, their actions take on a new shape. To normal people, these actions look quite odd. They would see a person staring into space, making strange movements, and describing objects that didn't exist. These actions make no sense to normal people; much like a 3D object makes no sense to a 2D individual. I imagined psychedelics as starter kits for people wishing to journey into another spiritual dimension. I thought that maybe there was some wise individual who could make this journey by his own accord, without any outside substance. He truly must be a god.
