During the trip itself, it is often unrecognized but crucial to remember that the user does have the ability to directly control the course of the trip themselves. The intense, abstract thoughts and visuals that come and go leave in user in a sense of awe. They may feel like they are simply following some mystic, preordained pathway through an abyss of the unknown. However, as Ive mentioned, with experience comes the knowledge of how to guide a trip, and changing the course of a psychedelic experience is easy, provided the user doesnt forget its possible. It is recommended that the user decides and focuses on what they wish to see and where they wish to go before the experience. This can be why meditation proves helpful.
