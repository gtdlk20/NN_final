As I experience this revelation, my body becomes saturated with sadness. I sob incessantly, something enormous and vibratory wells up in me. Like the little boy, I try to scramble away from it, but it seizes and shakes my entire frame. I can't name it, but my mouth opens like a sewage main, and a black sort of energy comes rushing forth. By now, every cell in my body is vibrating, I am about to burst at the seams. A howl forms in my throat. A howl, a scream that goes on for hours. I am now on my knees about to explode with - with ANGER! ANGER! My friend is frightened and crying as he witnesses the pain. The sitter holds me, or should I say, is restraining me. Suddenly the howl stops, and the anger is spent. I get up and say: 'That's it. I am coming out as a man. I am no longer a child'. Even though I am journeying, I know I have never experienced release on such a scale. I also know this is a very meaningful rite of passage. And that I have been healing beyond my wildest expectations, thanks to therapy, the journey work and my loved ones.
