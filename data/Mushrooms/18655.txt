I had a fair amount anxiety that morning, sort of in the same realm as anxiety before you go to get a cavity filled at the dentist, if that makes sense. After ingestion I had a bit of difficultly sitting down and relaxing. I want going around the house cleaning things up, prepping things, my mind and body not wanting to relax and let things happen.
