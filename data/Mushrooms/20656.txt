It was at this time that I remember feeling certain I was back to baseline. My face was really sore from all the poking, and the corners of my blanket and pillow were still wet from saliva. I looked at my phone, made note of the time, and went to get myself something to eat so that I wouldnÂ’t feel like death in the morning. I do not remember when I feel asleep anymore, but I thanked my newfound friend and whoever else was willing to listen for the wonderful night and went to bed.
