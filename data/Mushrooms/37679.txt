After many attempts to regain arm and leg control I wandered into the living room again.  The roommate had come home and they were talking else where.  I sat in the same chair I had been in before and just closed my eyes.  The visuals were more intense out there, which I can only attribute to the dark room and the glow of the tv screen: giving off the only light, it gave the room a magnificent blue to red alternating pattern.  I could make out the closed-eye visuals well at this point.  The first visual I was able to make out appeared to be a liquid wall, which seemed to be trying to keep me out of someplace.  This wall seemed to be made of two layers, and resembled thick organic chain link fence.  Upon closer inspection it turned out not to be a wall, but transformed into a complete biological system of some life force.  What I was seeing were veins and arteries pumping multicolored liquid bubbles, like a lava lamp, throughout my entire visual field.  I felt like I had wandered into my unconscious mind's respiratory system. The fluidic motions were interrupted when I heard the roommate say 'John, John... you don't talk much when you're tripping do you?' All I could do was give a big cheesy grin and say no.
