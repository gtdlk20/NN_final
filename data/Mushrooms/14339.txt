All throughout the second hour, negative emotions kept washing over me, and I struggled, trying to find peace within it all. Finally, I decided that this trip was like a deep cleansing. The bad trip was my mind reaching into itself and cleaning out all of the bad gunk. I decided that this trip was like a deep cleansing. The bad trip was my mind reaching into itself and cleaning out all of the bad gunk. I told myself that though it felt bad now, if I just let it happen, gave myself over to it, then I would come out on the other side refreshed and more ready to take on life than before. I relaxed a little. Suddenly, a chorus of inner voices began reassuring me that they loved me, and that they didnÂ’t mean to hurt me, but that they had my best interest in mind. They reminded me that my friends and family too, even when they hurt me, also wanted the same for me, to be healthy and happy. I began to cry so many tears of joy. I opened my eyes and looked around the room. It was bright, and cheery, and felt so warm and wonderful to me. It was still swaying and moving in tune with the music, but I knew the bad part of the trip was over. About two hours had passed since I first ate the shrooms.
