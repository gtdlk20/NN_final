We got home and everybody else but my wife left. By this point I had no idea or conception of anything but time and space and how to use my robotic body. I felt trapped inside my body. And we still had some chores to do that day, we needed to finish cleaning our backyard and garage as it was filled with large wooden slats  and rocks. So, I need to throw those wooden slats away, I wasn't sure if I could ever lift it, but I don't know from where I got this incredible strength lifted it and threw it to the other side of the wall, I did this to every single wooden slat that I would find in my way.
