We went outside so I could enjoy a beer and a cigarette, R insisted on smoking a joint he rolled but I said I wasn't a fan of smoking weed on mushrooms. He started laying in his hammock and I started to pace, drinking and smoking, he kept repeating 'Man, I'm just so high, I'm just so high.' The next bits a blur, all I know is that I ended up back in R's room. He seemed a little anxious which concerned me, I said words I now regret telling him, 'Why are you so scared?' I think this set the tone for his trip, while mine had been set while we were going up the hill. We started talking for a bit only for him to start manically laughing, I told him to stop because it overwhelming but at one point he laughed so hard it overpowered any other noise, I told him that he needed to stop because 'You're gonna go hysteric.' he seemed insulted, which certainly wasn't my intention, I was trying to help. He kept clarifying that wasn't hysteria and I interrupted saying I needed to get some water.
