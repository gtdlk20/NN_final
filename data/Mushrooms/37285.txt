In retrospect it was a perfectly reasonable thing to say, but somehow mentally somersaulted myself into believing that I'd died and was now a ghostlike observer, I did a double take. I inferred that this reality was the first part of the afterlife, where 'God' controlled characters and scenery made to look exactly like the people and place where I'd died. I tried talking to these characters, warily, considering that they were actually puppets of 'God'. And yes, this is all a bit mashup.
