Perhaps echoing Jack's womb bound maneuver, working my way rotating round clockwise I ended up lying upside down on the sofa, my head hanging down. I considered that everything's much better that way round, for one thing there's NO DUST! This may have been somewhat inspired by a photo I had seen at the Tate Modern earlier in the week of the artist upside-down, tied to a chair, reading a book (held upside down). The artist was hanging upside down, but the picture had been inverted. With pleasure at feeling utterly abstracted from ordinary reality I kept completely losing track of time, I felt outside of it, minutes passing ridiculously slowly. The carpet and ceiling swirled with patterns rising and falling, which I seemed to be able to control with my mind somewhat.
