While I waited for the effects to come on, I reclined in my bed and watched Family Guy on Adult Swim. As I felt the tingling in my legs and the stomach cramps begin, I recollected on my previous trip a couple days earlier. In hindsight, I probably shouldn't have taken another trip in such a short amount of time from my previous one, but what can I do now? I decided to make one last trip to the bathroom before the effects got any stronger, and then returned to my bed.
