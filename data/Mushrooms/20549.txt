While planning to spend a few days with my girlfriend at her place I decided to make some mushroom tea and take it with me. I used exactly one hundred mushrooms of various sizes. By this time the mushrooms had been dried for month or so. I boiled 4 cups of water then added the 100 mushrooms and 2 Lipton tea bags. I stirred it up and let it sit in the fridge over night. The next day I stirred again then strained the liquid off. I added a little water so I once again had 4 cups. I added sugar to taste as I drank the tea.
