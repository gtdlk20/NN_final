For I while I listened intently to the soundtrack to The Passion of the Christ. (Disclaimer, I like the movie but in no way endorse Mel Gibson or some of his less than perfect views.) I was able to appreciate the mystery of the historic Gospel narrative, its oriental nature, the ancientness, the exoticness, etc.
