In a very good mood, I arrived home from work. I chronologically put together a plan of action after I call the Party House to see what was up.  My friends were just getting ready to put theirs down the hatch, so I decided to do the same.  I would quickly make some pasta, and put my bag in w/ the sauce, Shower, Shit, Shave, Dress and be ther within an hour.  Perfect plan I thought, by the time that I arrive to the house I will be just about where my friends were.
