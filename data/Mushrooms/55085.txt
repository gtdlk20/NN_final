The trees were like a boundary line.  Once beyond, the dry grass flew outward in beautiful geometry.  I love the visual component of mushrooms.  The whitish grass was gorgeous on the raw dirt, under a purple sky.   I love the visual component of mushrooms.  The whitish grass was gorgeous on the raw dirt, under a purple sky.  We walked a bit, and I fell to my knees.  My intense appreciation for my surroundings clashed continually with my ideas about angry people owning the land we were on.  After letting this roil around for a few minutes, I asked my friend if we could return to his house.  We walked the long way back as my body began to disassociate a bit.  It wasn't hard to walk, it just felt a bit like I was a puppet.  I was very sleepy, or I wasn't, but I yawned deep, deep yawns.  They seemed to begin and end beyond my body's capability to yawn.
