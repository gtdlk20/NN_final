Then, something miraculously euphoric happened, I knew who I was, I knew my girlfriend, my family and my life. I felt whole again, this didn't seem to happen to R, he was panicked, he kept saying he was so high and so confused. I was still tripping balls too but decided we could put on The Office to calm down, this seemed to help us both be quiet. I had to pretend to be in it, I did my very best to help but Jesus Christ, Jim's and Michael's foreheads were so big, eyes were all over them. That wasn't the most reassuring. Eventually all settled down.
