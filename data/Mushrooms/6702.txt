The next morning I wake up and go to piss, I stumble around everywhere like I am drunk, didn't think anything of this at the time (hey, I just woke up).  Finally we all get dressed and go downstairs to get water/food whatever; I can't hold a glass because my entire arm starts shaking uncontrollably, at one point my legs give out suddenly while I am walking and I fall on my ass, I'm still not really taking this seriously, though I'm beginning to wonder what the hell is going on.  For the mutual reasons of finishing the bowl and helping me out we go back up to my room and complete last night's session, afterwards I decide (don't know why) I was feeling better.  The three of us leave the house so I can walk them to a bus stop; on the way my legs start to get this really crazy feeling, it's like they were trying to move the other way or something, I had forgotten how to walk normally.  We're going down this really steep hill and I'm falling behind because I can't fucking walk, I try to catch up to my friends and fall; they turn around and I try to get up, I walk a couple paces and fall again, I tell them to just go on and eventually they do.  This really sucked, my muscles (and I'm a serious runner so my legs are pretty powerful) just wouldn't hold my weight or something.
