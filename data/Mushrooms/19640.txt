I hadn't experienced anything like it before and I was pretty scared.  It was the coldest night of the year, sub-zero temperatures and about a foot of snow, not to mention the fact that every sidewalk on campus was covered with inch-thick ice.  I told my friends I was going for a walk; in reality, I wanted to go back to my dorm and fall asleep to get rid of the incredible feelings I was experiencing.
