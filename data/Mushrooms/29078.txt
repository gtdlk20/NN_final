I had wanted this trip to be really good, something special. What I actually got was something completely and totally different from what I ever could have imagined beforehand, yet no less special. It was an incredible experience, and thinking back on it I do not regret it. That said, I have no desire to ever repeat that kind of dose again. It's scary thinking back at just how little control I had over my thoughts and actions. Thankfully I didn't end up doing anything stupid or make an ass of myself, but that could have been a real possibility. Especially if I somehow made it to the festival before I peaked. Not to mention the pain in my stomach. That alone was enough of a reason to never do that kind of dosage again. I've done shrooms plenty of times since this experience, but nothing has ever, or hopefully ever will, match the intensity of what I experienced that night.
