I can see how some people have went crazy on shrooms or acid because it totally gets rid of the concept of the self and could make this existence seem not important, or maybe they fully regained the concept of self and the real world would seem like a faded painting, never fully there. I also sensed a very powerful and loving thought that I believe come from another spirit on a much higher plane than mine. Its message was to exist, to be one, it said that the more I realized the concept the further the thought of the concept would fade till nothing but pure existence remained. At that time the thought started to fade along with the rest of the world as I drifted towards pure existence. I never got totally there.
