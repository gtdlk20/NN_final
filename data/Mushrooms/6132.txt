I followed my plan to the T, but something went wrong, or right depending on your view of the situation, along the way.  I sat down at the table w/ my pasta dumped the psilocybin on top mixed well and ate.  I then picked out my clothes for the evening, grabbed a towel and jumped into the shower.  I washed my body and then just stood in the stream of water for about 5 mins.  I then decide that I needed to get a move on and reached for the shampoo to finish my shower ritual.
