From this, Ive learned a lot about attitudes to drugs. Its not enough for me to take them to get high and have a laugh. Theyre so valid as ways to open yourself up to new experiences and thought processes. The drugs debates just seem even more irrelevant and frustrating. You cant blanket term drugs. Its totally misunderstood.
