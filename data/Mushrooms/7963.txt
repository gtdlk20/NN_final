The first thing I noticed that might become a problem was the music. We were listening to 'After Midnight' the Eric Clapton cover. I quickly realized that not only was my appreciation of music enhanced: I was hearing it too "well". I was experiencing it so intently it was almost as if I knew what the musicians were thinking that day; their mood, their most profound intention. I mused that I could tell what they'd had for lunch. The level of insight was so far beyond being enjoyable enhancement; it was so intimate that it I was overwhelmed. I was then struck by the realization that I was suddenly not only high but higher than I could handle, so I decided to excuse myself and step into the night for some air.
