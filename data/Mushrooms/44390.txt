I began to see more and more. When I would concentrate on my friend, he would turn into light, made of long green looking gems all up and down his body. He looked like he was sitting in some futuristic crystal throne. I started seeing the auric field around everything, it looked like rainbow rays of light, and they were creating patterns. I saw what looked like a dove in it, and then it moved back and forth like rails moving past each other. My friend put his hand through the air, and it split in two like a cell dividing, then it conjoined back together.
