While I stood there, I began to notice the clouds and blobs I could see with my eyes closed begin to take on definate shapes. Colorful and intricate fractals started to appear and 'dance' to the music. I was amazed at the power of my mind to create these things that my computer struggled to produce. I watched with awe as the fractals moved and zoomed in to reveal new and wonderful shapes. I couldn't control what I was seeing, but that didn't bother me at all. About this time a few of the guys came downstairs and found me laying on the floor with my eyes closed (note that I don't actually remember how I got there). They tried to bring me upstairs, and I tried to tell them to just leave me. I couldn't talk. One or two words would come out and suddenly the sentence would change and another one or two words of a different thought would come out. I remember KNOWING that it was because I was only partially in this world and this reality. Eventually the guys just decided to leave me down there, with the music.
