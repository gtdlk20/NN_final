To me, the taking of such a substance and at such quantities was on par with preparing for a deeply sacred ritual. I felt I was not only prepared intellectually, but spiritually. The cubensis was grown organically from spores in syringes by a friend of a friend, so I did not need to be concerned about the taste. I simply prepared as suggested by Terence McKenna. I ate little prior, I drank plenty of water, I watched How to Take Psychedelics by Mr. McKenna several times, and finally, I prepared a rather large bowl of weed. I made sure that I was to be alone and undisturbed for at least four hours. I ate the 5 grams of mushrooms and stared at Facebook until I neared the 45-60 minute mark.
