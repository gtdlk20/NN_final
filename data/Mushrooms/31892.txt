A few days later I agreed to trip at the beach with a close friend. I split the mushrooms between us. I diced up 4.5g of the dried mushrooms and ate them in a peanut butter sandwich. I then proceeded to walk to the station with the remainder of the dried mushrooms in a ziplock baggie, to catch a train to meet my friend. The journey in total was around an hour, and seeing I had fasted for 12 hours beforehand, it did not take very long before I started to feel the effects.
