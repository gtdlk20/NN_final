Truly, though, it gave me a much greater understanding and appreciation of how it could be used on a spiritual level. I knew that night I had reached something I would never touch again, at least not for some time, it was a different level, a different plane of existence and I understand now why so many cultures pursued spirituality through the use of natural psychoactives (mushrooms, peyote, etc.) It was so clean and pure, I could feel that it was natural, it was from a living organism, not a chemical. It was beyond any high I'd ever experienced, psychadelics truly are a different class of drug from anything else. After seeing the most beautiful things I've ever seen in my life, I can understand that now.
