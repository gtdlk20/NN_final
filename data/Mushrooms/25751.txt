My friends tell me they decided to go home for the trip and left me out on this hill... All I remember was picturing myself in a large rave type concert/party out in the hills. About 2 hours later I somehow found my way back to my friends house were I was quick to realize all of us were tripping hard. One friend and I went to the front yard to admire the 'perfect sky' as my other friends stayed in to experiece the 'perfect song' and 'perfect guitar rift'....
