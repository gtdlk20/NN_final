Before I get into the meat of the report, a prelude as to why this is such a curious trip: In April of 2006, I had a bag of one ounce of dried cubensis mushrooms. Some were eaten, some were given away, I ended up with about 15g of them left in the bag. I ate 7.5g one weekend, had a really intense, but great trip. Three weeks later, I ate the last 7.5g. To say I was unprepared is a mild understatement.
