It was so hot and I felt like I was suffocating. All I wanted to do was go home. I left the beach at 4pm and looked for someplace that might have air conditioning to go into. After more disorientation, I ended up in the Bally's casino. The sounds and lights from the slot machines were too much to bear, so I went back onto the boardwalk. I continued to walk for what felt like forever, and the casino buildings looked bigger than life. I found an outdoor shower and showered the sand off of myself.
