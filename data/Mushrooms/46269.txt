We found Tim and Cathi sitting around the cylindrical jellyfish tank. This area was very dark but the tank itself was lit by black lights. Watching the jellyfish brought up all sorts of thought patterns focussed about the life of a jellyfish. They seemed like the most pointless organism on earth. A clear jelly sack moving around with nothing but instinct and absolutely no memory, it wouldnt even know it was in a tank. It wouldnt even have any enjoyment in its existence because its whole life was virtually determined by the ocean currents. But would the jellyfish care. Was it so simple that the pointlessness of its life didnt occur to it, could it recognise some things were better off then it. The life of this sad organism was pointless but in a way it seemed much better then ours. Sure it could never be happy but only because there was no such thing as happiness in its primitive brain and so likewise it could never be sad. It was an entity with no mind of its own, and perhaps that's better then the alternative. On a visual note I could swear the tank was full of tiny fish which I would see clearly for a moment but would disappear when I got up to look at them.
