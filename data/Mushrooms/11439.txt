Upon closing my eyes, four identical fractal spirals began tracing their way out into a great black void.  If I concentrated hard enough I could actually ride on one of the four as it spun off into infinity.  The difficulty was that riding the spiral too long made me dizzy.  If I was in any one of these alternate realities for too long, I grew extremely uncomfortable.  I found that it was easiest to let myself not choose any one reality and to attempt to simultaneously exist in each reality for as long as I could.  At these moments when I inhabited all of my available bodies simultaneously, were the only moments when I felt the same euphoria of my previous experience.
