When I felt the effects of the mushrooms starting their queasy, tidal rush in my stomach and chest, I pressed play, put my headphones on, and leaned back. At the time I didnt yet have prescription eyeglasses and my eyesight overall wasnt great so I was watching with a pair of dirty reading glasses on. As I the movie started, the low fidelity of VHS made me feel nostalgic. The colors seemed very saturated and I wondered when the last time I actually listened to classical music had been before this because it felt so satisfying now. I was grinning ear-to-ear in the darkness. I felt physically moved to sit up and wave my outstretched arms in focused circles rotating from my shoulders. It felt almost like an athletic warmup. I felt no anxiety. I felt an energy starting to pass through me that felt like waves of YES. I felt pretty confident that this was going to be a good time. I started rotating my neck in circles and it felt like my head and my whole body were rubbing up against a membrane that had the whole of the universe on the other side of it it felt like my head and my whole body were rubbing up against a membrane that had the whole of the universe on the other side of it. Like I was wearing my consciousness like a glove or it was enveloping me. I started to notice that when I blinked my eyes and moved my head, images I saw with my eyes open would smear and become fixed behind my eyelids.
