Then there was a voice telling me it was really not OK to give into this and I should just keep going forward. This voice at the same time felt like it was me, and like it was something quite external. I had mixed feelings about this voice - it seemed well-intentioned but I was really wondering what it was trying to accomplish. What is the point of going through all the motions of this life - why is everybodys life so similar and why do people just keep doing the same thing again and again seemingly without seeing it doesnt make much sense at all? Reflecting on my daily activities it seemed very much like Im a small, predictable element in a huge machine (society) that actually serves no goal whatsoever.
