So I decided to call the guy in which I got the shrooms. Lets just say his name is Matt. I try calling his cell but he's not in range. He is a good 30 minutes off the freeway from where I was. So I continued to call his cell, leaving desparate messages to no avail. Finally he picks up. 'Hey man. Dude. Isnt this crazy?' I said 'I am not ok. Im flippin out Im gonna die I dont know whats goin on.' He proceeded to tell me that I was ok and to just calm down and that they were on their way to come and get me. So we hung up the phone and I started to think. Wait, did I actually talk to him? Or was I just trippin. So I tried callin again. No answer.
