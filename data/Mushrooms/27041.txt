Pretty suddenly, I came to myself. The music had stopped at the chaotic mess of mind that I was swirling in spat me back out and I realized that the only noise in the room was the small hiss one of the pipes under the sink was giving off. I found myself sitting in the middle of the floor with my knees pulled up to my chest just staring at the wall. For a minute I could see both sides of the coin. I could see how a still quiet room could just as easily be perceived as a riot of sound and experience. I collected myself off the floor. I still had a small (very small) feeling of fear. My mind was still racing but I could feel myself coming back to a more manageable level of mind. I knew that I had left the house in shamble with my frantic mental collapse. I cleaned up and decide to go to sleep.
