The phone rang again and Matt told me that they were outside my complex. I said, 'Ok, I gotta put some clothes on.' Matt replied, 'YouÂ’re fucking naked? Fuck yeah man!!! How many did you take?' 'All of them.' I replied. 'Holy shit man. Fuck yeah.' So I put some clothes on not thinking about the shirt I grabbed to put on and walked outside. A bunch of people were waiting for me and I just busted up in laughter as well as them. We all started hugging and talking and I felt so incredibly satisfied and happy.
