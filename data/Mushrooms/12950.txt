I had dimmed the lights, had Jimi Live @ Woodstock playin on the sound system, had plenty of vitamin C including oranges, orange juice, and VC 2000 mg. I don't know if it really helps- but why not. I live in the mountains, so at the time there remained about four feet of snow across the land, and had warm gear in case I wanted to go outside.
