I got into the shower turned on the water and the feel of it felt disgusting I got into the shower turned on the water and the feel of it felt disgusting I thought some kind of sludge was running all over my body. I Washed myself violently trying to get rid of the feeling. I picked up a bottle of body wash and the smell of it was a clean smell that made me feel better. I used all of my friends body wash (A whole bottle, I paid him back today) and it made me feel clean again, refreshed at last. I then sat in the water and felt relief and happiness again. I took another 20 minutes to put my clothes back on. I was having insane visuals and it looked like my shirt and my pants were talking to me. I had two shirts in the bathroom and one of them I condemned. I had a long conversation with the shirt I liked about how I didn't like the other shirt.
