Sometimes you can actually get what you want, and then it is a motherfucker.  The first session I was pulled into space and hung in front of a black hole and then watched a ghost pass through me as I dropped down into the fetal position.  The rest of the trip was survivable but I was glued to the floor for about 4 hours at what in my mind looked like a mountain on top of me.  This mountain was dripping in one solid layer as if caramel was running all down it.  The 'caramel' part was really very tiny bands of repeating symbols, everything from jean pockets to sandwich icons were lining up in striations all the way around it.  The hallucinations were strange in that they were only there when I closed my eyes and even then it was if the whole thing was just implied.  After recovering I had 2 weeks of what felt like the clean slate that Ayahuasca leaves people with.  I haven't drank more than about 3/4ths of a beer since.  I was finally able to let go of my divorce from 2 years before, even the hate that was building in me for the guy who stole my wife of 15 years away with his magic bag of meth.  I was finally forgiving people and even myself.
