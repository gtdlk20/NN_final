Once back to my friends house we get out and thank them. We quickly went downstairs where we talked for about 3 hours in the corner about I dont even know. Thats when I tried to stand up and I couldnt. I told me friends and neither could they. All we could do was crawl, so we crawled around, as if we were babies. And slowly we could start to stand up, and run and skip around, and thats when her little brother came down and started running around as if we were all little kids. Soon we just chilled, and grabbed her guitar and jammed for a while as if going throw a life. After that we all lay down in our beds and talked about death and soon fell asleep which all seemed to be the stages of life, and we went through them all in just one night.
