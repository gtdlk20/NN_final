The voice told me that the space that I was looking out over was mine, that it had always been mine and that it will always be mine. It told me that in this space I am the same as god and I am free to be exactly what I am. It told me that I could return to this space whenever I want to. It told me that this space is actually all around me all the time and that I am the same as god in that space as well. It told me that none of the barriers that I feel up against in my life really exist because everything I think of as reality or life were just illusions. It told me that everything that I have ever had a true drive to do could be achieved. It told me that all the things that Ive ever done in my life that keep me from being in a peaceful state are no longer necessary. It actually used the phrase: You dont need to do the shit that sucks anymore. You dont need to do the shit that sucks anymore.
