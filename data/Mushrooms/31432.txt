I am currently living with my parents (I am a functioning adult, but at the moment this is practical and pleasant), they went away for a movie but knew that I was taking shrooms (theyre open-minded). They were surprised I would take them on my own, but I told them its actually not such an uncommon thing to do and it can be very introspective. I have used salvia on my own on earlier occasions, which was a generally good experience. Mushrooms I had only used in company so far.
