The thing is, as humans were constantly changing  our thoughts are constantly changing; our bodies are constantly changing; and our outlooks and perspectives on life are constantly changing. Thats true whether an individuals high on drugs or not. And while some people may think or act or respond differently on different substances, or learn lasting lessons from certain drugs, I dont believe its right to judge someone based on what drugs they use, though some drugs, predominantly psychedelics, do certainly seem to help unlock mental gateways; doors of perception, as Aldous Huxley called them. And that evening, I was feeling an indescribable connection and sense of love to everything around me. I didnt want to hurt anybody.
