I'm not sure exactly how long I was laying there, but because of the nausea I felt sick. Two times I dry heaved, fighting to keep my Taco Bell stomach at bay. In a state of half-consciousness and half-sleep, I had conjured a scenario in my head where I thought I had died. I had been given deadly mushrooms and I was experiencing the end of my life. I had thought my life was a hallucination that took place in real-time in my head up until that moment: the time of death. I was not mentally prepared for death and with each thought I had after this initial 'realization', I became more and more convinced that I was dead or dying.
