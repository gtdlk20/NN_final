This perspective was quick and faded faster than the others. It happened prior to the hospital scene. I was removing a helmet of some sort only to look around at my friends who were excited. I had impressions of how was it and a sense of awe, as if I did something heroic or incredible. I cut them off by stating in disbelief that it [reality] wasnt real. I was awed, and overcome by the realization that I wasnt who I thought I was. That I was home, that I was in some virtual reality simulator, and now Im home. I half acknowledged this during the experience as well because I knew this was a simple representation that allowed my mind to understand what was going on.
