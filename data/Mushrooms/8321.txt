After a series of obstacles preventing me from dancing (hair in my face, needed water, forgot pipe or music, too cold outside) I was so agitated and upset that I was crying while I danced, which my friends remarked on later as being eerily beautiful. I twirled, full of manic unstable energy. It felt like the entire universe was finally paying me attention. All eyes, all consciousness were on me. I felt like I had willed this condition into existence with a hitherto unknown special power I had inside.
