8:00-we called my girlfriend and she came and picked us up. We went to taco bell and I was trying to eat but I didnt have a mouth so it was kind of hard. I was still freaking out but I was just keeping to myself and could not talk to anyone. It felt like EVERYONE in the entire world was looking at me and laughing at me. Thats the best way to describe the feeling.
