After an indeterminant period had elapsed, I decided to turn in, so we split up at about two in the morning and I staggered back to my room, fell on my bed and closed my eyes, but to no avail, for three hours I lay sitting there, wondering about the purpose of human existence and what my purpose was before finally dozing off at about five in the morning. After such an incredible trip, I roused myself out of bed and made all my classes.
