If I turned my head and looked somewhere else, sometimes the hallucinations would start to disperse, but then all the geometrical shapes in my field of vision would meld to together and rush at me, and I'd be back in this alien world. The biggest underlying theme of the trip was technology. It was like I was being imparted with knowloedge about the human potential and the infinte other worlds and civilizations out there. It didn't seem like the kind of shit that my subconscious mind would create. It was completely alien, completely real, and unlike anything I could have begun to imagine. I don't know what mushrooms are, but I think they are a key to understanding the nature of reality and the nature of the human mind. I was not prepared for anything I saw, even if you're an experienced tripper, this is intense shit, it totally fucks with your head. Proceed with caution, but if you think you can handle it, a level 5 trip is truly something else and it's absolutely mindlblowing.
