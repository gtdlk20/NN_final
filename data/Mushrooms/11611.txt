I felt like I needed my cat, and my one year old cat T (although she is the one that is usually not affectionate and does not like to be held) ran up between me and J and laid her front paws and head on him.  I touched her and J, and told him to put his hand on T, to feel her purr and for her to comfort him.  Cats can sense when their owners are in distress and will show support.  I held her between us with my left hand, which she would normally run away from (being held and/or restrained in a spot...she hates it), and I held my right hand over J's chest, not touching it.  I focused on absorbing energy from the universe, and from T, until I felt like I would explode.
