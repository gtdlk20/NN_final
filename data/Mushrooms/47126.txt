My four friends from college finally got our hands on some of these magic fungi.  We started off around 8:30PM, all taking half an 1/8.  Beforehand, we prepared a travel plan to our local nature preserve.  As we walked towards, we felt lightheaded, threshold effects, nothing special.  As we entered into this clearing with a huge bridge, the onset effects began to take hold.
