I awoke from my nap, and had an incredible urge to ingest the mushrooms, I took out the 1/4 and started to pray with the mushrooms, this gave me the strength to not question the power of the mushroom. I slowly ate the fungus and swallowed it down with some apple juice, for the vitamin c and to help the bitter taste of the stems, the caps had no bitter taste at all. I didn't want to wait for the onset so I put my body under my blanket and listened to some music.
