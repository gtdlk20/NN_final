After the movie ended (about 2.5 hours after dosing) we were both feeling pretty good and started to wander around my house looking at things. I became very interested in the pillows on my couch and the curtains in the living room. Patterns and colors were fascinating. There was mild visual distortion in my peripheral vision, but whenever I looked around things were normal again. We walked around for a half hour or so, then decided to go downstairs and check out the computer.
