We went inside and started playing on the piano togethor.  It was AMAZING!!  We arent that good at the piano in the first place, but I didnt even think about that.  It felt like every note was an addition to a masterpiece that we were creating.  The keys on the piano were rolling like waves.  I played like I was expressing my feelings.  Then when me and z were playing it felt like we were talking to each other through the piano.  It was by far the best feeling ever.
