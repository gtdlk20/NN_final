Last night I found the plastic snap lock baggy that was in my pocket on new years day. The remaining shrooms were crushed into a powder. I emptied about an egg cup full of it into a tall plastic container followed by 350 mL of orange juice and a 500 mg vitamin C tablet. Vitamin C changes everything. I wizzed this concoction up with a stick mixer (kitchen appliance) until it was very well blended.
