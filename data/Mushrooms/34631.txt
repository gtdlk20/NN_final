We got to the festival and started scoping out a spot to camp.  Within 5 minutes of getting to the festival a man approached me with a backpack full of shrooms and chocolate bars for 15 bucks a bar and 20 bucks a bag.  I bought a bar and immediately ate it, it was 5 o clock.  We found a spot and set up camp and within 20 minutes I was feeling the effects.  I couldn't help but giggle and smile at my friends who were stoned but not tripping.  30 feet from the camp site was a giant football field sized field of bright yellow flowers that seemed to glow in a flouresent tint.  The sound of bongos and guitars filled the air and I couldn't help but feel great.  10 mins later I bought a bag of shrooms from the same guy that I bought the bar from.  I ate them plain with water and then went to the concert.  I was still trippin pretty hard but then the bag I ate started to kick in after another 20 mins.  The sounds of the band playing seemed to reach out and touch my mind in a way I can't explain.  The sounds seemed to morph into colors and a strange fuzzy feeling in my head.  I was giggling and thinking of thousands of thoughts at once.
