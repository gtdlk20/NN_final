I remember my wife leaving to walk around the room around 6:30, and going to use the restroom for what was likely a brief time but seemed like a vast amount of time before returning.  She was frustrated with the duration of the trip and was unstable walking and said she felt like she was really heavy and weighed 400 pounds.  She became full of anxiety and stress, and after returning to bed experienced a vision of a tiger and stripes on the ceiling and seemingly a lot of fear of the tiger.  She said I became the tiger and wanted me to move away.  I told her to become the tiger so she wouldnÂ’t fear it.  I remember telling her to attack me as if she were the tiger, thinking that by embracing being the tiger, she could feel more active and less stressed but she insisted that made her anxiety worse.  We stood and tried to dance for a minute without that helping, then she got back into bed and I sat on the edge by her for some time.
