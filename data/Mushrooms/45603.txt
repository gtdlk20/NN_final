It is the wind horse that arises for me during the psilocybin trance; concentrating upon the breath as the anchor for awareness has the potential to open the central channel to the flow of the 'wind horse,Â” something available to us all, for it is our essential nature, and which has returned just in the nick of time to assist our awakening to the possibility of creating a new civilization, with a central focus placed upon stewardship of the fragile life of our sacred angel, the Earth. Or so this awareness asserts in my heart by its presence.
