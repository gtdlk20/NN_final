I became amused that humans tried to express all these things through movies as I watched Star Wars. I was so alienated from all human ways of life that I was curious as to why humans wanted to eat or have sex. I thought it was so trivial. Time had no meaning; it passed, but with no formula for how long a minute would be opposed to ten minutes. I wondered when I'd understand how human life is again. In this daze of philisophical thought I somehow realized that I was God, and that I could control what happens in the world through my influence of others. I began to get tired and closed my eyes. The next morning I was totally back to normal, albeit a little more hungry then usual. It was a worthwhile journey, though I wouldn't want to embark on one again for a while.
