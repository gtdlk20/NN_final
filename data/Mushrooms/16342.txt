Back in Cascadia I know several master morel hunters. They don't eat them raw. When I asked Major Morel Eyes [not his real name] about this he said that even benign shrooms like morels can make you feel sick if they aren't cooked. For my next test, I'm going to simmer 5 grams in butter like I do with morels and see how I react to that.
