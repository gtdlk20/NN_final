Then the storm came in. Winds picking up, rolling thunder, and what seemed like a torrential downpour gave me a pretty good idea that the party's over, although at this point I didn't WANT to believe it. While most people were confused, those of us on mushrooms were REALLY confused. I looked helplessly at my Rockin' R wristband hoping it would give me a hint to what I should be doing to get home (after all, the guys on the bullhorn back at HQ told us it was -important-). People started getting off on the shores looking for our tube company's trucks, trying to carry heavy-ass coolers wrapped in unwieldy tubes of their own. Waiting for the buses things devolved into some sort of Woodstocky primal state. Beer and bodies all over the place, music, and various forms of sex. The prison-esque buses arrived, I got on, and was dumped off back at the start. The storm was over, and a beautiful post-trip sunset sat on the horizon.
