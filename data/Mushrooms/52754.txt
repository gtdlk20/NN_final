I've added this section after going on my first mushroom trip.  I would like to recommend that first-time trippers be especially careful about dosage levels.  I took approximately 4 dried grams, and I had a bad first trip.  I lost all sense of reality and thought that there was a huge world-wide conspiracy against me and others who had entered the 'mushroom portal'.  I assumed that the trip would last forever, and in many ways, it seemed to.  I also almost destroyed all of the cakes in an attempt to 'close the portal'.  I thank my trip monitor for stopping me.
