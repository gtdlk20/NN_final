Certainly my experience is not unique as far as the effects of psilocybe cubensis, but according to my research it is rather rare and more similar to the experiences described on DMT, ayahuasca, or some other entheogen.  My friendÂ’s experience with the insectoid, on the other hand, is very common to psilocybin-cubensis, ayahuasca.
