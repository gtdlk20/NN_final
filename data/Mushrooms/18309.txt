We started to walk back into town and my body had such an intense feeling not know to vomit, urinate, or take a shit, I felt like I was going to explode with this feeling. On the walk back to town, I really changed I finally figured out that I need to get a serious job and get my shit straight, and that my piercings were holding me back and that I needed to wake up early and actually do something. We made it to the gas station where we all knew the girl that was working and I went to the bathroom, WOW, that was weird. I definitely peaked while sitting on the toilet at a Chevron gas station, my body had never felt anything like it, and nor can I describe it. Things got weird when I looked in the mirror and my face started to move, and the tiles on the floor started to spin, I had to get out of there, but the door was locked and I was stuck, I finally got out and was like, 'wow' that was fun.
