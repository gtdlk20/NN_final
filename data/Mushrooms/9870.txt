As I rise, these visuals leap into 3d. My bedroom floor is made out of quickly moving snakes but theyÂ’re not too scary because they are stylised snakes and they all fit together like puzzle pieces much like the art of M. C. Escher. They seem to be about 1 foot deep I am up to my knees in them. I am sitting on the edge of my bed.
