During this period I experimented with ecstasy, then lsd. Ecstasy was exactly that. Totally mind-blowing. Experiencing it with my closest friends we talked endlessly, with a profound and true connection between us all. We were able to compliment and criticise each other, without any awkwardness or ego. Pure understanding. Ecstasy taught me how to low let go of my ego, and how to have faith in myself. In so many social situations I used to say or do things in order to gain some kind of 'upper hand', to boost my ego and social standing. Ecstasy completely obliterated all that bullshit. It taught me that it doesnÂ’t matter what other people think of me, it's my own sense of self-worth that precedes contentment. The key to happiness is by doing what I want to do, for my own reasons.
