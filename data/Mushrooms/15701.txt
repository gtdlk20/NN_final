I should note at this point that there was quite a bit of construction going on in my neighborhood today, especially across the alley from my backyard. These external stimuli became a very important element during the remainder of the trip. I became acutely aware of all the noises around me including the wind, birds, dogs, and especially the construction. Every thought, feeling, and perception I experienced in my mind seemed inextricably connected to the noises around me, and vice versa. In fact, they werent really just noises anymore, but expressions of good or bad vibrational energies. When I perceived a particular energy within my own mind, there came an instantaneous and corollary change in the vibration of the surrounding environment, as if one was conducting the other. With darkness came aggressive dog barks; ominous bird caws; and saws, hammers, and nail guns. With light came gentle breeze, happy bird chirping, and a sense of general peace. Were the sounds evoking the energies in my mind, or vice versa? I dont think there was ever a separation to begin with; the energies came and went through me and my environment simultaneously.
