In short (VERY short), my experience could be best described as an overload of memories and of all the senses.  I enjoyed the experience very much and had many periods of joy, amazement, and ecstasy.  I am very glad that I experienced what I did that night.  However, it was also one of the most terrifying experiences of my life and I hope I never trip so hard again. If I were to pick the one theme that characterized the majority of my trip it would be 'the mushrooms as a living entity inside me which I was battling against, trying to hold on to some ounce of reality while the shrooms laugh and play with my mind'.
