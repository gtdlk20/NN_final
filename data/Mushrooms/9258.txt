2:15am my gf had said before we took the mushrooms that she was quite tired from work, but we decided to trip anyway. She stated that she may fall asleep after she takes them, to which I laughed and said you won't fall asleep on magic mushrooms. To my astonishment, sure enough, she was pretty much asleep on my chest! How could this be. I moved a little and she woke up, to which I questioned her about any visuals. She said she saw 3 coloured 'things' moving when she closed her eyes, which I thought was fairly tame. Maybe I should have given her more for her first dose, but she seemed content enough which is the main thing.
