Eventually the exhaustion from the experience, and the come down, over came us, and we decided to lay down and try to sleep a bit, since we had a whole week of partying ahead of us. Laying down felt incredible, to just snuggle up in the bed with a blanket, but as soon as we turned off the light, I was wide awake. My companion confirmed that the same thing had happened to him. Rather than try to get up and find something to do, we layed in the dark enjoying the last of the effects, and reflecting about the experience, and life in general. Eventually we both fell asleep, but I ended up waking up every hour or so for the whole time that I was laying there.
