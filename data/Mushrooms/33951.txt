Within an hour we were all full on into the psychedelic journey. At this time I became uneasy about the music that was being played on the stereo. The house music was just simply not compatible with the mushrooms as it lacked the sophistication and otherness and while it didnt bother Merc too much I asked if it was ok to change the flavor and they were ok with that. So I put it on Deja-vu Fabrique album compiled by Zolod. For those who dont know, it is psychedelic trance. As soon as the disc was changed, the consciousness in the room elevated to the next level. As the initial sounds of the first track spread through the air through the speakers, it synchronized with the vibe perfectly and calmed my fatigue. My two friends were blown away as soon as the CD started playing. Merc exclaimed, WOW, This is totally Amazing!! Who is this?? Our other friend, who wasnt very familiar with psytrance couldnt believe what he was hearing. In other words, the music guided our trip and grounded our spirits, melting away all negative feelings of fatigue and nausea, letting us transcend effortlessly into the Divine realms.
