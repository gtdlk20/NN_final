My conclusion was that there was significant potential in psychedelic therapy, but was careful to tell myself that it would be unlikely to be a miracle cure or magic bullet, which cures everything completely. Whether in the realm of politics, social problems, illness, disease, or behavior issues, rarely if ever does a complex problem have a simple solution. I am reminded of a magnet on a friend's fridge which says, ''For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.' - H.L. Mencken'.
