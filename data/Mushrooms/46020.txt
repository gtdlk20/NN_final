Said friend had no experience with psychedelics and looking back it was a mistake calling him over, shoulda just rode it out alone. He thought weed would bring me down so he basically kept forcing me to take bong rips which had the opposite effect of relaxing me. He thought it would be funny to put on a 'Bum Fights' DVD and I just remember feeling so horrible for those people who were willing to degrade themselves for money (ripping their own teeth out with pliers, fighting, etc..) Terrible thing to watch while tripping balls.
