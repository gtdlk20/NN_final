These two men, two samurai, do not think of this. They do not think. They act. They do not worry about predetermination. They do not insist on their autonomy, their control, however weak it may be, of something. They are not human are they? These men are killing machines theyre violence in the abstract, anthropomorphic ideas. Their actions have been written out and through the inability not to accept, they accept this.
