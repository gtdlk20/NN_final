One night in July of 2014 I decided to eat some Golden Teacher mushrooms I had acquired. My mindset at the time was somewhat neutral -- not too great, not too bad save for some anxiety I had due to my upcoming departure for school which is a 6 hour drive away. The duration of the trip took place in my room at my parents' house. It was my 3rd or so mushroom trip, however the prior experiences were quite weak; almost microdoses. I was bored that night so I eyeballed a few stems and caps, it had to be around 2.5 to 3 grams, but I have a naturally low tolerance for most substances so I figured this estimate would suffice. [note: Never take psychedelics out of boredom]
