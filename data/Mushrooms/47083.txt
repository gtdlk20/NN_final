After sitting there for an amount of time impossible to decipher, I got up, and decided to just keep moving, convinced that whatever happens is going to happen and I can't change it now, so I walked and I walked and I walked. Today, I wish I wouldn't have eaten so many because then I would have been able to stay at the circle and indulge the serenity and recreational unity. Instead I wasted my time tripping out on a delusion. I walked, then I walked some more. I wanted to go home but my sense of direction was fucked. Everything was a completely different color than it was earlier in the day. The whole faire was simply a completely different place altogether, so it was the same as trying to find my trailer when their really wasn't a trailer to find. ThatÂ’s how hopeless I was.
