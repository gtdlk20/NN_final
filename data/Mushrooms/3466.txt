The rest of my trip was composed of two aspects: 1) an intense visceral pull from the music, and 2) engrossing mental hallucinations.  As I sucked the music in as strongly as I could muster, I became suddenly aware that I was standing in front of a board of spirits which had come to council me on my earlier stumble into confusion.  I could not see the spirits but I could hear them clearly; in fact, their presence was so real that I didn't even need to pay them close attention.  The spirits existed in another dimension, and seemed to be from a future time.  They took turns explaining to me, in slow, methodical discourse, that a race of humans in another dimension had been buoyed by psychedelic experimentation and had evolved new mental capacities.  They pointed out that these evolutionary advances were not spawned by genetic predestination, but had rather been induced by combinations of free-will exercises and psychedelic experimentation.  They told me that I had been chosen to be one of their representatives in the earthly dimension, and that my order was to spur the evolutionary progression of my people as expeditiously as possible.  It was my job to have my neighbors ready, with the necessary sets of faculties and mental tools, at the desired point in space-time.
