After sitting talking about random things for half an hour I noticed the trip seemed to be weakening and the visuals were calming down. Everything was floating and settling into its place. I felt very calm and focused and that I could do absolutley anything I wanted, but all I wanted to do was sit and enjoy what had just happened. An hour later all the visuals had gone and I was left with a sense of inner peace and complete calm. We spent the rest of the day smoking bud and chilling out. I believe I found out a lot about myself and the people in my life that day and I would recommend shrooms to anyone interested in learning about themselves. I cannot explain how powerful and emotional the experience was, I don't think anyone can.
