9:00 P.M. I was sitting down comfortable in the quiet hallway, brightly lit with my perception of it, and I experienced the transformation. My surroundings more then melted, tendrils began to creep from the wall, transparent hyperspacial tendrils, symmetrical in nature, which began to transform the space I was in. They grew only from the walls, and I interpreted it as folds in the nature of reality. When I had taken LSD for the first and only time, years prior, I experienced something similar - a perception of holes in space time. I observed these empty spaces of blackness on the face of a building, their edges surrounded by colorful fields. I was quite fascinated by this, and I was beginning to feel incredibly good. At this time, my thoughts began to race out of control. It was fascinating.
