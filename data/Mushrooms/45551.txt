After consuming the 3 grams, we laid in bed together, watching our breathing, as the effects began to emerge.  At a certain point, we found ourselves suspended in deep interstellar space, minds silent and open.  Gently and slowly, we noticed a point of light emerging on the periphery of awareness.  Upon emerging and catching our attention, it began coming closer, soon accelerating its approach at a rapid rate, while emitting a deep vibrant 'Aum' sound.  It soon became apparent that this was a living entity of galactic proportion.  As awareness of it blossomed, resonating in harmony with the vibration being emitted, it became apparent that it actually was a galaxy, our own Milky Way galaxy, and was endowed with a single, unitary consciousness that was vast and unfathomable.
