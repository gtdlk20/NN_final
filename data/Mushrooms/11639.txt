We made it back to my apartment, avoided talking to my neighbors, and locked ourselves inside. Things started to get a little overwhelming at this point, and my friend would not stop talking. I was too overcome to speak, but she was getting really angry at me for not talking and kept demanding that I speak to her. her eyes were hugely dialated and really freaking me out, so I agreed to talk to her as long as I didn't have to look at her. I realized that I was starting to trip even harder at this point and that we needed a trip-sitter. I called my friend who had taken me on my first trip, and he agreed to come over and take care of us.
