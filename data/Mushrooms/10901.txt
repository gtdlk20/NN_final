My research on mushrooms (through texts and experience) have made me realize the power of my surroundings on the way my thought processes work. For example, when I trip in the woods it can be more intense because all the trees around me seem to block the clarity of firing thoughts from one side of the brain to another, as though the trees represent obstacles in my mind. The same is true for being indoors - I tend to trip harder inside because I am much more conscious of the walls and feeling enclosed. Conversely, open fields provide a vast endlessness of freedom. The feelings of expansion I get in an open field is the most incredible way to trip on mushrooms, rivaled only by the beach. Anyway, back to the trip.
