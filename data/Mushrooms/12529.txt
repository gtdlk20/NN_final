I am starting to spiraling into shroomland. The onset of Psilocybin is fast and confusing. It seems at though 9 million things are going on at once, yet i am just laying down. Sleep would be impossible. This is the only uncomfortable part, the part that decides a good or bad trip. I started to ask 'what have i done' but took deep breaths and relaxed. I just let myself go and it was the best thing i could have done. I was thinking of so many things, one particularly interesting thought was about ancient man. I felt like a ancient man foraging for food and finding this strange little mushroom. I was thinking about how they probably thought they did something bad and poisoned themself, laying on the forest floor staring at the canopy sway back and forth, even thought there is no wind. I was thinking to myself that eating mushrooms is just poisoning yourself a little bit, not enough to die. This whole time I was staring at one fractal poster I have on my ceiling. It was swirling and looked like a graphic cartoon moving in odd liquid ways. The leaves on my cannabis plants looked like they were waving to me. Another interesting visual hallucination was the wall breathing with my breathing, a common one with real mushrooms. Time was so distorted everything i just wrote seemed to happen for weeks.
