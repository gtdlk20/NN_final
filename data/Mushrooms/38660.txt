After having a grand ol' time playing with my closed eye visuals, I wandered out of the now very warm bathroom- (I was laying on the floor in there because there is radiant in floor heat in the house, so having a 95 degree floor is very nice and comforting when engaging in these experiences.)  I recieved thoughts that came and went every few seconds that were totally out of this world.  I could actually close my eyes, choose a time period in my life- specifically, like a boat my father had when I was 3, or the house we lived in when I was 7- I could zero in on a certain memory, turn it into a mirror image, zoom in to anywhere in the room/boat, etc, and see everything with exact detail to how it really was when I saw it last- which was 11-15 years previous to this trip.  I mean, it was so detailed to a 'T'- it wasn't even funny.  That's what's so awesome about the fungus, is the precision and creativity that they can give my brain.
