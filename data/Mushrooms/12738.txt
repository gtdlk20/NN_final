The time when I took this trip was a somber time of my life. It was the end of the school year and though this is my favourite time of the year I had recently broken up with a girl I was very fond of and was still recovering from quitting smoking. Also I was in my worst state of drug addiction ever at the time, I was abusing prescription drugs all day almost every day, drinking, and really doing whatever I could get my hands on. My mental health was quite low at this point, I felt very distant and lost.
