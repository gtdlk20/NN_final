Eventually I started calming down and I wanted to go and meet my brother at a drum n bass club where he was MCing in Croydon. Thank god we didnt. He came home covered in blood that night with tales of a fight that had broken out and some nut case with a gun. Eventually we started coming down and watched some TV in silence. After about 15 mins we looked at each other and tried to work out what had just happened.
