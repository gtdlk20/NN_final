I then kept on walking. The effect of the mushrooms was only getting stronger and I was already tripping about as hard as I was comfortable with. I don't remember much of the next song. I'm not sure if this is possible with psylocibin but I felt like I was so high that I was blacking out of consciousness every few minutes. I do remember standing still in the middle of some bushes and staring at Squaw Peak and seeing the outlines of spiders on both peaks. The images of the spiders transfixed me to my spot and I felt a strange sort of vibration rumbling all throughout my body to culminate at my hands. I would have stopped to enjoy the feeling, but I was afraid that I'd freeze if I stayed still too long. I think it was at this point I decided to head to my truck to stay warm, so I kept the spider mountains to my right and started navigating my way back to the park.
