Some things to keep in mind about L, he and I have always walked a line between friend and foe. He is the darker half of our balance, we believe the same things but in radically different ways. That night as I mentioned L split a pole, very bad hoodoo in our circle, he was walking always ahead or behind never with us. When we were watching the movies he and A sat very close and a dark aura settled over them his look turned sinister which it has a tendency of doing, but this time a caught him mugging Junebug on more than one occasion. L displayed his loyalty that night.
