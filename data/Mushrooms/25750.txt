We decided to go on a hike up into the hills (of Wyoming). We got to a nice hill away from housing, and smoked a few bowls of Nug trying to pass time before our trip came. About 1 hour later after walking a couple miles further into the hills I started to feel the effects. I lost all control of speech and could do nothing but mutter... Although this muttering was absolutley uncomprehensible, I was doing it so fast that I was amazed and drawn into it..
