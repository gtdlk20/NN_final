Within ten minutes of consuming the second 3rd of the brew I was coming up to a level that I have never experienced before. I had that music player in my hand. It was playing worship music. I was tapping my foot and I was getting into the groove. Over the course of 4 or five songs I got so deeply and passionately into the music that it had taken hold of me and I was swept away. I was right there with the musicians, I was part of the music, it was emanating from me. I was looking at my music gadget and had profound appreciation for it and itÂ’s designers.
