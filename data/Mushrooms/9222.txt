Okay, so, about 3 weeks ago, a few days before school, a couple of friends (Jessica and Cody) and myself decided to end the summer with a psychedelic trip to remember. So that night, I called Jess up and she picked up Cody and they went off to get us some shrooms. Later on that night we met at a restaurant and had a nice, non-fast-food shit dinner. Naturally, we ordered got bacon cheese burgers, and told them to hold the mushrooms. (for now... :D) So, we went at our dinner-- enjoyed ourselves, etc, etc, and just before we ate the last quarters of our burgers, we stacked about 3g of mush each in between our patties and had our last bites.
