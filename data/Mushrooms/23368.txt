My friends 'M,' 'B,' 'J,' and I decided to try magical mushrooms over Christmas break after our first semester of college. My friend 'L' was having a stoner kick back at her house, which was supposedly a great place to try mushrooms because it was next to a forest. We were sitting on her back porch with a few of my buddies that were only smoking(including my friend 'W' who is very experienced with drugs, so he watched over us). It was about 9 pm when we each consumed 3 grams of P. Cubensis. Although I was pretty nervous, I was also excited. As I looked into the stars, I could already imagine that this experience would change my life.
