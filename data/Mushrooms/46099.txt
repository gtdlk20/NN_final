We completely lost track of time, and the concept of it was fairly ridiculous. Every now and then someone would read the time and give a reality check to pull us out of the rapid mind wandering. We were still getting obvious closed and open eyed visuals. One of my friends was wearing a leather jacket, and my couches are also black leather. It looked like he was apart of the couch, and when I looked up at his head, it looked like he had a third eye on his neck which was oozing down. Not very scary, but just weird. Everything else in the room was still alive and the patterns in the carpet were 3D. We all felt contradicting thoughts going on in our minds, and it was very hard for us to make any set plan as to who is going where for the 12:00am ball drop. We were still tripping pretty hard, and ended up just watching it at my house. It was very bizarre because I felt like I wasn't on Earth, therefore it was irrelevant to see Earthlings celebrate such an event. Strange, I know.
