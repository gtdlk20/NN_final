I started to feel better, and felt as though I were slowly falling asleep, but all of a sudden I felt a jolt in my body. My ears began to ring. The most violent sound I have ever yet to hear. And in front of me appeared a solid gas sphere of bright colors, with extensions which grew from all sides of the sphere of colors. The sphere disapeared and my room began to sink in. It felt like my room was actually brathing, and I was stuck inside. Everthing I looked at began to shift shape and warp. I was now unable to concieve what was real and what was not. As things were warping, I felt this was the end, I thought I was going to have to kill myself to end it all.
