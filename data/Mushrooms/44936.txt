We turned on the TV and Mullholland drive (a Lynch movie) was on. For the lives of us, we could not figure out what was going on in the movie and we thought we were really, really fucked up. But we switched the channel and were able to understand other programs so we realized it was simply that Lynch movies are fucked up and no one gets them. We had a hell of a discussion before we realized that, though. Also, my friend wanted some food, not because he was hungry but because he wanted the taste. We pondered over what to make and then decided to pop some popcorn. We sat back down at the TV becuase I was actually pretty interested in Mulholland drive (although the girls faces kept melting and looking very evil). My friend however, was much more interested in the popcorn
