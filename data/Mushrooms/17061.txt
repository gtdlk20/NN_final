While still on the other side of reality, and one hundred percent insane, I watched some TV.  I felt like I was swirling in warm oil, very comfortable and womb-like.  Most of my friends were in another room again.  This was probably somewhere around the two and a half hour mark. I had no sense of time and I had no idea how long I had been alone. I got the idea that my buddies were avoiding me. I began to feel uncomfortable. The anxiety kicked in full when I thought I heard someone say, 'He's tripping too hard'.  I thought I was in trouble, and I sensed loss of control.  I needed a sitter, or someone to talk me down, but my friends were not having a good night themselves and they were not in the mood to deal with me.  The trip changed gears on me instantaneously.  I had felt mostly good, and now, suddenly, I felt quite bad. powerful anxiety and nausea  quickly came over me. I knew I was getting the Fear. I ran to the bathroom and vomited, and I felt a little better, more relaxed.
