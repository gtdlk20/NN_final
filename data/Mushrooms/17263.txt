Anyway we got to the volcanoe finally and I tried to go on the hike. I started walking up the hill at like 17'000 ft. Only able to take like 5 steps at a time before having to rest and catch my breath. I look up towards the peak of the mountain just as all the clouds blow clear, and I swear that I saw a face form out of the mountain. I stood there stunned just watching. The face shakes back and forth as if saying no to whatever I was thinking at the time, which was weather I could climb this thing all the way. I decided that it would be best fer me to chill at the bus and let everyone else hike instead of possibly passing out on the trail.
