I believe at this point that I was starting to feel the nausea quite strongly and so I decided to go to the bathroom just just outside my room to throw up. I think at some point I closed my eyes and began to see the earliest sign of fractal images, possibly some eyes and faces (which as youll see, I would see a huge number of later). I quicky felt the presence of this peculiar feminine entity that I also felt was there on my last trip. I didnt so much seem to directly see it this time but I felt like I caught glimpses of it through the mirror, its dark, quite elegant and I feel like it belongs to a different species. I cannot tell if it shows any signs of being aware of me but its interesting that I feel like its a female presence.
