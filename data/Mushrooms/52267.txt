The paranoia became quite bad, and as it intensified I started to hallucinate.  I was certain that Carl and Dave were taking the piss and I could feel bad intentions being projected from them.  Then I started seeing them say the most cutting comments.  I saw their faces slightly morph and contort into more evil versions of themselves.  I was slightly worried by this, but since I am used to smoking lots of gear, paranoia doesnt really bother me.  Admittedly, it was overwhelming to actually see the paranoid delusions I was having.  This only lasted a short amount of time, because I quickly regained control.  I still felt isolated, but I wasnt worried about what Dave and co. were thinking any more.  I was enjoying my trip too much.
