Then, something strange happened, I had the most overwhelming urge to pee, so I went to the bathroom and attempted to do so, but it was impossible.  While I was in the bathroom, I decided to sit down on the tub, which I ended up falling into, and I just sat there.  While I was in there, some more friends popped over, both on shrooms.  They opened the bathroom door and found it funny, me sitting in the bathtub.  Then they left me alone and started watching Taken in the living room, while I just sat there for a few moments.  It was very strange, my visual perception, it was like looking through a broken windshield.  Everything was cracked and fractured.  But, I then got up and went to lie down in my room with the lights off.
