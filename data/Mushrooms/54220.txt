(This is where number 2: Clarity comes into play.  Something in me was making sure I did not fall for this clarity as the solution.  It was realizing that fear itself is not to be removed, but respected and I have to learn how to properly face it.  The flashes of Clarity were intoxicating, but it wasn't the end goal.  Logically that wouldn't make sense anyway- then why would anything happen?)
