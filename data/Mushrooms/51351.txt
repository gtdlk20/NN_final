I now had left the uncomfortable coming-up and entered the peak. Now the intense hallucinations had eased a bit, and I felt that I was one with the hallucinations instead. I had entered the trip. By that I mean that everything I looked at seem so new and beautiful. Everything seemed alien but yet very familiar. Now we decided to go outside again, with intention of going downtown to experience the city in this altered state of mind. At this point, I didnt experience reality loss anymore, because I was so busy looking at the wonderful things I saw. The carpet on the floor, the trees outside etc.
