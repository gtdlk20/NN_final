After a little bit of walking I began to experience the flood of thoughts that come at me while experiencing mushrooms.  I had very light visual hallucinations, more a feeling of greater appreciation for the beauty around us.  I put on my headphones and tuned my mp3 player to a series of tribal percussion performances and traditional songs from around the world.  Though I didn't know the words, I could feel the celebration within the songs.  People singing about life, the earth, nature, the harvest... and there I was amidst such a beautiful setting.
