I've been searching for mushrooms in my lil town for months now, with zero success. This town is dry as a bone, so me and a couple friends did a lot of research and decided to make an attempt at cultivating our own. We got hit with a nasty contamination and lost 12 jars, but we haven't given up and are currently trying again. With all this waiting time and not a lot of tripping time, I have been extensively preparing myself for a high dose experience. I've meticulously read trip reports on erowid and shroomery and I have done mushrooms 3 times before (none of them high dose, however). The most important piece of advice I could give to anyone is to be extensively prepared. Have a sound mind, a safe place, and comfortable clothes. Make sure you know and would absolutely trust your life to anyone in the tripping party, because that's what you might just end up doing.
