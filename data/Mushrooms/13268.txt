The mushrooms I acquired were ground up and baked inside of chocolate 'pyramids' that weighed between 15 and 20 grams each.  It irritated me that I had no way of telling exactly how many grams of dried mushrooms I was eating, but I estimated that it ranged from 2 grams minimum and 5 grams at the most.  The pyramids were wrapped in wax paper, then wrapped in colored foil, and cost $25 each.  My dealer told me that one chocolate would 'definitely' be enough for one person, maybe even two.
