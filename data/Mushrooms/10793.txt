After a while, I start to experience ego loss. I try to fight it, but soon I just cant see no reason in doing it. Im sweating like crazy, so I decide to drink a lot of water and wash my face. Things were talking to me, and in a relatively short while I come to discover all new things about the human mind. Im just amazed by the intensity of the trip, I became one with everything, and everything was right there with me. Though, the definition of me seemed such a big bullshit. I was surrounded by stars, planets, and lots of Universes, seen if it seemed some sort of chaos, it all made sense and I was in peace.
