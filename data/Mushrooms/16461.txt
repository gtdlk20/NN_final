This trip was incredibly powerful and changed my thought process forever. This was a year ago and I needed that long just to be able to sort out what all happened. That night changed my life forever. I view nothing in the same way as I did before this trip. I now meditate everyday, hike as often as possible to reconnect with nature, and spread the word of psychedelic discovery in my own life to anyone with an open mind willing to listen and see the real side of life that has been hidden from us by our society. I'm grateful for mushrooms and other psychedelics. At the time of this trip, I was a heroin addict but ever since that night I haven't touched the stuff. It has truly made me a better person. I appreciate life and everything I have now.
