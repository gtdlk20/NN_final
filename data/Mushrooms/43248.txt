I go to the washroom and I can swear the moment I go through the door of the washroom I start tripping. I believe it is the change of temperature, a sensory stimulation that wakes me up soemwhat and knocks on my head and says '' You're tripping Cal You're tripping '. I empty myself and go down the staircase. I go to the stereo and start press power $ play not wondering about the cd and volume. I am sure one of my cds is in it.
