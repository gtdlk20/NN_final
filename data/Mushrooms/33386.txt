Things were great. The next scene we approached was yet another portrait of hapiness. There was a tree that had been carved into by lovers that had walked the trail before. My beauty simply called it, 'The Love Tree'. I found this hilarious as did she. She then exclaimed 'I want to hug the love tree!' I mimicked her 'Hug the love tree!', and with a big laugh I decided I was going to take a picture with my cell phone, which seemed like a good idea, but in my alien frame of mind, the technology proved too sophisticated for me at the time. (In retrospect, it is now Sept. 17th. Just a couple of days ago I found out that I managed to take a small video of it.)
