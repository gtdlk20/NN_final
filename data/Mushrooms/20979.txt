After about a year of feeling anxious, depressed, hopeless, and constantly scared of the next fit of rage or panic, trying many kinds of therapy and only getting worse, I had the thought that I should try magic mushrooms. I'm not sure where that thought came from initially, it sort of appeared in my mind one day while I was gardening. It took me several more months to figure out what kind of mushrooms were safe, how to use them, and where to get them, and to arrange for a sitter for me and a babysitter for my kid at the same time.
