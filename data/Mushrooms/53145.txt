I felt my left big toe transforming into a thick white arrow, that began to spiral upwards! At this point I was still able to discuss what I saw with the others, and we laughed at each others' observations. Every time I opened my eyes, I could see the flashy star (which I had named 'my little red thing'). It made me feel calm and peaceful, and drove away the twinge of fear I occasionally still felt. This star was, in fact, to be my 'guardian angel,' to which I could return in between my jumps from one world (or scenery) to another. In my mind, I could analyse almost everything I saw, and felt to have a certain control of which figures to look at (yes, I have read Castaneda!).
