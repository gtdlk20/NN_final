She was behind her computer and I was lying on the couch. We were talking and soon I had forgotten I had even dosed. I followed the advice from a wise shroomer to 'never expect anything and work with what you get WHEN you get it.' I asked myself how do you know when you have begun to trip? As I was talking to her I stared at her wallpaper. It was twirly and with nice texture. Colour was red & orange. As I stared at it I kind of saw it expanding from one place and then moving from another place. I asked myself 'Am I imagening this or is this really happening?'
