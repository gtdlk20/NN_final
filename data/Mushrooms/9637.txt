    The evening finally arrived! It was the night of the laser show musical and I am excited to attend and experience it all with psilocybin in my system.  I have consumed mushrooms twice before in the span of two years, the first two times were enjoyable but I did not take enough to have a truly memorable experience. Today, as a 19 year old, I will be acquainted with the magic of the shrooms. The day of the show I have solely an orange for breakfast and a fruit shake with toast for lunch at around 3:00 PM so my stomach, I believe, was ready to go. The lightshow begins at 10:00 PM so I calculate how long it would take to arrive at the planetarium, the length of the show (1 hr), and the time to get back home and with that I know the time my group of friends and I (4 tripping, 1 sober driver) should consume in order to reach the peak in the middle of the show. The analytical aspects of my mind definitely paid off in this trip.
