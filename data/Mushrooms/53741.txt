My life has drastically been changed by this experience and i haven't done mushrooms since. My hard work and optimism have paid off in a recent relationship and a promotion at my job. I feel refreshed every day i wake up and i have those 3 grams of mushrooms to thank for it. They opened my eyes to what's really going on in my life.
