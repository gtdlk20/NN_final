About 45 mins later I started to feel the first affects giggling and stomach discomfort. I recall looking at the TV and seeing peoples eyes moving apart slightly. About 30 mins later I was now really starting to feel the main affects and was shocked I was tripping so hard on what I thought was a low dose. I was not scared at all just shocked. Outlines were starting to move to the objects in my room.
