We put our coats on and made it out the door. I bought the orange juice with me and still continued to believe that I was poring it over my face. Neil had to keep reminding me I wasnt. We stumbled down my road laughing hysterically and occasionally trying to stay calm as people walked by. God only knows what they thought. We had beanies and sunglasses on (one pair) and couldnt walk straight. Neil was talking some crazy shit? What was he saying? I have no idea. I dont think he did either but we both knew it was hugely profound and if only it made sense and had a point it could have been brilliant.
