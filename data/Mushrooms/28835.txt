I ate the mushrooms at 7:30pm, not long, maybe 20 minutes, before our guests left. I thus had minimal time to prepare. In those 20 minutes, I put hopes into words on a page in a journal - mainly intentions around examining an overarching tension of late. IÂ’d not call it anxiety, though at times I get anxious. But this tension has me forcing things, out of tune and out of time.
