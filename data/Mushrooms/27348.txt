In conclusion I feel as though everyone should try mushrooms; especially artists, writers, and musicians.  There is so much to gain from psychedelic drugs.  That is if you go into them with the right mindset.  You should go in knowing that they are not a toy or game and that they can screw up your mind.  Moderation is also key.  I could not imagine myself eating them more than once a month.  I do not however feel that those afflicted with depression or any other psychological disorder should take a psychedelic of any kind.  Also one should be in a general good mood before taking them.  That night I learned that instead of trying to control things I should just go with them.  Kind of like what Ram Dass says in BE HERE NOW.  I hope next time I trip I can watch a movie or take a walk in the woods.  Mushrooms, for me are a much more benevolent hallucinogen.  In the words of C 'They want to make me skip along a path on a bright sunny day like a child'.
