T-0:45--We decide to sit down on a bench that gave us a slight view of the hotel. When we sit down, we notice that the ground starts to shift. We amuse ourselves and continue to laugh at the patterns and shapes we see. Typical shrooms stuff: trees melt, the ground flows, the air breathes and faces look very scary. We had trouble looking up at the sky though, becuase all the leaves were moving cuz of wind and it totally blew our minds. I feel more and more nauseous and at this point my skin starts to feel like it might fall off. But Jim happens to be a chatterbox when he trips, so I just listen to him and don't think about my body.
