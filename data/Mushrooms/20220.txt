I cried, and my ego still dissolved. Suddenly an instrumental track on el cielo came on. This track was a personal favorite of mine, and its melancholy tone struck deep within me. I said to myself, uh-oh, its the dying song, dropped slowly to the ground and died. I laid on the floor and felt my breath slowly cease. I felt my identity leave me. I laid on the ground for the next few songs, and finally decided it was time again for my rebirth.
