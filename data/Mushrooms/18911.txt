We decided to make some tea, I usually just eat them.  So we got out probly 5 grams (mabee a little less) from the huge ziplock bag and put them in some boiling water.  The shrooms swell up with water and we smashed them a little with some forks to get the juces out.  Then we added a bag of apple cinimon tea to the mix.  We were talking wile making the tea and we decided to offer his dog Buddy some.
