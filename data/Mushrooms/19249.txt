And I love you Alice! Going around the circle naming people, And I love you Miel, and I love you Goopstar, and I love you Cory. I love you Cass (Alices lover, not present). And I named the other three people in the house who werent tripping, I love you Monkey, I love you Cado, I love you Marshian!
