Identification:  Spore print is rusty orange.  Also look for the tell tale 'wood like' stem.  There should be a definate 'break' between the stem and the gills.  A 'blueing' effect will take place after a while if you burse the stem.  Nice thing about this mushroom is that it has no deadly look a likes. (Except in Colarado)  Could be confused with the Jack-o-Lantern mushroom, which is mildly poisonous but not deadly.  The Jack-o-Lantern mushrooms gills form from the stem and radiate out to the underside of the cap however, as Big Gyms gills are found only under the cap (not on the stem).  Little danger in misidentifing Big Gym as long as a person have a field mushroom manual (it is pretty distinct).
