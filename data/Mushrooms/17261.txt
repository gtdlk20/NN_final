It was when we were on the bus that I started feeling the effects which came unusually quickly, only taking like 20 minutes. 40 minutes in we stopped at the look out site over all of Quito. I began noticing little things swaying. And all the colors of the houses in the city had a brighter light to them. I was returning to the usual lighting and look of a trip. I got back on the bus and traveled for another 40 min or so. We stopped at a gas station on the way to go to the bathroom and that's when sh!t started goin down. I was sittin starin at the tiled ground when blocks started shiftin about in big sections at first. But eventually I saw little single blocks sprout arms and legs, full on push themselfs up from the ground and run into another open hole as if playing duck duck goose or something.
