After a good two hours of gummy, fantastic fungal frying in the room (everything seemed like a video game, but all quite lighthearted at this point).  At this point I think it worthy to note that on tuesday evening earlier that week, I had taken three hits of acid, and experienced an endlessly long stream of memories proving to me with hallucinogenic absoluteness that I was a terrible person.  That trip had yet to finish evolving within my brain (acid never really finishes with you), and I am at any rate a person constantly questioning who and what i am, and what I'm doing with myself.  Such questions can lead to scary places on hallucinogenic drugs!
