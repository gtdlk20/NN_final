My friend gave me a call and said, 'Hey, do you wanna come trip some shrooms with me at my sister's apartment?' I of course said 'Hell yeah!!!' I went over and paid for them and ate them, most of the people there, whom I did not know, were dipping theirs in peanut butter, but I wasn't because the taste never really has bothered me. When my trip initiated I looked around and everything was beautiful. My friend who was sittin next to me (who I now know is a fucking bitch) would turn and whisper something mean and judgemental about the other people in the room. There was a purple aura emitting from her and I could tell that it symbolized the unpleasantness within her soul and now I can tell what kind of person someone is just by looking at them. I regard that night as the night that my third eye opened.
