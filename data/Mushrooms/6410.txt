My initial reverie was broken by my good friend and experienced tripper Stead and boy did he look startled. His eyes wide in amazement he informs me that we could spend A LOT of money on these truffles, I agree heartily. He then tells me of his macroscopia experience in the tent. He was lying upon his sleeping bag staring at the tag (as you do) when the whole tag zoomed in to occupy his entire field of vision each word on the tiny tag seeming as tall as a man. I smile and say 'cool'.
