I ate an eighth of the 'shrooms while my brother and boyfriend, both much larger than I, ate about a quarter each.  We saved the rest in case we wanted to boost our doses later on.  About thirty minutes after dosing, I started to come up.  We were listening to Squarepusher, loud breakbeat ambient music with an upbeat feel, and I was beginning to 'see' the music drift out of the speakers.  As soon as I noticed this, beautifully brilliant lights began to appear and disappear in all corners of the room.  It was as though stage-lights were being flipped on and off throughout the house.  My brother was leaning back against the couch, eyes closed, moving slightly to the music.  At one point he turned to me and asked me, 'Am I real?'  I assured him he was and he began to laugh happily like a child.  When he opened his eyes, though, I could tell he was freaking out.  I didn't worry because he seemed to be enjoying himself.
