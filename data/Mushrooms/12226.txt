I drank the tea first, and noticed that it was quite strong on my very empty stomach. I didn't realize HOW STRONG until the second sip, when I felt a pressure around my skull that seemed to slowly move down my body in a euphoric tingling that made me shiver. Each sip I took I could feel the mushrooms stronger as soon as I swallowed it, and by the time I ate the garlic bread I was already starting to get visuals in my peripheral vision.
