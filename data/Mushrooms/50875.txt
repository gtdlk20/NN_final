Voices, many voices could be heard now. So many languages. Different cultures speaking in a trance-like melody creating music as it went along. I could not understand a word of it, yet it was beautiful and enlightening. I started to realize, 'Why am I here? What is this place I call home? What is this place we call earth?' The thoughts kept coming with the answers only being more complicated than the last. I sat down once again. My hands had become the largest things around. Kind of like the Foo Fighters - Everlong song. I outstretched my hand and realized I had hawk like vision. Every crevice could be seen in my hand. It was an amazing thing to see, every detail which couldnt never be seen by the naked eye was all exposed to me right now.
