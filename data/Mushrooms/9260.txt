2:25am I lay there with my eyes closed, playing with my gfs hair whilst she relaxed on my chest, pretty much asleep. This is about when I also drifted off to sleep! Yes, asleep, 2 and a half hours after dosing Pan Cyans. This is new to me as I've never wanted to sleep on mushrooms, and pretty sure it was impossible. I guess however that the factors involved such as being tired before hand, having intense sex, and the mushrooms being a somewhat low dose, all contributed to us being able to sleep.
