After this I'm still feeling nauseous but I start tripping hard, fast. My pupils are huge and my body feels like a feather, I keep waving my arms which are getting this tracer effect looking like 4 arms are following my one and I'm mind blown. My legs are like jello and I cant stand well which I thought was hilarious and start having a laugh episode. Its all fun from here but I'm still coming up for some reason as everything starts to feel warped.
