I started to trip super hard, many times more then I have ever been on anything, light was separating into its various colors, extremely vivid colors, more then I have ever experienced, absolutely everything came alive, the floor was teeming with insects and what looked like pieces of food moving around. Flying bright lights about the size of bumble bees, dozens of them started to swirl and fly  around me, my walls flexed intensely with bricks flicking around and every  second or two something large would rapidly swim along the wall, this also happened  on the floor, people on the TV were breaking apart into little blocks and this happened to a number of object. Streaks of colored lights were flying around the room whilst the small ones were still all around me. I had Metal music playing and the vocals would all of a sudden and often become a strange but cool sounding instrument only playing notes, it was kind of freaky, whilst the whole song would suddenly become weirdly distorted. I looked at my arms and my skin appeared to look like lava, with dark and very bright spots of yellow, red white while being semi see through, I thought I saw my muscle underneath.
