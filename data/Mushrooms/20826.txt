What I would call the usual imagery coming on with closed eyes after half an hour.  The fractal lattice  a sort of higher dimensional beehive with extra-dimensional insectoid creatures in it.  Endless Mandelbulb worlds forming and morphing into each other with shapes and colours I cannot describe using language.  Mandelbulb movies on YouTube get pretty close to what it all looks like but there is definitely a strong presence there of a high intelligence.  I remember a huge dragon coming into view (Poimandres?) but it all lost focus when I was awoken from this dreamscape.
