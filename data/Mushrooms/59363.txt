The colours in his room were reflecting off the CD's and into my eyes.  None of us could talk to each other because wehen we tried it sounded like endless echo coming from our mouths.  I put my head inside chris drawer and I felt like I was attached to it somehow.  Then I fell on the floor and went on for almost and hour about how 'nothing is always and the present is tomorrow'...just mindless ramble.  My friends had three mouths it looked like, and Baz was playing his guitar (we had just begun to learn so he wasnt taht good) but it sounded reqally cool.
