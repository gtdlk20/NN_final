Nothing makes sense anymore.  I see a van pass me on the road.  I have NO idea what it is.  All I know is that it looks familiar.  Everything looks familiar, trees, buildings.  But if someone asked me what they were, I could not have told you.  Every sense has combined into one - I smell, feel, see, taste, hear everything I come across, even if it doesn't smell, make noise, and is not in reach.  My problems - I don't even know what they are anymore.  They have evolved into physical shapes in my mind.  My ex-girlfriend is an orange triangle, for example, that would physically harm me.  It felt like something was attacking me.  Hallucinations are not describable - and that's all I can say - literally.  I cannot describe them or even begin to.
