T+3:00-5:00: I stay pretty much at a steady rate of tripping, I go back and forth between dancing with S and sitting at the table. When both of us are sitting at the table, we talk about what has happened and what we are feeling. For at least twenty minutes, we discuss the possibility that our friend D isnt real. We base this on the fact that he doesnt really know anyone else, and that hes wearing all white. We compare him to the imaginary people in the movie, 'A Beautiful Mind'. S actually shouted out at one 'Ds not real!' and drew some rather unwanted attention, but it amounted to nothing. We kept making comparisions between anything unusual or senseless to the big bowl of carrots we had seen at the beginning of the night. I had a surprisingly difficult time keeping my balance when I wasnt holding on to S, which usually never happens to me on shrooms. I also made the discovery that ice is an amazing thing to have while tripping. It prevents you from grinding your teeth, and also helps with dry mouth and dehydration. So I would go in cycles between dancing, losing S, sitting at the table to eat ice and waiting for S to return so I could dance some more. Even though I knew other girls there, I didnt feel comfortable dancing with them because I wasnt able to judge other peoples feeling toward me. I couldnt remember what was fantasy and what was reality. For example, I couldnt remember whether a certain girl liked me, or if I just wanted her to like me. By the time we left the dance, I felt pretty much fine, and I had a very enlightening conversation about the nights events on the ride home with S.
