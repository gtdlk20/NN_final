I recently acquired some dried Cubensis and was really excited to work my way up into the higher doses, hopefully to get to McKennas Heroic Dose in silent darkness in the near future. I had never experienced psychedelics on my own since usually we picked fresh Liberty Caps from the fields around the area I live  an experience that is always more satisfying and manageable with several people looking at once. I wanted an experience that would be challenging but not unmanageable in order to test my wits for getting potentially lost in whatever would be waiting for me beyond the pale of the heroic dose.
