After not being able to find mushrooms near my house for a few years, I hit the jackpot this fall. I came across a pond not far from my house where hundreds of psilocybe mushrooms were growing in the manure around the bank. I believe the species is Cubensis. I tried eating a few with two friends, and based on our experience I believe the mushrooms are weak, though another guy tried 3 of them and he thought they were strong.
