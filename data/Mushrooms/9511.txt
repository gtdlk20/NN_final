All I can remember now are short blips of vision, looking out through my eyes and seeing myself still in the car with M. But they are only flashes, a few seconds long each at the very most. M says that I was repeating myself over and over again and behaving as if I didnt recognize him, yet I was acting very sexual, trying to take my pants off for example. But to me, its like someone cut chunks out of my timeline and spliced it back together crudely.
