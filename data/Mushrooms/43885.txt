I remember being really disoriented walking back and I was familiar with the area but being high I had like no idea where we were heading back. There was a split second of panic because I had thought we'd gotten lost but I had faith in my skewed sense of direction and it eventually led me to the foot of the big gravel hill that lead to my car. The entire time the shrooms made my body feel groggy and sluggish the shrooms made my body feel groggy and sluggish. I almost preferred walking though because it kept my mind occupied.
