As a man in my early 20's, I had had many LSD experiences, but almost none with any form of mushroom. In the space of 12 months, I had two separate, yet similar, experiences. One landed me in a State Mental Hospital for 2 weeks, and the other ended with a month-long stay in a County Jail. If one believes the 12-steppers, the next 'trip' should've killed me. It didn't, but that's a debate for another day.
