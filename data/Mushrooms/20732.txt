Slow by slow, in almost eternity, I was regaining things that would only come if I surrendered and trusted in things.  Hearing the neighbors would bring me back to fear which would keep testing me.  I was teaching myself how to let go, through challenge, I noticed the noises could be misinterpreted by myself.  I realized I am not the center of attention, but just me, on my couch.  I realized that I had to stop feeling like life revolved around me, because it goes on with or without me.  That sobering realization was like the light you barely see as you come towards the end of a tunnel (knowing that you will be out of it at some time).  I started remembering that I can't be too sure of anything, but I had to put trust in life and the universe to work.  It reminded me of the shamanic stories of getting in touch with the divine.  But it is not the goal to stay there, but to use it to reconnect to life, to stop trying to be my own god and stop enslaving myself.  It was beautiful and loving, to feel, to think about, to be there.  Liberation?!  GRATEFULNESS AND CALM!
