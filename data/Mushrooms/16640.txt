Not saying I don't have hard times now (I most definately still do) but everything seems less serious. I prefer stillness and silence now and practice mindfulness. I have taken a serious interest in my health and no longer eat fast food/processed garbage and prefer fresh, whole and preferably organic foods. I also excercise regularly and practice hatha yoga and qi gong. I feel so much more vibrant and alive. Quite the change from an overweigth 16 year old with suicidal tendencies.
