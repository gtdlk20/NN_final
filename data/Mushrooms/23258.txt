About 1 o'clock in the afternoon. I slept in a little bit because our area was having a snow day, so everything was closed and shut down. My friend gave me a call and reminded me about our conversation from the previous night which was about eating some mushrooms. I had nothing to do so naturally I agreed and we began our search. We called almost every person we knew trying to find us some fungus and it was nowhere to be found. It was almost 5:30 by the time we found someone with enough for 6 people. At this point I was very frustrated because I had been searching for mushrooms all day and I was about to start tripping while in a bad mood. 6:30 roles around and the 6 of us have consumed our share, I ate just under an 1/8th at this sitting. I chewed mine up quite efficiently so the effects came to me within 20 minutes. The room started swaying in different ways and I was feeling great. We hung out for another 25 minutes or so then decided to take a trip outside.
