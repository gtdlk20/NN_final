I stood up off the sofa I was on, and a silver ball (which I had for the trip, but had completely forgotten about) fell out of my pocket and rolled all the way across the floor into the corner of the room.  I said I knew that was going to come into play.  Then we realized how much the old house was leaning downhill.  As I stood at the low side of the room, I felt a force pushing me against the wall, as if it would be a great struggle against gravity to walk to the uphill side of the room.
