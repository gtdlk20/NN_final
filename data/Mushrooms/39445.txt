As much fun as I was having I had just as bad a time. So paranoid and ashamed of myself. Anyhow I was tripping the whole time. The end of the concert I realized I couldn't name one song Dave played, I was so distracted with everything. I could hear every single person's conversation and I just wanted them to shut the hell up. But the music was still amazing and just filled the air the whole time.
