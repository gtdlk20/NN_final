I went upstairs to be by myself away from all the overwhelming lights and sounds. My past girlfriend 'A' then walked into the room with her boyfriend 'E.' The sight of her immediately comforted me. Her voice sounded like angels. I've always realized how sweet she is, and that turned her into a biological angel. I then met 'A's' boyfriend, who told me about his shroom experience, and talked me out of my bad thoughts because of his happiness when he talked. We then went downstairs into a room with all of the trippers.
