I made my way into the toilet and hugged the bowl and dry heaved, unproductively. There was no way I was going to escape the ordeal by that route. I felt like Id gone wrong; that I was naughty and out of control societally. My mind flashed on Keith Richards, Elegantly Wasted as I slumped around some outhouse toilet, tripping hard. I determined that this was not very glamorous (though perhaps a little rock'n'roll) and made my way over to an unused Caravan in another corner of the grassy yard. There I would sit in a corner in the dark and sing aloud the song Hey Joe over and over, and each verse covered would centre me and keep me calm.
