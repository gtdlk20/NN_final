I looked down at my hand and it was as if I could see all the blood cells running under my skin. They were those familiar doughnut-shaped red blood cells, only about the size of a dime. Later in the night, I saw the same thing in my face in the mirror, as well as a complete twisting and bending of my face. I was wearing a plaid shirt, and that was a constant source of awesome visions.
