It was less than a year ago from this point that I had tried shrooms for the first time, and I instantly fell in love. Between then and the festival I had tripped 7 times, the smallest dose only being about 1 gram, and the largest being 4 grams. I was particularly excited for this trip as I knew the festival would be a great location to do it, and had decided on a dosage of 3.5 grams. The plan was to eat the shrooms after dinner, hang out in the campground for a while, and then head to the festival for the music. There were maybe 8 of us that planned to drop them, but because everyone was eating something different for dinner, not everyone ended up dropping the shrooms at the same time. I was among the first to drop them, and I sat around the campsite waiting for everyone else to cook their dinner and eat it while I was coming up.
