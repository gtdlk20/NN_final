We talked about an assortment of deep and insightful things.  I can always tell a shroom conversation from a normal one because insightful things on shrooms are always things I never would talk about normally, although they make sense, they just dont come to mind sober.   This is one of the amazing things about shrooms, because when I sober up later, theyre still amazing ideas that I get to take with me from the trip.
