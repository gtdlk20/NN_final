I didn't expect 2 grams to change my thoughts. I made up a person in my head that was telling me the actual meaning of life. I knew that the person wasn't real but I was so convinced that she/he was right. I thought I was a meaningless organism that deserved to die. I probably would have hung myself then if I was functioning properly. I stared at my hand, hallucinated, seeing different angles, etc. I had a thought that movies, cars, and all that were just in a series of technology that 'we' distributed through the minds of scientists to make people think that the world is progressing.
