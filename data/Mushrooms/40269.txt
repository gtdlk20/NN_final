T+1:45: I have to get up and walk into the dining room, where all the teachers are eating, INCREDIBLY uncomfortable. The normal things are being served, pasta meatballs etc. and then in the middle of one of the table is giant fucking bowl of hot carrots. I nearly break out laughing. This seems so ridiculous to me, just a giant bowl of steaming carrots in the middle of a dinner table. I resist the urge to mention this to S, and throw some vegetables on my plate and hurry back to the table with my friends.
