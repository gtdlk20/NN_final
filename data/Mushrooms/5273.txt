God, youre a tough one. I say to her now, slumping onto the ground. The other portraits are smiling as usual, but now it seems because theyre much more pleased with my efforts to entertain the sixth. If Im under the effects Im still unsure because Ive been like this without provocation before. Now I feel another shift upwards and check the lamps. No halos. I turn my gaze to the standing lamp which casts a huge variation of light onto the roof. Though I can see it sober, it hadnt occurred to me how much it looks like the gills of a mushroom. The lamp much more like a stem now, I exhale, exhausted, and the tendrils of light above me respond and ripple with the breath.  Oh my. I put my hand on my chest, the hearts pounding, but its beat is funny, its in time with the bass now. We are going on a trip. I say, I feel like my hand can get very close to my heart, almost grasp it.
