     I decided to dwell on these thoughts. The two sets of thoughts were so distinct that they started 'arguing' with each other. They argued about which was the proper way to really live. The whole time I struggled, to the point where I thought I couldn't take it any more and that I was going to go crazy. Meanwhile, I kept staring at the wall and smoking joints like nothing was happening. However, crazy shit was happening. As the battle for my conscience continued to build, I decided that I'd go crazy if one of these 'voices' didn't leave.
