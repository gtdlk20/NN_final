While I wasn't consciously aware of it, I could still hear the campground around me. It had grown dark, and when that happens, the drums come out. Drums, drums, and more drums. It vibrated the very fabric of the universe. At one point I heard a sharp whistling noise, followed by a flash of light and a loud BANG: a bomb must have exploded over the campground. I could hear everyone's screams of anguish, followed by frantic footsteps as people tried to flee. But what could I do? There was no way out of the reality I was experiencing. I forgot about the whole thing and continued on my journey through the cosmos to the beat of the drums.
