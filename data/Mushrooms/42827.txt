The instant that Peter told me he had weed, I told him truthfully that I had never tried it before, but that I really wanted to and he replied by telling me that I was more than welcome to share the small supply he had, and he would try to roll and joint or two for us a little bit later. We needed to make one last trip first, just quickly across the street to a drug store, to pick up mix for the liquor. I remember a large group of us walking over, and I was completely wound up, unable to calm myself down. Two girls walked with us  I cant remember their names or where we had even met them now; I dont think they stuck around long. My roommate had a video camera and I tried to record the whole evening. Actually Im sure theres still footage of that night lying around somewhere.
