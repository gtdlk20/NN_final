After looking around at the room some more, I went back to my jeans, only this time I saw words. I couldnÂ’t read them, but they were in large, blocky text that reminded me of newspaper headlines. They then formed into some kind of runic language. It reminded me of old Norse or something. Then there was another face. Oddly enough, in the exact same place as Jesus, I saw a man with a rectangular head, square glasses over his eyes, and a triangular mouth. His head kept growing taller and taller, and a second set of eyes sprang up out of the first.
