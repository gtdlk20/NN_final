I did not, I repeat, did NOT have a bad trip.  It was only the intensity of the trip that made me seriously believe that I was dead.  I have since this day completely changed my outlook on living life when you know it can be taken away in an instant, at any time.  Thanks for reading my trip report and happy and safe shrooming everyone.
