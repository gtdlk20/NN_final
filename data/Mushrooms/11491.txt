k and I started watching some futurama, and I absolutely could not pay attention.  My mind was consumed with thoughts along the lines of, 'Wow, I'm so worthless.  I could die and it wouldn't really make a difference to anyone.  It makes no difference to my friends if I'm there or not.  what if they're just hanging out with me to humor me?'  there was no rationale behind these thoughts, it was poison spreading throughout my mind.
