After the whole thing, I understand the importance of being around people who you are very comfortable with.  My emotions swung so fast and hard, and I should have never went off alone left to my own devices.  Tripping is an amazing experience, bad or good.  The only advice I can give is to not let yourself get into a hole, if you find that happening, talk to someone, talk about anything.  Next time, I'm sure to stay around the friends I love who I won't feel unsure of myself around, that is, if I do try the magical mushroom again.
