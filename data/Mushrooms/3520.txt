Tripping? Was I tripping?? What the hell? I wasn't tripping. I was getting really freaked out now. Slowly my friends were beginning to look more and more unfamiliar to me. I didn't know what was going on. I heard Adam shouting loudly. That made me even more uncomfortable. I suddenly realized that this was a bad place to eat shrooms. I didnt like being here normally, let alone shrooming. I didn't know or care what time it was anymore, all I knew is that I wanted to go home. I hadnt been careful enough about setting. I was having such a bad time because I was at a place I didnt like. But how would I get home? It was too far to walk, and I hadnt driven there. Somebody would be nice enough to drive me home. These people were all my friends. They would understand that I didnt want to be here, and they would be more than willing to drive me.
