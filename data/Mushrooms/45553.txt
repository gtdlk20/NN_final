As our individual points of awareness were integrated into the vastness of this greater mind,  we were shown the immense multitudes of worlds which made up its physical form.  By directing attention toward a single point of light, consciousness was able to enter the world which had attracted its focus and we began to perceive the beings that populated that zone of embodied experience, gently entering into and merging with the lives of the forms residing and having their being there.  We were stunned by the immensity of this awareness and came to realize how it is always present in its fullness in every point of its being.  At one point, my wife asked me, 'Do you see this?  The Wisdom Disk?' At one point, my wife asked me, 'Do you see this?  The Wisdom Disk?'  I replied, 'Yes!  Do you see its singularity and the multiple worlds too?'  She gasped, 'Oh!  Yes!'  Our minds had become one with its presence and we again merged into the deep resonance of its being.
