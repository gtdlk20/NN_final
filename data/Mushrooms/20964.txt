It was the Fourth of July.  Myself and my three good friends (we'll call them Dan, Luke, and Steve) each had an eigth and a half of mushrooms.  We got our gear together, picked out a spot, and went camping.  The prospect of communing with nature, mushrooms, and colorful explosions in the sky all at the same time was exciting.  I remember thinking the night before, 'I haven't been this excited for something since Christmas Eve when I was a little kid.'
