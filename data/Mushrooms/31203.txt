Stage 1. We made some rounds about the neighborhood, walking up and down random streets, chuckling profusely at just about anything that came to conversation between our trio. We then found a path leading up a tree-covered hill, so we began to venture onwards. All I could think about was Narnia. It felt like I was entering my own Narnia. I kept asking my friends, 'where's the goat?' but to my demise... there really wasn't one. We kept walking onwards, laughing a lot, and having weed-like effects so far, everything was dark. We did a lot of cool stuff though. I found a cool bush and stood behind it, waving my hands around from behind it and making a voice for it, while Jess and Cody watched from in front... that only amused us for 15 minutes.
