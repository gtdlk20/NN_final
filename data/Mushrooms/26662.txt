Agent number one took us back into my girlfriends room and began to speak to us while agent number two went into the living room to call headquarters and scan our records to make sure there werent any warrants out for our arrest (of course there wasnt, my DUI didnt even show up).  He said he was going to take all the equipment, have it sent to the lab to test the remaining little pieces of substrate for inoculants.  He said that if the lab found anything he could pretty much guarantee us some trouble.  He said also, that we would likely be in trouble for destroying the evidence.  I insisted that it wasnt evidence until he had confiscated it, and until then we were just ridding ourselves from any legal technicalities.  Of course he didnt agree.  For about another ten minutes, he threatened us about how he was going to talk to some people (attorneys and so on) who would be more than interested to prosecute against us for our malevolent intent to eventually deal.  I dont know for sure if any of this is true or not, I surely hope not.
