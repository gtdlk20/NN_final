For the most part, I do not participate in drug use. I have smoked marijuana a few times in my 40 something years; however, I have never enjoyed the high. I do drink alcohol, but rarely to get drunk anymore. So, when my friend wanted me to join him on a trip on mushrooms, I was quite aprehensive, down right scared really. But I wanted to face my fears, as my friend assured me the trip would not turn out to be something out of my control, that I wouldn't get lost and never make it back, and so I did it. Here is a short synopsis of my amazing experience.
