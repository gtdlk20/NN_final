I decided to try this with my wall hanging that is behind my alter, its a celtic knotwork design with a pentagram in the middle, and it was lit by the candle on my alter.  I usually meditate on this symbol (sober) so I decided that was what I was going to do on shrooms.  It was soooo fucking awesome.  This was where the height of my trip happened.  As I was gazing at the pentagram it began to dance around and the lines and angles on the pentagram would light up differently, showing different angles and shapes within the pentagram and those lines and angles would come off of the wall hanging and into my room making different angles and designs but it was all with the same angles found in the pentagram.  Then it would change back to the dancing and shifting around and then the whole wall hanging would become this dark blue with some kind of steller looking map or designit was hard to tell because this would flash in and out very briefly and quickly, this happened about 3 or 4 times.
