Being completely amazed by everything made me so happy. Being that my friends kept coming to talk to me made me frustrated because I had to keep taking out my headphones. So I decided to go on a walk. Keep in mind this place is 1200 acres. Walking down a path shaded by trees, listening to very floaty music and simply flying over the land, I felt as if I had no legs and was just hovering over the ground. Again I was extremely happy and observant of my surroundings. Trees dancing with my music and amazing visuals were going on everywhere. Suddenly the path I had been floating across opens up and turns into the most breath taking view I have ever seen in my entire life. Nirvana. Bright green grass fields with radiant purple flowers growing on them in the distance and birds flying close by me. At this point I lost all check with reality. I was in my own heaven. Everything I did went perfectly with the music, like a soundtrack to my life. The song is still on repeat. I lied down in tall green grass and just looked at the view for a good half hour.
