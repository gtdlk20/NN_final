I dont think I would have been able to interact with my friends, but closing myself off from everything except me made the trip go into free fall. My mind was racing and for most of the time uncontrollable, and it began to get so extreme that I feared for my sanity. I could no longer think rationally, and my thoughts just went off on random tangents, often contradicting thoughts that had passed through my mind only fractions of a second ago. I fought so hard to calm down, and to reassure myself that I would come down, but it began to get so scary that I didnt have much faith in myself anymore.
