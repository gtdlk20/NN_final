The bicycle leaning against the wall did not appear to me to be a bicycle. I stared at it, and I said to myself that it looked more like a dog, and the mere thought of it being a bicycle seemed completely absurd. A pair of jeans atop the radiator was melting all over it, and the bars of the radiator were wagging. I layed my head to the side, and unfocused my eyes a bit, just thinking. Slowly, my field of vision was clouded by a large, transparent neon persian blanket, which rose from the floor, and tried to wrap itself around me. Behind it, the closet was turning black and brown and black again. My blurred arm turned into a mountain range. My SO came in the room, and he layed his hands on my back and began to give me a backrub. He was melting into me, and I was melting into the bed, all of us like wax.
