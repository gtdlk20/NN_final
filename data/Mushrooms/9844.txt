Jumping forward slightly in time, we were coming up in a big way and the timing perfectly coincided with us reaching the mouth of the river where it meets the ocean and wow!!! Sensory and emotional overload!! This is the most beautiful beach I have ever seen in my entire life, the weather is perfect, the timing is perfect, we are grinning at each other, holding hands, splashing, playing, running and swimming.
