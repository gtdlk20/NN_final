The point I am trying to make, and what I concluded toward the end of my metaphysical journey, is that we have no control over anything.  I did not choose to be born, and I am going to die eventually, at some time I cannot control (unless I desired to commit suicide).  Also, I did not choose my genes or my type of organism, and I did not choose my environment.  I dont really know why Im here either.  I am insignificant, as we all are.  I do not even choose my actions.  The fact that I am writing this sentence was predetermined by nature.  All I can do is just be, live, exist.  All I can do is just go along with the process of my life and see what happens, as we all should, and strive to enjoy it.
