Foolishly, I opted to dose on the mushrooms alone that night, prepared in tea concocted with lemon juice and honey. I still didnt fully understand this powerful chemicals capabilities or truly respect the full power of psychedelics. Id had the notion that, for some reason, Id experience the most enlightening, mind-expansive trip achievable if I could be left completely alone with my abstract thoughts to study and analyze them. Little did I realize how long an eight hour psychedelic experience could feel when the users all alone the entire time. Fortunately, I would not trip for eight full hours that night.
