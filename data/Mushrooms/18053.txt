I muted the TV and glanced at my bedsheet. I keep a camo blanket over the bedspread because...uh..just because. It was teeming with life. The camoflauche itself moved around like little color-coded bodies of germs attacked one-another, and I giggled and watched the fight. I looked up at the TV, which was not only much smaller looking than normal, but actually seemed hundreds of feet away. As a matter of fact, everything seemed smaller. Or I seemed bigger.
