The humid air condenses on all the surfaces in the aquarium, so I have tilted the aquarium slightly so I can suck the excess water with a turkey baster.  I have learned that you must do this.  The excess water seems to slow mushroom development EVEN if the cakes do not touch the water.  I suspect that the water tends to absorb gasses as bacteria multiply in it.  Also, if you are using an ultrasonic humidifier, I also recommend that one changes the humidifier's water frequently even if it hasn't run out, or else it will become stagnant too.  The stagnant water mucks up the transducer element and probably isn't too good for the cakes either (ultrasonic humidifiers giggle everything into the air, including the bacteria, minerals, etc.).
