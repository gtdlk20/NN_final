I had to go smoke a cigarette.  I fought my way outside and walked to the side of the building.  Some people came up and talked to me, but I couldn't understand what they were saying.  I heard 'What's wrong with you?' and that was about it.  I figured since they had a blunt in their hand, telling them what was wrong with me wouldn't matter.  It would be nice to let someone else know how I'm feeling.  'I'm tripping,' I said.  The words surprised me.  Because I hadn't spoken clear words the whole time I was tripping.  They told me I looked like a ghost.  The word ghost echoed over and over again.  He would say 'You look like a ghost ghost ghost ghost ghost...'  He kept repeating it over and over.  I muttered some more strange words, and when I looked up they were gone.
