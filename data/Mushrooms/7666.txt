Remembering what I felt in other trips I've had, what went wrong, what went right. Definitely experiencing the full effects of what the dose I did had to offer. At one point I had thoughts of the bathwater being blood and things felt a bit uncomfortable but I just turned on the bathroom light again and all was well. Sometimes I find IÂ’ll get excessively gory hallucinations, even on a good trip? Unbelievably violent but kinda beautiful at the same time? I dunno... I try to just accept it as part of the experience instead of holding onto it. The more I accepted what I saw and felt the easier it would be to go back to visualizing brighter, prettier, happier things.
