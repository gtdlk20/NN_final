As I am getting pissed, I see the most incredible vision of my life for only a few seconds. Suddenly my friend turns into a holographic idol made of gold, it looks like he is the center town in Egypt and my room is going down into a valley where there is Egyptian like architecture with columns, statues, stairs, buildings, then their are diamond encrusted jewels, and alien symbols, and my friend has a pharaohs mask and rotating and changing is this brilliant hyperlight. My friend continues getting upset though, and the vision is cut short.
