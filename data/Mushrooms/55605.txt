This report is about the first time (and only time to date) that I tried shrooms.  It starts off on a thursday morning.  My roommate had recently acquired 6 gelcaps and we were going to wait for the upcoming weekend to try them.  We are quite experienced with cannabis and alcohol but that is all that we had experienced before the mushrooms.
