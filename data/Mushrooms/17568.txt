After smoking a big fat joint, my friend and I decided to come back to my place to take the shrooms I had left over from my birthday.  This would be the very first time I had ever experienced these kinds of hallucinations.  About an hour after ingesting the shrooms, we were very disappointed, because nothing -or very little- seemed to be happening.  When I got up to show her to the door, I felt myself shrink down to the ground and eventually collapsed because of the amount of pressure I felt pulling me to the ground.  This was no time for me to be alone.
