I learned from this last experience the following: The power of sensitivity that mushrooms activate is a holy power that should only be applied to nature. Tripping out to man-made shapes and colors is an abuse of that power. If I ever do mushrooms again, it must be an occasion in unadulterated nature. Only then will the mushrooms align me with my surroundings and interest me with their unique insight.
