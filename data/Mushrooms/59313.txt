Yesterday at around 1 am I took about half a gram [0.6-0.8 grams] of Panaeolus (Copelandia) cyanenscens. The Effects took about an our to kick in. After a while I found myself lying on my couch giggling and repeating phrases that seem totally useless to me now like: 'I do what I do, and why..just for its own sake', 'There's no god, where should he be?' or 'Damn, I'm coming down' followed by endless laughter. I felt like I had solved all the mysteries of perception, mind and spirit and was perfectly happy. Now, I don't, but the most interesting thing about all this nonsense is that I could 'feel' the cerebral nature of my brain. You might ask 'cerebral nature', what's that supposed to mean? I'll try to explain: My conclusion was that that thing, located from behind my eyes down to my spinal cord and from there reaching into every part of my body, was actually myself. I was absolutely sure that the whole discussion about the nature and location of the mind or spirit is totally obsolete.
