Suddenly a part of me thought that if I could find a mirror I could somehow salvage my life and remind myself that I was just having a bad trip. I staggered to the bathroom mirror and what I saw shocked me. I staggered to the bathroom mirror and what I saw shocked me. I didnt recognize the being that stood in front of me, I knew I knew him. But from where? He looked plastic almost like he was made of wax. This person who was myself then began to melt. Oh fuck, I need to get out of here I thought as I ran towards the front door. If I can get outside and see the night sky and nature maybe it can remind me that Im still on earth and that Im still a human being.
