That night, myself and a few friends, including my then girlfriend, brewed a very strong tea from our harvest. We drank the juice of 150-200 each and made a second brew. We then went on the 15 minute walk back to the park. I knew it was gonna be a biggie within 8 or 9 minutes, when we stopped outside a pub to chat to a few friends who were out in the sun.
