Now, I kinda would have preferred to wait, I was tired and we had had a loooong day.  I also got up early and had little sleep the night before.   But J, even though he has had psychedelic drug experiences before, like acid and X, has never taken psilocybin mushrooms.  I had been telling him forever that if he did them, he would never want acid or ecstasy again...because mushrooms have all the good things that come with those two drugs without all the 'bad things' (side effects, crashing, physical harm) and it's a much more natural experience in which one can still keep a grip on reality (unless one takes too many, but I have always only taken about a quarter of an eighth, which is what we both took last night).  Our seller said to split them b/c normally an eighth would be what one person should take, and if we wanted to make the most of the trip we should definitely take them all.  I didn't want to trip hard so we decided to each take a quarter of them.
