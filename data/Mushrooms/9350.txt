Then I closed my eyes and started drifting off. The music was extremely textural and provided a gorgeous backdrop for the stage of my thoughts. My thoughts were very visual and I started going through the things I like about my life. I started getting hit with waves of gratitude for the people around me, the music was amazing and I cried with joy. After a while I realized I had had my eyes closed for quite a while and decided to open them. The stereo said the song playing now was called Eyes Closed, I wondered if this was a coincidence.
