So I made my way into the bedroom where I found my boyfriend tripping out on the designs on the comforter. I joined him. We had finished peaking a while ago and our minds were a little clearer. We were actually able to converse with each other, though the conversation didn't make a lot of sense... We were still feeling silly and laughing a lot. The other guys had gone home (It had to be nearly 3 am at this point) so the living room was empty. I went to put on some music...
