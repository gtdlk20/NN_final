T+++?:??: I've entered an incredibly deep feeling, introspective state, it feels like I'm going over every single memory in life and attributing a value to each of them, the higher the value the more I would like to act as I did in that memory in future. After what feels like an ETERNITY I've narrowed down a handful (about twenty) unique, low value memories and investigate the cause of my low value actions. After I deduce the causes and decide upon preferred high value actions I do the same with a much larger amount of high value memories, but this time I investigate why exactly I feel they are high-value. Consistently when I do this I feel I've valued some memories too high because of egocentric or materialistic (among other) values. I begin re-evaluating a lot of my memories from a more disassociated angle, and amaze myself at the different values I'm presented with. I form a concise paragraph detailing what I concluded from this evaluation process, and decide to try and write it down.
