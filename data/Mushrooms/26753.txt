11:30 P.M. I went and bought myself an ice cream bar - the first food I would have since the spicy chicken and I devoured it. It was the most delicious tasting ice cream I ever had. After this, the sweat truly came and I let go. I was down completely, my thoughts running at a normal speed and only the memory of the days and eons long entheogenic voyage remained.
