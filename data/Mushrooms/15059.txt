I picked them up for a friend who wanted them for New Years Eve, Dwayne explained to me. I still have some left over. Without the slightest hint of hesitation I agreed to buy a gram of the mushrooms from his as well. I didnt know when I wanted to do them, but I had decided that I definitely wanted to at some point in my life, so I wasnt about to pass up the opportunity. I couldnt help but think about HSTs quote regarding LSD: Jesus man! You dont look for acid! Acid finds you when it thinks youre ready.
