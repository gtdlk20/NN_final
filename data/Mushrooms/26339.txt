10:30pm - Standing in the hallway observing 2 drunk people and 2 totally sober people.  Sober people seemed really strange in how they were making fun of the drunken people.  Being drunk just seemed like a waste to me and in my beshroomed state, I swore off any alcohol for my life because it became such a waste.  I felt sad and sorry for those sober kids who felt they were superior to anyone who uses substances to experience life.  I knew they would never experience what I was seeing and feeling and felt truly sad and angry that society doesnÂ’t accept it.
