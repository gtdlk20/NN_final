During this time I think T had decided to go out to the park, but came back in soon after as he too felt the shrooms take hold.  He said he was in full on survival mode, and even typed in '911' on his cell phone, all he had to do was push the 'send' button, just in case.  At one point I also had that feeling: 'What if we need to call for help, then what?'  That thought vanished as quickly as it came.
