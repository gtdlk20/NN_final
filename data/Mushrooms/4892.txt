The light came on at some point and filled the room with garish brightness. I finally started to remember who I was, and that Id taken two grams of magic mushrooms. The trip must have gone bad. I called out for my roommate, J! He didnt come. But of course not. He didnt exist. He was only in my head. It had probably been months since I ate those mushrooms; I was now in a mental asylum, in permanent psychosis, with my family and scientists looking on. Behold: the freak who fucked himself up on drugs.
