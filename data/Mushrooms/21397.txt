I consumed the mushrooms at 10:00 A.M. with no particular fowl tastes.  Everyone goes to these extreme measures to try and hide the taste, but I found it actually not bad at all, having eaten them in about 15 seconds.  We went out to his hot-tub, where mist arose because of the cool weather.  The enviornment felt mystical and perfect.
