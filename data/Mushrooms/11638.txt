Once we got back to the car, we locked ourselves in and could not stop talking about how horrible it was to come across strangers while we were tripping. We were starting to trip harder and I had to drive back to my apartment. Luckily, it was only about 2 miles from the park. I remember feeling like we were flying through space and watching my hands hold the steering wheel like they were the biggest hands in the world. I just kept repeating 'I should win a medal for driving right now' and my friend's hair was floating through the air moving through the car.
