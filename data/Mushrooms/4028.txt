I have spent most of my 38 years researching and studying the occult, the strange, phenomenology and the unexplainable within the human experience. For at least the last ten years I kept my eyes open for an available and sufficient dose of mushrooms or DMT to cross my path but in North Eastern America these plants and chemicals are exceedingly difficult to encounter, and much less so at a suitable shamanic dosage. In the last 4 of those 10 years, I woke up. Through the internet and research, I became aware of the nature of our reality and the forces which we allow to manipulate it. I also became aware of our role in this matrix and perhaps our purpose as well.
