As I've always had with shrooms, the effects literally caught me by surprise. I'd obviously been feeling a bit of a trembly body high for about half an hour, but when I suddenly looked away from the tv and towards the kitchen, I noticed the walls were booming towards me in a 'two steps forward, one step back' motion. This made me feel a bit uneasy, so I told W that we should go for a walk. We walked outside, I lit a cigarette, W lit a joint, and the fun started.
