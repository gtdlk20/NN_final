It started back at me in the most cold, cynical way, and said: No, you are an echo, an event horizon on a collapsing black hole. I (who?) renounced it and I stated: I will forget then, forget in the dream. And hey, wait a minute, you are the tool I created, a game I contrived. Logic, reasoning, tools of beauty to observe itself. Identity, Self, origin, creation, Will, choice, prime experience  it was all very confused and mixed up.
