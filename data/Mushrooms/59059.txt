While he was back at work in SpencerÂ’s Casey continued to mess with my head...in a good way of course...but it still bugged me out and made me laugh my ass off. He would wave his hand in my face in a very melodic and rave like way, each time he did this I would zone out for a sec and then flinch when he moved too fast. His hand looked too ill. He would also point out things to me, like little spots on the wall and asked me what color they were. He pointed out an old fan in the wall above the doors that lead back out into the mall. The fan had two strings hanging from it that Casey swore were grayish and greenish colors. Yet to me they seemed to be bright ass blue and pink.
