Two days earlier I took 5 grams of dried prepared in a mint tea and I was definitely tripping but mild visuals. In fact I would have welcomed bats with fangs and flying spiders but I had very mild bejeweled rivers of beauty but really not what I had expected and I deemed it a failure to launch. I was going to do the fresh the very next day but I thought I should give it a full 48 hours before trying again.
