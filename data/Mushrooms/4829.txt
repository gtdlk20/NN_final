There is a long path near where I live that goes through a narrow stretch of planted forest next to the highway. We both agreed this would be a perfect place for me to explore the screen behind the mirror, so we started walking in the direction of the highway bridge, a.k.a. the shorter way from where I live. As we were walking down the path, all I could perceive was a sense of overwhelming beauty within everything, but for some reason, still no bright visuals other than a fine, trembling haze covering everything I looked at. In the middle of the path in front of us, some dimwit had parked his silver car, which I couldn't bring myself to believe was really there, but W assured me it was. A bit weirded out by this, we decided to go in the opposite direction and traverse the entire length of the path.
