Imagine you are an ant, or at least the size of an ant. Now to you everything is bigger. A portable TV is the size of a movie theater, a bread crumb can feed you for a week. But if you were your normal size a bread crumb is nothing. If you were starving to death and you saw a bread crumb you wouldn't waste the energy to pick it up. Now you understand how proportions work. Now think about this; space, not like planets and stars, but the actual space in which they exist is infinite. So in proportion to the universe we, Earth, the galaxies, and all matter are infinitely small. Infinitely small is basically the same as nothing. Nothing meaning non-existant. Therefore we do not exist and nothing we do, see, or feel will ever matter.
