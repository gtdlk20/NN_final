The effect started becoming noticeable, my head started slowing down and feeling heavier. I knew that in the next 20 mins or so I would be launched into the unknown. I was listening to some Vangelis music the past few days, so I hastily started a spotify playlist based on Chariots of fire, this all becomes very poetic if you choose to look at it that way. The chariots of fire is a concept linked with Apollo and the sun god Abraxas, so this is how the trip towards what I thought would be the sun began. I glanced through the tracks in the queue, I recognised some of them but not all.
