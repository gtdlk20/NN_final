In our group there isn't some kind of hierarchy but there is some sort of who to ask for what. Nitz is the one to ask when you have money trouble, Rocko is the one to ask when you fall short on ganja, Cal is the one to ask when you need a place to crash, Gimpy is the one to ask when you need a car. All in all some kind of simbiotic relation rather than friendship but it changes tonight.
