My trip lasted about 3.5 hrs and I finally went to sleep at 6:45 witch was not what I had planned to do at all. I think I was becoming so confused not just because of the shrooms but it was 4 in the morning I usually go to sleep at 2. I have to say mushrooms are hard to get a proper dose on, this was the fist time I ever had such a intense experience from just a few wild cubes.
