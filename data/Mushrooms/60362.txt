Me and a friend of mine Dan came into a large amount of mushrooms and got tired of eating them, so we ended our trip and the next day tried smoking them. At first smoking mushrooms may taste bad, but its an aquired taste, after about 3-5 hits I dont really taste how bad it is anymore (not that its that bad anyways, it smells worse then it tastes).
