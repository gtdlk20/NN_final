Shortly after lying down, I felt something grab onto my leg and pull me out of the tent. What was happening? Suddenly I heard my name being called. I looked over, and I could see K, A, and E standing maybe 20 feet away. They were waving at me. What? Why? What did that hand motion mean? None of it made any sense. They seemed like they were a world away, how could I even travel that kind of distance? I was reminded of the pain in my stomach, and returned to the tent.
