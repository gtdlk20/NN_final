The advice I followed was to just give in to it, not try to stop it or whatever... just let my mind go.  And I kept in mind that no matter how hard I tripped, I would be normal again in just a few hours.  It's all good!  And I made sure to have someone sober around.  Even an experienced tripper needs a babysitter sometimes.
