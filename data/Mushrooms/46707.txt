It all began when a friend invited me and M for a day out to Alton Towers, A British Theme Park. I suggested that a dose of magic mushrooms may increase the enjoyment of the day out so the day before we went to our local head shop and purchased 15 grammes of philosophers stones each as the only mushrooms available were strains which we had either not tried or had unpleasant trips with. Being conscientious little trip heads we also bought some vitamins (B complex and C) and Paracetamol so that we could hasten a come down if we began to bad trip. We looked forward to an early night so we would be fully refreshed in the morning.
