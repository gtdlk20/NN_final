After 2-3 minutes in the ever-deeper womb, visuals came.  Somehow the womb had become my home, and I was exploring the evolution of man.  I would see those 2D Inca patterns, think about all the things I knew about the culture and picture them with that info.  Some patterns looked like abstract drawings, those were from Africa, some looked like lines and runes, those are in early Europe, etc.  This was very fun, but the super fast come-on was nauseating.  My body was buzzing with incredible energy.  This all happend in the first 5 minutes.  Still 'living' in the womb, I focused my attention to my room.  I 'felt' it occupying the 3D space around me, and I imagined how my 5 roommates were all doing their various chores.  Then my imaging focused outside, where my mind was searching out all the living things.  It was as if the mushroom was revealing to me all the life that is around us, even in a lousy city.  Visuals were becoming 3D, adding relief to them.
