Everything in the world became connected.  I felt a connection in which I could not explain between emotions, objects, actions, places, people, time, ideas, and anything you could imagine.  I saw how everyoneÂ’s lives came together in an interconnected web.  I knew everyone had their own paths in life and those paths are continuously crossing with others.  I felt that my parents were wise for having experienced so much and realized that it was them who have given me the gift of life and set me on its course.  I began being overtaken by extreme feelings of joy and love.
