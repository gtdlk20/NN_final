Two weeks ago, at the beginning of my holiday vacation from college and back home, I embarked on a solo level 4 or 5 mushroom trip, ingesting 5 grams dried.  This is the highest level trip I have ever done of any substance.  I am male, 19, in good physical and mental health, and weigh 170 pounds.  I was lying on my bed in the dark the whole time, intermittently looking out the window at the night sky.  I felt this setting would foster a very analytical, metaphysical journey.  I am the most logical, rational person I know, and always seek the truth.  I was not afraid of what the alien state of mind might reveal to my consciousness; in fact my goal was enlightenment.  I initially anticipated only a level 2 or 3 trip because I thought the mushrooms had lost a considerable amount of potency, but I was aware that they could have possibly retained their strength.
