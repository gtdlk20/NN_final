OK, simultaneously as I am rising in this musical crescendo the visual hallucinations also rise. In previous trips I have seen the patterns that ebb and flow in a two-dimensional way in other words they are stuck on some surface, the floor for example or the wall or a tree but always the images are constructed out of the substance of real life. In this case it was the granite looking vinyl floor under my feet.
