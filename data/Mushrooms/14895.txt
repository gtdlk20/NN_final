The first cluster headache decided things, a psychedelic freak-out is preferable to an hour or so of what feels like a blow torch aimed at my skull.  Still cautious though, so only took 0.1g (equivalent, actual mass of the chocolate fragment was 1.5g as each 1 gram chocolate weighed a total of 15g - weighed out with a scale).
