This was the third time I've done psychedelics but I only ever take very low doses.  I was with friends and we had a great time at first, laughing loads.  Then we went to a club and I found that the environment was really affecting me - if the music was something I liked, I felt great, but if it was unfamiliar, I felt very confused and disjointed.  Likewise, seeing people who seemed different from me (dressed different, significantly older or younger etc) made me feel confused and like I didn't understand what was going on.  On my way home with my boyfriend, a car that had stopped for us at a pedestrian crossing suddenly revved and accelerated towards us for a 'joke', to scare us - this freaked me out big time and I was suddenly intensely scared.  My boyfriend kept asking what I was scared of, but it was nothing, or rather everything: just a sense of fear and vulnerability.  I desperately needed to feel safe, be in a familiar place with people I trusted, so I would recommend to anyone doing drugs like this that you do so.  Anything negative or threatening seems to be perceived more strongly, as if the normal defences that you have in your everyday life are stripped away.
