As we walked we encountered several dog walkers and joggers. At the start of the trip we had intended to freak out as many random people as we could, and I am pretty sure thats exactly what we did, though I remember none of what we said or did to them. God only knows what they were thinking, and I doubt even God cares. With a bit of luck, their lives were ruined forever.
