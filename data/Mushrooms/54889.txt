My walls were pulsating in and out. I tried to stand to get a drink but I felt like jello and fell on my face cracking up. The good thing is that I felt so damn good that I didn't feel pain. I couldn't stop dancing either. My world was now a washing machine spinning in flashy colorful circles. I wasn't expecting to be that blasted but I was wrong. I barely remember what I saw I just know I saw things. I fell into my coat closet and just stayed there so comfortable and just closed my eyes. My musics still going so I was in heaven. I was seeing a whole 3-d neon story unfolding right before my very eyes..in total darkness! Then one of my other friends (lets call him T) came over just to see how we were doing...T walked into me laughing nonstop and E wrapped up in his shirt in a ball like a baby just happily tripping. T and I smoked a joint alil bit after that. By that time E and I were just past the point of making sense. After T left, B came over to check up on us too. Nothing eventful happened while B was here. I was laying on the floor on my carpet just watching it dance and change. E was laying down trying to understand everything.. Why this Why that. It was about 3:30 now and I was still in space. E and B left my house at the same time and I was there alone listening to trance. Thank god I was on my come-down by that point because I wouldnt want to trip alone. Thats about it.
