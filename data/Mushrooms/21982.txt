So here I am, sitting in complete darkness looking at a spiraling vivid full colour lightshow with techno music in the background. This isnt too bad I thought to myself. That was until I realised that the patterns I was staring at was me, I was the patterns. I no longer felt like I was a human being but a soul that was everything but. Each time the pattern would rotate, shift or fold these sharp pains would shoot through my being. It was really starting to scare me, and the atmosphere of the trip took a really dark turn when the thought that I had died started to slip into my thoughts. Shit, ok so Im officially going to be the first person to die from magic mushrooms, not cool.
