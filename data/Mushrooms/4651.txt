The sound of a stream that runs down from the mountains grew louder. I knew it ran parallel to the trail at this point and looking through the tree line I could see the white foam of water breaking on rocks. A little flesh colored figure bounded across the stones. A shaved squirrel? I figured maybe a naked gnome. A shaved squirrel? I figured maybe a naked gnome. I stepped back and looked again. It was gone. Nothing but rocks and babbling water. IÂ’ll hold firm it was a streaking elf. What the hell- it was my trip.
