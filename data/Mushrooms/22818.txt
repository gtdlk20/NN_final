I am glad I wrote the disclaimer, and about my experience while tripping and directly after, because it seems that since the experience (and I found the same thing with my other trips), my egoic mind will try to convince me that the experience wasnt really profound or that great. Not to mention our entire culture, which essentially denies the validity or reality of any transcendent experience. Also, as my friend Austin says, Its easy to downplay an experience that is not your own. For any skeptics I recommend checking out a website called TASTE about scientists transcendent experiences, or just trying it yourself.
