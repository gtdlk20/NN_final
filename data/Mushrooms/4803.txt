I recently had my first spiritual experience within the confines of a holy place. I was attending a church service in Barasa, Haiti and during the singing of hymns I was awestruck at the levels of faith within the room. The energy was tangible and people participated with all of their hearts. This ceremony was in stark contrast to the Catholic masses I had been familiar with as a child, masses in which the solemn readings of a priest were met with the robotic recitations of the audience. Instead the room was filled with passionate proclamations about hope, and I watched as this simple building served as a sanctuary for the community to build faith in a better tomorrow. After the mass I joined the young girls dancing to homemade drums. I got lost in the fun of it all and truly drew strength from this experience.
