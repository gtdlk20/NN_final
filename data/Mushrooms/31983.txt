A good set and setting is crucial but most importantly having the awareness that this experience is not an abstraction but that the trip, physically and mentally, occurs in one's own consciousness.  I canÂ’t stress this enough.  Way too often people think of the trip as something that will be experienced outside of them, in the sense of the physical world becoming distorted, which it most definitely does, but the distortion also happens to you!  To your ego! To your consciousness! And when that happens the trip becomes so bizarre that people will often feel overwhelmed.  But if you can become aware of this, through the acquisition of knowledge from others, it will allow you to ameliorate the potentials of a bad trip.
