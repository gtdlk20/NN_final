Near the end of dinner J was asking me what it was like to trip on shrooms but I couldn't describe it to him.  I was feeling panicky and ready to leave.  I learned that he had tripped on LSD a year ago on a boat trip and that it was the scariest experience of his life.  I didn't want to converse with them because I was feeling so weird and somewhat panicky.  I began to feel a very strong sense of panic as my body tingled and I gripped the chair handles and looked down.  I began feeling so small and insignificant and that the room was moving.  I looked at the weird carpet which I cannot describe now since I've only been to that food place once and it was while tripping (knock on wood).  But the carpet seemed to be moving and raising up at me.  Out of the corner of my eye it looked like W's chair was moving backwards as if he was being dragged toward the corner of the wall.  I shut my eyes and opened them again.  W was where he was before, J was the same and the room wasn't moving.
