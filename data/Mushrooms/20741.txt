I was still feeling strange, coming down, and felt like watching TV.  I put on a great music video that has always stirred my emotions of sadness and joy:  King Crimson 'Starless' and the tears of joy and sadness flowed... it was amazing and cleansing- feeling the instruments speak to me and the lyrics/tone of his voice.  Then I remembered that Joe Cocker died and as a tribute I put on his cover of 'I get by with a little help from my friends' which gave me tears of love.
