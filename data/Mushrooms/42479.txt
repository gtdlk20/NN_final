I was tired, but still tripping. Maybe not tripping, but I definitely still felt high. I wanted to sleep. I wanted to bury my thoughts in peaceful slumber, as I felt a bit detached from reality and it wasn't unpleasant, but it wasn't pleasant either. It was.. empty. So I turned off my light and the television and tried. You can probably guess what ensued -- ladies dancing, colorful flowers, mostly dark, almost black and white type visuals, but some also had color. Very faint, cartoon type stuff.
