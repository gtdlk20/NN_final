The trip began pleasantly and very rapidly with a little warm cuddling, nothing overtly sexual or verbal, and I think that even though I felt aware enough at times, there just wasnt really enough enduring coherence in that awareness to talk. I slept for a little while and my wife says she started laughing.  I spent some time on my side with my arm over her chest with her on her back.  I could see her breasts and somehow that was terribly important and as a certain sequence in the music played I tried to make a word to describe being there with her like that, and it came out something like cream and gems of power (I know, Wheel of Time, and my wife says I was mumbling).  I wondered if it was important to see more of her, if I should, but she didnt want me to move or touch her anywhere.  I also remember licking her forehead to taste her, and she says I looked really weird.
