We emerged from the tunnel into a completely different world. Decades, maybe centuries seemed to have passed. All the plants seemed about three times as tall as they had been when we fought our way through to get there, and the cars speeding over the bridge looked futuristic. One thing that was the same was a truck that had been parked in a lay-by about a hundred yards along the dual carriageway. We could only see the top of it over the enbankment and now it looked like a huge monster hiding amongst the greenery, ready to pounce. We fought our way through the tall and thorny plants, wondering what the new world was going to be like, and how we had survived in the tunnel for so long. We decided it must be at least 50 years in the future, and we headed back to town to see what it was like.
