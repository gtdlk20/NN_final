(Post Call) Okay to talk to but things are really moving faster and faster right now... arms seems a zillion miles away. the keyboard is so amazingly small, this is cool! I wonder if my blood pressure is up, cuz I can see things popping out on my hands a bit... interesting... should really have medical equipment so SOMEONE can figure out what this does to your body... mind you, right now I don't mind what's going on. But I can imagine being in a state where I WOULD!
