The first 2 to 3 hours (after I assume the first 30 minutes) were somewhat blurry to recall all the details.  In part this was possibly because I tried to keep my eyes closed and focus internally.  I was aware of music and colors, but did to focus on them, and tried to steer my mind towards contemplation. My goal was healing, and I thought focusing on fun patterns and colors would distract my mind from the task at hand.
