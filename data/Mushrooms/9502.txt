My boyfriend at the time (who is now my husband), M, got them for me and he was to be my sitter. We told my poor mom we would be midnight bowling with some friends and wouldnÂ’t be home for several hours. She was trusting enough of us to let M spend the night and we lied to her. After she went to bed, I ate the mushrooms with lots of orange juice and we decided to play some video games (specifically WarioWare) until the effects started to hit. It was about 10:30 at night. After about 20-30 minutes I started to feel really silly. I was giggling at everything and feeling a little woozy. So M suggested I walk around and see how much it was really affecting my body.
