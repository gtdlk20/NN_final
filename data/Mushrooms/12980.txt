Margo began to eat her mushrooms.  I kept staring at mine, wondering why they looked so grey and old.  Martin was fumbling with an empty bag and Nick was just finishing up his eighth.  James was watching us.  I put a very small piece of the mushroom in my mouth, held it there for a moment and chewed it.  It tasted like soft old sticks.  I gently took it out of my mouth and placed it back in my palm.  I wanted some orange juice.  Somehow I forced myself to eat the rest of what was in my bag.  After I got over my initial squeamishness the mushrooms werenÂ’t that hard to chew and swallow.  I got used to the old-stick taste.  Three glasses of orange juice later, we were ready to go.  Martin wandered back into his room and Margo, Nick, James and I got ready for a walk outside.
