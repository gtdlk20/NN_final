I sat across the table from my friend.  I began to realise the infinite size of the world.  I was staring at my friend, but the rest of the world got larger and larger.  I could still see the walls, ceiling, floor, etc., but I could see *through* them too, and there was a blue grid, like in the movie 'Tron'.  I was overwhelmed and daunted by this, but I had experienced this several times before, and realised it was a normal part of the mushroom trip.  I started to feel like I couldn't breathe properly, so I told my friend I was going to the toilet to change clothes.  At the time I was wearing a skivvy, with a shirt over the top.  I was taking the skivvy off, so I was just in the light cotton shirt.  I went to the bathroom, went into a cubicle, and noticed that things were starting to go 'chaotic'.  That word describes it well, but I will go into more detail.
