We really deserved our harvest. After roughly 20 hours of field work, we finally stumbled across a field brimming with liberty caps. They were everywhere. Two hours of frantic picking later we had approximately a kilo of fresh mushrooms. Hyperventilating and happy, we returned home and examined our bounty. We invited all our closest friends round. Shock and awe was the general reaction to the colossal pile of fungi we had amassed. There were seven of us in total. Obviously still reeling from the adrenaline rush of our find, I decided that we were going to do half of the mushrooms that night.
