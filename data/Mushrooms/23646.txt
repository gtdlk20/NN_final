At this time the effects were wearing off, and I paced for a while longer and then became depressed. Later on as I was coming down I was not feeling any more trippy effects, except for a strong stoned feeling, and I had a difficult time controlling my emotions. Bad emotions stayed with me without any effort, and good emotions were difficult to conjure. I think it is best to be as free of stress as possible when tripping to reduce anxiety from the outside world, which I was feeling very strongly. I ordered pizza with some cautious phone calls, and it arrived and I spoke to my mother and I loved her and had a great appreciation for her. I realized many times during my trip how much I loved my mother, and how I would change things.
