Other then being able to see different spectra of reality, when I was at this totally still, unbreathing state I was sure that I would not be visible to someone who walked by. I just knew it. Because my consciousness had slowed to a point that they just wouldnt notice me. It seems far fetched but I've read stories about sorcerors and yogi types who could do this. Nobody walked by so I couldn't test it. Next time!
