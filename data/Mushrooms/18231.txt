I felt like a little kid again...I was helpless, and all I wanted to do was tell them what had gone on that night, so that somebody would comfort me, so that somebody would tell me everything would be okay...that my life was full of wonderful things and that no drug could take away these things. But I couldn't. I realized that now that I'm an adult, this was something I had to conquer myself, an experience which I had to survive and learn from on my own.
