We finally got home and we were dropped off by a bar next to the train station called RockwellÂ’s. After calling our parents we walked up onto the train platform and sat down. Casey and Chriss were still down by the phones. I can recall me and Lisa talking about how useless we felt. We talked about how we didn't want to move for anything and how impossible it was to get up from the ground. Our bodies were like mush. We sat on the ground and watched the trains go by. Our visual effects had basically gone away. But every now and then lights would get a little brighter and things would move a little funnier, but it didn't last long.
