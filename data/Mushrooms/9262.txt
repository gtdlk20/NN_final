I woke up the next day at around 10am. I woke up first and took a shower. I had a very positive, refreshed feeling, and very happy about the fact that there was no anxiety whatsoever on the trip. But also that me and my gf connected in a profound way. When she finally woke up, she seemed in a very positive mood as well, very peaceful and innocent. Overall for the dose size and how late it was when we took it, I feel it was a super positive experience, and maybe the coziness of the night and being in bed together made it simply perfect. The only downside was waking up to an army of ants on the bedside table that had discovered the leftover of the honey concoction.
