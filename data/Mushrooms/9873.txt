My nose is producing phlegm, lots of it and I am enjoying wiping it all over my face my facial contortions also include hawking and generating spital and it is just coming and coming and coming. I am writhing on the floor of my shower and making hideous animal noises. This culminates in oh dear can I write this. I explode with vomit and it is everywhere, I writhe in it. I smell it. I vomit again. This is too much. Some sanity returns I stand up and shower myself down. It never occurred to me to turn on the hot water. I start to wash some of the mess down the drain. I am weak and exhausted.
