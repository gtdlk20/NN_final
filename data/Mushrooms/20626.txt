I was fully immersed in the experience at this point, but still fighting ever-increasing waves of nausea. I was fully immersed in the experience at this point, but still fighting ever-increasing waves of nausea. I was trying to keep everything in my stomach for as long as I could manage, but I had the intuition that eventually I would just have to jettison everything. Now, I wouldn't label myself an overly superstitious person. I firmly believe in the rules of evidence and the scientific process. However, at the same time my parents taught me the value of a spiritual life. I've changed my beliefs and my world-view countless times by now, but never once have I been convinced that there isn't more to existence. Since this trip, I have gotten really on-board with the idea that certain plant-teachers encourage vomiting to rid you of bad energy/spirits/thoughts, whatever you want to call it.
