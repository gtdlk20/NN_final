We went and got some pizza, and he said to put the mushrooms on the pizza, like it was freakin' pizza hut or something. I ate my slice with the half eighth of magic mushrooms. About ten minutes after eating, I noticed some definite mental effects. I felt very good, almost too good, like it was MDMA/ecstacy or something like that. This feeling persisted for about an hour. Just euphoria, feeling toasty. We sat on his couch, him sitting a few feet away, and watched a GG Allin concert video/documentary. Now, GG Allin is considered the most insane punk rocker who ever lived, a guy whom his own friends, family, and bandmates lived in fear of. But, watching this video I felt nothing but good anticipation for the evening. That's when the stuff got weird, and in a fast way indeed. The lights from the VCR, green and red, started to look like tiny lasers, shooting horizontally, and going around the televison screen. My skull and top of brain area started feeling very warm, like my brain chemistry was concocting the psychedelic mixture of blood, brain fluid, and the mushroom's natural chemicals, whatever they are.
