Post Trip:  Overall the trip was much different than I expected. The intensities of emotions I experienced couldnÂ’t be fully understood while I was experiencing them. Looking back on the experience, I am able to much more fully understand and appreciate what I learned during the trip. I think that a lot of what I learned from the experience I already knew, yet it was not concrete to me because I had never thought about it verbally. My advice to anyone considering tripping: make sure you trip with people whom you love and share a mutual respect, respect the drug for its power and intensity, and go into the experience with the right intentions (self understanding and improvement).
