This new state felt more real than normal reality. It wasnt that I was dead and didnt exist anymore. It was that I never really existed to begin with. My sense of self was just the sum total of all my bodys senses and my memories stored in the brain. As though my body was a living feeling video camera and I had been stuck in that single perspective my entire life but now I could exist from any perspective. I am not the body or the thoughts. I am the thing that is perceiving the thoughts. Some might call this the soul. But the soul is not me, because he didnt exist anymore. Do a search for a video called Imagining the 10th dimension. It helped some of this click for me after the trip was over and I was searching online trying to find out what the fuck just happened to me.
