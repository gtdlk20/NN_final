It took awhile, but my friends convinced me I was only being paranoid.  I felt a little better about the situation, but extreme paranoia overcame me again when we talked with the hippy looking guy and for a second I almost believed that he was some sort of undercover police figure.  Once again my paranoia had to be talked down and I felt like an asshole for being so dumb.  I could tell my friends, especially Seth, were getting tired of reassuring me like I was a helpless child.
