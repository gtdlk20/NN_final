We bought the shrooms and walked to the seawall to divide them up. It was a good mouthful of dried shrooms with about half of it caps. I held mine in my mouth for a few minuets before swallowing them. We then walked back to a table by the beach where there were lots of bushes and woodwork around. About thirty minutes later we could just begin to tell the effects were setting in. Patterns seemed to move slightly and colors were brighter. Everything seemed funny and I was expressing a lot of emotion when I would talk about anything or crack a joke. I remember thinking I wish I could do that more without any chemical. P wanted some cigarettes but we were starting to trip then so we did not want to walk into a store and try and buy any so we went looking for a machine.
