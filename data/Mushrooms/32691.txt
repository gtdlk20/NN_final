I ate the other half of the bag in about one minute, and decided to take a shower. The hot water felt ecstatic. It felt like when I was in the water, I was really in clothing that was as warm as they are when they just came out of the dryer. The shower curtain was breathing, and slightly wavy. I felt the other shrooms coming on, and I decided that the shower might not be the best place to be when they fully hit me. So I got out, put on a nice warm hoody, and laid on my bed. At this time my friend, Josh called me. He knew I was going to do them, and called me to see how I was doing. I told him of my experience, but after a couple minutes he said he had to go and he'd call back later.
