As I started to giggle, I noticed her beginning to feel it to.  We walked around the apartment and ended up in my room, where many posters hung on my walls.  I told my friend that the eyes of the people seemed to be looking right through me, and that I had no choice but to tear them down.  Anxiously and in a panicked state, I began ripping the pictures down.  I knocked down all the teddy bears that were facing me and tore down all the family photos.
