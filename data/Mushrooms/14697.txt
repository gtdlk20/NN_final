I felt like nothing mattered, but I did not want to live that way. I was terrified I would be stuck in this mindset forever. Stuck in the circle of time I just stepped into. I thought about how terrible Tom Hanks must have felt in Groundhog Day. That would be hell. That's not what I want. I want to live in this beautiful world. I don't want to exist as a pure intelligence. I always thought it would be nice to transcend my human body into a pure consciousness, but that doesn't exist. We are consciousness. When we move on to the next plane of existence, you will not be you, you will be everything.
