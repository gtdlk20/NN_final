Half an hour later and we were in another dimension. We were confused and delirious. I felt as if I had no control over my limbs; they were flapping about like a branch in a gale as we laughed uncontrollably. Anything that anybody did seemed unbelievably hilarious and I also started to feel a profound connection with everybody else in the room. I seem to remember that when I was laughing it felt totally amazing, like a primeval release of energy. It felt purifying and energising. We were laughing so hard that it seemed to echo inside my chest. At that point I started to think about how natural and right the whole situation was. I understood how for thousands of years humans had been undertaking the exact same ritual of picking mushrooms, getting high with their mates and having a fucking good time. I thought about the people walking the streets, walking past these mushrooms, knowing they were there, and that they were psychedelic, yet completely disregarding them out of sheer ignorance. Why the hell werent they getting them there selves? Dont they want to feel like this? Coz its fucking brilliant! Fools!
