I was in Amsterdam with my girlfriend at the time. She remains the girl I have had the longest relationship with in my life. We had a common past of somewhat heavy marijuana use. She had taken mushrooms only once before and I had already used them maybe (5) times. We each got an eight of Mexican mushrooms in the Smart Shop. We asked extensive questions concerning the effects of the variety of mushrooms the shop offered, and the guy who ran the shop and sold us the sacred shrooms, answered our questions based on his own experiences with the different types. I think this gave my girlfriend a confidence that I resisted because I already had a knowledge of mushrooms.
