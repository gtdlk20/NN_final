I saw my cat, Binx, who is thee chillest cat ever, he reminds me of me, if I were a cat. I reached out to him spiritually, told him with my spirit to come over to me so I could pet him. And he came. This didn't surprise me at the time, because I Understood. I pet him for a bit, and then decided to come on the computer. I talked to my friend, Zack on AIM for a bit, and told him what it was like, because he has never done them before, but really wants to. I told him of my experiences, of my epiphany, of my Understanding. And he found it all immaculatly wise. He said my words were like poetry.
