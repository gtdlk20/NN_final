The movie was amazing, I could not stop laughing through the whole thing. When the tunnel scene came, I saw so many colors and details flowing throughout the room that I was shaking in a giggling stupor for 5 minutes after it. After a few more anime videos that were neat, but not all that trippy, my girlfriend said she was tired and wanted to go to bed. I then looked at the clock, and saw that it was 2 am. Then I suddenly remembered something about comets. And then it hit me: we were missing the meteor shower!!
