I ask my friends to turn out the light, and they do so. I feel confortable sitting right next to the speaker, where the music can flow out and right into my body. I can feel the vibrations, and I can feel the music, which is both powerful and relaxing. I close my eyes for along enjoying the CEV's (closed eyes visuals). In my CEVs, castles are being built out of squares appearing one on top of the other, while kliedascope patterns are born beyond them.
