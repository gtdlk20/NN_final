If I ERASED THISS I WOULD NEVER KNOW WHAT I WROTE!!! But, would I even remember that I had wanted to rease it. This ability to type is cool cool its just so connected and tight just typing away while everything in the world fors on my[roars on by?]... I can keep my head on several different levels at the same time! Do I do this all the time? Do I always hear the music, look at the window, see the lgithing, focus on what I am doign, type and write? This is like a catharsis thing?!! Everything just pooring out.
