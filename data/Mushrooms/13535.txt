I crawl into the bed and the world shatters.  Complete fear now.  I can barely see, ghostly wisps pass before me and I can't tell the cabinet from the closet, things are floating around the room, I'm seeing double and triple vision, and rainbow lights shoot everywhere.  Momentary blackouts.  All I can hear is a 'ffffff' noise (similar to the noise you hear on DMT).  I can't deal, so I close my eyes, and my ego decides to leave.
