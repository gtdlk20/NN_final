Someone stated shrooms amplify background noise; in this trip I could hear a windstorm going on in my head, actually the 'wind' was really hundreds of whispering voices saying different things.  Sometimes one would be more distinct than the rest, I occasionally identified my own as a thought and other times it sounded like a god was speaking to me, some of these gave me some crazy messages most of which I of course don't remember.  I became very tired and my body was uncomfortable despite it being stretched out, I closed my eyes and let the brainstorm take me where it wanted.  Recently I had been drinking (just to get drunk of course) and this resulted in a couple bad experiences having too much to drink; that came back during the trip, I felt really drunk most of the time and at one point was actually convinced I was drunk, though I'm not really surprised at that.
