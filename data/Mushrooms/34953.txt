I pulled out my dried little cubies out of there plastic box, drank some orange juice, and ate the shrooms.  I had not eaten anything all morning except for a part of a banana which had been an hour or two ago.  I was pretty nervous for some reason, even though I knew the dose was too small to induce any seriously irresponsible behavior that my dad would notice.  I tried to feel good so I popped on the Safety Dance and ran around my room singing to it.  No, this is not something I normally do.  It's weird for me to even admit that.
