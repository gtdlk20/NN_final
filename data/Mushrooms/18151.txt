Matt, I called out, I cant climb anymore man.  This fucking rock is coming off on me! Matt tried to reassure me, to talk me through the climb, but the fact was I couldnt do it. I could vividly see my death, and Matts words of brain bashing kept ringing through my head.  I could imagine headlines and newspapers explaining how a bunch of crazy tweaked out kids thought how fun it would be to climb rocks and stupidly plummeted to their deaths.  I felt like a weak, lame loser with no heart to overcome my fears. This plus Matts positive verbal walkthrough of the climb helped me to muster the courage to, step-by-step, pull-by-pull make my way to the plateau. By then Seth had already reached the top.  We continued to climb again, this time Matt spotting me in case I had any trouble.  The last 10 feet of the climb were the worst for me.  I was covered in dirt and dust that had cascaded down the rock, temporarily blinding me.  A large piece of rock came off in my hand and Matt had to steady me or I would have fallen. Dirt and mud had assailed me, worms crawling around in the stuff hitting my face and getting in my mouth.
