The bed-dance: as the music played, the mindscape cavorted and coalesced and transformed before me, I realized that I could still feel parts of my body, and thought that was a sign I was not fully immersed. At first, I tried to strengthen the experience, by tuning out my body-sense. But I let my toes wiggle a bit, and marveled that this took me deeper, into an experience where feeling, mind, and movement, were experientially unified (analogous maybe to the idea of phenomenologically synonymous previously applied to beauty/gratitude). It gave me a glimmer of insight into the contemporary dancers world - the sensorial is bigger than I realized!
