The following events I am unsure if they really happened or if I was dreaming them. The trip had turned into a dark hell in which I could feel nothing but intense pain and I had literally felt I had gone crazy. I felt like there was no turning back and all I could think of was that I wish it would all end. Nothing was making sense, my soul was stuck in a fucked up universe and feelings of regret, sadness and fright was all I was. Something inside me looked over to the corner of the room and seen this these small red lights. What is that? I thought, what are these funny red lines. Somewhere in my mind it told me that they were numbers off a digital clock. 11:45pm, what the hell?! Where have I been for the last 2 and a half hours. My mind was lost, where have I been. I think the visions and feelings got too intense that I passed out at some point. I knew I was still tripping hard as I didnt recognize my surroundings and I couldnt figure out if I was standing or laying down.
