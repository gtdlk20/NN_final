I eventually had forgotten I had even eaten the mushrooms and thought that I just woke up that morning completely insane. Around this time 'ego death' set in and 'I' had no idea who or what 'I' was. All concepts of myself and the world I lived in were wiped clean. Time no longer seemed linear and was more cyclic in its nature, reminiscent of a single point (the eternal present). 'I' was the void and that was all there is, infinite voidness. This is only from what I can remember.
