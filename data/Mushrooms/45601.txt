What emerges for me at this point in my work with the spirit of the mushroom is awareness of a wind which moves through the inner body. The only literature that I have encountered that touches upon this phenomenon is the Dzogchen teachings on the windhorse,' or lungta - which is described as a subtle energy that moves through the central channel of the inner body. For me, this wind manifests as an opening of awareness into infinite space, a spaciousness which moves through the body as a wind and which is actually experienced as awareness itself; not the individual awareness of the experiencer, but the awareness that is a unified field which pervades the entire cosmos. The individual awareness merges into this greater awareness and flows, free of all objects, in and through all forms. When the mind is concentrated upon the flow of this wind, awareness is free of all objects. There is no longer a 'me' nor a we,' but a unified consciousness that is beyond the world of forms; in fact, it is from this spacious awareness itself that the realm of forms arises. When this awareness arises there is a passing of awareness beyond the realms of forms and formlessness. At this point, language fails - presence' is probably as good a word to speak about this as anything else. Here we move beyond signification to that certain something' itself. Nirvana actually translates directly as blown out, the extinguishing of the flame of individual awareness. The answer is blowing in the wind.'
