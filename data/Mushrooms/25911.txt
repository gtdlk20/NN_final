T+0:45 - After extinguishing the cigarette, I shut off the light and lay down on the bed.  The visions began almost instantly.  I prayed to the mushroom that the experience be as painless as possible.  I decided Bachs 5th Brandenburg Concerto might be an interesting way to ease into the trip.  It was, of course, awesome, but by the time it was over the first wave had passed.  Taking stock of the situation, I noticed that I was still there, and the visions were fading fast.  Odd.  I tried to figure it out.  The last time I did a heroic dose I couldnt even remember my name.  Perhaps these mushrooms were less than premium.  Could it be my vitamin regimen?  Losing patience and against my better judgment, I got up and wandered around the apartment.
