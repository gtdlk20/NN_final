I fucking love shrooms! I repeated, shouting throughout the house. I cracked the window, retrieved my bong and began to grind a modest amount of weed. We settled in for the peak of our trip. I still wasnt feeling much, but a couple hits from the bong resolved the issue completely. We spent the next few hours in our childlike regressions, watching animated video clips online, safely inside. Personally, I was too caught up in my mental state to even be concerned with what was on the screen. I just tried allowing myself to enjoy this powerful yet incredible experience with those closest to me.
