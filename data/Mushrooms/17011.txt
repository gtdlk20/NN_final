The friend that had come down with me brought cookies with him, which he shared with us and they tasted oh so good. I was still in the child like state of mind, so when I was eating the cookies, I was getting crumbs all over me and I didn't care. I had five cookies in both hands and chocolate residue all over my face. I would take a bite of my cookie, giggle at the tv and pay no attention to the mess I had made on my t-shirt. I didn't care, I was 6 again and I was enjoying the things the way I did when I was six -- carefree!
