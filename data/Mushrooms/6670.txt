During the movie I thought much about society, money, and the effects current society has had on our 'primate' psyche. I also thought alot about my future and education and such. At the time I drew some (afterwards seeming) silly conclusions. I was under the impression that anything is possible. That everybody can do anything. That everything can be explained to everybody. I kept thinking about how everyone could go to college and get a good education, and then I pondered why people didn't. Why isn't everyone on the street wearing a 1200 dollar italian suit? Why wouldn't people want to make alot of money? Why settle for anything less then the top? After all, everybody can do everything. Everybody can, nobody wants to was my conclusion. When the movie was over, I was feeling much better. I kept thinking throughout the entire movie, and thus not about the entities, or the dawning ego death. A little detail I recall, right after the movie was over, I got on IRC, and talked to some irc buddies of mine about the experience, everything in dutch mixed with english (even though my native language is dutch, I often find I can better express a feeling or thought in English), which many people find very annoying, but I remember commenting that it sounded like an alien trying to speak 'Earth-ish' :) .
