A normal weekend, other than the rare and sudden call from a friend who could obtain those mushrooms I was always looking for. I let most of my friends have first dibs on the stuff and then I just kept what was left over. My friends had described heavy trips off of very small doses of this certain strain. Most of the friends taking doses of around 2 grams or less.
