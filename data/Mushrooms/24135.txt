Me and TK would get up walk around, and then fall over, it felt like our muscles would just give up on us. It was fun, everything was incredibly entertaining, and we were completely care free. We made up our own games, such as switching a light switch on and off very fast, or turning the tap water on and off while trying to catch it in our hands. To me this care free playfullness was truly the mind of a child. We even giggled and laughed like children.
