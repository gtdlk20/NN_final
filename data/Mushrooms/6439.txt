Background Info: My cousin TRIP and I decided to trip on shrooms together for our 3rd time on a beautiful Friday night in December. We had gotten 7 grams of gorgeous blue and gold mushrooms during the previous week and we had been preparing all week for what would be our most amazing trip yet. My friend had died in a tragic car accident during our preparation week and I was scared of having a bad trip due to my constant bad moods. Believe it or not, this had very little or no effects on my trip.
