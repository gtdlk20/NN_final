Once back inside I was able to enjoy an evening of delightful colors and patterns here and there. Sleeping that night was a waste of time. I was sweating so badly I felt as if I was in a pool of water. Didnt toss and turn as I was comfortable but there was not much sleep to be had. The following morning, I felt amazing. Like my brain had been turbo charged. I will do a larger dose later as I am certain I could have handled more. But as of now, this seemed to have given me exactly what I needed. Also, I coined a new quote while laying in my sweat pool. The reason we see black when we close our eyes is because we arent looking with our mind.
