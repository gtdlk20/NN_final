We have just moved in our house and both had cut our losses on the previous attempts to get that most interesting fungus. It was Friday night. I had just gotten all my supplies for school and was wondering where in the hell the summer had gone. Keep in mind that at this point in my life I was very disappointed at myself for not obtaining any shrooms during the short summer. School was about to start and I knew nine months of book worming would soon be at my doorstep.
