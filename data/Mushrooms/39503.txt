A couple of guys that I rode with to the party found a girl that had a baggie of mushrooms to get rid of, so we all went in on it together.  RP advised me to be catious with dosage, and so I took about a gram dried.  the taste wasn't nearly as bad as I was made to believe it would be.  if you've ever eaten *extremely* stale french bread crust, that was about what the texture and taste was like.  after this RP and I went and sat down where the music was playing waiting for the effects to come on.  at T+15 a strange feeling of energy began brooding in my torso.  there were several 'trippy' symetrical tappestries hung up between the trees in this music/dancing area, and the colors were brighter.  There was a slight overall change in visual perception...reality seemed more vivid.  At T+40 or so I noticed that I had become very talkative, and had this overall positive feeling...contentment would be a good word.  I was also happy to be in the presence of other people, which is weird because I'm normally not a social person at all.  These were the extent of the effects for the first dose.
