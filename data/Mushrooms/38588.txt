I looked down at the grass. Each individual blade of grass was dancing around and was alive.  Who the fuck are you talking to? John asked sticking his head out the door. I thought his head was not attached to anything, that it was just floating in the air.  That old Irish lad, over there, I pointed to the tree, but now his face was gone.  Come on back inside, before you hurt yourself, John persuaded me.  Duddey was still sitting across the room, speechless. I could tell he was in his own dimension. His dreadlocks began to slither, like snakes. He looked like Medusa for a few moments. Then a feeling of pure terror took over me.  I zig zagged my way over to the center of the room. I laid down on the floor with me head pointed north, stretched my arms straight out to my sides, and spread my legs. I began to visualize myself as a five pointed star, as a shining pentagram. I felt it was the only way to banish the evil that I thought surrounded me. I could hear thousands of horrible devilish voices all talking at once. Some were telling me to commit unspeakable acts. Some were laughing, and others where chanting an unknown language. I thought I was dying. Considering that I had overdosed on shrooms, I probably was.
