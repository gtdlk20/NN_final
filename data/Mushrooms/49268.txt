When I closed my eyes, it was like I was on some sort of ride.  There were really colorfull dance floors totally abandoned, but with tiles of many different colors, and some I had never seen before!  I saw colors that are not possible to make in a normal state.  As I flew forward though dance floor after dance floor, I could see in the distance my friend Scott's face.  When I got closer to it, I could see his mouth was open.  My velocity seemed to increase and I opened my eyes right as I was about to be engulfed in his mouth.
