Looking at my two other fellow travellers I see that they were still drinking their tea. Suddenly I feel something I have never felt before, as this was my first time with mushrooms, I thought that this might be a natural effect... I turned to one of the more experienced travellers to tell him that I was feeling something... he responder that it was too early to feel anything, not giving much thought to his comment I turn my head back to face the open fire, but before I turn my head back, I have disappeared... My thoughts change dramatically, everything around me disappears, all I can feel is the warmth of the fire perfectly tuned to my body temperature as if not to disrupt me.... I gazed into the fire for a few minutes while enjoying the music (a soft dub with only drums)... While looking into the fire I suddenly realized that I was in the woods...
