Going into the trip, I set three intentions: healing, learning, and fun. The mushroom sure as hell showed me a good time! Not only did it help me heal parts of my subconscious that I had trouble accessing without it, but it also taught me a great deal about myself. I think the most important lesson I learned was that I am not my current ego, identity, or manifestation, and that there is no need to be afraid of danger or evil. You will always come out the other end, even if you end up dying in the process. Second of all, there is no need to get hung up on any state of being, no matter how good or bad it looks. Nothing lasts forever, and life is constantly in flux. Life is perpetually in balance. Theres no need to hold on to anything! Third of all, the mind creates at least half of the world we experience. We are truly masters of our own reality. Our thoughts, attitudes, and intentions affect everything, spoken aloud or not. Fourth of all, humans are fundamentally a natural expression of nature itself, and we are meant to be here. We all share a common spirit, even if our cultures vary greatly. Fifth of all, the living world around us is tuned in to our psychic energies on an incredibly deep level. If we can learn to be open to it rather than approach it with fear, we will find the answers to our ecological crisis. Sixth of all, I dont have to be as socially anxious as I have been in the past. Its ok to express myself and be open with others. More often than not, this openness is met with respect and reciprocal openness. Seventh and finally, there really is nothing more important than family and community. Were all in this together.
