At the first session (Hey You!), I felt that the mushrooms may not work for me and that I can control them and approached them in an arrogant way. And they showed me their power and their beauty  made me humble. Pretty fast. During the second session (Still here?!), I wished for some party-style visuals and possibly insights without really being prepared for a trip  and the mushroom told me exactly that, pointed to the life I shall take care of. And for the third session (Its alright!), I accidentally stumbled into a full-grown trip, without expectations and the mushrooms comforted and reassured me.
