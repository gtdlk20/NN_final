About ten minutes after that, I decided to turn on the TV. I don't know if you're the same kind of person as I am, but when I'm bored and nobody's talking to me but me, I really piss myself off. Like one side of me explains everything to the other side, like a dumb stepmom that tells you shit you either already know or don't want to know. Example: 'Wow! It's really, really rainy out! Come look at the rain! Come look! Look, hurry! Look at the rain!' You just want to bitchslap the person, because odds are, you know it's fuckin' raining and you couldn't give a shit less. But alas, I cannot bitchslap my mind, so I did the alternative.
