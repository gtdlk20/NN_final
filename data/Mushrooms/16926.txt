T+25...My awareness of things is getting hazy, and I begin to feel sick. I lay down on the grass with my face up. It is partially overcast, and there are many clouds out. One right above me begins to take the shape of a buffalo head. This effect made me feel like I had to puke. So I did. It felt surprisingly great. Not like puking off alcohol. This had a relieving feeling, and it calmed me down a little bit. I then turned and noticed P talking to our friend N. He must have just gotten there while I was puking. I walked over there, and remember having a conversation about the remaining gram me and P didn't eat out of our quarter bag. It seems weird to me now thinking about how we left just that little bit in the bag, but I am kind of glad in retrospect. N and our other friends were just about to eat their shrooms at Z's appartment, but they wanted a little more. P mostly does the talking.
