(T+3:00) I decide to turn on some music to sooth my soul.  I choose some classical to guide my journey.  I put in Moonlight Sonata and collapse, overwhelmed with myself.  I close my eyes to see what I hear.  The colors directly reflect the music.  The violets pulse with the heartbeat of the music.  The dark reds blast around the melody with deep blues extending beyond my reach.  All painted on a black background of an unknown void.  My thoughts calm as I become lost in this beauty.
