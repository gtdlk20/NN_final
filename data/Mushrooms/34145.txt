Then, after approximately 1 hour and ten minutes I felt it.  I was sitting in the stand looking and watching the kids and teens swimming and I noticed that this little boy's bathing suit started to become a more vibrant orange than what it was two seconds ago.  I smiled, the effects were starting.  Right after I noticed the bathing suit color, every thing took a brighter shade, and colors just looked all that more appealing.  Then I started getting a body high.  It was a tingly feeling that started in my toes and slowly after about a thirty minute duration reached the top of my head.  It felt pretty damn good.  My attention drifted away from the kids in the pool and towards the nearby forest.  The breeze was pretty strong and it was blowing the leaves and branches causing them to sway.  This was really cool because it looked like the trees were waving at me.  It was like the trees knew I was on shrooms.  This made me giggle my ass off, it was such a funny feeling I was tripping at work as a LIFEGUARD.
