We arrived home at 2:15 (T+2:40) and I started watching a little television. A song on television was playing and it sounded very three-dimensional, as if there were TV sets on in the other rooms with the same channel. I had to ask my girlfriend if the other TVs were on. They weren't. The disassociation had edged into a very slight dreamlike state which persisted for the next three hours.
