When we walked out of the room to calm down, things got strange.  The wallpaper started moving, and the corners where the walls met seemed to be stretching infinitely, and pulling me- I was falling into them!  These odd feeling continued for hours, until finally it was time for my friend to go home.  When I walked her to the elevator I had no idea which way to go...the hallway was like a maze to me- like unknown territory.
