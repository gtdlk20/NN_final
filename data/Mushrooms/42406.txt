Brad went inside to go to bed before his parents woke, and I was unfortunately left by myself.  By now it is about 4 am, and for fuck sake I was left by myself with the peak of the high only beginning to take hold.  I got in my car (I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THIS) and managed to drive to a 7 eleven where I thought what I wanted at the time was a bottle of water.  I purchased a bottle of Fiji water and I realized, sitting in my car, that I wasnÂ’t the least bit thirsty.  This is when the night started to turn very, very unpleasant.  A looping thought recurred in my mind over and over and over again.  I kept thinking that this certain drug was never supposed to touch a human brain, that once this shit makes physical contact with your mind you are permanently fucked and in a deep state of psychosis.
