I remember Dane cook telling a joke about seeing his dads penis, I thought to myself. I've never met my dad, I have no dad. My dad is dead (Died in 1990) and I was filled with overwhelming sorrow and sadness. Falling into a pit of despair. I then began to think about my brother who passed away in January 09 and how there were so many things I wanted to say to him that I never got the chance to say. It hit me so hard.
