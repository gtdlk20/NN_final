For the next hour, I sat and just watched everything I was being shown. The closed-eye visuals were amazing, whole structures and brilliant colors behind closed lids.  Even when I opened my eyes, I saw white-on-white images against my blank ceiling.  Specifically, I saw the chrysanthemum!  If you don't know what that is, Google it, seriously. In all my trips I'd never seen it before. It was on my ceiling, but it wasn't flat.  I got the impression that I was seeing just a piece of it, that the full size of this gateway would leave me catatonic.
