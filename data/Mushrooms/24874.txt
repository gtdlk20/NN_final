I'm not quite sure what type though. The growth seems to be a shroom which ends up about 10cm high with a small top (this is when it spores), and a fringe about 1-2cm below the cap. The stalk varies but is at least half a cm in diameter varying to 'Grand Dady' which was 1.25 or a bit less. Light brown cap, high humidity, some sun.
