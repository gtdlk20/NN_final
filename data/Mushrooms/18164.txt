The mush came on very slowly during Swordfish. I became very interested in the movie, and my television seemed very crisp and clear. It wasn't until I started to truly understand the movie that I realized I was tripping. What I mean by truly understand is that I suddenly became aware of -everything- in the movie. The character's clothes and the way their hair was done and the rooms they were in all started to make perfect sense to me. My brain was going like this: 'How did he get those henchmen?' - 'He put an ad in the newspaper for bouncers and found some ones that would work for him!'. 'Where did he get all this cool theatre stuff?' - 'He hired a audio/visual company and they made it all for him'. These thoughts seem very silly now, but at the time they were amazing.
