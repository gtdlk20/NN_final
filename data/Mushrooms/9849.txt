We had much more good conversation and many more mini adventures, peering into rock pools, letting shrimp nibble at our feet etc. and then we started to come down nice and gentle, we wandered again and found a grove flowers on a another headland. It was a ground cover flower with lush green foliage, a carpet of green leaves spotted with pretty flowers we lay down in them and cuddled. We were protected from the wind and we were in our right minds again. People walked along the little path through this little forest and they saw us in our lazy embrace and called out warm greetings we felt warm towards them and sociable.
