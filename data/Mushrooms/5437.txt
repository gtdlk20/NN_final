I would consider this a level one with borderline level two experiences. I started my day depressed from a cannabis hangover. The day prior I had smoked, I was feeling depressed, and not in the mood to do any work on my birthday. So I opened up my stash, and decided that a cap and a stem would suit me just fine. I dosed at about noon, which I later found to be a good and a bad thing. The mushrooms tasted terrible as is to be expected, and they were fortunately bearable with a few pieces of chocolate. Water afterwards helped to wash it all down.
