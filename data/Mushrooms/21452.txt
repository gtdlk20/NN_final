Eventually, I tune out my friends and the movie and begin to recall the movie from the night before.  I start pondering whether or not I'm in a perpetual dream.  I'm debating in my head whether I'm dead or alive.  After many thoughts I begin to rule that I'm caught in a dream and nothing is real.  I'm beginning to freak out. I'm disconnected from reality and all that surrounds me.  Meanwhile my friends are talking about god knows what and all I can think about is that I'm sitting here caought in this never-ending dream from which I will never wake up from.  I begin to give thoughts of love to my parents and loved ones.  Eventually I begin to regain control of my thoughts and become aware that in fact I'm alive and in control.  It took my the longest time to convince myself that I was just on mushrooms and eventually these thoughts will dissapate.  Soon I came back to the real and was happy to find everything in tact. The time is between 1-2 that I finally drift away from the trip and return to baseline.
