I tried to understand in a rather drugged state why these things I had been SO convinced of weren't real.  I started to truly understand what it could be like for someone trapped by a mind that doesn't work right.  It made me realize that I couldn't count on any of the experience I had had.  It put the entire experience to shame in the scientific test area, so I had to wrestle with how to best make my mind cope with it.
