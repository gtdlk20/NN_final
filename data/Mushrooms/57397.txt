I did mushrooms for my first time on friday. We found the best way to eat them!!! We melted a couple chocolate bars in a pot on the stove and bud busted an ounce of mushrooms and added them in, then we poured them into icecube tray and freeze them for a bit, then chow down, I didn't even taste them at all. Anyways, I ate 2 chocolate cubes which had 2.2 grams in each. After about 20 mintues I started to feel warm and buzzed like I was drinking.
