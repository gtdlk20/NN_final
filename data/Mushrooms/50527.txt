While I lay in my bed, my leg turned into a pile of rocks for a period of time, and I had a mental conversation with what I thought to be God when I looked up at the light in my room.  I outstretched my hand towards the light and found that it was severed or possibly decayed from before, and from my mouth came the words: 'I feel like the only person who understands me is god and all he does is laugh at me.'
