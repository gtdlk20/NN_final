Not long after I began to come down we started smoking marijuana. This altered my state of consciousness again, although I didnÂ’t get high. It seemed to wake me up a bit, confuse me even more, and made all my senses more sharp and crystallised. I also experienced quite a bit of paranoia and general anxiety, and although I experienced this quite a lot while tripping the marijuana definitely made it more intense. I think now, looking back, that smoking made me less relaxed and less happy, but it is hard not to smoke marijuana when you do it so often!
