At 2:15pm, I ingested 2 grams of very strong magic mushrooms. I was sitting on a hot, crowded beach in Atlantic City, NJ. I went into the ocean to cool off a couple of times and then went up to the boardwalk to buy cheese fries. While I was eating, I started to feel very relaxed. I couldn't finish the fries.
