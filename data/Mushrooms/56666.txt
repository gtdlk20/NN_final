We were walking down the street when I start tripping hard(but still good) I was feeling great.  I kept putting my food in my mouth and spitting it out cause I couldnt swallow. SO I dropped the food and went to a wall to take a pee.  I turned from the wall and found sean and his dogg eating the mc donalds off the middle of the street.  My legs felt really warm so I asked sean repetedly if I had peed on myslef.  I was really confused.  This is when my trip turned bad because sean breaks out in a sprint down the street screaming at me to get away from the 'people' chasing us. I was still feeling my pants trying to understand whether I peed on myself or not. I finally got what he said and looked back.  I just saw 1 huge shaddow coming towards me so I figured it was a lot of people packed really close together.  I was terrified!  I started running with me. He then told me that he was sure he was dieing and he didnt know what to do.  That made me start thinking about dieing, and I thought I was dieing too.  We split up and went home.
