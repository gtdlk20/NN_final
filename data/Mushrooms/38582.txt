I explained. I felt like I was a part of the wall, as if my face was painted on the wall, and we were one.  Its just the shrooms, E, its just the shrooms, calm down Ethan, Fat Chat tried to comfort me. I stared at him.  Fat Chad sat their slowly, but deeply and heavily breathing. His stomach jiggled like pudding when he moved. He had a small mohawk hair cut, just a short patch of hair on top of his bald head. I looked away and looked at him again. His mohawk looked like a strip of iron. He sat there with an evil grin, in full steel armor. Metal spikes protruded through his armor. A fierce battle ax set against his leg. He sat on a gold thrown that sparkled in elegance. He was a goblin warrior king of Agartha I thought to myself.  You look terminator dude, I think I better step outside and have a smoke, I announced to the group.  I slid the door opened and stepped out on the balcony. It slammed shut behind me.
