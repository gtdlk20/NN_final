We went across the road to a vacant lot that sat quite happily amongst the other houses to wait for the acsent into the unknown. It was a beautiful day, I needed no drugs to appreciate that, the sun was shining and the birds singing and soft white clouds moved with a reassuring grace across the blue sky. But little did I know, it was about to get alot prettier. 45 minutes in, lying in the grass speculating on the metaphysics of a rubiks cube that ramon thought we might need, I noticed the grass was growing, and the fences moving, I stood up and noticed that I was certainly getting some kind of high, ramon assured me that he was too.
