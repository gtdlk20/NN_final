After about 3-4 hours I start feeling agitated, restless, and slightly upset/depressed. I go to change the music and put on a Doors live album, Disc 1. I continue to grow gradually more unsettled and start seeing depressing imagery in all of the programs on tv. I try to call several people during the trip but nobody is home. The one person I managed to reach was going out at the moment so it was a quick call. I seem to have a strong need for other humanly contact, especially during trips. Which is quite odd as I'm usually very reclusive and isolate myself from other humans the majority of the time. I'm very uncomfortable in social situations and feel that I'm too dissimiliar from others to relate in a proper manner. No other substances were ingested during this time. I would like to try mushrooms again as I feel they could have more to offer and just that the set and setting were probably off, and perhaps it was just the wrong time.
