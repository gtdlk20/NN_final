So sufficiently moisturized and coming up on the mushrooms pretty quick. I felt the effects coming on within about 15-20 minutes. Time felt a little warped already super lazy and heavy suddenly. Felt like a decent effort to just lift my hands. I couldnÂ’t really decide what to do just yet. I just kind of laid on my bed feeling a pretty heavy body high slight bits of anxiety just a standard come up on mushrooms. It kinda reminds me of DMT before I exhale. Heavy. shadowy, depth perception becomes amplified and moving feels like a task. Regardless of body high no very noticeable open eye hallucinations happening. I felt a little disappointed but reminded myself it was just beginning. The first heavy mushroom wave ended and I felt suddenly lighter so I got up off my bed and grabbed a coconut water and put my headphones on. I made a playlist the night before which was a solid life choice.
