The therapeutic plan was to take the medicine in the morning. I was sure to get a good night's sleep the night before. I also cut down significantly on my caffeine intake in the week prior. I had a banana and a glass of water for breakfast. I had heard that lemon juice helps accentuate things, so I cut up a fresh lemon and squeezed some in another cup of water. I didn't watch TV, or listen to the radio or any music that morning.
