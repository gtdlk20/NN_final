I looked up to the trees to escape the lunacy of the other two (I felt sane while they weren't, even though I was actually worse) and I saw a very sexy, feminine tree and my mind took note of it as it stretched high above me, higher and higher.  Then I looked to her right and there was a small and dumpy pine tree that was very angry at my attempts to hit on his wife.  I didn't want a barroom brawl, so I walked away and told him that he had had one too many.  Then as I returned to the car a cop pulled up along side the passenger side where I was standing.  He immediately rushed us and accused us of being drunk.  There was stuff thrown all over around the car and Tiff had been nibbling on the tortillas and making a paste out of it and putting it on the seat.  When he accused us I retorted loudly that we hadn't been drinking, as we hadn't.  He asked us then why he smelled it so strongly.  As he looked in the rear windows with his flashlight I made a small attempt to bite his neck but the noise of it caught his attention too quickly and his gaze returned, calming me down.  He told us that park hours were over and that we should leave.
