Me and my Seattle, have been growing mushrooms for quite a while now, and we are on our third batch, we have a whole selection of different types. Well we have gained a considerable amount on knowledge about psilocybin and its mother the mushroom. What we wanted is the absolute STRONGEST ( azurescens) mushroom available, and then we would mix it with the HIGHEST YEILDING (we chose the B+ strain) to make a good batch for people to buy. Well we grew them, and treated them like our children, till one day we had what looked like a sea of sacred mana. We had learned that the aborts (ones that didn't fully grow) were the strongest. So we decided to take ALL of the azurescen aborts to our domes.
