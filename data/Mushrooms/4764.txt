We walked to the top of a hill overlooking this valley; we sat down and ate the mushrooms.  To me they did not taste that bad at all, just seemed like a lot to get down.  But everyone else seemed to dislike the taste very strongly.  We all washed it down with some juice then continued our walk down into the valley.  Beck ran off into the woods as I assumed he might due to him repeating that next time he did mushrooms he wanted to be alone.  The rest of us set down the big white sheet under a shady tree and lay down to let the effects kick in.  We all were excited, maybe a little bit nervous/anxious, but all in good moods.  At first the familiar feeling of heaviness and fuzzy buzzing kicked in all over my body, as I looked into the tree above me the limbs seemed to pull away from me and each other.  At this point time started to lose relevance and I can't be sure of any of the time passing I mention here.
