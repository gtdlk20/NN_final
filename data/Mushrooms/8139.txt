Looking back on this, I was definitely not sobering up. I don't know how I convinced myself that I was, but there was no way that I was. I find I usually peak around the 2 hour mark, and I was only 75 minutes in. I didn't want to waste any time though, and figured the sooner I redose, the better. I went into my tent and weighed out another 3g of shrooms, and ate them.
