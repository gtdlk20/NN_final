Then I realized so many things.  I didn't like where I was at in my life and knew I had to move back home.  I'm still smoking weed, but no longer shrooms.  I now believe that shrooms sort of show truth in everything.  It took shrooms to make me realize I didn't need them anymore.  They were definitely more therapeutic then recreational this time.  I now am looking forward to things, which I haven't done in a long time.  Doing mushrooms alone, which can be more unpleasant, can also be more rewarding and often a slap in the face with reality through the unreal.
