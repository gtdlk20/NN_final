Everyone, now wallowing in their own deep state of frying were milling about, inside and out all doing different things, but there were always at least 3-4 people out back smoking. I guess someone had ventured inside and busted out a black light on a pool table. It was incredible, colors were so vibrant and distorted none of the pool balls could remotley have been the colors they truly were. The red solid ball was neon orange. Then, one of the fellows begins to dance with the black light. It trailed, oh boy did it trail. It was beautiful to watch the dark purple light interact with the environment around. Throughout it all the theme was almost always of happiness, laughter and uncontrolled giggling were the name of the game. The whole thing was very much like an incredibly vibrant dream, but one that I could remember.
