I am not a frequent drug user. The first time I had ever decided to take mushrooms was not long after I had tried pot for the first time, and I even freaked out pretty bad from that. To believe I was ready for a hallucinogen was probably delusional of me. But nonetheless, I couldnÂ’t help myself. I felt as though mushrooms would help me to have a really spiritual experience and would provide some insight into the ways of the Universe and God. I believed I was too smart to be a recreational drug user. I used drugs for a deep, spiritual purpose.
