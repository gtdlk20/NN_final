In time, the poison passed and my trip became more pleasurable.  I crawled out of the tent once the sun had gone down, about the same time that Steve returned to camp.  Luke and Danny were already at the point where we they could see fireworks (about a quarter mile from camp).  Steve was setting into a very powerful psychosis at that time and refused to journey with me to go see fireworks.  'How many Fourth of July's do I have to go through!?' he was shouting.  I stayed with him and we completely missed the fireworks.
