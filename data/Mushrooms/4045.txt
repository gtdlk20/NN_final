The love I felt from my mother and friends was quite real. The love from my father was distant and reserved. He spoke little if at all. My mother on the other hand was in tears of love, joy, sadness, compassion and understanding. I could feel all of this, as if I was her feeling for me on the bed. It was the most powerful love or emotion I had ever experienced in my life. I realized my eyes were streaming tears the whole time. Suddenly I was her and she was me, I was all of them. Waves of love and compassion rocked my body. My pillow was soaked with tears dripping from my eyes and ears.
