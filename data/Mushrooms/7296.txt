Since R loves mushrooms his room is all decked out.  It's a tripper's paradise! R shows me his setup for his legal Shitake mushrooms.  He grows them so he can hide the illegal ones from his parents and have all the growing equipment around.  R is going to college in about a week so he has stopped growing the psychedelic kind.  R tells me that he has grown Australian mushrooms, P. Cubensis, and Pan Cyans.  He tells me that he tripped the hardest he ever has in his life off of 1g of Pan Cyans.  R shows me all of the artwork that he has done.  One drawing is a crossword of C's name.  Another is made up of inkblots.  The most incredible piece of work is a spiral made up of pen dots.  It took R 21 hours to finish.  R's room has tons of blacklights, blacklight posters, and objects that glow in the dark.  R and I talk about how it's unfair that people in society such as writers, poets, artists, and musicians get paid squat while entertainers such as sports stars are millionaires.  R turns off the florescent lights and puts on the blacklights and lights some incense.  We talk and I play with the glowstick while R plays with the blue light on my key chain.  We talk about school, Beethoven, and how Magic Eye is made for trippers. I have my watch on and try not to look at it.  But when R and I are talking it seems as though at least 30 minutes have passed when in reality only two have.  I have to make a conscious effort to move.  R has a curtain up in his window.  He wants it taken down.  Not wanting to inconvenience him I tell him I will get up to take it out.  It takes me about an hour to will myself to get up and take it down.
