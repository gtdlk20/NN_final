After a fruitless effort to get a cigarette, we decided to go to sleep. We were almost completely down by that time. I was confused the next day, being normal. While we were tripping, time had lost it's meaning. I stared at a clock while tripping, and it just looked like numbers in a box, and it was strange to think that time is just a creation of man, that this thing which governs our existance is just numbers in a box, and nothing else. Although my thinking is back to normal, I have to wonder if I do mushrooms enough, will time be nothing?
