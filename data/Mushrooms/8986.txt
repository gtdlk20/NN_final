As I previously stated, the fine details have left me, so obviously there was a lot of stuff going on during the onset of the trip. The Shaman played deep, not really dark but ominous music to guide us. My body started feeling incredibly heavy, with waves of warmth and tingly running from head to toe. My thoughts were going a million miles an hour with no real direction or meaning to it. I had to open my eyes a couple times to make sure I was still in the room, the ceiling was visibly breathing and dancing. I remember looking slightly to the left to a window on the roof multiple times throughout the trip and had some sort of emotional bond with it, and determined it was my brother, and I couldnÂ’t stop cracking up and calling him an asshole.
