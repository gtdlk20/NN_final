Then one of the most striking moments of the trip. My friend was sitting on the bed next to me, humming loudly to calm me down and I wanted him to stop. Now knowing the physical world was also myself, I stopped fighting him for a moment and relaxed. It's hard to explain, but it was like I fell in sync with reality. For a moment everything was like mirrors, perfectly reflecting each other, and I was it and the awareness watching it change. We smiled at each other and my friend stopped humming.
