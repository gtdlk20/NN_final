Now, 10 yrs later, I still have an appreciation for the psychedelic experience, just a different form of appreciation.  A spiritual appreciation, not a Recreational Lust.  I now only use these chemicals for Spiritual and Divine Purpose.  To date I have yet been able to journey into a similar experience, but when I do I will be ready.
