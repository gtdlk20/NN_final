In terms of effects - there were none! I distinctly remeber smoking the last few tokes and discussing with my partner that it had been a waste of time and what was the point of selling mushroom joints if the had no effect. We concluded that, given the place (Amsterdam) and the avaialbilty of mushrooms joints that they nothing more than a gimmick, perhaps a flirtation with the liberal (drug) laws of Holland. We also questioned the contents of the joint, as, well - it could have contained anything. We were, after all, tourists for the day and the Dam is a place where anything goes. Would I try this again? Not. Mushrooms are food and therefore to be eaten. I don't smoke potatoes to get anything nutritious from them so why smoke mushrooms? Next time, they are going down my neck in solid form...much more predictable effects!
