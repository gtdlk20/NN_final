Josh came from a conservative Muslim family and was simply horrified at the thought that he might be found out by the trip to the ER. Michael, rather than approaching him calmly instead induced a death trip, in which he convinced Josh that he was dying and that he shouldnt put this type of guilt on his friends. Josh looked to me for help convincing Michael that he was indeed ok and that everything was normal. He asked me How do I look? Im ok right? I responded, Im really not in any state to be telling you what normal is. At the time I looked at him and he had turned purple and had started to inflate as though he were being puffed up as like a balloon. Then when I denied his request he suddenly looked as though someone had pricked him and let all the air out. His skin turned a dirty olive green and looked like a flaccid piece of rubberwhich then began to drip and run over the couch like melting wax. Much fighting ensued and eventually Josh was carried out kicking and screaming by two other men. *Note* It turned out that he was perfectly fine after being examined at the hospital.
