Moving downstairs we decide which movie to watch, A has come equipped with two; Bumfights and Super Troopers, we decide on Bumfights, Mistake the Second.  I hated this movie for the entire hour it lasted; it was pretty trippy to watch but it was fucking with me in a way that was just bad, something about crowds of people beating the shit out of each other mixed with freestyle rapping about crack plus bums too drunk to walk on top of whatever the hell else was in there that I don't want to remember is a horrible thing to watch on shrooms.  Later we all said we hated it, but we were all way too blasted to say anything about it anyway; this hour is a complete blur to me from the point of sitting down on the couch.  At this point I crossed over into whatever that other reality is, everything I can remember is in a spinning storm of greenish blue, I know I was walking backwards through time in a dreamlike trance and watching my life in third person.
