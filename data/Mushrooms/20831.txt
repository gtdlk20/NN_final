I felt a strong connection of this whole realisation happening to be connected to my early childhood and even my embryonic state.  Maybe because I had just lost complete control of all bodily function and only a glimmer of consciousness was still there  just like at the beginning of my life  but maybe also because I felt as a child that I really was not in control, was freaked out about the whole affair of living on this planet and the bizarreness of life in this human form.
