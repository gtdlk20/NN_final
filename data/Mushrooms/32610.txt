I had waited for a pristine time to do them, and what better time in my opinion than the night of New Years Eve.  I am writing this as I wait for the shrooms to start kicking in.  I had just the night before taken 50mg of Seroquel for my insomnia, but had refrained today because I've heard Seroquel can affectively stop a psychedelic trip from occurring.  Quetiapine (Seroquel) and Psilocin/Psilocybin are medicines/drugs that both target the receptors of Serotonin and Dopamine. Specifically for Seroquel, the D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are antagonized, the alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor, and 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 serotonin receptors.  Psilocin targets the Serotonin receptors and acts as a potential agonist instead.  By some peopleÂ’s notes, the effects seem to cross each other out.
