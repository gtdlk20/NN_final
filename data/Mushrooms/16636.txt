This whole time my 'friend' was basically laughing at me and looking at me like I was crazy. He said the whole time I was experiencing my ego death I was 'curled up on my bed mumbling incoherent nonsense' (word salad). Needless to say Im not friends with him anymore. After around 4 hours (which felt like an eternity) I began coming down. That feeling of realizing that I was coming down can only (for me) be compared to what its like to be released from jail. Relief and ecstactic joy. The rest of the trip was unremarkable. 7-8 hours in I was baseline, but still very shooken up.
