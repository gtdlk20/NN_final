Despite experiencing the most distressing and mentally scary period of my life, I am now pleased that I had the whole experience. At the time I wouldnÂ’t have hesitated for one moment if I could have ended my trip, and I will almost certainly never double dose again, but I am glad that I have experienced some extreme states of consciousness on my first two trips. I think that if you are not a very happy person you will always have a mixed trip, because your emotions are so fragile, changeable and intense on psilocybin/psilocin containing substances. I think the key for people who are not confident, happy and stable is to find the trip level where they can deal with the bad experiences without too much trouble, and where the good experiences are worth enduring the bad ones. I went too far this time, but I will try again, third time lucky I hope!
