The only remarkable event occurred when I stepped out of the bright sunshine into a dark bar bathroom.  As I walked in, I couldnt see or make out colors or shapes; everything was a black and brown haze.  After 10 or 20 seconds, shapes started forming, and I found my way into a stall to take a whiz.  I noticed that the stall walls were bending and rolling like sheet metal.  I found that to be pretty amusing.  I then noticed that the wood grain was moving, and upon closer inspection, the lines were stretching and shrinking, and try as I might, I couldnt make them stand still.  Once I walked back outside, the effect was completely gone.
