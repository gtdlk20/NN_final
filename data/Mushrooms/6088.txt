And I have to tell you: sitting was never that exhilirating. I described it to her (in earthly terms) as the kind of a feeling that you get when you're sitting behind a red light in a BMW and as the light turns green you accelerate. The BMW goes smoothly but fast into acceleration and your body, for a second, gets pushed gently into the seat. And it was exactly like that. She laughed at this and I said 'This is the easiest way of explaining it: it's hard to describe if you never have been accelerated. You are like an eskimo in a sense that if I would try to describe this to an eskimo you would both look at me like a crazy man. You and the eskimo have never been accelerating so I can't explain it better.'
