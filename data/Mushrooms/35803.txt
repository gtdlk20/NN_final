After belaboring the details of the night for so long, I won't get into Y's silent freak out, although I should as a warning to the uniniated.  I was in my sister's room, a very familiar place to me.  Y was not familiar with the setting and that may have made her uncomfortable, contributing to her bad trip.  Y was mostly familiar with alcohol and to a lesser extent marjiuana.  Psilocybin has nothing in common with either of these drugs.  They are as different as apples and asteroids.  Z and my sister both percieved (far better than I) Y's nervousness and her oncoming panic, and suggested we go to bed.  Which bummed me out a little at the time because I was still tripping pretty hard.  I thought they had stopped tripping, I had no idea at the time that it was because of Y.
