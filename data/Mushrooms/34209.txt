My auditory hallucinations were fun but distracting. I couldn't differentiate the voice of my friend 'C' and the ones on T.V. It all came together to make gibberish at times, then poems at times, then alliterations. Every Single Sentence Someone Said was an alliteration, then at some moments it was stuttering and repeating fragments of words 3 times before the word is over. This was probably the most intense thing of the night. The sounds of his words didn't match up at all with the shape that his mouth was making. We decided to go outside and smoke a cigarette. It was a beautiful moment.
