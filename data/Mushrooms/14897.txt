Then came the next headache...  0.1g didn't do it this time...  a second dose, for a total of 0.2g did.  Next day, next headache, a baaaad one this time, got bolder and took 0.3g.  Blessed relief again, noticed some giddiness this time. ;-)  Curiously for the 60-odd minutes when I normally would have been screaming, I could feel the headache-location kind of quivering, like some creature was trying to wiggle its way out.  That eye remained puffy and half-closed.  But no pain. I could feel the headache-location kind of quivering, like some creature was trying to wiggle its way out.
