This is me obviously lying in my bed in the dark having a mushroom trip. The me I experience every day in the real world. I was able to observe and listen to the responses of the Inner Me and bring back knowledge and some dialogue in this primary perspective. It should be noted that the only hallucination or visual that I had aside from the scenarios was Mother talking to me as a glowing ball of light next to my head.
