I'm 17, live in Canada, and I've only smoked pot (for a while though).  A friend of mine notified us that his parents were going away for the weekend, so we bought some mushrooms and decided to try them at his house.  I myself was excited to try them, but was worried about a bad trip so I only bought 2gs.  I was told they were very strong and that I only needed a small amount if I was unsure.  My friend who was getting the mushrooms had had them a few times before and bought 4gs.  My second friend had never tried it before, but also decided on 4gs.
