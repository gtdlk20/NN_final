Soon enough, they came back inside satisfied with their journey and we all had a few laughs.  My vision was distorted, the most distorted it has been compared to all of my trips.  There were colorful waves moving through the walls and pretty much everything I saw.  The floor was moving in parallel layers, each layer moving differently.  I was cold for the rest of the night and time moved very slowly.  I had very poor depth perception, balance, and coordination.  These things didnt bother me too much though, because I spent the majority of the night sitting down.  I had a period of about 5 minutes, which felt like 2 hours, where I was realizing and analyzing everything I was experiencing, as well as comparing them to my other trips.  I felt disconnected from reality, lost in my own mind.
