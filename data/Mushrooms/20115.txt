Eventually I found myself outside back with the animals.  I was staring at a group of falcons who were sitting outside weathering.  (The falcons were crippled and un-releasable, as were most of the animals kept at the museum.)  I was coming down, but I felt like I had had enough, and I was agitated, and I wanted it to be over.  I just stared and stared at the birds.  A volunteer woman came out and started talking to me, which really helped to calm me down.  She brought a peregrine falcon 12 inches from my face and I stared into its eyes for the longest time while I talked to her.  It was amazing.  After about an hour of talking to her, I felt like the mushrooms had passed.  If you have ever seen Beavis & Butt-head Do America, it felt like when Beavis is coming off of his peyote trip, and the world just ceases its agitation and settles back to its proper orientation, but little ripples of trip rush past from time to time.
