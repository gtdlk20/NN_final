When I got home, I bolted past my dad into my room.  I kept getting these phone calls from my friends, but I didn't know who they were, they didn't know what I had done.  They were scared more then me at the time.  I have a rainbow light in my room, so I turned it on and watched the room swirl together in an array of colour.  I have clown posters, ICP, and the started laughing at me.  I couldn't smoke a cigarette cuz it kept melting.  After 1.5 hours later, 3 guys stopped by to hang out.  They were idiots, but I had no one else.  They kept making me change the music, but I was disoriented, I didnt know my name.
