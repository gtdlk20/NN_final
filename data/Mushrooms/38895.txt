Scott turned off the VCR and we watched Sportscenter on ESPN, and the announcers faces and words started getting slow and weird. Their faces were scary. Their faces looked like they were boiling and their words freaked me out.  I looked over at Scott and he was smiling, reading a book of some kind. His walls and bed were shifting positions, and the room was in some weird purplish 'haze', but he had a blacklight on. I looked over to my right front view, and there sat Jerry Garcia, and I realized then that I was indeed tripping my balls off, so to speak. Jerry was smiling, giving me a kind of reassuring 'Just Be Cool' look. Now, what's really weird is that at the time, I was only very mildly into the Grateful Dead or their music. I bareley knew who Jerry was. But, there he was, appearing right in front of me. It's almost as if I was communicating with his ghost. And as quickly as he was there, a few minutes later, he was gone.
