This experience completely changed my life for the better.  It was like I had died and was reborn.  It was as if I'd been somehow sleepwalking and I was finally awake to the beauty of life, of everything.  I had tripped on numerous occasions before, but this was the first time I remembered how it felt to be tripping after coming down completely.  I was bubbly and happy for the next two months or so, when I met someone who would crush my happy spirit.  But that's another story.
