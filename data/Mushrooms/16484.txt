At this point I am literally seeing things run across my room, I'm starting  to feel delusional. I close my eyes and my world is go, I take myself to  wherever I wish, this part of the trip gets a little hazy, but I remember  forgetting who I was and believing I was stuck inside this trip I remember  forgetting who I was and believing I was stuck inside this trip. I feel like I'm bleeding from my finger, as I didn't realize I had a finger  in my mouth and I was biting very hard. When I looked at my hand I  couldn't even see if there was anything on it, I now start thinking to myself about how I can project myself to other places, the first example I used was going back millions of years when the dinosaurs were not extinct.
