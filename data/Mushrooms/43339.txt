The skylines I remember seeing of the festival were these two large buildings, one with a construction crane on it. The buildings, along with the sky, seemed grainy and two dimensional. Its as if the sky was merely a giant mural someone had painted. By now it had gotten dark. I stared at the stars and few clouds but dont remember much. A few of my friends were trying to talk to me, but I felt scared each time they did, I wanted to be left alone.
