Then I started to feel quite sick, like I was going to purge soon. Then I looked in the corner of my room on the ceiling and noticed this red colour which was confused for the colour of blood which upon investigation turned out to be the paint thinning and the red wood underneath shining through, it was enough to bring back the story my mum had told me earlier about a girl dying of a tumour in our house, and I started experiencing very negative vibes from the room. As I realised Id lived in this room for the last 3 years at school, which is when coincidentally my grades started to drop (though, its a lot of effort changing rooms). My sister lived there 7 years before me and had ended up with chronic fatigue hmmm, whatever.
