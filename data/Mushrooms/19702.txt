Thank god we were in nature and we knew that there would be a meadow across the street. We made our way over there, but got distracted when we decided to lay down in the grass road divider.  We called some car over to us and asked them how to get 'downtown,' but I had a very hard time talking to them and understanding.  This was about 45 minutes to an hour after we ate the mushrooms.  We went through the barbed wire fence and walked around in some brushy forest-like area.  Everything was so weird, and we felt fearless. We met a couple of trees, one named Henry who had a very distinct personality to us and we took a picture with him.
