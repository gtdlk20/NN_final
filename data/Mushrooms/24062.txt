When the evening drew to a close, I caught a bus home. For the whole ride and for a few hours after trying to go to bed, all I could think of was how much I loved people and wanted to help them. The best part of the whole thing was the couple of hours after the trip, where everything is still noticeably different. I've done shrooms many times since, but nothing can compare to the time I first went out and got nice and tweaked with my friends.
