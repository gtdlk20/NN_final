Visuals were still very intense. I saw many geometric patterns and a glowing ball of crackling light strands, slightly donut shaped, that was evolving into and out of itself. I thought it was a persons energy, or gods energy, or both. Sometimes now I see this shape represented in art and it makes me wonder.
