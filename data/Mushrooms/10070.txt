After about ten minutes we were at the high way on our way to a nice route through the mountains that we know. We were all smoking ciggs with the exception of Z, who never does and was not about to start. Well on the ride we saw motorcycles, people tenting and almost simultaneously we all had the realization that we ARE AMERICANS. It was as though we had never truly realized what it meant to be American. We are all just immigrants. We were in our mustang, cigarettes lit, listening to Jimi. We drove full speed down one road, but luckily G spotted a cop and slowed down right in time. It was comforting knowing he had things under control, and I was able to relax and just enjoy tripping and seeing the scenery. Then we started listening to rap, which sounded amazing and I really listened to every word with anticipation of the next thing coming.
