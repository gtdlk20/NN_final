15 - 30 min: I start feeling a bit weird quite fast. Must've been the empty stomach and careful chewing. I ask A how he feels and he says 'Ok, nothing yet'. We both lay down on the ground and I can see some thin patterns float on the sky. Colors are slightly more intense now. When lights (car lights and lamps) pass my visual field they linger for a few seconds before fading away.
