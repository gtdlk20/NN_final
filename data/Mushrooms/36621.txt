The CD starts and the whole thing is wonderful. Beautiful music and the shrooms havn't even kicked in yet. I could feel the uprising. Frightening. I curled up in the corner of the couch in our apartment. The only light on was a red light in a lamp near the stero, which was blasting full force. Me and Guido sat uncomfortablly on the couch while his brother sat motionless in a chair watching the stero. Slowly I started to feel... diffrent than his brother. Like me and him were in two seprate worlds. His world was very cold and gray, while mine seemed to be where all the music and light was. My BF sensed this world parallel too and whenever we tried to talk to Joe he'd get very frustrated that we couldn't comprehend what he was saying and would hand us an object (like a can or box) and say 'go play with this'. Of course we did not want to touch anything at all, touch was to uncomftable as was looking at Joe. Everytime I looked at Joe he would shrink very small and I would grow very tall, so I tried not to look at him at all. This was only the begining.
