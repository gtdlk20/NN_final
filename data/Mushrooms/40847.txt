This summer I had the opportunity to pick up a large quantity of mushrooms for the first time in a while. I jumped on the chance buying a pound, thinking this would supply me for a long time. Having recently had a string of positively memorable trips I was excited to continue on with the trend. My boyfriend and I had been thrilled for a while about Alice in Wonderland in 3-D coming out and felt this would be a perfect outing for us to trip at.
