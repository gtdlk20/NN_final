I flushed the handle. The evil swirled down the drain back to the earth from which it came. The horrific voices ceased. I was cleansed. The water filling the toilet was a florescent pink, and it turned to neon blue as it began to overflow.  Hey John, your toilet is overflowing, I shouted.  He entered to check on me and see for himself.  What are you talking about dude, no its not, he explained to me.  I was still out of touch with reality, but I was safe now. I expelled the demons. The dangerous amount of organic poison in my system was rejected and ejected. I decided I needed to take a shower and clean off. It was the most interesting drizzle I ever took.  I remember reaching down and turning the knob and was hit with what felt like a sub zero arctic blast. I slid back, but as I slid back, the wall in front of me that the shower nozzle was attached to appeared to expand for miles. The shower nozzle looked like a torch, emitting a silver flame. I was convinced that the water was actually fire, but it was cold. I felt as if I was being baptized. All of the sudden the wall started to move towards me, and the ceiling and surrounding walls followed suite.  I stumbled out of the shower, falling over its ledge onto the floor. I wrestled about trying to get the shower curtain I had entangled myself in off.
