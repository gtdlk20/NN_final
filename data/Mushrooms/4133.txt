There was a phase when the universe felt chaotic. I'm not sure whether that was before or right after my sitter changed the music again. I remember concluding that there was no point worrying about anything, since everything, possible or impossible, was already happening. I assumed that that was what the session was all about and that it was therefore probably coming to an end.
