We blessed the mushrooms and took our dose, about 2g of Pensacola cubensis each, while riding a bus to our designated tripping place (As studio). I was feeling relaxed and excited about the coming experience, but I was also trying to let go of any expectations. The attraction that I felt for A was also making me a bit antsy and nervous as I didnt know what to expect, even though it was not so strong as the first time around. The mushrooms tasted nice and I was thinking they seemed so inconspicuous to be holding such a big secret inside them. I didnt notice anything strange before we got to the studio however, even though A said he could already see some changes in the environment.
