What I find interesting is that most of the benefits are quantifiable.  A question skeptics often ask entheogen users is, How does tripping benefit your regular life?  This is always difficult to answer, because the benefits of entheogens are as complex and subjective as the human mind itself.  I may think tripping gives immediate and lasting benefits to my music/writing/art/love life, etc., but how do I prove that?  Now I have finally stumbled upon an easily quantifiable benefit: I know objectively that my yoga practice improves while I am under the influence of shrooms.  Should I ever be able to volunteer for a study of this phenomenon, a scientist would be able to measure improvements in my flexibility, as well as my more relaxed breathing, heart rate, etc.  Even without a doctor measuring physiology, anyone with a regular practice knows when they are able to stretch farther into a pose.
