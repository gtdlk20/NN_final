Throughout this stage of the trip, I played some very relaxing music from the Dreamy vibes playlist on Spotify. The synths and low melodic electronic sounds mixed occasionally with beautiful waterlike trickles added to the intensity of the beauty and emotion I was feeling. The music was like soft marshmallowy pillows consuming my auditory senses, which when mixed with the comfort of my bed produced a feeling of relaxation that I had never previously experienced.
