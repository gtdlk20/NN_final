I laid down on the floor and tried to get comfortable.  I was cold, so I covered up with a loose weave blanket and stared up through the holes in it at the room, which was constantly warping and moving.  I found that by looking up through the blanket's weave, I could actually be somewhat comfortable.  If I stared long enough, I found myself feeling physically disjointed.  As if my body were inhabiting various areas of the room I was in.  My right arm was under me.  My head was floating above me near the roof, looking down on me.  My left arm and leg were somewhere near the front door.
