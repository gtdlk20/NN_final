I looked over at Friend 1 and he appeared to be a zombie, Pale skin with a blue-ish cast to it and teeth looked like they were meant for ripping human flesh. I was very glad he was a good friend of mine and would never eat my brain. At this time itÂ’s about 5:30. This trip was a very mental one for myself, I had many visual hallucinations but the state of my mind was the most amazing thing to me.
