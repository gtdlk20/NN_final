Zero hour plus 40 - extreme doubt, fear, and agitation set in. Do not fight them. Say goodbye to yourself, your reality, all the things you know, all the things you love, all your addictions, all your obsessions, all your fears. Just say goodbye. You are leaving them now. It is okay to cry. It is best to cry. If you hold back tears, yawning will force you to tear. Might as well let it flow. It is a cleansing.
