I tried them several times with friends and we enjoyed them tremendously. But, I wasn't getting the experience I wanted. As I mentioned, I consider such things a gift to be used wisely, and though I'm not above just having a good time, I would much rather put time and effort into the preparation for such a trip, so I can get something valuable out of it. Something I can take with me. A state of mind that will continue that will help me in the future.
