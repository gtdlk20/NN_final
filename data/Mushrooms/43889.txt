When we were coming down I got out of the car for a piss and was just taking in the beauty of the sky on the horizon. I felt very calm and happy and the breeze and birds all made the moment feel very peaceful. When I got back to the car I suggested to my friends to go for a walk to kill an hour before it got dark and they agreed.
