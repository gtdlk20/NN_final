My friends all said that they had really good trips, felt very euphoric and happy, but lacked strong visuals. Two of them had 5 grams of fresh Stones, whilst the other had half a 5 gram dose. I also noticed that for the main part of the trip I drank quite a bit of water because I had such a dry mouth, although I wasnt actually very thirsty, but I had to go to the toilet a ridiculous number of times for the amount of water I drank. Whilst for the latter stages of the trip, and throughout the evening, I drank lots of water and was really thirsty, but I hardly had to go to the toilet. However my friends only got thirsty in the evening, and certainly didnt visit the little boys/girls room nearly as often as I did.
