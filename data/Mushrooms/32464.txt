Oh yeah, it got dark but I was warm and comfortable, no wind, no mosquitoes or sand flies. I nicked off by myself to eat some KFC that we had but I didnt end up eating it I got so lost in thought. Then I heard my wife crying so I went to her quickly. Her come down was a bit nasty and she said she was sick. I realized that we had forgotten to drink and we had been in the sun all day. I made us drink a lot of water even through we didnt want to and then she told me that her breasts were very full of milk because we had left our baby 24 hours ago. She asked me to feed from her and to suck her completely dry. We have fooled around like this before and it has been erotic but this was different she needed me and I was the strong man coming to the rescue. It was very, very intimate and slightly arousing but not erotic or sexual. I developed a good technique and she was greatly relieved. From this time on for the rest of our two days away we did this together about 3 times a day.
