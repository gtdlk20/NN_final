Then she tells me sadly that I am everyone, and that I am also responsible for all the horrible atrocities and crimes committed, that since I am everyone, I have also been everyone evil. The passing of this knowledge hits me with a tremendous blow. For the first and only time in my mushroom experience, the Me Lying on the Bed gets up and walks over to the computer desk where I sob bitterly holding the wall for support. I cant express how powerful this was a realization. It is one thing to understand intellectually that you are one with everything, have lived every life and done everything, but it is another when the knowledge hits the heart as Truth and bearing all the consequences of this realization.
