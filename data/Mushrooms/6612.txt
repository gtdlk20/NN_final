For my first trip I had taken 5 grams of fresh Philosophers Stones, and despite the external problems that led to a bad trip, I felt quite comfortable to take a larger dose for this trip because we were in a much safer place. I was also eager to have a powerful, insightful, visual experience. I decided to double dose, so I ate 10 grams worth of fresh Stones, which had since been dried.
