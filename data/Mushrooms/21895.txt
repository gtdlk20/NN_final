We went to M's house and ingested the mushrooms and drank soda to diffuse the foul taste of the substance at around 11:30 P.M. At around 12:00 to 12:30 the effects began to hit us. An extremely overwhelming body high and euphoric feeling came over us very suddenly. Soon after M and I began to see colors much more vividly and patterns seemed to shift. This seemed to be an amazing substance that I couldn't believe I hadn't experienced before. We went outside to stare at nature and the moon for about an hour or so and his younger brother came outside and hung out with us fully aware of the circumstances.
