Coming down was like returning from animal mode to human mode.  I felt like I was shaking off some insane, alternate personality, and coming back in to reality.  I literally shook my mane like a wet dog several times.  I was really depressed for a few days afterward, plagued by feelings of meaninglessness and insignificance of the entire world.
