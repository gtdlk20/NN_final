T+1:45ish - Still sitting in the bulldozer's bowl, we had finished the mushrooms and were now wondering what would be most fun to do next.  I looked at two trees about 50 feet or so away from us, and noticed that they were moving a lot despite the still air.  They looked to me like two people making out, and I decided not to say that out loud in case it might sound weird.  I simply stated that they looked like people, and R also noticed they were making out.  W was apparently seeing the same thing, and we marveled at the fact that we all saw the same distortion simultaneously.
