I sat in my underwear and robe looking out the window, reality still wisping and waving and bending.  At times I got nervous, but I was able to reassure myself.  Eventually my boyfriend came back and that really made me feel better.  We watched out the window, his trip almost all over, while I was still coming down.  I had a good time looking out the window having a nice conversation.
