About forty-five minutes after we had eaten the mushrooms we returned to Nicks house.  We were relieved that his dads car wasnt in the driveway.  I followed Nick through the dark dining room and living room as he turned on the lights.  I couldnt see anything in the dark.  I could only sense where objects were and I had a strange fear of bumping into a coffee table or chair.  We walked up Nicks glowing red staircase and into his room.  James layed down on Nicks bed and said 'This is chill time now, folks.' James and Margo sat on Nicks bed.  Nick sat in a chair with wheels and I sat on a soft brown bench-chair in the corner.  They began a game of Blackjack with Nicks optical illusion playing cards.  Martin wandered in and out of the room, nervously picking up various things and pacing back and forth.  Nick and Margo and James card game slowly lost its definition as a card game when the players became more fascinated with the optical illusions on the cards than the game itself.  Margo layed down with her head against the wall and held cards up over her, every so often picking up a new card.  James did the same in the corner of the bed and wall.  Nick sat in his chair.
