So I had a day off from work finally and decided I really wanted a psychedelic experience, took out my bag of mushrooms and downed the disgusting fungi. While waiting for my experience to begin I smoked some cannabis (usually helps me stay calm during the come up) and then it started to hit me. Everything looked as if it was alive, even my pants began to breath and form multiple patterns. It was like my first trip all over again it made me so happy I burst out laughing, laughing so hard I began to get tears. All the ideas that flowed through my head interested me and lead to me playing my guitar. Each note I played had a meaning to me so I began to play whatever came to mind, and ended up making up the best song that I have ever wrote. Of course playing guitar while on mushrooms was fun within itself just because of my amp and pedals sinking into the ground, and my hand forming colors as I moved my hand up and down the neck of my guitar. After this amazing music experience on magic mushrooms I look at them in a totally different way. Music already had a strong meaning to me but now ill never look at it the same.
