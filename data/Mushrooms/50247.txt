Next we were resting on the sands of a dessert in India...around us were the sounds of the hustling and bustling of street vendors. My ex and I were East Indian in nationality and were lying on a woven rug made of burlap that I could actually feel under my body. I reached out to hold his hand (in real life) and remember feeling like it was colder and more dry than it really was, more worn and tired. I 'knew' that if the lights were on, his skin would be darker in colour. I was convinced that we really were East Indians hanging around in the dessert on a burlap rug.
