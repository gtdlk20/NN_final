As we sat on the bus and continued to talk and giggle, Lisa and I both could hear a girl singing and then we looked to the back of the bus, there was only a few people there that were talking. But to me and Lisa it seemed as if the volume of their voices were loud enough to get the drivers attention while driving. So I guess Lisa and me were the loudest ones on the bus. We felt that we had to speak louder so we could hear each other over everybody else. And it turns out that everybody on the bus was staring at us. This is the reason for Casey and Chriss to move.
