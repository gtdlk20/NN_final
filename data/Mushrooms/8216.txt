The Mushroom or The Object had started to reveal itself and I grew bolder.  I asked It head on 'what are you?'  It let me experience something like a faint memory.  I was looking through the eyes of a lower mammal, something like a monkey or an ape and I was looking at my hands.  For the first time I saw myself as this incredible, sentient being but still something primitive.  I felt a strange sense of wonder and then shame.  I remembered where it started for my own lineage - I am consciousness and this monkey and the mushroom had given me a space within which I can exist in a small and limited form.
