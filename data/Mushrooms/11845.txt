T+2hrs I'm aware of evereything going on around me very much so, including all the different conversations, yet I myself am very much stuck in my own world.  I haven't been tlaking much, and have been examining everything in the room very closely as if it is the ownly environment I know. The visual element has been there for quite some time now, though I did not fully acknowledge it or notice it till this point. There are of course the usual things, such as trails, and things waving and breathing, most notibly the walls. The floor appears to be a current, such as the ocean going back and fourth as I sit on it. I play with the thoughts of the images around me in my head abit, laughing alittle once in while to myself. I try to play with the trails with my hands which is fun, and become very interested in the various models my friend has in his room. I also begin to explore his CD collection.
