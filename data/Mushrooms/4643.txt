I wandered off from the cabin and took a seat on the grass in this beautiful, rolling field sprayed with purple and yellow wildflowers. I was sitting there in a half lotus, awaiting the colors to intensify or something. I wondered if I had taken a large enough dose. I checked the time stamp on a photo I had taken seconds after eating the last cap.  The time on my digital 35mm camera read 12:17. I figured it would take thirty minutes or so for any effects to be felt.  I texted a friend at 12:27 and I reported a nice feeling. I suspected it was a placebo effect as ten minutes was not enough for real shroomy feelings.  The plane was taxiing on the runway. The flight attendants were about to go over safety procedures. Which is what I did. I came up with a ritual to protect my consciousness from any unfriendly energies. I cloak myself in an impenetrable shield of love  built by the forces of all those in my life that love me. They stood around me and would only allow good energies in. It is very effective. Powerful.
