It was at that point my friends were finished smoking and we started walking back. My body ceased to exist and I felt like I was made of smoke. As we walked down the road, the road was swirling with flowing colors like a river, and my smoky body kept getting caught in it and drifting away. Now things began to take on the appearance of a mosaic, the world made up of interlocking polygons. Every sound I heard stuttered and trailed off, I no longer had a sense of body and it felt like it was just moving on its own accord without any control from my mind. I somehow made it back without just collapsing and tripping out, and at this point my mind was dominated by stuttery tearing sounds and the word 'stairs' in my voice just echoing in my head again and again. my mind was dominated by stuttery tearing sounds and the word 'stairs' in my voice just echoing in my head again and again. It was now about 11:20
