Eventually we headed back to the little area where our bags and bikes were located. I told Dan I was still tripping pretty hard and didnt want to go back just yet. We chilled for about a half an hour. I layed down on the leaf-covered ground and put my jacket over my eyes. I dont really remember having any kind of visions, except I remember seeing this large gecko/lizard crawling across a dark background. It was a pretty vivid image.
