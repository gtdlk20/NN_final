As soon as I was out of the shop I started nibbling on them.  These were fresh and tasted a whole lot better than the Liberty Cap or Mexican.  They come in a truffle form.  This, I found out later, is because they are mushrooms that deform under the ground, never quite sprouting through the surface.  I munched on the box of Philosophers for quite some time, slowly chewing them and rubbing the mulch around the inside of my mouth.  I had been guaranteed this would work.
