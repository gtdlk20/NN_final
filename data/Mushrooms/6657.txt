Before I begin with the experience here's some background; I've taken mushrooms many times before (I'd say about 50 times or so) over the past few years in dosages varying from 1 gram of dried P. Cubensis to 60 grams of fresh ones.  I also use MJ and alcohol on a somewhat regular basis (read; weekends ;)).
