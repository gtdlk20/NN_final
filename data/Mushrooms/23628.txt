Things progressed within twenty minutes. I began to feel a very moderate stoned feeling, slowed motion, though my mind remained fairly clear. Things seemed to vibrate and pulsate more than usual, and my reality was becoming visibly altered. My consciousness began to change slowly, and I became much more whimsical and had a few small emotional outbursts of laughter, I was no longer depressed. I went downstairs and lay in the dark. The lights on the ceiling, which were off, seemed to move toward me though fixed, my basement wall expanded and grew further away, and the brick walls seemed to have a more beautiful tone to it than it has ever before. A painting that is usually out of my vision had a beautiful glow to it. The black frame and black wall borders began to pulsate with blue dots and the wall moved slightly, but logically distorted. Inside the painting a man on a horse began to move, as one would imagine his movement along the coast of a lake in a forest.
