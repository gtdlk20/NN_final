The mushrooms were chopped and shredded into two peanut-butter and spice balls about the size of golf balls, which went down without too much trouble, with a little water right at 4:00 PM.  We joked that they had all the appearance and appetizing appeal of a small horse turd, and how we now understood the appeal of making an extract instead of just eating the things.  We took a short walk, about 20 minutes, until the first effects started to be felt, then retired to the bed, she with her head on my chest, and told Google Home to play classical music.
