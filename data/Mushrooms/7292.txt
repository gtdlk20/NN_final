I have loads of trip toys: A glowstick, gum, tic-tacs, a hand-mirror, bouncy balls, whistles, a hackey sack, a balloon, candy, a koosh ball, Silly Putty, a blue light on my key-chain, an empty film canister, a deck of cards, and Magic Eye Books.  I'm not the Moderator of the Shroomery's Trip Tips forum for nothing! I keep checking my eyes with the mirror to see if they're dilated.  I am laughing like hell at D who is wearing my Raccoon hat.  There's a metallic taste in my mouth.  I wonder what time it is.  It's too bad I took off my watch. We're talking about the differences in the Mario Brothers Nintendo games.  My purple Kool Aid looks pretty good.  When I was sober it tasted like Dimeatap cough syrup.  I wonder what it will taste like when I'm shrooming.  D is singing 'Touch Me'.  R's brother comes in for a beer and gets made fun of.  I tell everyone that I like beer, but I'm afraid of getting a beer gut. D says to sacrifice food for beer.  Coincidentally D works at a beer wholesale store.
