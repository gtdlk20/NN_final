Music was quite amazing to us. Normally, Josh and I don't agree so much with music. He's more into classic rock, and I'm into metal. But with the mushrooms, music was perfect, no matter what genre. I put on 'Death Blooms' by Mudvayne, and what a great song it was! I listen to Mudvayne regularly, but the song seemed brand new to me. Josh said, 'What is this music? This is really cool!' It was during this time that I got the best visual hallucination of the entire trip. I looked at the closet doors, and they were moving in a manner similar to that of waves. It was like staring at the surface of a lake on a windy day, but it was happening with his closet doors. This was amazing to me, so I told Josh, and he looked at the doors and saw the same thing.
