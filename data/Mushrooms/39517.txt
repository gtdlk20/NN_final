Geometric patterns were a major attention getter, as well as textures.  The bark of trees was covered with tiny geometrical shapes, and felt amazing.  I also got on my hands and knees and stared at the ground.  The combination of dirt and leaves was full of geometry. I hesitate to call them geometric hallucinations.  The geometry was there all along, but only now was I seeing it.  I simply noticed much greater detail, especially with patterns. I picked up a handful of dirt and let it run between my fingers.  It felt great. And the music.  The music was unreal.  Old school Goa...it was as if I were hearing every discreet element of the tracks that were playing through a different ear.  No words can really do justice to this so I'm not going to try to explain any further.  I started dancing.  My movements were timed rhythmically with the music and precise to the millisecond.  Every track seemed an old friend that I was eternally familiar with.
