My best friend, N, begrudgingly took her dose, complaining that drugs never had any noticeable affect on her. While the rest of us tried to swallow the remainder of these vile, sour, nutty truffles, she sauntered off to the kitchen and sat at the table to read the morning paper. Of course, she was the first to come up. As she sat at the table, she suddenly clamped her hands down on it - 'Woah. The table is floating'. She ran back through to the bedroom, absolutely doubled over with laughter. It was the worst case of the giggles I've ever seen. We suddenly decided that it was incredibly important to go to the beach right there and then. While N clung to the doorframe giggling and shaking, I had a hard job of putting her shoes on for her. We began the painstaking 2 mile walk down the sole country road, through a couple of tiny villages and past closed churches and primary schools, to the beach at the edge of the island.
