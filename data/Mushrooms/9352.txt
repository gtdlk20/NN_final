I was coming down from the trip and my mom came down the stairs. We talked a bit, I felt like my talking was a bit incoherent but she said it wasnÂ’t too bad. I told both of them roughly what I wrote in this report and we talked a bit about subjects that were roughly related to the experience. We talked about how (maybe) shrooms simulate some aspects of mental health issues and can make you more empathetic to people suffering from those. And how in a way seeing your mind dissolve can be like a near-death experience which can change your perspective on life.
