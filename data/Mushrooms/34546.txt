(0:00) - We go to my room and have a bit of a kick off ceremony where I ask everyone if they have any last minute questions or apprehensions. I didn't want anyone to have to worry about anything before we blasted through. No one seemed to have any concerns and we commenced the sacred ritual of eating the mushrooms, chomping on a big hunk of chocolate then tossing in one mushroom at a time. Everyone at 1.7g, dried after eating a light breakfast 2 hours prior.
