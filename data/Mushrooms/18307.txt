We stopped at 7-11 because everyone thought it would be funny to make me go buy a slurpee, so I went in and tried to fill the cup up, it looked so watery I poured it out and moved to the next flavor, I poured that one out, and the next, eventually I said whatever and took the watery slurpee. When I got back to the car I noticed that the slurpee was thick not watery and when I touched it long ripples went through it, then my friend started to go off about a slurpee being 'Sex in a Cup' saying all the reasons it was that way. I also felt like I was sitting way inside of the car seat, not on top of it.
