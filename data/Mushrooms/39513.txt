I went back over and sat by RP and his friend, and leaned back and looked up at the sky.  This was when I 'peaked.'  From this moment on, time became irrelevant.  Looking up at the pitch black sky and leafless tree branches, I was completely amazed.  I fell back into a laying position, and stared for what seemed like an hour, but in reality was probably a few minutes.  My entire perception of my surroundings had altered dramatically.  It was very intense...like an information overload.  There was a physical feeling in my head that is very hard to describe.  It seemed to be centered at eye level and the best I can do describing it is to say that it felt like all of the images that my eyes were seeing were screaming into my head at 1000x their normal speed.  If you've ever ridden a high speed roller coaster...imagine the feeling of the wind rushing into your face, and then apply that feeling to all of your senses.
