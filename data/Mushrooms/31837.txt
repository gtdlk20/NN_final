It was that thought that brought me down a bit - that my landlord lived in the apartment above me, and perhaps I was making too much noise? I always get paranoid about being too noisy when Im intoxicated. So I zipped up the laughter and decided to go have a bath. Ive yet to go swimming while tripping, which I understand is amazing, but taking a bath, or even a shower, is pretty great too. When Im tripping I find it very hard to tell if things, including myself, are wet or dry, and actually getting wet delightfully confuses the senses even further. Lying there in the lukewarm water I fancied I could hear the jungle noises again, and soon I got the sensation of lying in a swampy puddle in a lush, dark jungle, with lizards and frogs and other creatures all around me.
