My first thought was to take advantage of my psychedelic mindset and play guitar. So I picked up my guitar and played some improv for a bit, but I kept slowing down and eventually stopping. My head felt heavy and my hands felt slow and awkward. I realized the onset of a mushroom trip was not the best time to attempt to play guitar, and hoped I would have better luck later on.
