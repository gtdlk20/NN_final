When I got back I found M staring at the floor, he had colourful visuals of the floors crazy paving moving around. We began walking to the next ride and even when we had begun to queue we didnÂ’t really know where we were going, walking and queuing were just as fun as the rides. As we got onto the next rollercoaster (the runaway train) M decided the guy announcing safety procedures was a DJ called Fenriz (a Norwegian black metal musician). Fenriz growled to us as the ride began. We had very little idea that we were actually on a ride, we spent the entire time conversing as if we were merely sitting in a pub for the afternoon.
