This morning, there is a fairly strong backdrop of remembering, but no hangover or negative physical effects.  If there is a next time, it will be a recreational dose and I hope an extract so I donÂ’t have to eat that horrible tasting stuff and can hopefully avoid the nausea.  I think we both want to do this again though.
