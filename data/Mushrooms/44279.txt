We had to pay for the bowling and get our shoes etc, so my mind was focused on that, so for a few minutes, although I felt euphoric, I didn't let it show.  I never did start bowling.  The lights and music were too much for me.  The others sat around drinking beer and taking their turns at bowling, but I was there, I was completely involved in the cadence and rhythym of the top 40 pop tunes they were playing.  There was one light in particular, and it spiraled out, narrowed and then shone straight.  When I looked into it, I felt I was looking into the 'light.'  I felt like a philosopher who had finally reached enlightenment.
