D (who had recently purchased the house) was worried that maybe the house was falling over.  I said of course its falling over, everything falls over, but it wont in his lifetime.  Then D said he felt like he got caught holding the bag and we laughed about that for a whilepicturing him not being able to do anything but literally hold the bag.
