Anyway, at around noon I went searching for my original friend. She was having a pleasant trip in the library, with another mutual friend. She had apparently been telling him all the secrets of life. When I came, I calmed down slightly, but then went on a tangent, and cried because the walls were crying. My friend slapped me, because I had 'ruined her trip'. Anyway, the wall was crying, and I was crying... I kept rambling about how much experience the wall had had. Apparently I talked about this a lot. I don't remember it that well.
