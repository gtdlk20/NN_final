I was trying to get my mind in the proper state for the experience, as I knew the drug had the potential to cause underlying mental problems to come to the forefront of the users consciousness. Looking back, I probably should have known that my life was too unorganized to proceed with tripping, but then again, if I hadnt of tripped, I wouldnt be the person I am today. And it had been shown to have a long term, positive personality change in the majority of users, I kept telling myself. In the end, I concluded that I would want to tell my friends about the experience once it was over, and I didnt want them to feel excluded.
