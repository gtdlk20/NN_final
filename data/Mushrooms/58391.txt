Now I walk downhill, and remember that a new athletic ability comes with mushrooms. I jump like a goat from black basalt ball to ball over the top of the grass and fireweed, very quickly, but sure. My pack is a massive muscle on my back. I am a goat and a bison. The land drops away like a Hitchcock stairwell and I smell water icy and green. The blond heart-shapes of elk rumps bob into the woods below me and I drop through layers of scent: gunpowder rock, lime lichen, birdshit, bearfunk, elkpellets, troutstream, and this last brings me up short and a whip of the oldest primate caution bends my spine and tightens my thighs and I slide into the trees along the stream aware that there is an animal and aware that it is unaware of me in my silence. So I drift like breeze-blown catkin fluff into a thicket of serviceberry and the buck is below me bent to the water like a streambank, drinking, crowned with arrows like St. Sebastian, connected at the mouth to his inverted self seen by me against a horn of jumping lights on the still beside the riffle.
