In geek terms, I have realized that mushrooms have given me an ability to run a sort of feedback loop to fine tune these aspects of my own 'programming' when it comes to reality and being in it.  I have a theory that these visuals which I have seen less and less of, were 'lines of code' of my brain that lacked a proper interpreter.  As they have been challenged and brought to the surface, the visuals, which seem to be repetitions or abstractions of my visual center- ended up manifesting as thought loops and emotions.
