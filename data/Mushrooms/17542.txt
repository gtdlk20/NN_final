I took 1.5 g of very strong mushrooms, with two friends who took 1.5 and 2 g respectively.  Yes, I know that 1.5 g is not a large dose, but I am quite sensitive to psilocybin.  Any amount over 1 gram usually gives me strong effects. The mushrooms were all broken up into fine slivers in the baggie - and it looked like a lot of spores.
