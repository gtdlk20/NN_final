O but my friends, the shit got intense.  About thirty minutes after the tingly feeling reached the top of my head some effects hit me that never happened to me prior before this trip.  This was in fact the most shrooms I had ever ate.  The pool water looked really cool, just the texture of it was amazing. When I looked at the water this one kid splashed on the cement it started to move and become wavy. Think of squeezing a pillow very slowly in and out and thats what the water was doing. After another ten minutes or so peoples faces started to do the same thing.  Their faces were being distorted and becoming wavy.
