So as I was doubting my love for Justina, I noticed that even though I was feeling pain, there were no tears in my eyes. I took this as further sign that my love for her was never really real and I shouted at myself, 'Where are the damn tears?' I took mushrooms partly so that I could feel the emotions that had been building up inside me for the past couple of weeks. And here I was with all the tools that I knew of to provoke a response, from drugs to music to memories, and I wasn't feeling anything strong enough to bring even a single tear. I started crying shortly after though. I stood in front of my neighbor's house by their truck and the tears just poured out of me.
