I rejoined everyone else sitting around the campsite. I sat in this folding camp chair I had brought, and I could feel myself sinking into the chair. Oh man, NOW I could feel the shrooms coming. Was redosing a mistake? Who knew. I decided to just roll with it and before long, I forgot that I had even redosed. At one point, I went with the group back to the edge of the campsite to look at the field on the other side. Oh my god, when I looked at that field, I felt as if it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. It was still full daylight, but the sun was low enough that it caused the tall grass in the field to glimmer in the most beautiful way imaginable. The colours were unlike any I had ever seen before, it was perfect.
