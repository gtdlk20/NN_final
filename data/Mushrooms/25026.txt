Knowing that my roomate was out of town for the weekend, I opened my eyes to see who or what it was.  It was me!!!! I was across the room sitting in a wicker chair.  The me that was on the couch was gripping the armrest and the cushions validating that I was physically there. All of a sudden the other me in the chair stood up and walked to the center of the room and 'looked into me.'  I know that sounds strange, but it is the only way to describe the instance.
