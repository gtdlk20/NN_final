I could definitely tell Buddy was tripping.  His pupils were big and he had that special twinkle in his eyes.  He would look around at every thing and tip his ears at any noise.  At some parts of the trip he was very playfull and energetic rolling around in the grass and he loved to be scratched, he LOVED it.  We tossed his bone for him and he would fetch it and munch on it for a wile.  At other times he was very calm and looked thoughtful.  Me and D both felt a new conection to Buddy, we could feel his mood and his thoughts better.  Mushrooms can open your mind to other forms of comunication.  Dogs comunicate mostly with body language, facial expressions and eye contact and some vocally but not as much as we humans depend on vocal language.  All three of us definitely bonded on a new level.  We all had a great trip.  The sun was out and the leaves in the mountains are just starting to change color, a cool breeze made things just right, fall is a great time to trip.
