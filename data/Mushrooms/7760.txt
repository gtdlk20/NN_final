This is the first time this trip has changed me as a person. Before the trip, I was a shy person, I never really tried to go out of my way to try and meet new people. I was always nervous and quiet around those who I didn't know. After the trip, now about 7 months later, I can sit down and talk to a stranger without thinking twice about it. This year alone I met so many new people it's unbelievable.
