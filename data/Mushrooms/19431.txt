I left the room and dry heaved into the toilet and then lay on the floor in the hallway, My eyes were rolling into my skull at this point and I felt like sleeping. I felt well on the verge of passing out as well, like Id done a lot of mushrooms and my body wasnt appreciating it. Anyway, I maintained consciousness, though I later regret it, as I feel I may have experienced a breakthrough dissociative state, similar to the alternate realms I have visited on DXM and ketamine. Oh well, the thoughts became very peaceful as I made up my mind to continue with uni, just change my subject choices for the next semester, find a new job, continue my music production and just use my time more resourcefully.
