T++1:52: I check the time again, from other experience reports I've read I wonder how people find this so difficult on psychedelics or if I'm really soft and always underdose. I feel like I'm forgetting something and start trying to remember what it is, I start thinking about the actions I went through before the trip and during so close my eyes, before long it feels like I'm living my day pre-trip in rewind, truly remarkable and the most detailed polymodal closed eye visual I've ever had. After doing this I checked the time again. 4:56! It had only been a few minutes and it felt like I'd watched about six hours of footage condensed into about an hour, definitely not four minutes. I remember I was aiming for ego loss this trip, and decide to try for it, even before beginning I'm doubting the effectiveness of consciously inducing ego loss.
