We all go into the garage and I grab a pen and immidiatly start drawing on the wall. I draw such an introcate drawing, I feel like the pen is just moving on its own and lines are comming together forming such amazing things, I am being sucked into the picture. The picture I am drawing is over come with life, it is moving and swirling, drawing me deeper and deeper into the picture. My friend D, L and J come over to see what IÂ’m doing and stop and stare at my picture. Almost at the same time they say,'That is so fucking good.' All I can do is nod. My thoughts are so deep that I am past all my thoughts that come into my mind. It is so hard to explain to people who have never tried mushrooms.
