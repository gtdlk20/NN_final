Before I begin my story of a wonderful trip, I will provide some important background info to aid in understanding the extent of the experience.  Around the time this experience occured life was good.  Soon after the my first semester at collage began I received a phonecall of such greatness that to this day it remains umparralled .  I was blessed with the best possible source for beautiful Cali gold caps.  The prices were almost too good to be true, and over a period of a few weeks my partners and I became well known for our wares.  We were left with a copious amount of fungus for our own consumpotion.  So we began to trip almost every weekend.
