While by that point I had completely lost all sense of time, I believe was about 9 or 10 pm, and people were still calling me back. My friend had ended up getting mushrooms, but got lost with her friend who was driving and didn't have enough gas to pick me up. Another friend, though, was right in my town and could tell I needed to get out of my house, so being the good friends she is, told me she'd be there in a few minutes. Since I didn't know what a few minutes was, I just ran around upstairs anxiously, grabbing unnecessary objects and stuffing them into my over-sized bag, and then saw the pile of stems resting on my radio, so I picked them up and stuffed them into my coat pocket, thinking I would just carry them around - like gum.
