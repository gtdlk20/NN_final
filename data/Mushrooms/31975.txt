More importantly when I used my mind to think about life everything had quickly lost its meaning. I was no longer J, the thought of being myself was such a foreign and bizarre concept that at one point I convinced myself I would never come back down to reality. And, quite frankly, I absolutely loved it.  The feeling of freedom and being able to let go of the baggage that builds upon our ego throughout life was a heavenly release.  The habitual processes of my consciousness and subconsciousness no longer tightened their chains upon my soul.  Instead there was clarity and time to question my life and existence.  Although mushrooms may be hard on the ego, they definitely made me more appreciative and accepting of my blessings in life.   Instead of having hatred and anger from what I saw as all the wrongs in the world, instead, I had acceptance and love and nothing else to give, even to the people I despised the most.
