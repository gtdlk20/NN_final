Note that tonight was a perfect night, perfect temperature perfect breeze that seemed to come as soon as I wanted it to and an almost full moon and a mostly clear sky. Then Lucifer says something like 'now I know what its like to think like a crazy person and to be insane. Man this is fuckin CrAAAzy.'Then he wonders off by himself and comes back with a perfectly rolled blunt so we toke that up except for Akmed who cant smoke because of reasons. Then Lucifer starts acting really weird and gets up and starts wondering and running around my front yard. After I think a few minutes I decide Im going to see how he's doing cause the rest of us are just chillin on the ground and he is just rambling about weird and freaky shit and acting like a complete crazy person in my yard. This is when things start to go down hill.
