T +2:00 Â– This is around the time that my second dose peaked. I felt as flat as a piece of paper. My hands felt elongated and it was as if everything I touched had the same texture and temperature yet a different feel. I knew cloth from glass, yet it felt the same. I had trouble holding onto objects because of space being so extremely skewed. Gravity was a distant memory. When I got up to go to the washroom I felt as if a wind was pulling me to the side. I was now curved along with everything around me. When I reached the bathroom I looked in the mirror. My eyes were dilated but not that much. My face began to morph. It went upside down, back to normal, and then flowed like water. I returned to my bed to watch some TV.
