Some door was opened the night I experienced ego death, and every time I took shrooms afterwards, it was re-opened. It somewhat felt like the mushrooms would tune my brain to another frequency, but I didn't particularly like what I would receive. I could feel my head being tuned into this alternate frequency again, and I knew that if I would give into it my ego would be blown to bits once again. I thought to myself 'Oh boy, I'm really in for it now'. I began to panic a little. I already felt this was gonna be a hell of a trip, and I wanted to abort. I went for the vitamin C, only thinking 'Abort, abort!'. But when I put the pill in my mouth I had second thoughts. I remembered several texts which said vitamin C may in fact boost your trip which would have been the last thing I wanted then, so I decided to take a half one to see if it would do good or bad. Back sitting at my desk, I could feel the ego death experience dawning upon me and I had to fight to keep my mind in this word, this dimension.
