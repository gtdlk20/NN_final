T-3:00--We talk about how similar we are and how odd it is we met. We have the same interests (psych and people) and are at the camp for the same reason (to chill and learn some new tricks on cello). We discuss why everyone else is there (to major in music and make it their life) and how we could never do that and why. Talked about girls and love and life and about what I wanted to do. A very good deep honest and insightful convo. At this point I'm just chilly (it's now about 12 midnight and it gets cold at night in holland). I basically get to know Jim up and down in a matter of a few hours. I also remembered this thing I only remember when I'm on shrooms ... shroom de ja vu.
