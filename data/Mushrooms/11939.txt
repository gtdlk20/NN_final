Joe lives down the road and its not a far walk. I could not remeber this walk, only dropping Joe off at his house and saying goodnight. It was around 10pm now and fog was growing over everything. As we left Joe, windchimes danced in the background and for a couple of moments I feared we had somehow come to be in London and would never get home. I followed Guido down the other road, a main road leading to the beach and our house. He did not say anything and walked a little in front of me. I felt like I was floating down the road and talked nonstop to my silent compainion, completly ignoring the threat of passing cars, although they rarly came by.
