I ate 5 grams of dried mushrooms with a glass of orange juice. I went into my bedroom and watched the first episode of the newer version of the show cosmos. This was pretty intense to watch while coming up on a psychedelic. Im sure it greatly influenced the direction my trip took. Set and setting is key. Im not saying anything that happened was real, or if it was all in my head, or if I even know how to really define that anymore. This is just the story of what happened when I took a bunch of mushrooms.
