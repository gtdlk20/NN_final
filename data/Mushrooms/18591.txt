I did and do very purposefully think of this whole possible experiment as therapy, so I have used those words, as opposed to recreation trip, or spiritual entheogenic voyage. Not that I judge the legitimacy of these uses. I only say this to show that my personal goal has been to embark on this experiment for medical and behavioral health purposes. The mushrooms I took in college were for recreation, and I don't regret this. Yet, this time around, nearly 20 years later, my focus was healing - and going outside the mainstream medical route was only because that route had yielded only limited results. Meaning I had already tried the first line of therapies and remedies, and was only using this as a last result, so to speak.
