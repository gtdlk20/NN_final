The very first time I acquired psilocybin mushrooms, I remember feeling an almost unique sense of power. I would never wish to place myself on a level above that of my friends. IÂ’m far from a perfect human being. I think it was more so just the fact that I now had access to provide us with a magical experience none of us knew. I had something brand new to us and potentially life-changing. I had to provide us all with a chance to see something no one else would ever be able to imagine, even in their craziest, most vivid dreams.
