I had spent my whole childhood moving from town to town. I had no friends, nothing made me happy, and I had been constantly bullied by my peers. At one point near the end of 8th grade, I was smoking 2-3 grams a day (might not be much for the reader, but a lot for me). I tried stopping for a few weeks and felt like shit, so I continued through the summer.
