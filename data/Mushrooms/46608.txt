T+50...After this moment, I am not aware of the times of anything. I remember walking into the cornfield, and because it was the middle of summer, the corn wasn't tall. This allowed us to wander around aimlessly, drifting apart and staring at the stars. P laid down for awhile, and I followed soon after when I got sick of tilting my head straight up. I remember the stars were out more than earlier, which made for a pleasant experience. After some time, one of us got up and yelled to the other, and we decided to talk about what we were seeing. It was hilarious to try and speak to each other.
