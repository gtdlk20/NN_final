background: I'm 21 years old, male, and I consider myself a relatively experienced drug user. Substances I've tried include mushrooms, lsd (25 times or so, my favorite), MDMA, marijuana, mescaline, cocaine, 2c-fill-in-the-blank, DMT, various multicolored pills, you get the idea. This particular occurance involved 4 grams of psilocybin mush at an IDM/glitch rave in Mountain View, CA, and was written in retrospect the following morning.
