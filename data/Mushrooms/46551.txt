I called Luke and told him that I figured out everything and asked if he would like to join me.  He quickly came upstairs and we both sat on the floor and stared at an orange towell hanging by the shower.  It was moving and melting so vividly, we commented on how bizarre it was that in reality, that towell is not moving at all, but our minds make it do what it's doing.  I came to a realization about mind and reality that is really difficult to explain, I simply understood it and knew it to be true.  I watched the towell form the face of an ape then change into an eagle, a stormtrooper helmet, and many other forms that I can't really recall.
