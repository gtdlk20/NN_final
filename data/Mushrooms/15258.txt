Now The trip was intense with visuals while on my peak but most of my buzz was spent talking with my friend Rocko. However I feel I could have done much more with the power unleashed by the psylocybin. I can say this was a great first time experience, I was not expecting more since I had made sure not to read other people's report before having my own trip. After more trips I truly know I could have done more with the trip. For one we had a single tune running in loop for the whole night, Blind guardian Ashes to Ashes. While it was a group trip I by far prefer duo trips or solitaires. 3 is hard to manage and prones paranoia as making sure both of my friends were being kept entertained.
