I had the disorienting sensation of not knowing which way was north or south, east or west, even up or down for that matter. Though queasiness returned in waves throughout the trip, it gave me a reprieve just long enough to teeter out into the living room where Albus and Wes sat on plush couches, commenting on the compoundÂ’s undeniable quirkiness.
