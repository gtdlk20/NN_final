I turn on my comp and after it starts up, I looked at the screen and felt very confused. I started to feel hot and the nausea started to come back. I looked at the screen more and decided not get online cause what if my girlfriend called and found out Im online at like 5 in the morning? She wouldnt have called but she was very bad for me. I started to feel more sick and feeling flushed. 'Ill puke em out. That'll make me feel better.' Little to my knowledge that it wouldn't have done anything anyway. I tried to puke and felt worse and worse. I then had feelings of dying or being perma fucked and I was afraid. So afraid that I was going to lose everything. I would lose my girlfriend, my job, my apartment, my parents. My world came crashing down in a big hurry. I was crying uncontrolably. I thought that if I went to sleep I'd wake up and be ok. That sure didnt work. I couldnt decide whether to call my girlfriend and tell her or my parents or 911. I was totally flippin out.
