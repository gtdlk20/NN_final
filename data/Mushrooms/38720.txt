Martin became fascinated with the cards and Nicks globe-light.  I sat in my brown chair smiling and watching things.  Martin became the center of my focus, because he and the globe were directly in front of me across the room.  I shifted in my chair.  The bookcase wobbled and bent, the walls took a breath.  'Wow.' I said. Martin continued walking in and out of the room, disoriented.  The walls continued breathing and the bookcase bending.  The door to the closet was open a crack and there was a space between the door to the hall and the floor.  The paper map of Japan, on the closet door was waving in the nonexistent wind and flapping like cloth.  I kept seeing shadows of people walking by under both the closet and hall doors.  I looked at the door frame and saw that the woodwork was flowing.  I couldnt tell where the woodwork ended and the corner between the two walls ended.  That was when I knew I was being affected.  Everything else could have been attributed to general sober weirdness, yet I knew that this was not a sober thing to see.  Different parts of the floor began to shift and slide at different times and I felt myself slowly and gently moving towards the others around the bed, travelling on my chair.  I looked down at my leg.  The pattern in the denim became rows and rows of alien symbols and letters.  Question marks, pound signs and odd looking things I had never seen before.
