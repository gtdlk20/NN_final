6- Jar #4 looks fine today. I guess it was just a late starter. The suspected contaminant looks the same, so I am starting to think that its only a wierd chunk of greenish vermiculite. The other jars are fine. The spots are starting to look feathery around the edges and are getting noticeably bigger every day.
