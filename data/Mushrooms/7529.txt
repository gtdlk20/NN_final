I am Adam-thinking, by the way, and that is all that I can tell you.  Being with these people and not knowing them all that well was an entirely new experience for me.  We walked through the woods and all over observing the warm and beautiful state of the shrooms.  Inside my head was no shroom like feeling yet.  We encountered a friend on a path while we were wandering half lost in the woods.  He was also an experienced tripper and knew how to talk to us and handle us.  We walked and talked with him for a while.  I was still not really tripping, although I had some of the feelings that I was coming down and in reality I was peaking, hard.  I was lost inside of my desires, not knowing anything truly, but only feeling.
