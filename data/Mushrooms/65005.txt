Once D dropped B and me off back at my place, we continued to walk around our town.  B wanted to go inside my house, but I told him that being on mushrooms outside is far better than being inside.  He agreed and we walked for a good 30 minutes.  B then turns to me and says his stomach hurts.  I told him that mushrooms are a poison and stomach discomfort is normal.
