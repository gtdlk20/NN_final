The night passed on and the drug seemed to change alot, swinging from a more MDMA type feeling to a more psychedelic feeling. I went through copious amounts of nitrous oxide that night (as I usually do) because every time I would take a balloon I would see amazing colours everywhere, and generally ramble about them to other peoples amusement.
