We decided to go on the computer to talk to people and tell them what we were doing. I signed on to msn, and went on webcam for one of my friends and the computer screen expanded sideways and all I could see was my face melting, and my body turn to liquid. I felt like my body was evaporating and that there was nothing I could do, or anyone else either. I turned off the computer and started to call people so I could get out of my house and experience the outdoors. No one would stay on the phone with me for longer than 5 minutes, everyone was hanging up, I felt as if the world hated me, and that the house was capturing me and telling me to stay inside and not socialize. I became depressed and scared and didn't know what to do.
