After the movie had progressed to some crazy scene which I couldn't comprehend, I decided to do something. I didn't know what yet, but I knew I couldn't sit idle for too long. That something happened to be me going into my bedroom and attempting to play Halo 2, and when finally I reasoned with myself that I was FAR too fucked up to do anything beyond sit and observe. I then placed my headset on my ears and listened to GWAR's 'War Party' CD, which was 750% more badass in my current state, by the way. I eventually fell asleep sometime in the album, and upon waking up felt fresh and great. The usual 'Day after stupidity' hit, and we spent the next day smoking hash, shooting/inhaling some really good heroin, and doing nothing too active.
