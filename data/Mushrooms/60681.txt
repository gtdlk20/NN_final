About twenty minutes later I started feeling the effects of the shrooms. I was sitting in a chair it looked like a bunch of flys were flying all over one flew towards my face it slowed down and I could see right in its eyes. We decided to go outside because my friend said it's alot trippier outside. When we walked out the colors were very bright and vibrant. I started hearing things like birds and buzzing in my head. My friend and I were talking but I could'nt comprehend what he was saying it sounded fucked up.
