My husband did the first balloon. He sat with his eyes closed, smiling, for about 30 seconds, and came out of it laughing. He tried to explain what it had done to him but words seemed inadequate. He then joined our friend in trying to convince me to try it, but I didn't want to. A voice explained to me, 'That's not what this trip is about.' My husband did two more balloons, and seemed, for lack of better words, blown away by them.
