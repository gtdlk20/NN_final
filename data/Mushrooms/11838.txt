I loved (or should say LOVE) MDMA, and it was my prefered psychoactive. Not a clumsy, or overbearing substance, I found it theraputic and beautiful. In any case, I wanted to at least smoke some weed that night. However at about 7:00, my friend, the host of the house/party, informed me that he had some shrooms left from the last time we had all used them. He had about an 1/8th left. I sort of pleaded and asked if I could buy it off him. He didn't argue and was more then happy to sell to me for only the sole $5 bill that remained in my wallet. And so the night began for me.
