About an hour later when I had come down a little bit, my friends and I were squashed in a tent with a few other people smoking cannabis. (I had none so as not to spoil the mushroom effects).  The more violent of my two friends (I would like to point out that he is not usually violent) began burning someone's hair who was not tripping.  She became so annoyed she poured the bong water all over him.  I am sure now that if we hadn't hidden his knife earlier, she might be dead and he in prison.
