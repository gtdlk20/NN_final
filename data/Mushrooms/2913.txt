Another issue I have along with my depression (co-morbid with it) is chronic lower back pain. I have been to many many doctors and tried a variety of therapies, remedies and medications. I mention this because often chronic physical pain tag teams with more mental/behavioral health issues, as is the case with me. (From about 2001 to 2003 I was also on a opioid (Kadian) for my back pain.) It would take a book to record all the treatments, therapies, remedies and medications I have partaken for the lower back pain. I have been to acupuncturists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, neurologists, massage therapists, accu-pressure, sub perceptual electro stim, reiki therapy, faith healers, have gotten ex-rays, cortisone shots, CAT scans, MRIs, etc.
