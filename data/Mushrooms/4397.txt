After some time, I started to get a more 'loving' insight into my issues of motivation and such.  It was an understanding that I had chosen this to protect myself from burn out in a job that did little to nothing in rewarding good work.  Throughout my trips, I had felt like it was my ego that was sabotaging me in life, but it was my own doubt of my ego that made me feel powerless (and I suppose why it did what it had to do 'automatically').
