I have suffered from cluster headaches even longer, and was one of those that made the chance discovery that psychedelics improves matters, back in 2004 I think.  But the pharms (particularly risperidone and venlafaxine) pretty much nullified any beneficial effect from them, so I was a rather boring miserable individual for a decade.  In addition to the cluster headaches I also have lupus (treated daily with cannabis).  And have rather severe anxiety and depression that can lessen but never goes away completely, the akathisia doesn't help there.
