1:00 A.M. - Our trips began to peak at this time. I had suddenly transported to the bed opposite of the one we were laying on. I asked him how I got there and he replied Got where? youre still on the same bed we started on. He reassured me that I had not moved from my starting place, and I realized that it was all in my head. We talked about ridiculous things for quite some time. He was convinced that I was his brother, when in reality I am his cousin. I still felt like I was lying on the other bed. I could only see my right arm which I was leaning on. My other arm had disappeared and did not seem to exist. For some reason, this did not seem to frighten me in the least bit. I kept reassuring myself that it was only in my head and I was having an amazing trip.
