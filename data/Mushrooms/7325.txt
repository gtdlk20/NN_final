I felt mischievously daring as we strolled past a security guard in the courtyard. As we walked by a lovely ivy-covered church, I was awe-struck by dusky clouds and stained glass windows. My voice rang in my ears briefly, and the atmosphere of our surroundings shifted abrubtly with each new sound or voice nearby. I wasn't overly alarmed, knowing this tendency of psychedelics. I allowed myself to focus on the natural beauty of the park we were entering, fairly successfully ignoring passerbys. I felt that if I stood still and stared at anything too long, I'd be swallowed up and crushed by the immensity of beauty. I feared the looming conspicuousness of falling on my knees before lilacs and blossoming trees.
