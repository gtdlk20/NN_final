The psychedelic effects would come and go in waves like the taste of the mushrooms did for me, and each time someone would stop tripping they'd say 'Whoa, back to reality...'  The presence of this 'reality' was a somewhat depressing idea, as we wanted the trip to come back.  We'd keep discussing the difference between the trip and reality until the trip climbed back into force again.  This happened several times and eventually we figured out that the word 'Reality' was a sort of trigger that seemed to keep the trip at bay.  One would accidentally use that word (which came up frequently) and the other two would instinctively shout 'Don't say reality!'  It gradually progressed to a point where we would all ejaculate that word at random intervals, which remains an inside joke to this day.
