My first experience with mushrooms was at a weekend music festival, and it was good, but I didnÂ’t think that I really maximized the substance's potential. looking to try them again, I acquired about 8 grams of very good mushrooms from a friend at school. me and 5 other friends had planned to get together that weekend, and only one of us was not planning to trip.
