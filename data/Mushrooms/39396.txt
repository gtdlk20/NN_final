A. and I eat the mushrooms at my apartment at 7:00 PM, and then decide to drive back to his house before they set in.  This was a somewhat reckless decision, and I absolutely do not recommend doing this..... mushies can kick in fast.  Fortunatly, he had just swallowed his and not held them in his cheeks so it didn't hit him until well after he got out of his car.
