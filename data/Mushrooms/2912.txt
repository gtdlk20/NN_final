Recently therapy-wise, I have gone to general professional counseling. I year or two ago I went to a class in Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), and started practicing that on and off. I exercise approximately 3 times per week. I eat moderately healthy (which means moderately unhealthy too). I drink alcohol regularly, perhaps 0 to 3 beers per day. I drink approximately 2 cups of coffee per day. I also pray and meditate in the Christian religious tradition. The most recent prescription meds I have taken are Gabapentin, Lamotrigine (Lamictal), and Escitalopram (Lexapro), though in the last 4 months I have only been on the latter two of these.
