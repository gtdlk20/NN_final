The thought didn't frighten me, but I began to pray to an entity I called Daddy Mushroom.  I ended up lying down on my side, and from this angle I could see the curtains swaying in the breeze from the open window.  The curtains were actually Pakistani tapestries, very intricate designs in deep shades of maroon and dark blue.  They appeared to be breathing, and the sight increased my nausea.  I closed my eyes, and Daddy Mushroom took over.  I felt as though I was lying on soft dirt, with living things, plants and mushrooms - growing, dying, rotting into the earth, and then growing again - all around me.  Daddy Mushroom was showing me the cycle of life, and I was terrified.  I became convinced that I was dead, that I was rotting in a grave, and that I would be in this realm for eternity.  Daddy Mushroom wanted me to understand his power.  He seemed to be telling me that mushrooms are not just for recreation.  I distinctly heard a deep male voice say, 'Now do you know what I am?'
