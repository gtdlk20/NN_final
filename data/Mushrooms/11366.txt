It was a magnificent spring day in the very midst of spring break, in which I had a full week to relieve myself of the normal everyday school stress. I had smoked a large amount of hash the day before, but I had ingested no psychoactive substances on this unpredictable day. I had been looking forward to this day for quite some time, and me and a friend had saved enough money to buy a large quantity of drugs to last us through the days off. We were let out to break Friday, which was the day before yesterday. We were traveling up to my moms' boyfriends' cabin to stay for a few days.
