She suggested that I would look much less suspicious if I just went inside our house instead of standing outside. We went in and talked for about 20 minutes. She had assured to me that I was safe, and said that she was intending to go back to her parents house for the night. I felt anxiety about her leaving, because I wasnt sure if I was going to think it was okay to go outside and do crazy things. (I didnt trust myself at the time, but now looking back, I realize that I was totally responsible in that state of mind during the whole experience) She ended up staying and remained awake with me and until 2am.
