The emotional effect of the medicine was an energy release, like laughter. It was impossible to control, easy to trust, not exactly relaxing, but not at all frightening. I was surprised to find that I could still talk. It didn't feel the same as talking when I'm sober or when I'm stoned. On mushrooms, I found I could take a deep breath and then send a thought to my sitter, and somehow my voice would say it in English words.
