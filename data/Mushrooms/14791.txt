We proceeded to head inside, which I found very difficult.  It was hard to do anything.  M saw this as well, and he said hey, you ok? You seem to be having trouble standing.  I thought I was going to pass out.  It had hit me so hard.  I had gotten extremely tired at this point, probably having to do with having nothing to eat the entire day.  But, it was also extremely harsh on my body.  I cant even explain what it was like.  But, I had the thought that I might have been sold some mushrooms that may have had some poison.  I had read about mushrooms that have poison in them, such as the amanita muscaria, how they are fine unless taken in high doses, or something similar, although, I could be wrong altogether.  But, the point is, I thought I may have poisoned myself.  So, I thought I needed to get some food inside me to help absorb some of the poison, if there was any.  A friend grabbed me something, which I took a bite out of, spit it out, and decided that I didnt care.
