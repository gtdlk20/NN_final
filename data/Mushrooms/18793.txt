9:20 (T+35) : Ravi Shankar was on. I started to feel the need to dance. I felt better. It was really enjoyable. I had the weird sensation of being one of these Indian women dancing to the sound of tablas and sitar. I am a man, but I felt like I was a woman. Weird but fun! Writing this on my diary, I realised that I was writing on it every 3 or 4 minutes. My god ! My time perception was already distorted.
