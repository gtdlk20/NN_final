With my eyes closed, I saw all sorts of odd patterns, although the strangest of which were what I thought were smiling faces that darted in and out of my perception.  Their smiles reminded me of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland.  It was creepy to say the least and bothered me much more when I was trying to maintain sobriety, but at this point I was no longer uncomfortable with the situation.  For the next 20 minutes, it felt as if there were demons all over me.  I had strange auditory hallucinations of things laughing at me mischieviously and more images of strange half-formed faces and movements in the corner of my eye, but I found myself calm and unafraid.  I was completely at home with the demons that, although, taunting me, I knew would not dare to actually touch me or enter my mind.  It was a strangely empowering experience.  In control of my mind again (kind of... in that shroomy kind of way) I was overcome by a sense of curiosity and mischief.  I turned out the lights and stood in the dark, watching the lights flicker and calmly waiting for something else to appear in my vision.  Although my vision was still shroomy and the lights weren't exactly holding still, no more faces or odd lights came at me.
