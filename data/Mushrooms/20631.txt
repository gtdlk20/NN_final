I really dislike the excuse that words simply fail when describing the psychedelic experience. Not remembering is understandable, but if you really don't know what words to use then it's simply a matter of learning and practice. Granted it's difficult sometimes, but with the right metaphors and a sufficient vocabulary, it's certainly possible. In fact, I would argue it's necessary. I regret to say that from this point on, I do not remember everything that happened anymore. Nevertheless, I will do my absolute best to describe the things I do remember. It is also around now that I completely lost track of time, although I admittedly have a pretty loose grasp on that to begin with. IÂ’ll continue to provide time-stamps but keep in mind these are only approximations.
