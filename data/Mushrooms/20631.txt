An acquaintance of mine asked me to grow him some mushrooms a little less then a year ago, I was surprised to find out that one gram is all that he uses, sometimes less like a half gram, he has commented on the strength of my shrooms, I have recently used as little as half a gram and it has quite some effect, however I need at least two grams for decent visuals.
