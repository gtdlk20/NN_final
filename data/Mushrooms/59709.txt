Sept. 22   So far I have kept the temp measured inside the box at a max of 93.0 and a min. of 75.6.  Both are a little extreme but it happened through experimentation and will not happen again.  The 93 was especially dangerous I know but it only happened in the box for maybe 5 min. before it dropped.  I am working on the assumption that the air temperature in the box is slightly higher than the temperature inside the jars.  Therefore it maybe at the most got to 91 in the jars, worst case scenario.  The recommended temperature for these spores by the spore supply company during mycelia growth is 84-86 and 74-76 during fruiting.  I am going to keep the growing chambers at room temperature inside the closet which appears through a weeks observation inside the terrarium appears to be between 76-81.    I have determined how I am going to control the temperature in the growing box.  I will use a heating pad under like 3 or 4 towels with the box the jars originally came in containing the jars.  With this setup I can maintain a constant temp no high than 88 no lower than 83.  With this I should be able to get a perfect temperature drop on their birthday.  Also today I took the jars out of the box for the first time to check growth.  Only one jar showed any growth, a Puerto Rican jar.  It only showed growth at one inoculation site but the growth there was massive but then, reaching from the top to the bottom of the jar.  Something worries me about this jar, the mold appears to be a slight grey color and seems to be showing up unusually fast.
