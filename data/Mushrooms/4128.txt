I remember a series of kaleidoscope-type visuals. By then I couldn't keep track of my physical body at all. I tried to blow my nose, and gave up because I couldn't relate the position of my hand to the position of the handkerchief that was within easy reach a moment before. I felt thirsty and said so, but I couldn't sit up to drink. It felt like very few minutes had passed since I took the medicine. I noticed that I needed to pee, and decided there was no point trying to get to the bathroom. I couldn't even tell whether I was already peeing or not, and I remember thinking, "Oh, well, I'm glad all movements of fluid are just normal, healthy life processes of the Gaia organism." I got a beautiful visual of a living, breathing Earth with water flowing around and through it, and at that point I fully let go of my physical body. I remember thinking that I might drown because I was so congested and so helpless in the physical realm, and deciding that even that was okay because I trusted the medicine.
