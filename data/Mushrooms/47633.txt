Some brief history; L and Junebug have been friends since kindergarten, Junebug and I since third grade. l and I met in 11th grade. Now A is what we call high maintainence and is too controlling to get along very well with hallucinagens. Wisely she chose to opt out of the trip. Okay? okay. Now, about three blocks from the house is a building known as the witches tower. So called because the roof of the tower looks like a pointed witches hat, clever right? It stands on a hill over looking a river and offers an awesome view of the Downtown Minneapolis skyline. we rolled some blunts, munched our mushies (2g), and marched to the tower, all but A, just before sunset.
