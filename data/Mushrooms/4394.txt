I tried another high dose of PE cubes (4.6g) and had so many thought loops- even double or triple reverse psychology whether I was fooling myself or not.  I suppose that doubt was something I had to work out to be able to let myself have access to the more conscious problems, such as motivation- which I felt locked out of before.  There was not much euphoria in the come down, it was kind of dull and I figured that these things might have to be worked out in a sober state.
