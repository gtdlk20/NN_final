I felt it almost immediately, within a few minutes of starting to drink it. The first thing I noticed was relaxation, followed by a sense that anything and everything was funny. Those could've come from relief at finally getting the session started, but I think it was the medicine itself. The first clearly psychedelic effect was a shift in my sense of space and my own body. I lay down and held my sitter's hand. The guide came back into the room briefly to put on some kind of classical music. The music turned things into dragons. My hand and the hand I was holding both looked and felt like dragon's claws, not in an unpleasant way at all, just definitely dragon and not human. The friend who'd told the frog joke showed up in frog form a few times during the session, though I myself was thoroughly not a frog. I laughed a lot about my non-frogness.
