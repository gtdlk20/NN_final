I had a rather powerful high-dose mushroom trip the other day, on the spring equinox. I am going to do my best to put it into words, accepting in advance the futility of the gesture. Words are simply my mind trying to impose Order and Reason on what was fundamentally an inexplicable experience, one beyond words. It was definitely a ++++ mystical experience that was filled with joy and wonder as well as its share of sinister and uncomfortable moments.
