It was a normal Monday morning when I woke up. I didn't have school because it was a holiday (presidents day or something, I don't remember). I was going to eat mushrooms with two of my friends. Although I have tripped three or four times previously on mushrooms, I was still anticipating the day. Between us, we had a 1/2 ounce of very good dried cubensis (from Eugene, I believe). My friends came over to my house at about 10am, and we split up the shrooms. We didnt not eat the whole 1/2 between us, but split up individual amounts on the scale. I ate 3.3g, my friend (who was also experienced tripper) ate 3 grams, and my other friend was doing it for the first time, so he only ate 2.2grams.
