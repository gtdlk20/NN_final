I was becoming very paranoid because R's room had tons of posters and Spanish architecture. Voices appeared in my head saying that I was going to stay in this state of mind forever and never recover. I kept on telling myself that I would be fine but the voices persisted. I looked at the walls and realized the posters on the wall were the voices talking to me. I needed to get out of the room. M was enjoying his experience so much that all he wanted to do was go out and explore. I agreed to join him because I needed to get out of the room. R apparently was too scared to get out of his bed so we left him there because he wouldn't budge.
