In this period, where I was walking the whole way, this is what happened.  My vision became actual tunnel-vision.  The tunnel kept shrinking, I could only see what was in the tunnel, and that was hallucinatory in any case.  Outside the 'walls' of the tunnel was absolute chaos.  Think of when you turn your TV to no channel, and there's static, except along with all the static, there's random images from throughout my life flickering through.  All the while, this tunnel was shrinking.  The sounds were bizarre.  I could hear the band, the constant beating of the drums, but other sounds came over the top and drowned the band out.  These sounds were chaotic too, they had no rhythm, no pattern, just random sounds.  Hundreds of them, all over the top of one another, all from various times in my life, some were tiny snippets, some were longer sounds.  They got louder and louder, and more chaotic, and it just ended up being a horrible mess of white noise and sound samples.  I lost sensation in my legs, arms, body, and finally I just felt like a floating head.
