We walked over to a bench where some other friends were drinking some beer, It was hard to drink beer right now, but I kept sipping on it. Everyone went to the car and left me alone for what I believed to be 20 minutes or so. I didn't care though, because I was staring at some trees, then I actually watched a tree grow, lose leaves, grow, then get huge and fall over, all this happened in about 20 seconds. It looked like one of those time lapse cameras, but over a period of a few hundred years, it was so beautiful. Everyone had gone home now, and it was me and one other guy, one of my best friends.
