At one point we sat down near some water. I was climbing on a tree trunk that bended oddly, the water. Then I went and sat with my girlfriend on a bench. I lit a joint I had already rolled and just as I did so, a group of little girls rode up to the tree I had been climbing on. They were three girls probably between the ages of 5 and eight. The five year-old road on the back of the 8 year-old's bicycle. I watched them scamper on the trunk while we smoked our joint. I felt a little guilty smoking a joint when children were so near, but we were in a park in Amsterdam so we finished the joint without any legal worries. We sat and chilled and the girls finally mounted their bikes to rides somewhere else.
