I heard D inside the house, and for some reason I became afraid that he might be in there injuring himself.  I also felt that I did not want to be tripping alone.  I walked into the house and called his name, and he came immediately.  I told him I wanted us to be together.  I think sometime around then he told me that he had told his wife one time that I was a sweet guy, and I felt good about that.
