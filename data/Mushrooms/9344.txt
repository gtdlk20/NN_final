Then I actually started feeling a bit unhappy. I guessed that indeed perhaps it was not such a good idea to take shrooms alone. What has become of me - home alone experimenting with drugs? It started seeming like a really bad idea, the shrooms were messing with my brain and I was looking forward to my trip just being over. The rowing helped, I could focus on the time I had been rowing and see it progress. Still I felt lonely, I missed my girlfriend and I was actually looking forward to my parents coming home. A couple of times I felt like I should just quit rowing, lie down and accept and sink into the dark feelings.
