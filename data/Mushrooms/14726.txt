This feeling continued for some time.  I was wide awake and enjoying the experience, but my boyfriend had slipped into a shallow sleep.  Unaware of this, I started talking to him.  Bad idea--he wasn't having pleasant dreams at all.  Somehow, me talking to him while in that state caused him to become irritated.  He tells me now that he didn't hear anything I was saying but was instead positive that I was criticizing him (I wasn't, much the opposite, in fact) while he was in the middle of a nightmare. As I tried to reassure him, he became increasingly annoyed and started to get mad, triggering confusion on my part.  From there it escalated until we were both pretty upset.  We were able to get it under control, but it wasn't very much fun at all.
