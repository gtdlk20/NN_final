I was still very happy and euphoric about five hours after eating the Stones, but I began to sense reality gradually encroaching upon my mind from about six hours onwards. I gradually felt more sober, and increasingly tired and burned out. Tripping is so intense that it feels like youve been awake for two days straight. Coming down was not very enjoyable, but it wasnt especially bad. I think if I had planned it better it would have been a bit easier. Sitting around not doing very much is probably not a good idea, because it makes it easier to get depressed and self-obsessed. I found talking about my experiences with my friends helped a lot, as did talking in general. Having things to do such as watching T.V., or listening to music, helped take my mind off coming down and made me less sad. However my happiness slowly left me and I got quite depressed. I was sad that my trip was over, and I missed my visuals, but emotionally my depression didnt really have any basis, it was just there. Reality was coming home and it wasnt a pretty sight.
