Im not sure exactly when all of these events occurred in relation to time, I just know that it occurred in that order. I felt like I lived 100 lifetimes but at the same time it went by so fast. I definitely got what I came for, being shown strength and the whole crystal mother and crystal me thing seemed too coincidental to be just tripping, but then again Im pretty spiritual. It was all too real for me to pass off as some drug fucking with my mind. Definitely a life changing experience for the better.
