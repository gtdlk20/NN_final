As I began boiling water, I carefully selected an hour and a half worth of music to play, mixing in some soft music with some songs that I consider essential for tripping (Radiohead, how I love thee).  When the water was finished boiling, I poured the mushrooms into a cup and poured water over them.  Now here, I think it is important to note that I made a total stoner move and forgot to cut/grind the mushrooms in any way.  I was completely unaware of my error and let the tea stew while I continued my pre-trip preparations.  After ten minutes, I strained the tea and prepared a second glass (still with whole mushrooms, I had yet to notice).  I put two sugar rock candies in the tea and took it to my room to sip on.
