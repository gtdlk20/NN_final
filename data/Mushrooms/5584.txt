We ended up in the bathroom, all three of us looking in the mirror and studying our faces.  My pupils appeared to be growing and shrinking freely, without any relation to each other.  The end of my nose grew longer, then swelled like it was being inflated, then returned back to normal.  All three of us thought we looked incredibly filthy, though in reality we looked normal.  W lay in his bathtub and I looked at the various toiletries in the pantry with fascination until R kicked us out.  It was now his turn to take a shroom shit, but at least the lucky bastard was able to crap in the comfort of a bathroom and wipe with toilet paper.
