The music was flowing and I felt emotions pass through me, like last time.  But at some point it got a bit uncomfortable.  My senses got so strong that I had the volume at 3 where normally 10 is needed to hear things clearly.  After a while music would occasionally repeat and/or slow down for me.  I started to feel like I should move onto more inner experience and stopped the music.  I kept the thought in my mind that I shouldn't try to control this, because I am looking to grow past where I am now.
