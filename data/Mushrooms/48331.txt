I had been in the woods all day, it was a pretty cold day, and I'd been working on a shelter I was building by myself all day. I decided to eat the mushrooms at the end of the day, as I was sleeping in the woods that night. I know them very well. I went up to a lookout to watch the sun set over my town and eat my mushrooms.  I sat there for a while, all the time anticipating the start of my experience if there was to be one.  It pretty much all started when I stood up from meditating over the view. I had not noticed very much up to that point, the lights looked a little brighter, but I couldn't feel anything strong.
