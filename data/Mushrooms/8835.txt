My friend Addie* and I decided we would shroom together for the first time of our Winter Break (Just under an eighth each).  Im very careful about who I choose to shroom with because I dont think everyone is cut out to take them.  From personal experience Ive grasped that it is extremely mentally based, if a person seems too nervous, too wound up, scared or mentally not completely stable, I wont even think about shrooming with them.  Positive vibes throughout a trip are very important so we have to go into together and comfortable with each other.  Addie is a very chill girl so I knew it wouldnt be a problem.
