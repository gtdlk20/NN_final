The wind was blowing so softly, and the air was perfect. Not cold, nor too warm. We walked through paths, and through trees, Where, I felt as if I was an ant. The Trees grew hundreds of feet tall, and I didn't feel superior anymore, A little bit of paranoia maybe? But thats what I love about shrooms. The feeling of awareness.
