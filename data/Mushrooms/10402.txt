60 - 80 min: We decide to go away from the music. Standing up after sitting down for a while is really hard and I feel like 250 pounds. The visuals are so overwhelming (one of many things I see is people are 'breaking down' to pieces) and the air feels so thick I can barely walk. It feels like something is boiling under my skin and anything I touch is shaking. It's not scary though, just genuinely weird and quite interesting. My friend A is laughing almost constantly but I'm having trouble laughing. For me the experience is more 'interesting' than funny, so I walk around with either a smile on my face or gaping open-mouthed with excitement.
