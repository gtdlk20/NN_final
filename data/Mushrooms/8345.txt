-Religions contain a grain of truth in the form of metaphor. The bible, though twisted, came out of us because its inside us. Its the knowledge of where we came from, where we are going, and how to get there. Once, we, god, were animals, and it was good to fight and eat and take. It was a necessary step on the road to figuring out the pieces of the puzzle that allowed us to master living in the world, and free our minds to work toward what perfection might be like. Religion tries to get at this but fails to capture the majesty of it, and I think people are finally catching on to this. Any actual truths from holy books are already inside you, dont be lazy trying to get the point from what is essentially the cliffnotes.
