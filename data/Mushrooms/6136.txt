At this point my plans to jump on my bike and ride anywhere were no longer.  A lot of feelings and emotions were overwhelmingly drowning me.  I could not differenciate between what was real and what was not.  Scared out of my mind I decided to lay down on the couch and try to go to sleep.  Guess again!!!! Sleep was the furthest thing from my reach.  As I lay there eyes closed and a prisoner in my own mind, I get the most overwhelming feeling that I am being watched.
