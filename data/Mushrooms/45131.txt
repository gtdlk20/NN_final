I tell D to put on some jimi hendrix to sooth me as I start to feel a stong force. For some reason D wants to go inside his bedroom to listen to slightly stoopid. As I enter the room, the lighting darkens a little bit and I begin to feel 'wavy'. Laying on the bed, I feel as if my body is being stretched across the bed, melting into it. I quickly sit up and stare around.....this is where the fun begins.
