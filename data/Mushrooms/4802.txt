On my fourth trip I was sitting on a couch with in my friends living room. In the middle of a conversation I felt my edges become warm and begin to blur. Soon I felt as though the couch's four wooden legs were legs of my own and I could feel them resting on the hard wooden floor. Then the sensation began to creep to extend to the entire floor and it was as though I could feel the furniture sitting on me and peoples feet as they walked. Although the sensation did not spread any further, I felt intensely grounded, as though my physical being was not truly separate from the rest of the world. I felt what is commonly described as being one with the Universe.
