LSD-25 is hard to find these days, but nature has provided a noble alternative in the magic mushroom. I decided that I would try these instead of Clearlight. Perhaps this would provide the alternate view needed to understand this tension. So, on a cold and sunny December morning in 2013, while alone in my cabin on the shore, I slowly chewed over 4 grams of dried psilocybin mushrooms.
