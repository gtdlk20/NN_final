We finally arrived at 5 pm Saturday. I was a bit tired so I immediately made a large cup of coffee. Then there was nothing better to do, so we figured we might as well take the shrooms. We had actually planned to use 3.5 grams for two seperate experiences each, but it was spring break and we had a spacious cabin to ourselves in the middle of a beautiful landscape, and it wasn't long before my friend convinced me to ingest the full 7 grams. We re-arranged and set up the objects in the cabin to make it more comfortable, and by the time everything was ready it was 6 pm. I wanted to be tripping balls by the time the sun set, so me and my companion grabbed a bag of chips and started the horrible task of eating the dry fungi.
