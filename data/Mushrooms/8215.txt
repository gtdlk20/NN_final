By this time I was experiencing the most vivid hallucinations whether my eyes were open or shut and the faint moonlight outside the window was a part of the immersive place that I was now visiting.  Looking around I found myself on the surface of the most incredible and beautiful planets.  Some of them 'garden planets' - planets where civilisations had either terra-formed the whole thing or had left the planet and its ecology completely untouched.  There only to be experienced and revered as sacred and ancient.
