Matt, Rob, and I shared something at the Rock that no one else could ever comprehend because it was ours.  Even as I finish with this description of my experience and re-read it I understand that my ponderings and realizations could never be told to another human being with the same depth and clarity of understanding that I experienced on that Rock.  I apologize for my bastardized retelling of the raw emotion and comprehension that completely engulfed me that wonderful afternoon.  The only thing I can tell you to do is to find your own Rock, and get in touch with your own existence.
