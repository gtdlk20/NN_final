I think the trouble began the night before when I decided to watch Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem for a Dream'.  It's an excellent movie, the only problem is that its main theme is the degradation of human existence due to drugs.  I already had a question or two in my mind about where drugs were taking my life, and this movie didn't help any.
