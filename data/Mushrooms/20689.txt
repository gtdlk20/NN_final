Well to cut a long story short I eventually found about 200 liberty caps. On the night of 23 Dec 2012 I ground them into a powder using a coffee grinder. This gave me 5 heaped teaspoons of mushroom powder. I put 4 teaspoons of this powder into a small cup of hot water and drank it up. I did not have the courage to take that fifth spoon.
