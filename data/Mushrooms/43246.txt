Now the house, whenever we have trips in my house we stay in the basement. It is darker more of our territory. When we step in the upper floors it is my mother's territory. We step there in respect, give few words to my mother but we make it a point to be polite (so she'll keep allowing my friends to come by), we go everywhere in respect and slow and not loud and so on. Now I was alone...
