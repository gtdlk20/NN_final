After convincing me they were harmless and I would love them, we picked a huge amount (like half a glad trash bag) and headed to his house.  Trip went to the kitchen, boiled some water, put about 12  shrooms in and after 4 min's, took them out, added Kool Aid, and served me my first dose of new reality.  He told me it would take about 30 min's to set in and we left for the movies.
