Last night I decided to trip for my first time despite the warnings I've received about bad trips, people being scared their first time, tripping alone, etc. Frankly I knew I would be ok. I broke up half of an eighth into really small pieces, and chewed and swallowed some by themselves, and washed pinches of the stuff down like pills with sprite. It took maybe fifteen minutes to get this done. I got in the shower and listened to some music for a while as I bathed. Not much happened for about half an hour, although I did notice some extremely small effects, such as pupil dilation and rounder doors.
