Cory or Goopstar noted that the altar was looking disharmonious and in need of being rearranged. Where are my glasses? I asked, as I put my hand down, squashing them. Im really calling in nothing happening to my glasses, that they remain safe here! Although, I realized that glasses didnt actually exist, and that ultimately whatever happened to them, didnt really matter. They were indestructible in their existence/non-existence.
