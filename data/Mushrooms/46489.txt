Another baloon of nitrous revealed that I was actually quite high, as my vision turned into amazing colourful patterns. I was excited about this, and decided to return to the party I was at so I could talk with some friends. By the time I got back to the party, I was acting ridiculous. People constantly asked me if I was drunk, and told me that I should probably quiten down a little. I lowered my voice a little, and began to enjoy the trip. The effects reminded me slightly of a cross between LSD and MDMA, as I had been told they would. Having experienced other mushrooms in the past, I can safely say these feel radically different, and personally I enjoy them alot more. The hallucinations generally consited of a whole lot of colourful bubbles I could always see in front of my eyes. Patterns seemed to jump about if I looked at them for more than a few seconds. I began to feel extremely empathogenic, and had a desire to hold and hug people, as with ecstasy, however the feeling was alot more psychedelic. Throughut the night, I kept trying to work out exactly what the effects were, but it was very diffiult, I felt so natural on the drug and I could only loosely compare its effects to E and LSD. This feeling was unlike either of thenm, but they are the only grounds I have to compare them to.
