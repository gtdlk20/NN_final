(For my chronic back pain, I take percocet (oxycodone, 30mg) and Methodone (10mg), plus some muscle relaxers, but the oxys and Methodone were the only other drugs I was on.  They seemed to have no added effect to the experience (the other times I have shroomed, I was not on any painkillers), and J was not on anything else.  We both had 2-3 beers about an hour or 2 before shrooming.  I just wanted to add what other substances we had in our systems.
