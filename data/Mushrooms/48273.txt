It was grade 9 for me, and I had become increasingly more curious about how certain drugs worked, especially mushrooms. I had a few friends who I had grown up with but sort of lost contact with when we entered high school, and I had just started to become friends with them again. They started to tell me that they had done quite a few drugs including weed, ecstasy, ketamine, and mushrooms, and wondered if I would like to try any. I thought about it, and I had already smoked pot before, so I thought I would stick with the organic drugs, seeing as how I thought they were safer.
