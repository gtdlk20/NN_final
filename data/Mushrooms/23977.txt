It was only once I settled down in bed with my laptop (aptly) on my lap that I was truly entrenched in the experience: as I was watching the screen I developed intense tunnel vision, the walls of which were covered in LSD-like psychedelic patterns, swirling and bulging back and forth. As I was typing away to A, describing my experiences, I saw a colourful man-like creature stretching and extending across the wall to my right as though made of rubber, seemingly reaching for something behind me. Soon after this, I sank into a trip where my room morphed into what appeared to be a night guardÂ’s hut in an office complex or similar. I also took the chance at this point, as I stumbled to the bathroom, to take a look in the bathroom mirror: my skin was swirling and rearranging but my face, containing two enormous pupils and a smiling mouth, still looked somehow smooth and clear.
