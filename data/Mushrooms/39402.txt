And then it dawns on me.  This is The Conversation Game, and I have forgotten the rules.  I know it's a game we play a lot, and most of the time I don't think about it as a game, just as communication, but in this social setting I realize it IS a game:  it's all about getting a word in edgewise, bringing up a bright point before someone else beats you to it, getting your idea out on the table before the topic gets changed. Later, I realize that what was really going on was a pleasant conversation between myself and my friends, but I had become acutely aware of the social mores that govern our interactions, and perceived this set of rules as The Conversation Game.  I was thankful that I had been able to experience this among friends, because if it had occured in a conversation that really DID revolve around one-upping other people and ego-tripping, it probably would have seemed like a very unfriendly game.
