I remember sitting on my bed and getting increasingly annoyed at the music that was playing, so I got up and went and turned my stereo off. Just as I had re positioned myself on the bed, the music started again and I had to get up and turn it off. This annoyed me greatly as i thought my friends kept turning the stereo on, but I learned later that I had hallucinated the whole thing. The saga went on for about ten minutes as I repeatedly turned the stereo off only for it to start playing again. This eventually stopped happening and I was relieved. The trip was becoming a bit intense. I became very offense, insulting my friends then immediately apologising afterwards. I felt my mind split into two separate personalities, one evil and one good. The evil side of me kept calling W a fat bastard and then the good side of  me would immediately apologise and blame it on the evil side. I was genuionley horrified that I was being so nasty to my friend, but unfortunately I had no control over what I was saying. Thankfully my friend was cool about it and he knew what I was doing was due to the drugs.  Again, I completely zoned out for another 10 minutes or so.
