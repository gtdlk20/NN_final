In conclusion, this trip was very much different than my first trip. It was more of an intellectual journey than a visual journey. Since that trip M and I are much better friends. We bonded so much that he is almost like my brother. We also agreed to stop doing any hard drugs. R's dad found out that he did the shrooms that night and called both M and my parents. He doesn't believe that we did shrooms but he did make us explain some stuff. Also a big thing I learned was that everyone has different reactions to shrooms and even though people may be experienced with psychedelics they still have bad trips. M and I had just the right amount of shrooms to have a good time but R being a lightweight had a little too much and had one of the most horrible experiences of his life. I do believe I will try shrooms again but it won't be for at least a few months.
