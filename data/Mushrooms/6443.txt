11:20 P.M. - After listening to some songs to myself for a few minutes I began to feel fine again and we decided to take the rest of the shrooms so we could begin our dream. The only problem was that we had lost one of the bags! We began looking for it but we kept losing focus and forgetting what we were looking for. One minute we would be furiously looking and worrying and the next minute we would be laughing and talking about random things and how amazing our futures were going to be.
