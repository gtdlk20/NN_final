So, I decided to walk into the forest and hang out until things started to 'change'.  About 30 minutes in, I noticed a kind of dizzy feeling coming on.  Shortly after, I started to feel like laying down on a rock in the path.  I started to hear a bird chirping strangely as if it were surround sound and with a mysterious echo.  I soon realized that I was being eaten by mosquitoÂ’s and decided to go back to the cabin to find the mosquito spray.
