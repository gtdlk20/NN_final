By the time he arrived, I was tripping harder than ever. I wanted to talk to him about energy, and the inaccuracy of time and things like that, but my other friend was not in the same spiritual mood for this sort of debate. We knew we had to get out of the apartment, so he told us to get ready to go hiking. The strangest part of this was that when I was putting my shoes on to go hiking, it felt like my feet kept disappearing. I could see them, but it felt like they would disappear, and then suddenly reappear. It was a little scary, but because my friend who came to take care of us was so experienced, I didn't want to seem like a wuss in front of him and kept this to myself.
