33- The isolated cake is A-OK. In fact, I pulled 2 shrooms off of it today so [Joe Blow] could try some over the holidays. It seems to be all healed up, and I see no reason to not put it back into the grow chamber. The other shrooms are just huge. In fact, I picked about 15-20 shrooms off the cakes because they were mature enough to eat. (the veils had ruptured)
