The next morning, I felt a certain sense of peace within me, a commonly reported after-effect of the drug. I knew it certainly wasnÂ’t the afterglow that would come with the full experience. Perhaps it was no more than my mind playing tricks on me once again, psychologically feeling wiser at its discovery of something new. Whatever it was, it was there and it was something positive so I tried to hold on to the feeling for as long as I could. I tried to allow myself to stay more open-minded.
