I continued to shroom for another six hours, the visuals stopped nine hours after I started the tea, the changes in sound stopped after ten hours. The next three hours I had the nice after shroom buzz, where I feel very stoned and still have the giggles. Im sure the whole experience would have lasted longer than the thirteen hours it did, but I was spent. All the walking around and activity had taken its toll on me and I went to sleep.  The next day I had to re-walk the entire area to learn where things were. What can I say, when Im shrooming, I dont get a good sense of direction, especially in a new place as large as that was.
