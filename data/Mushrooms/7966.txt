I decide the next course of action was to make it to the remote-seeming toilet block and throw up the mushrooms. As I tip-toed my way through the tracer firework display of the grass and flowers (my night vision was on point to say the least) I became aware of an insistent background chatter, a somewhat repetitive chant on the edge of my awareness. I became aware of an insistent background chatter, a somewhat repetitive chant on the edge of my awareness. I knew this distant crowd sound was entirely internal, but it didnÂ’t seem familiar to me as an individual. It was like hiding under the covers late at night and finding some bizarre broadcast on some long-forgotten frequency on an old radio. The chattering voices themselves sounded cartoonish, high-pitched...not like children but rather the three imps from the Snap Crackle and Pop RiceCrispie cereal commercial. And they were not forming words in English; they were taking turns in making whoop, bringgg, zippp! noises. It sounded playful and mischievous. At this point I had the impression that if I was to interact with another human they would be convinced of my irreparable lunacy and would take me away in a van.
