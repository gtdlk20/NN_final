The warmth of the notebook on my lap. the focus and every with which I interract with everything I wish I knew this keyboard better because it is a limited way to express myself because I know I am not hitting the correct keys all of the time. Howver, I am getting better, I beleive with every passing second. I know I am working harder to hit the correct keys, and it seems easier than before to do the right thing and let my hands wander over the keys but how to harness this kind of energy... not really any way... its just something you can experience. but then you have to let it go. Intersting as hell. So many inhibitions completely gone. I can type this and know I WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK AT IT LATER... BUT PARTS OF MY BRAIN ARE WATCHING THE REST OF THE WORD (Damn!) Or rather, are watching what I am doing instead of just GOING with it.... there's always this 'EGO' observer of what you are doing and making sure it's okay. Somehow part of that is somewhat disconnected when I type like this because I can just let everything go and keep things going... the hands are now the observer recording wherever my mind is (just closd my eyes) however the world pulsates... a fish swimming.. silver... angles jumpsuit THIS IS SO FUNNY TO REREAD EVEN NOW!!!!!!! heheheheh! it will be nice to rest thgouh.. the effort that must come into taking an LSD trip where you are on the road for HOURS AND HOURS. I am somewhat exhausted by all this... but it's ok. The lightening outside is VERY surreal... the light from the notebook demands attention but the outside clouds swarm by the two trees (I couldn't write this way straight, because I wouldn't be able to suitably let go of that ego thing I WAS THINKING ABOUT EARLIER.)
