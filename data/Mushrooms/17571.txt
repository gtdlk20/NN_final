I was petrified by the time my dad came home.  I knew for sure that he would be able to tell that something was up.  Fortunately, he was too tired to notice anything was wrong.  After he went to bed, I was alone with my demented thoughts.  Everything began to look like eyes...the little wholes in my jeans, the tiny ones in my speakers, the triangular designs on my carpet - everything.  I felt as though I no longer existed because of all of these spying things looking straight through me.  Nothing made sense.  I had no way of telling what was real from what my delusional mind was creating.
