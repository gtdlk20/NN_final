Im not sure how long this went on for. Feeling the normal passage of time and the normal experience of my living space had fully disappeared for a while. I was completely wrapped up in this cathartic experience of wholeness and coming together. Eventually, I could feel the vision fading and I got very sad because I worried I would lose my connection to this moment and never experience anything like it again. I dont know if I said it aloud or not but I pleaded with the voice not to leave me and that I was afraid to be without its guidance. It reassured me as it was drifting away that it has always been with me, it is always with me, and will always be with me. It told me I dont need to be afraid because what I see as me and whatever Ive ever thought of as god are the same thing. Its said I can do anything I really want.
