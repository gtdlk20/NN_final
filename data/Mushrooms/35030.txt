3 noticed that I was looking at him in an odd way so I then looked at 2. 2 looked back at me and smiled, as he smiled horns began to form from his hair and he took on a very demonic look. I then interrupted 1 saying something to say, Dude, lets get out of here, that trees getting all over 3s car and it was. The tree was drooping horribly and began to melt onto the car. As this happened the car was not damaged but the tree seemed to become a moving image painted onto the car. All three laughed at this statement and we began to load into the car. We left at I dont recall any driving but suddenly we were standing beneath on a large stage at the park and 1 was climbing a steel cable holding the ceiling, which was a large white tarp. The time was around 7:30, everything was very wavy and the trees were swaying unreasonably for the small amount of wind there was.
