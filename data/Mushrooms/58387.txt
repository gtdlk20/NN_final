Goat-eyed now breathing in and out the whole verge of woods and desert, I see with predictable clarity and wonder the grey-green of ponderosas against vermillion cliffs and distant peaks. The blue bruise, the tawny dark-ringed cap, the nest of drying manure, all looked right. And my mood of maybe-fatal heedlessness suggested I should eat it. So I look back a half hour at my sad sad self in the just-grazed meadow, stooping under my pack and plucking the manure-flecked caps, and running my nail across the stems and watching them bruise blue, and taking a handful and half-chewing them and washing them down with my last Heineken, and now I am here at the verge of woods and desert in the riptide of profundity. The whole vista bleeds its color into me but loses no color. I name the scene turkeyhead because it is flushed with color that reveals a kind of sexual pulse not usually seen in trees and rock. I have my notebook, my walking food, my pistol, and I know circumstances back home brought me here with these things with the idea of writing a long note to the girls and stepping off some edge but I am scarcely able to maintain this thought.
