Now, this begs the question. Would I really have drowned myself in the bathtub? I dont think so. Having the thought of drowning myself in the bathtub and actually doing it are two very different things. Although I thought I might just stay under water until dead, feeling my soul separate from my body, I dont think I could have actually gone through with it. I feel I was very well looked after, by forces both seen and unseen, during this trip, and that I was simply undergoing a symbolic death/rebirth experience. I think had I actually stuck my head under water, that some more primitive survival circuitry would have taken over and moved me out of the water. And my friends certainly wouldnt let me drown either.
