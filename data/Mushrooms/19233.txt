No one wanted to eat the snow. Come on, guys, I know you want to eat the snow. Because its water, and its melting because thats what water is, its beautiful and we love water. Water loves us! But water doesnt even exist! By now I was really diving deep, into a space that, upon sober reflection after the experience, was rather delusional. I was totally convinced, that before the trip ended, everyone would have to eat the snow. Otherwise our group unity would be shattered. I knew with absolute certainty they would all eat the snow eventually.
