We turned on music (White Zombie - Astro Creep 2000) and simply watched everything move and bend. Pictures on the wall came to life and strange patterns began developing, covering everything. These patterns were the most interesting part of my trip. IÂ’ve heard of alot of people seeing mushrooms and whatnot. I saw letters. Mostly J and M, but several others were there. They were small, no more than an inch tall, and they all seemed to be part of one another. Every single surface I looked at seemed to have these patterns of letters embossed all over them, these letters persisted throughout the trip all the way up to the end.
