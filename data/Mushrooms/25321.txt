T-1:30--We were probably still peaking at this point. Cold, sweaty, hard to walk at first. We finally hit what feels like the top, then we drop a little. Jim stands up (we've been sitting staring for about 45 minutes) and exclaims 'Woah! We can DO things!' so we walk about, still tripping VERY hard. We were at the tip of the peak for at least 10 minutes, which was hard to handle. We were walking in a straight line, and could talk with each other very well. In fact, if the passerby overheard us they would probably think nothing was wrong with us.
