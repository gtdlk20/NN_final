I realised randomly a lot of other things. Psychedelic songs are prayers. They relate the story of God in various ways. I realised also that I might move in an ashram to dedicate my life to God. Those people living there have understood before what I just realised now. They spread love all around the world. I realised also that religions that use any kind of violence will fall, because they're FIGHTING for God and you can't fight for God. You just have to love. Praying is loving.
