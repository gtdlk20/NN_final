I obtained the mushrooms about a week in advance, for 20 dollars and eighth, and spent the week deciding how they would be administered safely. I finally made plans with my friend, lets call him E, to ride my bike out to his pad at dawn and dose them just as the sun rose. I spent the previous night dicing up my dried shrooms and grinding them into easily digestible powder, as the smell of them indicated that I would not enjoy chewing them raw.
