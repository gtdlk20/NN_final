I zoned out then and began having dark and paranoid thoughnts that I was ill and dying of imagined diseases and illneses. Fear grabbed me from below and pulled me down itno its sticky world. I was scared and tripping even harder. In desperation I called a friend. He calmed me down and we chatted randomly for ages. I kept saying to myself I was okay and it was over and I wasnt tripping anymore. It seemed to work and soon I was nealry fine again.
