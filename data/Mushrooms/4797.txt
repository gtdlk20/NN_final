I generally held the position as the responsible one among my more reckless friends, and on this occasion I had made it very clear to the group that this was going to be my first trip and that I could not act as trip sitter. Instead another friend, well call him Michael, assumed the role. He chose to remain sober and was trained as an EMT and lifeguard. This would have worked out wellexcept for his inexperience with drug culture. Another friend, who well call Josh, got heavily absorbed into his trip and tumbled off the couch on which he had been lying. He claimed that he was fine, and that he had just been trippin out, but Michael was convinced that Josh had suffered a seizure and was increasingly alarmed at the other symptoms that are generally considered normal side effects such as dilated pupils, cold clammy hands, and difficulty articulating full coherent thoughts.
