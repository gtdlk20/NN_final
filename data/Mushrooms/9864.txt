This is the first time that I have ever done shrooms inside. I am usually wandering around some beautiful outdoors location. We have small children and I have promised myself that they will never see me shrooming. My wife and I enjoyed shrooms on new years day but we have never since been able to get away from the kids (together). I have just realised we can do it right here in our bedroom when the kids are asleep. I start to have fun and enjoy myself then I look over at the remaining 3rd of the brew. I have never had a second helping before once I am up the thought of eating anything is mildly repulsive but eat more mushrooms yuk no way. Mushrooms have powerful appetite suppressant qualities.
