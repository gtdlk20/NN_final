We went to my freind's house since there was a park nearby and we wanted to go to the park.  We packed some music and a blanket.  We took St. John's Wart since we had recently read an article about MAOI's.  We each took a very heavy dosage and washed it down with water at about 6:30.  In fact, we took so much St. John's that we got messed up off of that and started to contemplate wether we needed to eat mushrooms to have fun that night.  But in honor of our weekend tradition, we ate the mushrooms.  At 7:30 we ate.  I ate 5g raw in about 5 minutes.  I put 1 gram in my mouth and chewed it with my gum without swallowing.  I felt the onset within 15 minutes so it takes the edge off coming up.
