I ate the sacrament around 8 at night in my bedroom and went out on my porch and smoked a small joint in my hammock. I usually don't smoke before my trip but I was a little too nervous to be doing this trip alone and needed to smoke that feeling away. I layed there in my hammock looking at the beautiful california sky for about 30 minutes. I then got too cold and headed inside, layed on my bed and began meditating with a lit candle in front of me on the other side of my room.
