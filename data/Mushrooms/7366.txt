In an unusally short time, about 15 minutes, several of my friends were already uttering those famous first words of any trip: Oh shit, Im starting to feel something.  In a few minutes I found myself saying the same thing.  I had made my way inside;  thankfully the security system was figured out and I could rest peacefully on the couch as the first blissful waves of an amazing body high overcame me.  I tried to let myself relax and let the mushrooms take over, as I have found that thinking too much, in general and especially dealing with shrooms, only seems to complicate and put undo strain on what is, and should be at all times, an amazing experience.  I stared at the hardwood ceiling and it seemed to me that writhing bodies were just on the other side of the wood, writhing and clawing against it.  I suppose that it couldve freaked me out, but I was just too engulfed in staring to care.  I joined my friends outside and listened to my friend Rob, lead guitarist in our band, play music.  After a short time listening to the music, Rob and I, along with my friend Matt, decided to leave the cabin and go exploring.  We were the experienced trippers;  everyone who stayed at the cabin were either shrooming for the first time, or going balls out for the first time.
