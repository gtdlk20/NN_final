There was a moment where I also said in a state of tolerance, You have to let go. I said this in such a state of love and forgiveness as Mom and as Me Lying in the Bed/Inner Self. I can only assume this was aimed at the potential parasitic life-forms that have cause me sleep paralysis for 23 years, but that is another story. Or perhaps She was simply telling me to let go of this reality, or detach as Buddhists say. Or it could have been something else as I will relate at the end of this account.
