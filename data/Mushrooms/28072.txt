I made some mushroom chocolates the night prior with some real Belgian chocolate. 100% easiest time I've ever had eating mushrooms hands down. I was legit trying to taste the mushrooms in it. Impossible. CouldnÂ’t taste it at all! I personally despise eating mushrooms as is. It's a long torturous process that brings on violent gut rot. The texture hurts my soul. So 2 grams of the chocolate went down no problem which was a really nice start. I ate it at about 7:30pm. I finished up tidying the apartment and lit some candles and incense. Had some rain sounds playing on the computer and sat on the side of my bed moisturizing my legs with some pretty heavenly stuff called Karma from Lush.
