As I started to come down, I was overcome with an extreme since of lonliness.  It was not the typical fearful lonliness.  It was just a sense of singular purpose in the universe.  In the months since this experience, I have thought about it extensively.  I have several things about myself.  In my life, I tend to create self defeating loops for myself.  By this I mean that I attempt to manipulate sitations to my benefit, but I do it in such a way that it actually inadvertantly damages me.  I spend too much time blaming the effects in my life, without examining the causes.  Virtually all my decisions have been made to allow me to follow the path of least resistence.  This is not the way I wish to live my life.
