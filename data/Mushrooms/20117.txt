Back to normal, I left the museum and wandered around a bit until I found myself standing on a footbridge over the highway.  The sun was setting behind me, and I just stood and looked out over the city as I contemplated everything I had just been through.  My trip was a very powerful experience, and I consider it to be one of the key events in my life that define me as a person.  I plan to trip again in a month, once my final exams are over.
