T+2:20: All hell breaks loose. We finally get to really dance. The dancing is fast and an intense feeling of euphoria rushes over me. I feel so close to S, as I always do, but right now I get to experience the physical closeness as well as the emotional attachment that I have. I can sometimes see people give us looks because we are clearly enjoying this dance way more than the sober people. We move over to our friends, who are rolling pretty hard on ecstasy, and our other friends who are drunk and on Klonopin. The group of us is in the middle, and everything is flowing over me. I dont even really hear the music, I just feel the motion. I am following Ss movements and I eventually bury my face in her hair and absorb the essence of the her and in turn the alternate reality of the mushroom trip.
