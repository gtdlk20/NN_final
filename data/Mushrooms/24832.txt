From there it was all somewhat of a blurr.  As I remember coming up higher, we wandered through our canyon/forestry and slowly we were becoming more and more connected with all the plants and natural surroundings, at one point I said  'B, I feel like we are man-animals.'  He naturally agreed with this, seeing as we were wondering about the forest, and we both had the idea that there was something great coming up beyond our sight of the forest path, and as I think back, I realize that the whole thing was an enjoyable experience.
