Although it was a very intense and at times unpleasant experience, I still feel that I learned a lot from it. I had an adventure through space and time that I never knew was possible. I came face to face with my own mortality and feel that I am a little more prepared. And above all, I realized that even though the trip was all a big hallucination, that reality and life and death is still much crazier than it seems, and there is something incredible going on. I was amazed at how totally out of touch with reality those mushrooms had gotten me. I hadnÂ’t known where I was, who I was, or what was going on. It was like having an incredible dream, a dream in which you get what you had always wanted. And then waking up and realizing it wasn't true, it was all a dream. That is how I felt as I was coming down from this experience. It actually disturbed me a little to realize anything could put me in such a distorted state. And that is why I will never eat a quarter of mushrooms again. Well... at least not anytime soon.
