During the return walk I felt fairly uncomfortable about returning to the concert.  By this time I could understand what had earlier occurred and was well aware of the scene that I had made.  The last thing I wanted was to cause another stir upon my reentry.  My nervousness quickly disappeared when the waves of glorious music began to roll over me once again.  It was as if I had accidentally been detoured from my original course in the early stages of my trip and had taken a poorly-charted, steep, and rocky short-cut to find my way back. I had come full circle, and was finally resting in the comfortable, euphoric, and highly energized state of mind that I had initially enjoyed at the very start of the concert.
