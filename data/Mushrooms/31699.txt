Around this time, my best friend was interested in psychedelics. We began to discuss the different possibilities outside of organized structured religion (something I had never done before).  Threw our discussions and a couple low dose mushroom trips (2-3g) I came to the conclusion that I should think for myself and decide what I think based upon my own experiences. I also decided that these psychedelics are a good place to start in my quest of truth and renewal.  At this point my best friend, lets call him j, had moved to my city for school. Him, along with 4 other guys rented a house near their school. Because I come from a christian home I have never been allowed to get intoxicated at home. Therefore when I was 18 I spent a lot of time at this house with all the guys. Eventually I introduced my other friend (we'll call him T) to my best friend J. T and J got along very well and J ended up invited T to the house. Long story short, T ended up moving into the house. Shortly after all of the original members of the house including J dropped out and moved back home. Now only T permanently resides at the house.
