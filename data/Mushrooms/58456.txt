Ever since my first encounter with mushrooms, plants and trees now have some unseen beauty that I have never realized before.  Staring at flowers, they seem to be somewhat alive and able to move around. The colors of everything magnified 10 fold. Everyone else seemed to be coming down after about 4 hours. They decided to go get pizza, since no one had eaten prior to the trip. My body felt hungry but the mushrooms wouldn't allow me to eat.  When we arrived at the restaurant it was difficult reading the menu as the letters looked as if they were jumping around on the page, so I ordered a regular being as that it was the simplest at the time.  Upon receiving my slice the cheese looked as if it was looking back at me.  I picked apart at it being because of stomach cramps.  The end of the day was nearing and the view of the sunset was a vivid detail of this trip.  The rays of the sun and the pink and orange shades made the sky look like I had never seen it before.
