Surprisingly, at this point, time seemed to lose all importance. All I knew was that everything made sense to me, and nature was tear-jerkingly beautiful. Nausea was there, but more as an annoyance than anything.  We climbed the hill that was the apex of the park, it had a beautiful view, and that's when I noticed everything had a slightly rosy tint to it, and looking towards the south, towards the foothills, I noticed the trees slowly swaying. Then the hill started to ripple and looked as if it was made out of jello. Closing my eyes, I was greeted with an intense catacomb of red tunnels.
