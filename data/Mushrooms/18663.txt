I did have times of weeping and times of ecstasy. The ancient mantras - laughter is good medicine, and crying is good for the soul - are still around for a reason. I think it was beneficial to get my emotions supercharged, since normally I don't weep and I just as rarely have moments of pure explosive joy.
