I didnt want to get back in bed, it was too miserable.  By this time we were becoming a little more lucid; she went to the restroom again and I followed to the door, saying I didnt feel I should let her go alone.  When she returned to bed, I sat on the edge of the bathtub, where I could see her in bed, and I felt pretty comfortable.  I think this started about 8:30 PM.
