I think I started to leave this place and start to gain a more conceptual view of what was going on because instead of those strange impressions I had flashbacks of feelings and mental images I from my childhood, that I had long forgotten. I started to think about my father and our shabby relationship, and feeling regret at my lack of effort to help fix it. Then I thought of my ex-girlfriend and I realized that I truly did love her and that I missed her with all my heart, and I thought about my mother and blah, blah, blah regret, regret, regret. Basically it all ended with an I wish I could tell them goodbye or how I felt before I die.
