Three hours had passed, and metabolism had decreased the level of my confused perception, yet the doors were left open. I remained stuck in the millions of neuronal pathways opened by such a simple molecule, and I struggled to answer the slowing bombardment of questions. Not only did the answer seem more abstract than the questions by the minute, but both became more irrelevant. Hours of this perceptive cocktail had worn out my mental comprehensive capacity. I no longer found this declining state so profound, as it was replaced by my human need to sleep and return to normality. Visual alterations still occurred, yet they werent accompanied by the former ideas.
