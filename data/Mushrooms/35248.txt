During the break, I stood around with my usual group. One particular friend was told that I was tripping. He grabbed me by the shoulders, and told me that I was a human being, from the planet Earth, and that I had taken a psychedelic drug. This calmed me down. I saw that this was true, and stopped acting like a fish. (Or... I thought I was acting like a fish...)
