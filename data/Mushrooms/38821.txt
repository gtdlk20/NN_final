It all started nice enough, I decided to do some cyanescens mushroom together with a good friend. I was a bit worried about if it would work because two days before I had had a small dose of cubensis (apr. 2 grams). I was wrong. I had done some preparing, mainly concentrating towards the mushroom, reading, South American mythology, drawing and I asked the prince of flowers for guidance.
