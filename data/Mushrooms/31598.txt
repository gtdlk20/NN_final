Soon after we turn the music off, chat for a bit and head back. I was coming down, even though the patterns were still visible and eyes still stood and watched. We head back to the campsite and I sit in my hammock, I get a feeling of discomfort being back in my own body but this changes when Jim comes up and talks to me. He treated me like a real person and wasnt worried about saying anything wrong. I told him I was still tripping and continued coming up with phrases and metaphors.
