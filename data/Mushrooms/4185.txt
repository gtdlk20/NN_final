I was transported to this place that seemed to be another world. A world made mostly of shallow water. Metal looking blade like parts were flowing in and out of it like fan blades but it seemed obvious that they were part of something much more larger and complex underneath the unwaving water.  Later, after several other adventures that IÂ’m not sure I can completely understand or describe, I sat up and decided I was hungry. My daughter was now in the kitchen and so I asked her to bring me an orange as I was feeling more normal now and able to be somewhat social. I asked her to peel it for me and this little being in my house with her tiny squirrel like hands was happily peeling an orange for me. This again brought tears to my eyes. After she left the room I looked around and noticed that my house was very psychedelic and trippy. I was amazed by all the colors and moving patterns. My blankets were clouds with little machines running through them. My wood floors and dresser had become a rave party of moving lines and designs. It was beautiful. I looked at the orange in my hands and I suddenly had the hands of an ape. I was holding these orange pieces and then I saw a memory of me as the ape kind of roaming around and eating various things. Now, as the ape I remembered that I had eaten some mushrooms although the ape me did not know they were called mushrooms. I was fully engulfed in the fact that I was this ape, learning how to process thoughts. The orange, now split into two halves with one being bigger than the other, turned into two brains. I understood without any question that I was seeing how the small brain was one from before and the larger brain represented a growth that I was now feeling in my own head. I learned as an ape what learning was and what it meant to comprehend thoughts with meaning and purpose. And then my room bursts into a million colors and crazy patterns and I was totally stoned looking staring at all of them and then all at once like a light switch, everything was gone. Not in a bad way but completely gone and at the perfect time I suppose.
