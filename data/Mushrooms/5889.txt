Once the playlist was over, and the lights came on, it was only 12:00am It felt as if it should be 4:00am and we should be waiting for the sun to rise. Instead some of us headed upstairs which we watched 'Darkside of the Rainbow' Where you play Darkside of the moon by Pink Floyd In Sync with The Wizard of Oz. It was so trippy, and the music flowd with the movie so perfectly, it was as if this is the way it was meant to be watched. Once that passed by We put on 'The Wall' by Pink Floyd as well. All I could think was 'Woah', The Images created in that film blew my mind. The Dancing Flowers, The unusual creatures and masks, and monsters, that were incorporated in it was perfect. A Movie I would recomend to anyone who is going to take any type of phycadellic.
