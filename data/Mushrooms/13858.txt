I just stared at the cieling at the clock that kept changing time a bunch. Then I couldent move. At this point I was very afraid. I didnt know what happend. Why couldent I move? A few minutes, hours, whatever, I had no concept of time whatsoever then Dorian came in the room. He was like 'Oh my god I cant believe I pulled it off' I could still hear his parents yelling about him. And I thought to myself 'WTF are you talking about. I can hear your parents talking about you tripping.' I wanted to say 'what happened?' but I couldn't. My mind was a mess, so many thoughts. My mind was a mess, so many thoughts. I was afraid they had called the police. Eventually because I couldn't talk I thought I had died. This is when I got really scared. I could still move but I couldn't talk. The one thing that kept going through my head. 'Wow, I have let down so many people just because I took some mushrooms. How pathetic. I am a idiot.' This went on for awhile. I kept thinking 'this is what the after life is like?' I eventually stoped caring I was 'dead' and I just enjoyed the visuals.
