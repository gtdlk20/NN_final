At seven oclock sharp, racked with nerves, I fetched the bottle from the fridge where it had been defrosting for a couple of days, studied the rank-looking wisps of dark spore materia swimming about inside the liquid, opened the lid and took a cautious sip. To my great surprise it didnt taste bad at all, mostly like coke, except with a faint aftertaste of mushroom. Immediately I thought that I had been tricked and that it was simply coke mixed with a sprinkle of culinary mushrooms, but I quickly silenced my suspicion, downed the concoction in a few swift swigs and nervously made myself comfortable on the bed, laptop on my lap.
