The rest of the day was awesome.  I didn't explain much of my experience of being outside, but I most urgently suggest that y'all try shroomin' during a nice, warm day in the summer.  Boomin' at night and during the day seem to me as two totally different things.  Anyway, nice boomin', keep it real, peaceout.
