She let go of my hand, and stepped into the clearing. When I hesitated, she beckoned me to join her. With great residual fear from the trauma of ego-death that I just endured, I stepped into the the field. She looked at me with a wonderful smile, and pointed up at the moon. It was the largest, brightest, most white moon I have ever laid eyes upon. She explained that the moon was our mother, and that as long as we had the moon in the sky all of our incarnations would be able to communicate with one another across lifetimes. She went on to tell me that while we were one individual soul, we were separate entities at the same time. Each incarnation had different characteristics and different identities. But while we walked different paths, we all had the same destination as spiritual healers. I took my hands out of my pocket and held her hand while we gazed at the moon in silence.
