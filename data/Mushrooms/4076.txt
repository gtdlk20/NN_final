If indeed it was Mother Earth in my bedroom, then I must say that it was the most powerful love I have ever experienced. It was tinged with sadness and patience. [ MomI never knew. I began to cry harder, if that was possible. I never knew you loved me so much  ] I cant explain in words how much feeling that level of unconditional love changed my life.
