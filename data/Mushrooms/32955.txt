One thing that I had said powerfully different about this trip was that the things I saw and experienced didnt seem to fit into the realm of hallucinations. The term visuals just didnt seem to encompass what was happening this time. Going into my first trip, I had heard many descriptions from friends whod had powerful experiences, such as seeing plants morph back and forth through their birth-death cycle, seeing clouds forming faces and moving like kaleidoscopes, etc. And meanwhile, my first four trips, while all very powerful cognitive and emotional experiences of the mind and senses, all contained visuals that like I said, I could for the most part ascribe to the effects of a drug. These included seeing still photos of space and of artwork become briefly animated, seeing Camille draw artwork that would also temporarily become animated, or seeing objects distort slightly in size or position, only to return soon after. All those glimpses were extremely captivating and enjoyable, but seemed to lack meaning, and would usually occur for a fleeting period later on in most of my trips (not to say I dont still think all of those trips were crazy and amazing to this day).
