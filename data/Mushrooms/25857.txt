Since I couldn't figure out how to get the shower to work; I curled into a fetal position under the bath tub faucet and bathed myself. The Goddess knew that I was dirty; covered in the invisible afterbirth of shamanic exstacy. She knew that I needed a familiar feeling/being/consciousness to clense myself. The faucet began pouring out the essence of H's last visit with her. The Goddess never forgets her collective experience no matter when or where we visit Her. Somehow She knew that H's vision, her memory, her inner Sage would wash me. I emmerged feeling renewed, clean, and somehow more connected to her (H) than ever before.
