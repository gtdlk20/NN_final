Somewhere along the line I got up and went to the window and looked outside, all I could see had the rotorscope painted look of the films 'Waking Life' and 'A Scanner Darkly'. Surveying the view of the back gardens, filled with kids toys and other paraphernalia I thought 'Am I Bob Arctor?' For a split second I believed I was, illustrating a fusion of various realms of thought and reality in my mind and how deep the trip went into my subconscious.
