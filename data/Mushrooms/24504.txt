We got to a bridge where the water was roaring so loud, so strong, it was so powerfull. It was just the night before were we had a huge rainstorm so of course the river would be rushing like mad. We stood there in amazement from the river, and the salmon jumping up it. As well as the lights from the hospital across the street, peering through the trees that were divinding us from civilization and our own world.
