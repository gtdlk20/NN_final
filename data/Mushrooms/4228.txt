In the first couple of months that followed this experience I purged a bunch of useless junk from my apartment, changed the furnishings, hung a bunch of wall art, built a desk, started an art project, sold a large collection of vintage clothes for a few thousand dollars, opened a savings account, and planned a vacation. I made a decision to cut my work schedule so that I could spend more time trying creating things and seeking my true calling. I made the decision to get off my antidepressants and started tapering down my dosage a month after this trip. As of this writing Ive been off my antidepressants for 7 months. Over the rest of the year I saw my alcohol consumption radically drop. Before this trip, I drank 4-8 drinks a day, 4-7 nights a week, for about 10 years. At press time, Ive only consumed alcohol about 10 times in the last 5 months, mostly out of perceived social pressure, and have regretted it every time because of the depression it causes me. My cannabis consumption also decreased notably which I didnt expect. Ive lost about 15 pounds. Ive started and maintained a daily practice of mindfulness meditation for the last two months. Im writing every day. Im reading a lot. I deleted all social media from my life. People tell me I look good and that I seem like Im in a positive place. I feel more genuinely engaged with my thoughts and feelings than I have in a very long time. Im willing to hear things of a spiritual nature without getting in an atheist uproar.
