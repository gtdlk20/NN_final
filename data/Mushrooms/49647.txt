There were other people around not tripping but at that time I wasnt conscious of being at all affected by them on any level.  Then me and loz talked a bit about music. He was talking about the effect it can have on you so I agreed and described the feeling of the bit and he said he didnt think Id get what he meant and that was it exactly.
