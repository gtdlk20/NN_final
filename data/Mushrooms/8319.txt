All I remember about the first 1-2 hours is that I felt sick sick sick and couldnt shake the awful sick feeling. I was getting increasingly tweaky and annoyed because I was not in my own home (as I had been on trips for months and months by that point) and didnt have all my own comfortable things with me. Nothing was where I needed it to be and it was impossible to find anything in my purse. The confusion was just too great.
