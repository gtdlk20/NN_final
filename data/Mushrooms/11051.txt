About halfway through the first cup, I began to experience a light feeling in my body.  I wasn't sure if the tea was actually having an effect or if it was simply a placebo.  When I finished with the first cup, I realized that the tea was definitely having some effect, although it was very mild.  When I went to strain the second cup of tea, I finally realized my error.  I strained out the second cup of tea anyway, cut the mushrooms, and let my third cup sit, thinking I would come back to it later.  Tea prep guides I had read told me to have two cups and then save the third for an hour later, but I figured I could just take three since the first two probably wouldn't be that potent.
