It was around this point that I noticed that my stomach began to really hurt. I sometimes get gastrointestinal discomfort when on shrooms, but normally it's minor and I'm so distracted tripping that it isn't an issue. I usually don't even notice it until after I've peaked and I'm on my way down. This time it wasn't minor, it hurt! On top of that, my perception of reality began to slip at this point. Where was I? Who are these people around me?
