The rain continued on and off and I was just sitting in my chair zoning out into the distance. My entire body felt very sluggish, as did my mind. Like all I really wanted to do was stare off into the distance. My friend decided though that we ought to head back to the my car due to the rain. Justin and I agreed and we got our things together and set off on the hike back. I enjoyed the walking a little more because it gave my mind something to concentrate on, a definite goal. 'We're going to the car.'
