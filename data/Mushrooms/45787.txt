The mushrooms I ate were Golden Teachers.  I grew them myself in a monotub. Green mold overtook most of my mushrooms and I lost a lot of them because of this. However, if you're really interested in learning what the mushroom has to teach you, watching it grow and nurturing it can also be very rewarding.  Paul Stamets and the McKenna brothers have written some very helpful guides on mushrooms and their cultivation.
