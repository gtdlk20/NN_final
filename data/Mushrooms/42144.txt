Stopped on a curb talked to my girlfriend for about 10-20 mins, curbs are nice metaphors, questions upon questions, the meaning of life doesnÂ’t really matter. We had a beautiful conversation about metaphors and time, I kept saying it doesn't really matter at the exact right moment and she was so entertained. Can I kiss you right now? Is that possible? Can I find the person that just drove by me? Is that possible? I think I said THAT's a good question about 50 times. Kept coming up with philosophical question after philosophical question, metaphor after metaphor. Kept coming up with philosophical question after philosophical question, metaphor after metaphor. How long do you think we're going to be together? Oh, but guess what? It. Doesn't. Really. Matter. We both laughed so hard, and I was telling her how beautiful she was. Complete honesty, hilarity, joy and pondering metaphor upon metaphor.
