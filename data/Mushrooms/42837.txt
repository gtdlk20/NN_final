After that weekend, I started smoking marijuana quite regularly. It was almost every weekend at first, and I even felt like that was too often. Ill be honest  I dont know why, but I had a bit of a guilty conscience every time. Soon enough Nick got into smoking as well, and by Christmas, I was already smoking every day. I was certain that I had a newfound insight and pleasure in life. I loved my friends, my family, and my own life more than I would have ever imagined possible. Also, for someone with insomnia, I personally found no better sleep-aid.
