The plant teacher began to teach, gently correcting me every time my mind wandered in the wrong direction. Forgiveness, acceptance, love, suspension of judgment, no telling people what they need or should do. Many emotional releases followed, I was dancing with my emotions, able to cry at sad thoughts and laugh at funny ones. It felt as if laughter and tears are made of the same energy and crying is as joyful as laughing. It's okay to just be, I don't have to feel guilty about being alive, it's okay to feel bad, it's okay to feel good, the important thing is to let your emotions wash over you, to go in and explore them, but then move on and let go and make room for the next emotion to flow through. I realized how I fight myself day in day out, the message I'm sent is that it's time to declare peace with myself. It then occurred to me that we all really love each other, it is just our neuroses that struggle against one another. What a shame I think, but the mushroom says no, you must accept that too, it is the way the world is. Infinite love, infinite acceptance even to our faults, our neuroses, our pain.
