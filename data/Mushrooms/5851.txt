At the peak of my trip I stood up and leant on the wall, pushing my fingertips into it. My core was vibrating, my fingers were buzzing and I felt the same vibration pouring out of the wall, the room, everything. I lost my physical self, normal senses left me for a second and I rolled along the wall and into the corner of the room laughing ecstatically. I was overwhelmed by the profound feeling of being the wall, of the wall being me, of me being everything, and everything being connected by this vibration. I was feeling with a non physical sense. Not touch, taste, or even sight. I felt my sphere of existence in its simplest and most profound state, without ego, without a centre. I could not be afraid because I was no more. My friends were distant shapes looking at me, I knew they were people but I wasn't one of them. As this passed my memories flooded back like warm water. My self retuned to me.
