NOTE THAT MY TYPING IS MORE OR LESS EXACTLY IN SP(AJHGRGHRG!) [I mistyped and was annoyed, I think. Speed?] with my thoughts. I can slow down or I can type fast. There is a need to be fast becaise I know this state won't be here forever... but there might be something to bring back with the looking at things positively thing... It's amazing tht I can make my hands be this disconnected organ capable of typing whwtaever I send at them... never protesting but knowing when things are a litle too much and de,amdmg tjay tjeu ne et slow down so tjeu cam ne accirate agaom [demanding that ??? slow down so they can be accurate again] Wow.
