We continued on our brisk stroll and made our way to a nearby jetty constructed of rocks. We walked along it and sat right on the end of it. Here we talked for over half an hour, discussing the beauty of our surroundings and observing little details on the rocks. It was nearing 2pm now, and we turned behind us to see a middle aged man with a fishing rod and gear approaching. He greeted us with a strong French accent and begun asking us about our day. Through conversation we discovered that he was a French pastry chef, and that he was there to fish after finishing his shift for the day. He sat beside us and started fishing. We discussed education and about the different pathways that people choose in life. The conversation shifted to talking about how many people find pleasure and joy differently, and how often the little things in life should be cherished and appreciated.
