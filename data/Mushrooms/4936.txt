The rest of the trip I lost track of time, like I wasnÂ’t able to get up to check the time even though my computer was on the entire time with the monitor off. The final effects of the trip ended exactly at 3:51 AM. With the trip ended I had seen no other recurrent hallucinations, after effects etc.
