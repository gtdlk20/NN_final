Fist I began to see patterns emerge in the limbs of the trees across the river from me. They were geometric patterns of triangles and stars. These patterns also began to emerge from the sand. As I sat alone on the beach my eyes began to water as the visuals came on stronger and stronger. All of a sudden I began to hear strange things. At first I couldn't make it out, but after a while it began to sound like singing, or more like a chanting. Soon the sound was much louder and all around me. Then i realized it was the wind...it was sweeping through the Yosemite Valley, through the leaves of the trees, and between the great stone walls. It carried the sound of the past, the sound of those that once inhabited the great beautiful valley. As the wind surrounded me the music got louder and louder, but it made me think that it was only a wisper of the power and herritage of this great valley. Then I began to se the walls of the valley throb with energy. I ran into the tent, my eyes watering half tearing up from the powerful moment with the wind, and half because i couldn't bring myself to close them.
