The walls are breathing periodically through out the experience. They reverberate. I look up at my chalk board, and an alien face forms from the dust. Geometric patterns of lines form in my visual field. They're not really there, but I recognize there are lines in my field - the image recognition of my brain sees the geometry but I cannot see them somehow.
