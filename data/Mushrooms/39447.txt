We went back into the car and began out ride home. This would be hard cause I didn't even know if my sisters two friends knew I was tripping. She just told them I was fucked up. So I was embarrassed at myself and tried to be okay. They looked at me funny though and it was a horrible feeling. I started coming down as we got home and I came home and talked to my mom and was fine. My sis told me never to trip in front of her again cause she doesn't like it or seeing me on it. I felt real bad about that. Today I woke up and I've had the hardest day ever. No work, just mad thoughts racing through my head.
