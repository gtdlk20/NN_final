I have taken 'Magic Mushrooms' on several occasions.  I acquired them through a friend who grew them in his backyard.  I usually took a dose of 12 mushrooms, which put me in an intense state for several hours.  I wasn't aware that lower doses were the norm.  Upon first acquiring a bag of 12 shrooms from my friend, I asked 'How many should I take?'.  He responded 'If you take any less than what I've given you, I don't think you'll get the full trip'.  Which is true.  All I knew these mushrooms as were 'Gold Tops' due to the metallic gold colour they took on once they had dried out.  The trips have always taken me to 'heaven and hell', and although they have been strong, I have always been aware that I am still on Earth.  Tripping out of my skull, but still on the material plane.
