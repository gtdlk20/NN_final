For such a journey, Logos suggested that a psilocybin mushroom tea, with its relatively fast onset (15 minutes) and short duration (about 4 hours), would be an excellent match:  A healthy day hike, to sweat the medicine in the glories of Nature, with no one in normal life even needing to know it was anything but exercise.  This would be a journey away from other people, with enough ardour in climbing and sweating under the direct summer sun and effects of the mushroom tea itself, to facilitate a mirroring of Inner and Outer trips:  A challenging climb up to Eagles Nest beneath the mountaintop, sweating on the medicine trips peak, then slowly sweating out and coming back down in all senses of the word, reintegrating with a baseline reality back down below the painted limit-line to walk away on more familiar terra firma.
