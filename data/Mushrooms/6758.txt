I continued to repeat this phrase until I decided to hang up the phone. I lay in bed, purely ecstatic about the discovery I had made. As I lay motionless, I continued to let my brain synthesize my surroundings. I was in space, in a sea, and anywhere I wanted to be. However, these settings were less realistic than the amazing experience slashing the ribbon of existence. All the while during these experiences, I knew I was still in my room and simply on drugs (pardon the clich√©).
