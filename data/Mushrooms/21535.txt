So, the next few experiences, I have experimented with higher doses (typically 2.5-3g of cyanescens- which are around 5g cubes and one instance of 5g cubes).  They got me deeper into the thought loops and questioning of reality- what about me is subjective and objective.  The comedown was always amazing- with flashes of emotions, great releases of tears of sadness and joy.  Visuals were there, but more subtle, whether it were the cyans or the cube high doses.  I didn't mind less visuals as I was trying to get to the root of my personal issues. However, I didn't seem to have the ability to directly confront some issues that were bothering me in my life I didn't seem to have the ability to directly confront some issues that were bothering me in my life- mainly my low motivation in my job.  I did bring them up but it seemed like my mind was not connecting deeply to the root of the problem.
