Cigarettes. Lots of cigarettes. I had bought a pack and was already through more than half of it (note that I am not a heavy smoker at all) and wanted much more. Two of my friends began to wander off and they started grabbing the trees and pulling on the leaves (later on they explained they could melt the leaves and bend/stretch them however they wanted). By this time the drunk feeling had worn off and I was free to play around inside my head. I was sitting in the grass holding a flashlight I brought with me and flipping it in the air. I could not stop, the light was a part of me; if I tried to leave it behind, it would tug at my very being until I ran over to pick it up again.
