It was so weird how my mind was makin up these little realities that weren't real. I kept forgetting stuff that just happened, so it was hard to put the pieces together and remember it's just a weird trip. So I thought I was dying cuz I couldn't really move and that whole theory that I had been in a car crash, even though I never actually left the place, and was finding it hard to breathe, pretty scary in the mindset I was in, after a bit I felt like I was in a state of purgatory and peace and I was accepting the fact I was dead. (finding it hard to breathe and having a feeling of great peace are pretty normal for shrooms, but I didn't consider that at the time) But a bit later I dismissed the idea of being dead (cuz... I'm alive). But not the idea of being in the whole situation.
