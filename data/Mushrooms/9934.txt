12:45AM - Major effects are felt right now.  The PC screen is a kaleidoscope of colorsits so beautiful.  It is like an unusual anomaly, Im actually seeing a beehive of intricate networks in my screen.  The keyboard also feels very different, its harder to type and my muscle memory is more difficult to perform.  I feel that I should only act as a spectator to this event that is unfolding.
