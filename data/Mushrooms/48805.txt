So then I cant handle the bathroom anymore and I lay in the bed.  I close my eyes and see a slideshow of faces of different races.  All saying 'PROPHET FROM GOD!'  as they zoom past me.  Coming down off of this trip I finally decided what I was going to think about all this.  I decided not to be the crazy guy that runs around saying god talked to him and yada yada.  You know what these people are like every town has a legendary person like this and quite honestly they are looked down on.  So I decided to call it a fluke and turn my back on the concept of heaven, hell and a god who is consciously controlling where we go after death.  Turning my back on god took about a week in total but I finally got over it.
