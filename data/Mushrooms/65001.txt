Around 8:30 we decided that we should smoke some cannabis to jump start the trip, even though we both admitted that we felt it coming on.  So I took out my cell and called my friend D up, he happily agreed to come pick us up to have a session.  We smoked a couple doobs and listened to A Tribe Called Quest, (which has awesome beats and is just generally trippy whether on shrooms or not).
