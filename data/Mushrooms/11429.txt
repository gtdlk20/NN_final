I decided to embark on my first mushroom guided journey in the early morning hours of Thanksgiving 2002.  I had done very little in the way of packing for the trip prior to departing.  I got some art books (Caravaggio and Klimt) and put several Lorenna McKennitt CD's in the CD changer before eating the mushrooms.  This was at approximately midnight.  Onset effects were almost an hour in coming.  This was due probably largely to the fact that I had eaten only five hours beforehand.
