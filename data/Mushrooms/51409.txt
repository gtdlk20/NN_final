The feeling most of the night was intense, but fun, like a rollercoaster or fun house.  However, for first time 'shroomers I wouldn't recommend doing them with a lot of people around who aren't on them, they only scared, confused, or aggravated me.  I think shrooms are best with six or seven people, all of whom have eaten them and who are all just relaxing in a nice chill environment.
