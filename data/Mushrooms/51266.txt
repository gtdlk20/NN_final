I had read a lot on shrooms online and knew that many people approach the trip in a spiritual manner. I had been studying the worlds major as well as minor religions and native cultures looking for answers. So far I had found similarities between all cultures, religions, and trip experiences. I had also been reading on spiritweb.com about out of body experiences and channeling of other spirits so I was pretty open to the possibility of a multidimensional soul and the existence of spirits and higher powers.
