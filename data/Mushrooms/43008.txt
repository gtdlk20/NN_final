Since Peter and I were already on drugs, it somehow became logical that it was Michaels responsibility to smuggle the joint into the show, which he willingly accepted. The walk to the bar and the waiting in line to get in were nothing out of the ordinary  it was still too early for any noticeable effects, and we were each rather quiet, eagerly awaiting the live music. We were delayed, and the doors didnt end up opening until about half an hour later than they were originally supposed to. I was simply trying to keep myself in reality, which was still easy for the time being. I was excited though, ready for the onset at any minute.
