It started off with me being at a friends house, eating my 9 gram bag of mushrooms. We had bought some weed earlier, we smoked 14 bowls and the mushrroms began to kick,and my 40 ouncer of old english shows up. I saw the world like I've never seen before, halucinating like a freak, the fish in the fish tank was scared of me, people appeared to be melting, a good friend shows up with some more of the mushrooms. I was offered a gram, I accepted, so I grabbed the biggest bluest stem in the bag. From there on the party was a blur, complete blur. From what I've heard, I started off by throwing up into my hands and threw the puke on the wall, then I puked all over myself. As my friends rushed me to the drive way to finish hurling, as I sat rocked out of my head, friend asked me to stand up, I declined then she kept at it, so I turned to her and chomped on her leg, I almost took a chunck out of her leg, and I left a big blue bruise with red teeth marks around the outside. Since I was so messed and I couldn't walk another 'friend' of mine decides to call my parents to come and pick me up from the party, a couple people told my parents that I was just drinking so my parents took me to the hospital to get my stomach pumped. I told them as I was the the hospital door that I ate mushrooms, they didnt take me in because they didnt want to get my friends in trouble for providing the mushrooms. When we arrive home they laid me on the couch, the only thing I remember is the snap of a finger, my fathers finger, I laid there thinking it was all a dream, being in my house and all with my parents, then I found out its all really happening to me, I wanted to know who called them and I wanted to know what the fuck happened that night, all I know is that was the most amazing I've felt but it was not worth it, wait.......... Yeah it was.
