My girlfriend S. and I rented a cottage in the mountains in the middle of a forest. It is quite remote. We started growing mushrooms the winter before and were curious to try out the results. All my last recent on psychedelics experiences were quite disappointing, I had a hard time tuning in and secretly suspected that I may have gotten immune due to my daily pot habit and mushroom-past.
