HereÂ’s where the first of three major events happened for me. My eyes were closed, and I remember being presented with multiple shadow figures. Not necessarily evil but I knew they were there to intimidate me and wanted to suppress me. I felt ZERO fear. Whenever they tried to rise above me, I rose above them and showed my awesome strength. They finally backed off, realizing they were no match for me. I have never felt so strong in my entire life. It briefly hit me that this was my test, showing me what true strength feels like. I to this day believe this was my grounding for the rest of my trip.  I felt awesome for a while, like nothing could touch me and I was a fucking badass. Some music changes and other cool stuff happened for a bit, and then my second major experience popped up.
