The clarity and vividness of this level of visionary opening cannot be understated.  It makes our ordinary waking consciousness of this world of forms appear as but a pale shadow of Reality.  Once apprehended, however, its Presence is perceived as fully embodied in each atom of every world contained by Her Immensity.  After such an opening, one is never quite the same.  The Presence of this deeper awareness imbues each and every detail of our ordinary everyday reality with a numinous luminosity that shines through all experience.  Of course, all these words are but an attempt to point out something which can only be fully grasped when it has been revealed to one.  It is pure grace and good fortune that allows this to be so.  I wish everyone reading these words may be touched by this emergent awareness of the Goddess, who reveals the secret of who we really are.  For we are, indeed, Gods.
