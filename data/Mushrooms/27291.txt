So I tried not to talk, because it made me feel sick and I closed my eyes and tried to find my balance, my center. Finding this tiny point in a colorful oblivion was very satisfying, and took away my sickness. I kept losing it, though, listening to everything around me. I could no longer distinguish people, voices, solid, liquid or air from each other. Everything blended, was one and the same, and I knew that this was how it always was, but it was just not visible. People asked me questions, and all I could think to say was that I forget. I forgot what sobriety was, I forgot who I was, where I was, who I was with, but at the same time I knew that if I could find my center I would remember. My hair became this white feathery webbing that surrounded me wherever I went and it made me happy. When I stopped feeling quite so sick, I found that I was completely happy.
