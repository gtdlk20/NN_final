After screwing around in there we walked across the school field and into town. On the way the grass and trees were very bright and wavy and van gogh like, which is one thing I definitely wanted to see while tripping. I was also able to pick out all the grass or branches going in one direction at any time. We walked through streets to the gas station G works at to visit people then back to the school. On the way I ate an orange I bought earlier. I heard they were good on shrooms. I said that I was eating a 'tree egg'. We liked that idea and it joined our already big list of shrooms related words such as 'imaginating' and other thing-doÂ’s.
