I returned to E's trailer after finished my kriyas out in his pasture and gulped down the nascently sanctified powder with orange juice I had brought from home. The next few minutes of waiting in psychosomatic limbo were tense and somewhat uncomfortable. I considered that my dicing and grinding of perfectly normal psilocybin mushrooms may have compromised the potency, and my trip may not progress further than the weak tingling sensation behind my ears I currently felt. This notion was soon dismissed as folly.
