We stayed in my room most of the night, where the trip became horrifying, I was laying on my bed paralyzed, I couldn't move, and no one could help me. I was melting into the sheets, and I couldn't breathe. I just wanted it all to end, I kept closing me eyes, but every time I did voices would talk to me and I'd see scary pictures, such as people puking everywhere, and people slitting each other throats. I couldn't take it anymore, and there was nothing I could do to make it stop. My friend told me water will help calm me down, and so the next thing I know I'm standing in my shower. I had no idea why or what I was supposed to be doing, so I started shampooing and conditioning my hair. I kept talking to the shower cap as if it were my friend.
