After about 20 minutes I started staring at this bush in the woods that was bright yellow and completely stood out from everything else.  It started twisting and pulsing and growing.  That was just the beginning of a great first trip.  It started raining a few minutes later.  I couldnt actually feel the rain drops on my head but I could feel my head getting cold.
