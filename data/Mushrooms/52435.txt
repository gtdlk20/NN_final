A feeling of silliness for taking the mushrooms, of needing to go through this/these experiences to see.  What am I looking for?   Why do I expect to find it with mushrooms?  I laughed and smiled at myself and the world for producing such an odd circumstance, at me for going through gyrations to feel in touch, to find myself I realize how ridiculously impractical I am in the things I do.  The way I dress, the way I do things, the fact that I havent learned to keep track of the simplest things.  But overall, its a good feeling.
