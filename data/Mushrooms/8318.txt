Firstly they tasted terrible and took ages to get down. I drank them crushed in OJ and could barely get them all in because there was just SO MUCH. I was already getting nausea before I finished the rest. I was with three friends who were also tripping but at much lower doses, and I explicitly told them ahead of time that if needed, they should restrain me. I didn't know what I was in for, but I'd done my homework on heroic doses.
