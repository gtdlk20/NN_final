My head began to become flooded with thoughts at speeds I would have never thought possible. If I were to think of a word, such as word for example, I would not only think of the word word and what it means but I would instantly think of every possible use, meaning, synonyms, rhyme, and experience I ever had with the word word. I felt like I could articulate anything clearer than any other time in my life. It was as if my brain was somehow able to access information and memories as speeds I never thought possible and I could articulate anything at lightening speeds. Dee must have felt the same way because at this point we were talking over each other at about a thousand words per second but it was fine, we didnÂ’t need to take turns talking. We were able to understand and respond to everything each other was saying more clearly than ever.
