We decided to push on to the EaglesÂ’ Nest to finish the ascent, the goal very close by, just about 100 meters more up a final steep slope, one that required walking slowly at angles not to slip, leaning in to the slope, and gripping down through the soles of the feet like mountain goats.  There was a great deal of long-faded graffiti from visitors past on the final approach, but the one that stood out was an old faded Cross and Christian fish, with an unreadable scripture reference, reminding us of the Gnostic Eucharist at work to embrace a Truth beyond the limits of all seemingly separate traditions or creeds -- and which to me had just revealed a kind of Univeralism in the form of parallel magical lives across time and space.  Praise Jesus in the Mushroom for the Sorceries of Mexico upon our hidden mountain!
