1:25pm  I talked to my fiance on the phone for a bit.  At this point I'm fully in the trip. Everything around me seemed liquid, amorphous, including myself.  I rarely look in mirrors during trips, but strangely, mirrors were the only thing I could look at without them melting and warping before me. I wasn't scared about the trip  I was scared I would be overtaken by something else if I let myself visit the city I was being shown.
