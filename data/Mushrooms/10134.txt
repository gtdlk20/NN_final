Three weeks ago I had the most insane psychedelic experience of my life. One that changed the way I perceived not only time, but space and energy all as one, and has stretched my mind into believing that life is more than just worrying about yesterday and tomorrow but is more about experiencing the now, and through this experience I learned and now believe that the now is all that matters.
