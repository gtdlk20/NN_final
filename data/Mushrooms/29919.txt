Were going to the desert, I promptly informed Manny, Albus, and 2 other close friends; Jimi, a musician whose weekend luggage included his ever present guitar and Wes, a horror movie junkie/astronomy enthusiast who had only recently moved to the city. Everyone with the exception of Albus had little to no psychedelic experience. I had tested, in three varying doses, the Penis Envy strain batch of shrooms we were set to take, but that was it.
