My body was feeling a little jello-like and my coordination was definitely being affected. So we decided it was time to go. We left and got in MÂ’s car and he started driving towards the canal which had a trail and some woods around it because M said that it was really nice to be in nature on mushrooms. Transitioning into a hippie phase, I really welcomed this idea of tuning in with nature. By the time we reached our destination I was really starting to feel it.
