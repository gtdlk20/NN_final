As I looked up at the open sky, vast, linear clouds were forming and whizzing all around the blue marvel. I noticed my field of view had been increased greatly, and the small patch of sky I was used to seeing was now in full panorama view above me. I looked over at a larger cloud to the south, which immediately started warping into a Greek/Roman style marble sculpture full of moving angels. I tried to explain this to W, but my articulation was not very good. He kept telling me he had no idea what I was blathering about, so I gave up. Poor soul, I thought, if only he could be seeing this. But I was reminded that he had just finished the joint by himself, and thus he was in his own little psychedelic world as well. It didn't bother me that I hadn't smoked any of it, since I had decided to not blaze until I was coming down. We headed back home, but I can't remember any of that part.
