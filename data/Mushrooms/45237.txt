Going into the trip I was so excited yet alittle nervous being that I had never taken a full 1/8 before and I was unsure of how strong my trip would be. Most of friends just ate the mushrooms striaght up but I put them on a sandwich and munched them down. They didn't taste nearly as bad as I remember them tasting.
