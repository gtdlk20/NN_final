The effect was a short-acting tryptamine buzz that was somewhat similar to a mild N,N-DMT dose (~5-10mg).  It lasted around 15-25 minutes, had no noticable open-eye visuals, and was characterized by a mild, but enjoyable, tryppy feeling. Overall an interesting effect forsuch a small amount of mushroom used!  Might try setting aside a little bit of my next oral P.Cu. dose to smoke while trypping.
