As usual, I was the first one to start feeling the initial effects. By 3:00 I had eaten about six grams on an empty stomach and it didn't take them longer than fifteen minutes to kick in. My head felt like it was slowly being pumped with air and I was getting slightly nervous and agitated. I felt like conscious and logical thoughts were slowly seeping away from my brain and leaving me with emptiness. It was getting harder to keep up with the conversation of my two friends and even harder to express my own thoughts into words. All that came out my mouth was a goofy laughter, and my friends knew I was feeling it. I suddenly realized how cold it was outside and unconsciously tucked my hands into my pockets. I looked at the landscape below and it was somehow different than before. The red and yellow colors of fall leaves were more brilliant now, but there was less detail, as if everything was covered with a layer of mist.
