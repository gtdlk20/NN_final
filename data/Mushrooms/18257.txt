We all loaded up in the bus and I was really tripped out by the shape of the ceiling.  Usually on trips like these with all my friend, I am talkative and sociable, but I found myself secluded and looking out the window in silence.  The driver could have taken me anywhere in the world and I'd never have known it.  The winding mountain roads, surrounded by trees made it imposible for me to judge our direction.  The prospect of coming over a mountain and seeing a brand new valley filled me with an undescribable joy.  I found myself able to also envision what these valleys had looked like millions of years ago, with water replacing the grassy meadows.  I tried to see the dinosaurs that would have been present but I was unable to.
