Now I push the friend starting close to the edge into the water. He stands up shakes the water off his head and thanks me. He talked about his new(ish) girlfriend and how he does love her but hasnt told her yet. I tell him what reason does he have not to love her and that its not that you have reason to love someone its that you have no reason not to.
