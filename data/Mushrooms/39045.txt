I came back to my room and laid on my back, closed my eyes and thought the question 'What is to come?' I meant as a prophecy because I had been reading about that, but whoever was communicating knew what I meant.  And WOW again!  Visions of war, disaster and possibly even martial law filled my head.  I saw a US soldier wearing a gas mask pointing a gun at a civilian who was laying on the ground trying frantically to get back.  The soldier was yelling at him 'get down!'  This civilian (looked American, but dont hold me to it) was literally scared shitless.  What I made of the vision was: some natural disaster, possibly the Great California Earthquake and martial law was enacted.  I dont know when this vision was taking place, but somewhere in the near future (near as in within a few years).
