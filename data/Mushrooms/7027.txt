Ive read stories about people unable to have sex, let alone become aroused, while on mushrooms. Not the case with us. A told me that he wanted to have sex, and would it be weird if we did? I said no. He said he really just wanted to melt with me, and I agreed that I wanted to feel us merge. So we put a condom on, and he slid in. Im not writing this to sound sexual. This almost wasnt even sex, because it was so intensely different. At that moment, I swear that the music became the air, rather, became the water, and that each beat was an ocean current washing against us. I could FEEL the music hitting my arms and cheek. We started slowly, and we kept going. The music that was playing had all of these noises that sounded like bubbles underwater, and it rippled and echoed in the room. We began to sweat heavily, and the room became intensely hot. We were drenched, no joke. We knew it was our sweat, but it felt like water. We were melting like that, feeling the others skin.
