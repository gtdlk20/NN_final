Nothing seemed real anymore. People would ask my questions and i didn't know the answers to them like have you had sex, or you said you've done this before have you. I knew i had but i though it was fake like my past was totally fake. we went out side and i felt VERY clean and it felt really good so i was being like a little kid if felt great. i wanted to go on a walk and they wouldn't let me which really pissed me off so i just staied in the drive way because i though the road was a bad place so i was looking at the trees and such and i saw another face which looked like it was crying too like the others. the people i was with kept trying to convience me to do things i didn't want to do, like go swimming and i just didn't want to.
