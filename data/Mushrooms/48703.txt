I was telling E all that I was feeling. I loved everyone. E and I had only been going out for a little bit, but I realized that I loved her and wanted to spend more time with her. I told her this and she seemed quite happy about it. My nose was literally, dripping snot. My hands were sweating intensely, sweat seemed to come out of every pore. I told E that I understand schitzophrenic people and I feel like I'm losing it. I began to get such a deep love for every one in the world, I poured my heart out to E. The batteries on my phone were running out and M was getting lonely, so I told E good night and that I would call her when I was sober. We walked back to our mattreses. T did not know M at all, so mostly M and I talked for awhile. We talked about our lives and America. I told M that I could see into anyone's life and know all their loves, troubles, family members and their lifestyle in general, but when I tried to look into T's life, I could see nothing. T was not talking very much, so I asked him to tell us more about him. He told us about his family, his parents, his girlfriend. M and I realized that America is addicted to connectivity and time. T would not let go of his cell phone, and he constantly wanted to use the lap top. We told him he was 'always the addict.' I don't even know what was going on in our heads.
