We later walked through campus and decided that we were both in the Jurassic park watching mood. For whatever reason she understood and was totally on the same page as me.  And then we started laughing wondering what about Jurassic park we liked, was it seeing people being torn up by dinosaurs?  We felt horrible about liking it, then we realized that it makes us feel better because while watching it we know no matter what happens, we will never be torn up by a dinosaur, then we decided that would be the worst death ever.
