My parents were going out of town for the night, so on my way home from purchasing the shrooms I munched on about 2 grams to get my trip started, but where I could still funtion enough to tell my parents goodbye. After they had left I still wasn't feeling any of the effects so I munched down on the remaining 3 grams and decided to kick back for the night. While coming up I watch a fairly corny movie, 'Coyote Ugly' (trust me, not my typical shrooming flick of choice), but I got a lot of humor out of it, and noticed all the really cheesy parts, but appreciated them at the same time. As the shrooms started to take effect I turned my room into a tripping palace. I turned on the black lights, lit some incence, and popped in Incubus's (some of the best shrooming music, in my opinion) 'Make Yourself' and 'The Fungus Amoung Us.'
