I set my VHS player and my headphones up with the 1940 Disney classic, Fantasia. Id seen this movie once before in 1990 when it had its 50th Anniversary theatrical release. I was a junior in high school, I was with friends, and was on 4 hits of acid. It was a good time but thats another story. The choice of re-watching this seems strange to me writing this now. Maybe I just wanted to evoke a feeling from my teens. I dont know. I smoked a little weed and puttered around the apartment while waiting for the come up.
