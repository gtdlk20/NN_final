T+90, maybe? who knows: With the help of the music there was a rising and focusing of the intensity of the energy, until there came a point where I gave birth to the universe, accompanied by ecstatic dancing. Sadly, though it was only yesterday, I remember this part as if it were a dream; by the time I could have described it with any clarity it was already swirling away. Really need to get a notebook or voice recorder set up next time.
