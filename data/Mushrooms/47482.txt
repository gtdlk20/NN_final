Once he tried to save and the computer malfuntioned he felt that he was basically in 'The Matrix'.  That we were living in a computer and they controlled everything we did and the only way to break them was to shun technology and go back out into nature.  He then labeled his room 'the room of truth' and J's room 'the room of security'.  He left his room and to tell us in J's room about what he found out but in doing this he locked himself out of his room.  He then turned on me and J saying that we were trying to keep him for real truth and knowledge that he could only get while in the room of truth.  J basically spent the rest of P's trip trying to calm him down but P would say in the middle of nowhere 'Brave New World'! Meanwhile I was in J's room trying not to listen to P for fear of myself bugging out.  After finally P to take a nap after 4 hours of tripping all settled down.
