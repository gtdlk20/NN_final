From this point on, I was starting to come down properly. A went out for a while so I was left to my own devices, at which point I settled down to watch a program about the 'scariest moments on television'. One of these moments, number 50-something I believe, was of The Wicker Man, a 70s horror flick. A clip from the ending of the film  which I shall not reveal for those of you who still intend to watch it  was shown, and the general atmosphere of terror being conveyed was so intense that I felt faint for a few seconds as I watched it. Again, this appeared to be an effect of the intense empathy I was experiencing throughout the evening: it felt as if I truly were the character in peril, and upon feeling what he was feeling my heart squeezed with ice-cold dread. That experience was the last real trip I sank into that evening, it was now 11:30, my energy levels were depleted and I was thrilled at the prospect of laying down for a relaxing nights sleep. The exhaustion I experience after a mushroom trip is surprisingly pleasant, despite  or perhaps because of  how it permeates my bones.
