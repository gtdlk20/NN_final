Music definitely effected my mood drastically.  A sad song made me cry.  Radiohead's Paranoid Android was... intense.  I can't really describe it.  Up to this moment, I found the trip very unpleasant, although definitely nowhere along the lines of a 'bad trip.'  I was not overly anxious or fearful and I still held faithfully to the idea that I was protected from harm.  Eventually, I finally gave in and relaxed my entire body, letting go of my physical form and losing myself to the images my mind was creating on my closed eyes.  From this point on, my trip took a turn for the better.
