After my first trip on Stones, which became a bad trip when my friend was sick and we had to hide it from my Mum for the day, I was eager to trip again in a safer place so that I could enjoy the experience more. My friend D. had a free flat, and our friends J. and Bonham were eager to trip, so we arrived at about two oclock and set the place up. I had planned to look at some art books, listen to music, and explore closed and open eye visuals, I also hoped to gain some insight into life, if possible.
