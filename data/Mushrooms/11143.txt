Sitting in my room reflecting on the trip I was listening to white rabbit and had the volume pretty loud. There was a sudden knock on the door. I leapt from my chair to turn off the lights so my mom wouldnt see my enlarged pupils and I wouldnt get busted. She noticed I had bolted from my chair and switched the lights off and asked in a very accusing tone What are you doing? As the song White Rabbit (which I had on repeat) passed over the lyrics One pill will make you larger, and one pill makes you small I answered nothing I was sure I was screwed but she just said Turn off that music and go to bed.
