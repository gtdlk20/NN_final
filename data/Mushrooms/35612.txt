I first noticed an increased level of energy.  It became very difficult to hold still and I fidgeted constantly while looking at several of the paintings in the art books.  I quickly became uninterested in the paintings.  I smoked a cigarette and grew fascinated with the way it burned.  It seemed that when I watched it closely, it burned slowly.  When I turned away for only a moment, the cigarette would seem to be suddenly consumed while I was not watching.
