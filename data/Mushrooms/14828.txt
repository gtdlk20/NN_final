I drove all the way to my house and made loops around the block for 30 minutes not knowing where a good spot to go was, because I had told my parents I was spending the night at brads, and I most DEFINITELY did not want them seeing me in that state of mind.  I found myself parked behind some trailer on a different friend of mines street.  It was there that I truly understood how deep a mushroom trip goes, and I only had about 2 hours left of the trip.  I laid in my car unable to sleep until the sun came up and I peaked my head out.  I saw a goat.  Yes a goat, on the horizon as the sun raised behind it.  It was a small farm.  I was just thinking, what the fuckhow much crazier can this get?  I drove back home, slept for 9 hours, and woke up with a new mind.
