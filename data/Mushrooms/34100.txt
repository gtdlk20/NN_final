After a while I got bored with trying to sleep and had enough energy to get out of bed and finish watching Fear and Loafing in Las Vegas to try to take my mind of the anxiety the mushrooms were making my feel. At this point I was feeling the trip that I had been hoping for, and actually managed to enjoy the movie. After the movie was over I took a shower and eventually came down at 9:02pm, though I kept feeling light effects until I fell asleep at 6:30pm.
