I put in Star Wars on my DVD player and began watching. About 5 minutes in, when Darth Vader enters the ship, I started getting nervous and shut the movie off. I felt bad that I hadn't tried to go out and do something. The world was closing in on me in a way. Panic hit me hard. I'm not going to be able to control this. I'm going to end up being found out in this disoriented state. I jumped into my bed and under the covers. My blankets were a sea of cloth in which I found some comfort. I continued Star Wars. After about ten minutes the panic disappeared. I had transcended my human desires and become some sort of alien that was analyzing my life inside my own body. All of my thoughts and desires were completely foreign.
