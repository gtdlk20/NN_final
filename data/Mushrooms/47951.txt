Geometric nature is present in everything: plants, cells, bacteria, DNA, rock formations, light, sound, heat, sensory perception, every aspect of science hints at this notion, unless our empirical knowledge is faulty beyond our comprehension. Our brain MUST attain these functions from extremely complex geometric mathematics at hand in every aspect of our chemical being. Our perception is nothing more than a random musing of these theories? Our thoughts, volition, memory, experience are formed by nothing more than this? The introduction of a simple chemical attests that our perception is sculpted by nothing more than intrinsic chemical reactions. How hard it was to conceive an idea like this. Every breath brought a new unattainable climax of artificial spirituality to my mind and body.
