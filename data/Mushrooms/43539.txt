It was my senior year in high school, and eating magic mushrooms on the weekends was becoming a popular activity for many of us. We all lived in the Pacific Northwest, where Psilocybe cubensis is probably the most readily available hallucinogenic mushroom. Hundreds of pounds are harvested wildly from wet, forested areas as well as pastures. I was able to obtain about one ounce of the orange red capped, white and purple streaked stem mushrooms. I was excited because the ounce only cost me $80, and I knew it would be more than enough to get my small group of friends 'frying nuts' off these cubensis. We had all tripped together several times before, and we were beginning to perfect the set and setting of the experience. We were not however, prepared for the intensity or mechanics of our upcoming trip on this particular, planned weekend adventure.
