Me and my tripping buddy (named A from now on) had gotten just above 2 grams (dried) each earlier this day but they were different mushrooms, I can't tell which kinds they were but my 2 grams were said to be 'stronger'. We were on an outdoor party and I was excited about taking them but in the back of my mind I believe there was a slight anxiety. I wanted to take them during the day because of a more 'lightful' experience, but we ended up taking them at sunset. We both sat down on the grass and started chewing them. My buddy, who had taken mushrooms several times before, wasn't very patient and swallowed them fast. I chewed mine slowly and really sucked on it to get a more intense experience. I also had them on an empty stomach. I had tasted mushrooms twice before and it was the same old earthy not-so-good taste that I could handle quite well by now, allowing me to really chew on them for a long time. After finishing them I drank some water to get the taste out of my mouth.
