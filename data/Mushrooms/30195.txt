Anyways, the visuals were intense yet intermittent. I would be bowling a frame, and I would see a few different things. First I would see other people bowling, but at the end of their approach they would go into slow motion and everyone would slowly turn their heads and stare very deeply into my eyes. Other times I would be bowling a frame, and I would see nobody in the bowling alley, keep in mind that this was a pretty busy night for the bowling alley, with the league and monday night football going on. And my mind would go through these visuals multiple times throughout the whole night of bowling.
