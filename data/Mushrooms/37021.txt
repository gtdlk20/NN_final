It was about this time we started to worry about Melissa. We assumed she was alone, and thought she might be off somewhere having a terrible trip. I tried to call her, but was entirely unable to stop laughing hysterically. I left a message on her machine about 2 minutes long of insane babblings. Later, Hank called her and she actually picked up. He said she sounded very out of it, very lost.
