Now getting back to the series of events concerning my trip (pardon my discursive writing style). The perennial abundance of societal values subsided only to be replaced by some rather peculiar feelings towards my tripping partner. I felt connected to her as if we were kindred spirits. With this being only my third time seeing her I still didn't know her too well. But being free from superficial and thereby trivial ties to our arbitrary system of judgement, I did know her. In fact, I knew everyone and this epiphany gave way to an ambivalent yet complacent disposition within. Fear of others had been substituted with a sense of unity among manking. There is nothing to fear because when all our idiosyncracies and pathologies are put aside we are all human.
