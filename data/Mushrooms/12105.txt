Next, my feelings morphed into a strong feeling of my own mortality.  I felt that I was on the 'other side'.  And still feel this was a real perspective & feeling.  My next feeling was that I had actually died!  This was such a real feeling that I really do think that it has some symbolic, spiritual significance for me.  I then felt, 'Oh no, what have I done in my life?  What consequences do I have waiting?'  I then felt a real responsibility to live rightly and to conduct myself in the most pure way possible in my life.  This because I think that Psilocybin mushrooms reflect your souls accumulated material: thoughts, behaviors & emotions you have had throughout your entire life, and quite possibly past lives.  This resolve to right things made me feel emotional towards my relationship with Christy (my wife).
