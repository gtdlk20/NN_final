That was my final vision of the event. I waited another hour, but my trip was over. Slight persistence of vision still lingered, but I figured it was safe to head home and call it a night.  On the ride home I found it very ironic that the song which was stuck in my head the whole time I was in spaced out, played three times on three different radio stations. I looked at Fat Chad who was sitting passenger side.  If I ever step into that apartment again Im going to get flashbacks. Man, I cant even begin to explain the insane delusions and thoughts I was experiencing back there, I muttered. A blank expression came over his face as he gazed into the distance.  Well, keep those thoughts to yourself, because we know that you know that we know that you know that you know he said in that familiar demonic voice I heard earlier. His words reminded me to be ware of the thought police.  I had peered into the face of death, and perhaps, the face of god, or at least one of his many faces. I had conversed with spirits and banished wretched demons. The experience may have been somewhat dangerous, but it did erase the ego, and shifted my perception on the way I look at the world and life in general, in a positive way.
