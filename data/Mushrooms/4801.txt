In my second trip I had taken only 2 g of psilocybin and had been having a very light pleasant trip. I was not having the intense sensation of dying and being born again, nor did I experience as deep of an experience of dissociation. I had been hanging out and talking with some friends when I became absorbed in the tapestries and art that surrounded me. Luckily everyone found zoning out in the middle of a conversation normal and no one called me back. I then felt the sensation of slowly being sucked into a vortex. My vision became distorted and I faded out. When I came to, I felt as though I was inextricably a part of everything that has been, is, and ever will be. I felt my existence as though it was a thread being woven into an enormous tapestry of space-time that was infinite in all regards. I lost my sense of singularity and instead experienced a profound sense of interconnectedness. I came to understand that all separation, all beginnings and endings are nothing more than illusions created by a binary mind struggling to cope with the complexities of survival. I realized that I was no different that the many things that created the bed I was lying on. Everything time, blankets, people, rocks, stars, and lamps were all different states and patterns of the same essential substance.
