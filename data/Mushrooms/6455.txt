12:45 A.M. - We suddenly both noticed that the entire room looked extremely hazy and smoky. It was as if we were both living in a dream. We discussed all the possibilities of what we would be able to do in this dream. The thought that we were actually experiencing a fantasy dream seemed amazing to the both of us. TRIP got up and sat next to his standing mirror and stared at himself for what must have been 10 minutes. He did not say a word, he just stared. He told me that his arms seemed out of proportion with the rest of his body, and as I looked I noticed the same thing once again. This is when we realized we were having a connected trip. We both were experiencing the same visuals and effects. I realized that whenever he left my field of view, I felt uneasy and lost, and when he came back to me I felt comfortable again like we were both at home again and happy.
