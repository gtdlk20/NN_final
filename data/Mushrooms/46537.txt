Mark's house is very cosy and we had a fire going in the living room with The Doors playing over the stereo and an amazing fiber optic light made up of hundreds of strands with beads of light at the ends (which I highly recommend to anyone planning a session).  I had taken mushrooms one time previously, also at Mark's house, except I had eaten only one half eighth, so I figured I was in for a bit more intense of an experience this time, little did I know that it would completely blow away my first trip.
