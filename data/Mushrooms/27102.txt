My legs were blue from the lack of warmth and light that the sun so graciously bestows upon us so we ventured back down to the main canyon where we could enjoy the beautiful clear sky and the rest of our trip.  We were lying in the sun and R noticed I had a bit of sunburn from the prior weekend.  He is a bit of a fanatic about sunscreen, rightly so, and we took turns applying protection to each otherÂ’s faces.  His fingers felt wonderful as they swept over the skin on my face.  Every touch felt extraordinary, like having my face brushed with silk.
