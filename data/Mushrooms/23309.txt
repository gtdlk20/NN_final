To combat being stone I tell myself I am actually a feather. I become very light but am easily blown across the room! I see my legs and remember; I am a man! And I get up, then realize, ha, if I can be anything, why be a man!? I proceed to be a tree, a mushroom, a French Informant, a paratrooper, my shadow Finally, cigarette in hand, a CD now playing, I take the risk of stepping outside.  Outside. It is so dark out, and cold, my feet instantly feel numb, so then does most of my body. The variance in life and light instantly suggest to me that outside is after life. Things here have no leaves, they are worn down, I am not dead, but I am someone alive in a place thats still and void of life.  Cant get hurt if Im the only thing here. I say, and confidently light up, cigarettes are a guilty pleasure of mine, taken only a few times a year. My shadow as I sit on the railing is ball shaped, so I mistake my own body to be ball shaped. I am now Humpty Dumpty.
