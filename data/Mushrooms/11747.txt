By about 5:25pm a friend came to the door (call him 'H') and asked if anyone wanted to play frisbee.  I jumped at the idea because I was feeling nervous and wanted to get out of my tiny dorm room.  When we got outside my entire body was feeling 'interesting' to say the least.  My entire body had every emotion rolling over every part of it.  If I thought a nervous thought for a second my entire body reacted.  It was good to be outside though.  I felt much happier and less nervous.  It was at this point that I told H that I had taken an eigth of shrooms and that I was starting to trip.
