I silently walk into the main one and find a place where I can see the dancers, about 3 rows of people from the core. I glanced around now and then noticing a few people here and there glancing at me, but with my internal clock slowed down so much, it felt like they were staring at me, which made me feel like they knew I was on shrooms, which made me smile and nod and keep dancing because everything was freely expressed here and the paranoia factor was completely inexistent because of that fact. Everyone knows IÂ’m on mushrooms! Yee-haw!
