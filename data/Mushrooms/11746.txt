'Have fun man.'  My roommate said to me as he put FIGHT CLUB in.  I knew I had between 5 minutes to an hour before they kicked in so I went upstairs to my girlfriend's room to grab my pillow.  I came back down and began watching the movie with my roomy.  By about 5:15pm I was feeling really weird.  I felt very anxious like something big was about to happen.  I wondered how this trip was going to be.  I couldn't concentrate on the movie, I just kept wondering how far out I was going to go.  I stood up and looked at my roomy's dresser.  It appeared to be moving toward me and I said 'cool.'  My stomach felt quesy but it wasn't anything that I couldn't happen.  I worried that if it became too much I would throw up and lose my $35 investment.
