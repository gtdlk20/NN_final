I knew this would end eventually, and that everything would be fine, because i Understood everything. I knew that the universe would forgive me, and everything kept telling me it was ok, and that it all forgave me. I was still sad, but starting to get better, as I realized it really was ok, now that I had realized it, and found redemption. It was absolutely life changing.
