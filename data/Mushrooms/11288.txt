Eventually they did wear off and I came back down to earth. As I said before though, the knowledge and wisdom that experience gave me is still with me and I have been a happier person ever since then. If there is one thing that I learned that night though, it is that there is only one thing we really need in this life  faith. Also, I dont think this experience would have been possible without the experiences I had already had with other drugs, as I outlined before. To me every experience (drug-related or not) re-wires my consciousness to some extent and I did happen to be a very open-minded, understanding individual beforehand.
