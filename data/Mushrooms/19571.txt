It was a Friday night and my friends and I decided to head on out to a rave.  After we got there, we each pulled out one Snickers bar, one bottle of orange juice, and one baggy of shrooms, thought to be five grams.  I was a little curious about what this would be like; my previous experiences involved only 3 or 4 grams.  The shrooms went down smoothly and we were ready to enter the dance.  I was looking forward to some psychedelic light shows.  Half an hour later, I was starting to feel a little tingly sensation originating in my stomach and slowly spreading through the rest of my body.  I smiled and realized that my trip was starting.  I was in for a long ride.  Shortly after, I was tripping balls.  Somehow I lost my friends in the 3000 other people.  I began walking around to find them but could not.  I started getting a little paranoid.  Everyone seemed to be looking at me.
