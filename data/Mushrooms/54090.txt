After that night I decided that I dont ever want to trip with more than 2 other people and that I wont trip with Lucifer ever again unless he takes half an 8th and even then I still dont know if Ill ever trip with him again. This night/morning proved to be a very good learning experience for every one. For one Akmed quit smoking and said that now he feels that because of his partially bad trip he has more control over it for next time as I realized also and I also learned that being in one spot for a long time is not good and tripping with more than 2 people is not a good idea and Lucifer learned his limitations.
