I played guitar for maybe an hour, then decided to go back outside with dog.  I walked down the driveway and saw a neighbor and his young son riding around on scooters.  The ambience of the whole neighborhood seemed pathetically naïve.  I walked to some rock atop my yard and sat for a while meditating.  Soon I saw my dads car pull up the driveway.  We conversed lightly and then I sat down somewhere.  I directly noticed my enhanced visual capacity as I looked down the pathway along which I sat and could see surprisingly clearly at a distance.  I began tapping my fingers on my knees.
