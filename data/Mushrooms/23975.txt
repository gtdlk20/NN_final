I had returned to my laptop and was speaking to my friend A  who also expressed surprise at the swift come-up  by the time the effects started to set in properly. They seemed very salvia-like at first in the way that salvia often appears to exercise a sort of force on my typing, seemingly compelling me to write certain things and omit others. I also felt heavy, thirsty and disoriented, again similarly to after taking salvia, and the bizarre sense of not-quite-identifiable familiarity was nearly identical.
