We turned on the TV, and we had no idea what was happening, once again. It was now impossible to focus on the plot. Whenever anyone moved, they left extremely clear trails, and the images on the screen were extremely distorted. Things seemed to inflate and deflate, and colors were extremely vivid. It wasn't entertaining in the matter that it was supposed to be, but since everything was so altered, it made for a good time. Rather than sitting down, we were just standing in front of the TV; why, I do not know. I looked at Josh, and his face appeared to be half red and half blue. As we watched the TV, we had a deep conversation about life, specifically, what it means to be alive, and we realized the sad truth, which is that life is only defined by a series of chemical reactions within a bundle of atoms. Which is true, by the way; without certain chemical reactions, we would be no different than rocks or the very computer you're staring at right now. It made us feel emotionally cold towards everyone else, but when we discussed it a bit more, we felt such a strong bond with one another. It didn't even feel as though we were two seperate people anymore; rather, it was like we were just one entity, having a beautiful journey as one mind.
