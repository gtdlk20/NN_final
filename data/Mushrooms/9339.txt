I used them on my own, at home. Most of the mushrooms are still happily growing in the garden but a couple were ugly or damaged (a kitten has been jumping around in my patch) so I picked these. An inaccurate kitchen scale said I picked about 6 grams, I was planning to take part of this initially and take more later after I had a better idea about the potency. I probably ate about 3-4 grams or so - a couple of tiny ones (less than a centimeter in length with a micro-cap) and 2 or 3 small ones (4-5 cm stem, 1 cm cap). I didnÂ’t end up taking the second portion.
