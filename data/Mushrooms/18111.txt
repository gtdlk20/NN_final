But it wouldn't stop. I just kept crying. It felt like I was letting out something inside me that had been laying dormant for a while. Sadness. The fact I had no job. What am I going to do with life? What decision should I make in school? What classes to take? Financial aid? My girlfriend? My mother? My sick grandmother? My childhood? My innocence? The fact that I'm growing shrooms and it looks like a drug lab (or so it looked like under the influence of shrooms!)?
