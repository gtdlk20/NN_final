The trip started for real after an hour or something when I sat up next to my friend and broke the silence with words... doubt breaks the spell (in finnish = epäilys rikkoo taijan). My friend turned to me, thinking what I have just said for a moment and replied yy..yes!...YES! I don't remember what lead to those words but my friend totally got the idea...
