A thought slinked into my mind.  What if the kind stranger I had procured the mushrooms from had made a mistake? Could they have been deathcaps?  I didn't know.  I began focussing all of my energy on maintaining control of bodily functions.  It was blindingly hot in the tent, so I kept my eyes closed for much of the time.  I became acutely aware of this smell, highly unpleasant and mildly nauseating.  I was sure that I was in some way responsible for it.  I opened my eyes one more time, looked directly into JeffÂ’s, and he said the two most profound words I have ever heard in my life.
