He got in the bed with me and we took off our shirts and lay together half naked. I have been naked with him so many times yet I felt a new strange sense of vulnerability in being naked. We talked about how small and vulnerable we feel as humans. We talked about how we need validation from others, just some small sense that we are meaningful and our lives are validated. He said that what humans really crave is just to feel like we are experiencing the same thing as someone else. That is why music is so powerful. Music (especially improvised music) comes directly from the minds and souls of the musician. As people are experiencing the music together they all feel connected through the fact that they are all experiencing the same thing at the same time. We tried to talk about the meaning of life. We agreed that feeling connected to other people was the most important and rewarding experience. I also broadened that to include a great satisfaction in understanding my place in the world and understanding how the world works. We also said that the meaning of life is different to everyone and to understand your purpose you need to just examine what it is that drives you to live. I also concluded that the meaning of life cannot be completely defined even for one person because there are way too many reasons for living.
