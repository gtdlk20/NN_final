After this extremely cathartic two and a half hours of crying, I went to the bathroom and washed my face. The coolness and freshness of the water on my face was simply amazing. I looked in the mirror of my bathroom and my visuals were still very much alive and well. My face looked ultra defined, and my skin began to ripple in colours of light pastel pinks, as though I were seeing my blood flow throughout my epidermis, as if it were right there in front of me. I experienced a profound few minutes of depersonalisation, as though the image of myself in the mirror was actually not me, but another being observing and looking deep within my ego and soul. Whilst it was a bit overwhelming, this experience did not scare me and was actually quite enjoyable, as though the other being in the mirror was pleased with that it saw within me.
