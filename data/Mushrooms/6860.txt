My dance was guided by the God-energy. It was effortless, creative, beautiful, and felt great. I danced for about two hours, and during this time I presented myself with many questions regarding my path in life. With each question the mushroom helped myself to see that I am on the right path, and that I am indeed at a turning point that will make me a happier person for much of my life.
