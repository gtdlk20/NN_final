The day arrived pretty quickly and I showered, got dressed, grabbed my one way shades and black shoulder army medic bag with all my special contents and paraphernalia.  After a 20 minute walk, I arrived at school and stopped, got seated in the forest right beside and started chugging the Sunny D.  Then, I unwrapped the mushrooms put them all in my mouth and started chewing.  Then almost gagging, they were so dry, crunchy and now in small pieces, it was an odd sensation.  I drank more Sunny D and swished it around in my mouth making sure to get all the bits from between my inner cheek and gums/teeth.  Then I walked inside, with a feeling of happiness and anticipation.  I can compare it to having an Alien egg inside of you, you know it is in there, its not coming out and its only a matter of time before BOOM.
