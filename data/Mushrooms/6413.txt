We made it to the cars and retrieved Aches 'precious' from the boot of my car. The precious was a chocalate birthday cake with half an ounce of hashish in it. Night had descended and the walk back to the camp was strange, because my vision was perfect over short distances but completely blurred past 30 feet I could swear that there was a group of white coated people cavorting in the distance but couldnt be sure.
