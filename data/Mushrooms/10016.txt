Finally, we made it to the woods. But these were no ordinary woods. It was a fantasy land full of ore mystery. Quickly we got completely lost. I was so glad I wasnt on my own. But then. I was! Neil was there but I thought I was him? I thought I was everyone and that the whole universe is just one thing. Were all one thing living in the illusion of separation so we can experience our self. This was when the trip went bad! I felt a loneliness unparallel to anything Ive ever felt.
