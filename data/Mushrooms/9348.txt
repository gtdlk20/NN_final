Once in bed I wasnÂ’t feeling so down anymore, I had made the bed so it was pretty comfortable. After a minute or so I decided it was not quite time for sleeping yet and I went downstairs where the music was still playing, but after one or two more tracks the album ended. I ate a nectarine (not very ripe) but felt very uncoordinated. I felt like a monkey being used for experiments, with me as the experimenter.
