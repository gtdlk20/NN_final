I have taken small doses of mushrooms a few times in the past, but this time I decided that I wanted a more substantial experience.  I took 1 gram at about 11pm and lay with my girlfriend watching the stars.  She became tired and went to bed after an hour.  I took another 2 grams and went for a walk.  I set off at midnight alone on a rural county road.  There is very little light pollution, the sky was clear and the moon was full.  I couldn't have asked for better conditions.
