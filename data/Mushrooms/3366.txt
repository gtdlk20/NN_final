I was still drawn to the jesus picture so I looked back at it. It seemed to resonate a hidden evil. like the devil had drawn it to trick me into looking at it. Then I had a strong feeling of, let's call it destiny. I'm 18 and of course struggling with identity, but the answer seemed to call me in to this now swarming sea of skulls and magic men. Like I would find myself if I kept looking. Then the picture began to melt, the skulls and magic men dripping off the page. Then it was again a picture of jesus, melting as well. This had snowball effect and everything around me started to melt. I started to melt. I assumed it was a trick of the great timothy leary and laid down on my floor to enjoy it. As soon as I laid down my girlfriend sat up from the bed and began talking. She was obviously in a very different trip. She was laughing and playing with the dog. I don't remember much of it, but I remember she kept saying 'I bet you think I'm annoying, talking this much' and I'd say no and think maybe we're not as compatible as I thought we were. Then she stopped and stared again at my Almost Famous poster, which has a picture of a seductive Kate Hudson next to a Les Paul, and she said 'her eyes scare me.' I'd spent time tripping out on the same poster so I looked up and said 'she's desire.' Then I closed my eyes.
