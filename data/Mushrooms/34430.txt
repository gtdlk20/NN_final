At about 3:30 I decided to eat mine. My friend J was skepticle about the whole thing, but I was anxious and looking forward to the experience. I read online that you must have a good mind set when going into a Psychedelic trip.  When I finished eating my mushrooms I decided to eat 2 oranges because I heard that something in oranges makes the trip more intense. At about 3:40 Me, D, and J decided to walk to my friend L's house. My friend D didn't have any mushrooms so he poured 5 beers into a water cooler and we began walking. At about 3:45 my friend J decided to eat his 1/8 of mushrooms also.
