The feeling of the Trickster showing his dark center, his realization of being stuck on the crossroads leading in the four directions of the Cosmos, with all of its endless beauty, but coming from that central place of dead silence nevertheless.  The awakening in darkness is followed by a scream of Will to get out and reach the light.  How else can it be?  Awakening is always a becoming aware from a state of not-being, which is incomprehensible to consciousness itself.  In order to fight one's way out of the first impulse, the first emergence, which is always and never in absolute paradox, one has to push away and project one self out of the silent, still well.  Never again back there, to that place!  But it is always there, the seen cannot be unseen, the experience cannot be un-experienced.  So the invention of Time then, of resetting in cycles, forgetting by veiling the memory upon each reset.  How long can a life cycle be before the awful memory resurfaces?  We seem to have found the sweet spot in never truly remembering how it all started.
