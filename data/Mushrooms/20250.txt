At about 7:30 P.M., I walked a short distance with my family to a friend's apartment, where I ingested about 5 grams of powdered mushrooms in orange juice. After I choked down as much of the mushrooms as I could (About 1/4 of a gram remained- I was certain that if I tried to finish the remaining dose I would vomit), I returned to my apartment, leaving my family at our friend's apartment. I had eaten only half of a sandwich that day, and I anticipated that the effects would set in relatively quickly.
