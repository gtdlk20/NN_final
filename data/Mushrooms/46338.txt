At one time i made my friends listen to me talk about Frankie from the MTV show The Real World. Its like we were all talking but no of us were he(a)reing what each other said. The feeling lasted up untill (intill) 11:00 pm thats when i started to come down. These were the best Shrooms they were dank!
