9:27 (T+42) : I have two plants in my house. I realised they were living beings, and the fact I own them must make me take care of them. My mood was still violently shifting from good to bad every minute, and I realised that mood was a critical factor to give an interpretation of reality, that there were infinite ways to consider anything depending on how I feel. Making sure that I would be in a good mood most of the time is really important to understand things properly.
