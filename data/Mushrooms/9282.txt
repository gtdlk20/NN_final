The location was in the countryside  We started after 10pm and we had a few children around at the beginning as there were shooting stars and everyone wanted to see them. After 20 minutes from consuming them, the effects started to become hard to handle. People were giddy and the stars twinkling had a sensational effect. The children were sent to bed and I took over the music as I was aware of the strength of the trip. We had anticipated we could dance and talk and it was looking increasingly unlikely that would be possible. The room was in almost darkness with lights off and 2 candles on the table. We had prepared water, slices of apple and dark chocolate. There was also a pasta bake ready to be consumed later as we had fasted for several hours; myself since lunch time.
