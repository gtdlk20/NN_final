Well, it all started at the beach. We were celebrating 420 and I decided to start the day with some Puerto Rican shrooms. This is my second time experimenting with shrooms. So I get to the beach and eat about a 40 or 45 of dry shrooms and drink it down with a beer. I started feeling it early. I was already tripping and feeling kind of weak. The ocean and sky never looked so beautiful. The water was a deep dark blue and then shifted to a lighter blue. It looked like three different levels of water. I was staring at a tall building that began to wiggle a little.
