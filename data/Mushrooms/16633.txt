I skipped school that day and ate them at home, in the morning, by myself. Within twenty minutes the visuals/mindfuck was already becoming overwhelming. At about 45 minutes in I puked up a small portion of the shrooms. I remember sitting there being mesmerized by the insane swirling fractal patterns of my own vomit that seemed to stretch out into infinity. Minutes seemed like hours. Around that time I called a friend over because I was becoming worried. I believe the conversation went like 'ate shrooms,... too much,... need help..'
