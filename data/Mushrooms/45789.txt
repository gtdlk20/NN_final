I took the mushrooms the day after my brother-in-law's funeral.  I was feeling empathetic towards my younger sister for having lost her husband and the father of her children. But I myself was not sad, if that makes sense.  More so, I had some questions concerning death, and I thought, who better to ask than the mushroom!
