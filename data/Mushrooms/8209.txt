From the start I knew this was the real thing and about 40mins into the experience I felt the urge to have a lie-down.  The P. Cubensis had insisted upon itself, didn't care much for my concerns or objections (not that I had any) and my body was telling me that something profound was underway.  Something on the scale of a planet-wide dust storm on Mars, and that if I resisted it would be a long and unpleasant ride.  I purged most of the shrooms without fighting the waves of intensity that were rubbing the serotonin out of their little neural hidey-holes and replacing them in their receptor sites with psilocybin.
