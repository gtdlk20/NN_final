I loved my job my friends where great and my girlfriend was the best.  That night she broke up with me. She told me that she still felt in love with her ex boyfriend and at this point she really just needed a friend.  I told her that I understood and left. I felt really shitty.  One of my friends told me it would be a bad idea to do any drugs at this point for fear of me having a bad trip. But I didnt think anything could feel worse then what I was feeling right then.  So I got my friend to grab me 7grams of shrooms. For getting them I gave him 1.  5grams and I had the rest. I took them at 7:00pm.  After eating them I went into my friends room and laid on the bed waiting and hoping to feel better and forget about what had happend that night.
