The ounce of shrooms was dumped on the head of our large African drum and divided into five heaping portions. I was sort of the quiet leader, and my portion was considerably larger than the other portions by about two grams. I'm pretty sure I consumed at least 7 grams, but not much more. It was already about 6:00 PM, and the sun was setting so I said, 'Let's eat these guys!' We had found that Cubensis had much more of a profound physical body high and head trip than visual effects, so we had better visual results in the evening time.
