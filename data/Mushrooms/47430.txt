It was one of the most powerful trips of my life, and I learned a lot from my sojourn into death.  Daddy Mushroom showed me that while psilocybin can be fun, it is also easily underestimated.  Every trip I've had on mushrooms has been different, but this time was an epiphany.  No matter how many times you trip, you never really know what to expect when Daddy Mushroom takes you by the hand.
