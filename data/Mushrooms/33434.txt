Maybe 30 minutes down the river things started to pick up big time. I couldn't get comfortable in my tube so I tried various ways of laying in, on, and around it. Eventually I settled in the fetal position, mostly submerged, with just my head above water inside the donut. It made a nice little world in there that prevented me from having to deal with the hordes of other rivergoers.
