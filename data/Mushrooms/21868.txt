Then it was there. My mother. The mother. She was there by my side. Talking to me. Telling me things. Showing me the beauty of my physical body. And wondering why I would mistreat it like I usually do. It was the first body to take care of. The only body that is under my care for as long as I live on earth. I rubbed it and touched it with awe. I was my own daughter and my own mother. I was in ecstasy, being pregnant of myself. That love and care that I'm supposed to take for my body, for myself is the only thing that I need to exercise in order to be a good mother for my coming baby. Who was completely calm. (I usually provoke some of his moving by having stressful thoughts or sudden reactions to a situation.) And that self love was way more profound than meaning to put my 'personal needs' before my baby's. It went into higher meaning. Loving truly the human I'm wearing since I was born, allows my being to love in the same unlimitted and unconditional way for every single being.
