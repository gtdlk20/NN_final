Last night I acquired some shrooms, weighed out 3.7grams and ate away.  Within 20 minutes I was already starting to come up, so I decided to go lay down for a little while.  I call a friend who is away in Florida for a week and as sheÂ’s talking the intensity just keeps growing, more then I have ever felt before.  Eventually during the phone conversation I am not even paying attention to what she is saying, but more so to the green drapes I am seeing hanging from my ceiling.  I have no 'green drapes'.  They floated all around the room, and with my hand I was able to draw their forces to my hand, almost like an electric ball toy you see at stores when you touch the little bits of electricity go to your hand.
