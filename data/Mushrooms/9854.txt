We came across a comfortable looking hollow in the gentle undulating sand dunes. A good place to rest, I sat down and in doing so I turned around and sat facing, guess what? The sunset. And I was blown away! Magnificent, beauty beyond description. We marveled, we were enthralled. This lead on to a discussion of stars and planets and the Earth turning and then we imagined piloting in a plane flying into the sunset. It would last for hours but eventually it would escape from you. We were imagining all the international pilots and as they look at their paperwork they are pleased to find out that they are scheduled to fly into the sunset. We imagined the piloting crew totally chilled out just like us right now silently sharing unspoken profound gratitude to be able to enjoy a six-hour sunset together.
