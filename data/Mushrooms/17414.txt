I was also conscious at the same time of a parallel speech in my mind which was independent of my own inner speech. It had a life of his own. It 'sounded' French (I am French speaking) but had no meaning. It was so rapid, I failed writing down any word at least phonetically and being meaningless they left no trace in the short memory. Very strange phenomenon. Could be linked to glossolalia ??
