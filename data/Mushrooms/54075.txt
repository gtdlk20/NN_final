We first decided to play sum old school n64 Mario cart until the effects came on so we played that for about a half hour until every 1 was feeling really 'different. After that we decided to go out on my screened in porch to chill. So we were just chillin and starting to trip pretty good when the first really random thing happened right out of the middle of nowhere, I was talking to Akmed about something random when all of the sudden I saw a black shape form right next to Akmed. I reached out to touch it and found it to be my German Shepard dog Otto which is really unusual because he is suppose to be chained up in my yard but instead he sum how unclipped himself and decided to chill with us which was all good anyway cause he's the nicest dog youd ever meet.
