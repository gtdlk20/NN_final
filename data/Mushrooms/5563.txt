We sat on the stage of a small outdoor amphitheatre made of stone, and I imagined a few times that the seats were filled with thousands of people watching our little show, though the theatre could probably just fit a few hundred people at most, and it really only contained the four of us.  At one point I stopped in midsong to tell a joke, and then my friend and I forgot about the music.  We picked up some sticks from the fireplace in the middle of the amphitheatre and proceeded to swordfight clumsily while jumping up and down the rows of stone seats.  After much horseplay and running about which seemed to last a half hour, we remembered about the music and returned to the stage.  We jumped back into the musical trance from the same point where we had left off as if it had never been interrupted.  That truly impressed us all, and the music was then that much more euphoric and powerful.  I would recommend smoking mushrooms, but it is nothing like eating them.
