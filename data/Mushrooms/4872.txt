I walked about the room with headphones on, musing that this kicked the everloving shit out of DXM (the only other substance Id ever tried) and its beautiful dreamy music. This was euphoric, rushing past my head yet lasting such a satisfyingly long time. Nothing could possibly upset me. I, a mild arachnophobe, saw tiny spiders crawling across my vision, and I laughed and said Dont start with the spiders. Sure enough they went away, and then I closed my eyes and things went to a whole new level.
