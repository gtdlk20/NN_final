After finally finding a ride home, I started to feel a bit better. But as soon as I walked in the house I began to feel scared again. The patterns started to appear again. But now the patterns where consumed in everything I looked at. I was stuck in patterns. My thoughts slowly began to race, I was now unable to concentrate on any single thought. My heart began to race, I felt my soul was being ripped from my body. I thought I was dying, and tried lying down to relax my body, as my mind was telling me, I was preparing my soul for death. Not my body, but my soul.
