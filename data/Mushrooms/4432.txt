While on the couch Dee and I continued to talk extremely fast elaborating on a multitude of things. All of a sudden there was a tearing open of our hearts and we realized that everything is the way it should be, the bad and the good. I talked about how I donÂ’t have the relationship I would want to have with my father and that I would want to have an experience like this with him so we could really understand each other better. At this moment I valued family more than I ever have. It was as if all the priorities I have were seen in the perfect order for me to be happy. At this moment I valued family more than I ever have.

Dee was talking about how he was able to understand his psyche and mind in a way he never thought was possible. He was frantically exclaiming how he was going to tell me how he thinks. Not like an opinion but in a structural way in which is mind puts thoughts together. He looked me in the eye and I immediately stopped him because I already knew what he was going to say. I t was as if the moment he looked me in the eye I knew exactly what thought was in his head. To this day I do not know if that was because I was experiencing the exact same thought of somehow he thought was put in my mind in an unexplainable way. I understand how hard it is to believe but as the conversation continued we both were convinced we could somehow perform some kind of mental telepathy.
