T +1:30?  I am now starting to become overcome by the visual and physical effects.  My body awareness is noticeable altered and touching my face becomes a strange experience.  Textures also take on a distorted proportion and my face sometimes feels slippery, I begin touching many things around me.  I decide I would be more comfortable lying down on the couch, which E has been doing for some time now.  Shawn turns out the lights and I enjoy the effect.  J has been upstairs for sometime writing in a journal.  Many of the non-trippers appear to be uneasy about our physical state and many comments are made about the size and depth of my pupils.  My sense of time at this point is nearly non existent.
