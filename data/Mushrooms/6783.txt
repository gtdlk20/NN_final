The second night of spring break in my freshman year of college was the best night of my life.  College opened my mind to lots of new things and I had only tried smoking and vaporizing weed and occasionally trying salvia.  I never had a breakthrough experience with salvia and was usually left with a mild headache.  My friend set me up with a little over an ounce of z-strain psilocybin mushrooms to bring up to my friends who were shroom-less.  I was trying to unload some of these shrooms so I went up to see my girlfriend at her school on a friday night and asked if anyone was interested in buying some shrooms.  Well the deal was done and 5 of us decided we would all shroom that night.  I had never taken any kind of psychedelic and was very excited and curious as to what would happen.  The next 7 hours were the most amazing of my life.
