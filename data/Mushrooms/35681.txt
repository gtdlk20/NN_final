So I headed into the woods. I was coming up quickly and the screen was very prominant in my vision. When I close my eyes there's this weird screen of static in front of me. I find when I get high the screen gains more prominence. Patterns appear on it and swirl around or noises come out of it.  In really hightened states the images on the screen become so real that I can't differentiate between the screen and reality.
