I am sitting in my room smoking a joint of MJ.(mixing herbs always has good effects). I noticed my MJ garden seemed very very bright, almost celestial. The lights were starting to get halos and i felt very jittery and uncomfortable. This is usually common when first effects are noticed.I put on some Pink Floyd(Dark Side of the Moon) and relaxed. My advice to anybody doing hallucinogenic drugs is relax. The reason 'bad trips' occur is because either people do too much to start with, or they arent ready for the effects. Mushrooms are not a soft herbal tea, they contain a chemical that is very powerful and overwhelming. Most people aren't ready for the fact that this substance takes control over YOU, you become small and helpless to its effects. So don't take any unless you are ready to relax and let the mushroom take you, you dont take it.
