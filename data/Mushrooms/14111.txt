During this time on the edge of the tub, I had an odd dream or vision of myself as an abstract entity made of black and white blocks with muscle and sinew diagrammed in the blocks and that I should be proud of how strong and powerful I had made myself, but that in life all of that power was now directed to suppressing pain and supporting the frailty of my aging self, and that the inevitable outcome was that this would consume me and I would end, it is just a matter of how long the struggle will be.
