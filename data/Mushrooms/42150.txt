Sat on a bench for a while, cusp of hallucination, always on the curb, something always on the tip of my tongue. But nothing really mattered. That was the theme of the night. The answer to every question can be, it doesnt really matter. The universe will exist forever, I will exist forever, maybe not my memories and self as I know it, but part of me, maybe just the quantum entanglement of particles in all our neurons, will be one and this universe, every dimension, will continue in a giant loop. But it doesnt really matter. I found the meaning of life and everything, I am now utterly convinced there is a higher plane of existence. But that plane of existence is aware how shitty it is compared to being a beautiful ignorant human. That saying, ignorance is bliss, how true it really is. The answer to time, reality, everything, is too much to handle for a human being. Our brains, as amazing as they are to us, have a limit, they are not infinite. Might as well be to us but they are not. I believed to truly experience the truth of the universe could be equivalent to human misery. Compared to our world this higher plane seems like a dark prison contained in a loop of non-existent time.
