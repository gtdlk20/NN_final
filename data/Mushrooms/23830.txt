As soon as the peak ended I lost the deep connection I felt with the world and my spiritual feeling.  I wondered how it got to be 4 in the morning already as the peak of my trip (3 hours) seemed to be over in a heartbeat.  I longed for something more, however, I felt I recognized a new beauty that wasnÂ’t there before.  I felt as if the new insight I gained tonight would stay with me in the morning. I was drained of all my energy and wanted to sleep but my brain would not slow down.  I felt as if I was a computer that had been running too intensely for too long.  To sum it all up, this was the greatest night/morning of my entire life.  Better than sex, better than smoking, better than drinking, better than anything.  I learned so much about life and death and felt a much stronger bond with all my close friends.  It was truly a life changing experience.
