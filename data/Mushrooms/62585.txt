My two experiences smoking mushrooms have gone like this, the 1st time was at a house party, myself being drunk and high (mota) ambled into a room with 3 people smoking out of a water pipe.  I was informed it was mushrooms and inhaled a a time or three.  Honestly I can't remember how many, but it was a good sized bowl, probably about 2 grams or so in it.  The effect:  I went into the room fucked up and walked out stone sober.  I hung around the party for about another hour, got bored and went home.  I'm not sure if that was normal, but hitting that pipe completely zeroed me out.
