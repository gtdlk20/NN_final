Standing back on the rocks looking down the river with all the trees, haze, and bobbing puffy white people in tubes, I felt like I wasn't making any progress. I needed to get to the end of the river, so I started swimming. Somehow, and I have no idea how, I wound back up in the group, tubeless. People asked me all sorts of shit, like where I'd been, etc, and still I felt no obligation to reply sensibly to these 'dream people'. Occasionally something would happen, like Sara shooting me with a squirt gun, and the combination of the seeing and feeling the event would make me think, just for a second, that this was actually happening.
