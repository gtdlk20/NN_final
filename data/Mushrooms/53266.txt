I emerged from the trance, unsure of who I was, where I was, what was going on, or why I felt the way I did. I had a number of disturbing thoughts, such as 'I must be dead- I've always known it would happen to me, here it is..' I saw my 3-month old daughter, and heard a voice telling me that I had, in a way, become her, and that I might as well be dead because I had fulfilled my purpose on this planet. Still yet another voice was telling me that I was not actually dead, but was just now experiencing life for the first time. Another voice told me that the Universe had just came to an explosive and violent end and that I was sitting in the twisted wreckage, and another voice told me that I was entirely responsible for its destruction. Confused and frightened, I threw on some pants and a sweater and ran as fast as I could to get my family.
