As I laid on my bed and let my music play, I suddenly saw a few long blue hairs reaching down towards my face. They got very close and soon, I could actually feel them on my face. These hairs grew thick and dark. They became the blackest color I have ever seen and took the resemblance of tentacles and they were still getting closer, I was being eaten by some large black octopus thing. Seeing how this was getting dark I merely accepted it and moved closer to let it consume me. I remember thinking, I am here to learn whatever I need so show me what you want.  I quickly was in a place full of faces and rooms. I was intrigued but then wanted to see my own face. I was able to turn and look into my own space. The face I saw however was not mine, it was my wifes. Clear as day and it was clear at this point that my wife and I shared some part of our soul. I know that sounds corny but we are very close and it makes perfect sense to me. Suddenly her face started to cry and I was not in my head any more but at my own funeral staring at my wifes face as she was being hugged by the people that came. I felt very happy that I now knew that no matter what, as long as my wife was receiving love from somewhere that I would be part of it even after death. Again, this part seems morbid but it was not. After accepting this I was hurled through all sorts of places and saw many things. I watched as the first two cells split for the first time and how later this conscience like thing actually built the human mind from all sorts of things to give itself maybe a structure. Or purpose. Anyways, it was unclear whether this was the universes first cells or my own but it was clear that they were both the same thing and so it was worthless to try to tell which it was. I was meant to watch, not think. And although I cried like a baby throughout this entire adventure, I never felt sad, just supreme love.
