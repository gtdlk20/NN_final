Paranoia remained with me for a while. I was very confused. Why don't the police want me to do this? What is a police? Am I a police? I was struggling to remember what I did for a job and then I'd remember and be confused by the thought of what it was I did anyway. I sat on the balcony for a while trying to figure out if sitting on a balcony was a normal thing for people to do.
