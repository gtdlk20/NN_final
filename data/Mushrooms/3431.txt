Sometimes when I'm having visions I have sudden broadening of conscience. It's like I understand the laws of psychedelic culture. I understand the need to enter such altered reality, because everything is so astonishing and it is always that way, but we cannot perceive that way. It's like if my consciousness is always in that part of the world but I didn't realise it. Then I had visions of my past, parties, clubs. I remember all the tales I knew about psychedelic substances, and everything was matching my actual experience. I understand art as a way to express the altered reality and project it into the normal world. I feel the creative potential of such substances. I want to record every single thing I'm experiencing, but I do fear I loose something, thoughts are so fast and powerful. I start taking pictures of everything. It doesn't matter what I'm aiming atÂ… everything is wonderful. I start spinning around, happy as ever. I look at the mirror. Some say never do that. But I think I'm beautiful and in a perfect shape, radiant. I sit on the sink, then I get lost I don't know where. Like if consciousness has stopped.
