All in all it was an amazing trip, although there were alot of times of being very frightened and out of control. I dont think there is a bad trip, its just how some people take the language of the mushrooms.I dont think I will fully be able to welcome the full ego-dissolving mushroom dose for a long time to come, but hey this was never supposed to be easy from my experience mushrooms are a life long journey, practice makes perfect. But its not about the goal, but the journey.
