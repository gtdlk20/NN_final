Why? I practically yelled, Why arent you angry? Were not just hurting ourselves, were demolishing the rainforests, polluting the atmosphere, raping the earth. Were hurting YOU! My voice trailed off along with my sudden burst of passionate, indignant rage. The trees spoke more clearly than ever, again through feelings, not words. My voice trailed off along with my sudden burst of passionate, indignant rage. The trees spoke more clearly than ever, again through feelings, not words. Their sadness came from pity - pity for any species so hellbent on destruction. Their tranquility came from the understanding that the greatest collective goal is to facilitate life, not end it. Humans, as opposed to other mammals have become artfully cruel in their methods of killing. For this, nature weeps, as a mother would for a son who has made a tragically poor decision, her tears coming from an inner holy place of unbreakable, forever enduring love. In this tender way that afternoon, nature wept for man.
