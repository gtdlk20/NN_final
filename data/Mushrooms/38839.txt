After a few songs I drifted away from the concert and started closing my eyes. This is when I met the entity which felt like the mushroom. It shared itself with me, I experienced mushroom consciousness, connected to the mycelium network, being one, experienced great love, honesty and warmth in the entity that shared itself and after many communications we said goodbye when we felt it was time and slowly the distance grew and I knew I would forget the reality of this meeting, the wonderful feelings I had but it didnÂ’t matter. I just knew I wanted to meet this wonderful being again and promissed to come back. During all of this a thousand other things happened, the room, my friend, the music, the light, my self, the visuals.
