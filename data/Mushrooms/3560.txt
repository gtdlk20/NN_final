I thought of the word TRIP again and in a flash I once again I traveled somewhere new. I once again became rippeling waves of energy and was transported. There were these strange adults standing around talking about me. They had that same strange grin that my English teacher had. There was magic in the air. I could see it, I could touch it. They understood the magic of these mushrooms. You eat them and permanently enter this new world. I was going to be in this state forever. In this magical world for the rest of my life.
