T +0:45  Nausea begins to kick in. I am happy for this means I must be coming up. I welcome the nausea and I relax. As it begins to subside I notice the first effects. The blinds on my windows have turned a blue-green tinge rather than their normal white. Also the frames around them are curving and waving, this will be of huge importance later. I realize I only have 1.25g left. What a waste to keep this. I down it and realize I have just done 5g. Twice as much as I intended for. A, Heros Dose, according to Bill Hicks. I brace my ego for a beating. I know that I will never forget this night.
