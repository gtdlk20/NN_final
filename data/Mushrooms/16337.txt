I am addicted to nicotine which I administer through a vaporizer, but hadn't used any for 6 hours. I am not on any medications and take no supplements. I did have a pacemaker installed a couple of years ago because of an AV block though. Other than that I am in very good health. My heart, lungs, veins, arteries, muscles and bones are great shape according to the doctor. The heart of a teenager. The face of an old man.
