Another notable feature of the trip was my inability to discern negative motives in people.  From time to time drunk people would come pretend to be nice in order to try and get a cigarette or just to call us losers (this was one specific occassion where a drunk couple explained that we were missing out on the fun on the other side of the slope, unless of course we were 'on acid or something'... hehe)  Anyway the amazing thing was that I was simply unable to tell that anything but true bonding was going on here.  Granted this would not be good all the time, but for someone as cynical as myself it was a welcome relief from brutal reality.  This is also in direct contrast to the exaggerated cynicism that acid sometimes gives me.
