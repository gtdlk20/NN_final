We picked up our friend from a meeting and I felt too uncomfortable to enter the building in my state. He ran out to us and I noticed the ground was covered in fungus looking red dots. Back at his place, he turned on a strobe light and played metal through some sub woofers. I figured I would have fun and move to the music, but it made me disoriented. I tried to keep my mood lifted, but things became so cartoon-ish and distorted, I felt like I didn't know where to put my focus. My thoughts began racing and the paranoia elevated. I went to get a drink of water and it was suggested that we go to yet another friend's house.
