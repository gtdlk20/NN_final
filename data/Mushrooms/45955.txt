1:35 PM - Feeling a slight increase, very likely from the second part starting to work in combination, a bit more relaxation, not too euphoric but definitely a slight mood lift and general decrease in inhibitions, like a couple of medium beers. Speech is still mostly fine but a growing head-heaviness is making itself apparent, which is rather pleasing, feels nice and relaxed in my face, and when I look round, even slowly, I get a pleasurable smooth feeling throughout my head. It's odd, mild, but enjoyable. No anxious thoughts whatsoeverÂ… I don't suffer from anxiety, but I definitely have the typical 'not give a crap' attitude which feels pretty good- would be fantastic taking 0.25mg an hour before tripping if you're prone to anxiety :) I'm wanting to talk a bit more and join in conversations which feels good, feels flowy and enjoyable to communicate. I feel like some music would be pretty nice right now. Time maybe going a little faster than usual? Interesting. A-OK so far.
