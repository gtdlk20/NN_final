The most vibrant visuals came from looking up at the clouds. They were constantly shifting and molding together in a bright blue soup. I had to force my eyes away from the clouds and look down, because I think could have stared at them mesmerized forever. When we got to the house around 3:30 everyone's mood rose considerably. We got comfortable and my friend turned on the TV which immediately put me in a trance. The screen seemed to be a window into another reality, and it was starting to blending into the real world in the living room. Periods of uncontrollable laughter came and went. Someone asked what time it was, I looked at my watch but it made no sense to me. The tiny chrome lines were dancing around and vibrating in a most comical way, and I couldn't tear my eyes away from it. Time was a concept I couldn't begin to understand. It was nothing, it didn't matter at all. After another half hour that seemed like eternity my friend P (who's house we're at) announces that he must leave for work.
