After this experience I've had seconds thoughts about drugs in general, particularlly strong psychedelics.  I have planned to stay away from them for a very long time, even marijuana for a while. This was just to overwhelming.  I guess I should have followed the guy's disclaimer before eating an 1/8:  'I don't recommended eating an entire 1/8th.  These will rock your world'
