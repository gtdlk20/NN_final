The next morning, I left for Ketchum, Idaho highly anticipating seeing old friends and tripping balls.  The day finally came when I had planned to drop the magic mushrooms, and I could barely wait.  On this day we traditionally take a trip to Red Fish Lake for the day, and have milkshakes at a restraunt on the way back.  During 'Quiet Time' I ingested the wonderful chemical, and it was time to go to the lodge and make our sandwiches.  I'm really glad that I ate my mushrooms when I did because I was sober while doing things requiring motor skills.
