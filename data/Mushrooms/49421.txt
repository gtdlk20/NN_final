The shrooms kicked in at about 20 minutes. Amazing swirling visuals in the rocks and some rock faces with vertical lines appeared to be dancing.  As I entered deeper into the experience, I began to distrust the place we were in. It seemed almost TOO trippy - the walls were sculpted by ancient waters and had looked like wailing souls - the heat still penetrated form these rocks even though the temperature was cool. I climbed out of this evil canyon and found a rock that overlooked the entire site.  As my friends explored and tripped, I watched and danced. I danced for my friends still in New York and I danced to protect myself from evil. I kept repeating 'one two three' over and over again while I danced. The visuals still strong after a hour and a half.
