T+02:45ish - W began to doze off after a while, and we all got up and resumed walking in order to avoid passing out in the cold (it must have been below freezing out, but none of us felt the cold in any negative way).  We neared the end of the waterfall area and needed only to cross the creek, and I slipped.  My foot fell into the creek and got soaked.  Now we had gone into the woods and I had gotten wet, just like D had warned us not to do.  I began to worry that I might get frostbite and that worry manifested in the form of some paranoia.  I began to feel less comfortable with the trip and wanted to get back indoors.  W's house was our closest available destination, about a mile away, and I had to make a bowel movement.  I complained about my stomach discomfort, to which R responded with a story about having seen a friend on shrooms go through nasty diarrea in the past.  I imagined him squatting and shitting in the woods with R watching as if there were nothing unusual about such a scene, and couldn't think of anything funnier at the moment.
