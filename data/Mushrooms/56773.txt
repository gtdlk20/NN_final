Unfortunately for me, things turned a bit sour. I got scared and panicky, which led me to believe that my family was out to get me. I looked out the door of my room and into the hallway where my brother was standing. He was very scary, and he was angry at me for something, so I retreated back into the haunted sanctitude of my room.
