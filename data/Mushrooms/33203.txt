For some strange reason I occasionally had a slight sensation of mousey or rabbit ears above my head (in peripheral vision) which was not a visually real effect but just sensed in a cartoonish way. I paid this no attention because I knew it was all illusory and would pass. Later I recalled someone had recently given me a 2007 calendar with a squirrel on the front!
