My preferred method of dosing is to simmer the mushrooms in water for about 15-20 minutes and then add a large amount of chocolate powder to try mask the flavour. I put that in a flask and walked to the area I had chosen, which took around an hour. I had taken precautions such as setting a timer on my phone when I started drinking so I knew roughly when I was peaking and to return before it got dark, should I forget in my elated headspace, and I also let some friends know where I would be.
