I bought the quarter and had somewhat low hopes for the shrooms. They didnt look very well grown compared to all the other good shrooms Ive eaten (Ive tripped on shrooms 20 something times, at least enough to consider myself well versed at the time). I later realized that the shrooms, which were black, were black because of how much bluing they had.
