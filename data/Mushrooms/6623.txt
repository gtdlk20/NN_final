At this time I was curled up on a seat, my face buried in a pillow, unable to do anything, and a prisoner to my mind. I had intense closed eye visuals, although my concentration was so screwed that I would often forget they were there, and when I became aware of them they often made me feel worse, because all I desired at the time was to be sober. I felt unable to speak, and I couldnt respond to my friends when they asked if I was ok. Combined with the mental problems I was an emotional wreck. I felt totally and profoundly depressed, extremely sad and regretful for what I had done, and full of pity for my suffering. I thought about death, and it seemed like such a beautiful escape. I knew I didnt want to end my life, but I was having such a terrible experience that I felt I would do almost anything to stop it. I constantly thought I wish I was sober, and I desperately wanted to ask my friends for help, but I couldnt bring myself to ask. Im not sure why, but I felt it was my fault and it would be unfair to ruin their trips. I was only vaguely and occasionally aware of their presence and voices.
