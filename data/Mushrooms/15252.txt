I get in the room and announce with glory I am tripping, my two friends reply that Nitz is on webcam right now on msn and I cross over the room and chat somewhat with him. Then we resume our places and start to trip in a group. The first thing we notice as a group while listening to music and talking about school and stuff is that we lost total sign of time. The only source of time knowledge being the comp clock we assign the Job to Gimpy of writing the time now and then and noticing us of the time.
