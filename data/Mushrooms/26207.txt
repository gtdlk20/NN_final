Over the next several hours, a small desire to trip grew. I kept telling myself I shouldn't take mushrooms on a Sunday night by myself in my room, seeing as I would be practically dead in school the next day, not to mention the fact that being alone on mushrooms can be a very bad idea for some. I also thought it might be bad to take the mushrooms because my girlfriend was decidedly anti-drug at the time, and me taking any drugs could greatly upset her and send her into a deep fit of depression and self-abuse that used to be part of her everyday life.
