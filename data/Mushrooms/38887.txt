In grade school I was considered a somewhat 'gifted' student. I easily acheived high exam scores and never studied. When I arrived at Middle School, sixth grade, I realized I was in for something much more challenging. It was a challenge I didn't want and still feel I don't need or anyone needs. Fun was at the top of my list. I couldn't care less for grades, academic acheivement, etc. This attitude brought me into summer school for a few years, the consequences of being a slacker in school.        But, I made it and survived Middle School and arrived at High School in Long Island as an optimistic, creative young man. The first time I smoked weed was with two girls I knew, and two of their friends, guys who were seniors. Now I didn't realize it at the time, but those girls who sort of became my 'guides' in high school were friends with the biggest stoners in the school.
