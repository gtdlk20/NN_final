The man was thrilled, and we made the trade, wished each other well, and continued on our respective ways.  The rest of the night was fairly uneventful, and after drifting off to sleep, safe in my tent, I awoke to a beautiful cloudless day.  I wandered over to the area where my closest friends also attending the concert were, but was turned away by the people watching the gate.  My friends were part of the food service crew, and therefore had different wristbands, wich gave them the priviledge of better camp sites, etc.
