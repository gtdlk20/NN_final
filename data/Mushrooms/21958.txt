I walked into my house and went strait to my room where I couldnt sit still. I was scared out of my mind. I was extremely hott so I went to the shower (DUMB DUMB DUMB).  I dont know what happened in the shower, but when I got out... I didn't know who I was, where I was, or how to put my clothes back on (or even what clothes were for that matter). I didn't know who I was, where I was, or how to put my clothes back on (or even what clothes were for that matter).  So I held my towel and emediately walked to the kitchen and grabbed a gallon of milk.  My dad found me in the kitchen naked with a gallon of milk in my hand.  He said, 'What the F*** are you doing?'. I then said, 'I am dieing and I dont know what to do.'  My dad told me to put on my clothes but I still didnt know how so he sat me down and attempted to calm me down.  I called sean and our conversation went like this, I said 'sean?' and he said 'Nathan, I am freaking out, I'm sitting curled in the corner of my room and we are out of milk! Am I going to die?'  I was trippin to so I tried my best to calm him down. He then screamed 'ahhhh!!, I got to go' and hung up the phone.
