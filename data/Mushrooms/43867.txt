I'd say my portion out of the three my friend split up was the largest. I ingested roughly around 2-2.5grams. They were just plain dried mushrooms and we just ate them as is. Don't believe the hype that people say that they're DISGUSTING, cause honestly they just kind of taste like dirt. But I chew all my portion up, we all drink our OJ that Mitch brought. I probably had an apple, a banana, some toast with peanut butter to eat before I came out but that was like two hours prior. So not that much but I still wanted some fuel because of the hiking that's required to even get to our spot.
