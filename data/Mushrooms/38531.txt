As we walked, I started thinking about my altered senses and in that I had a horrible realisation that nothing was really how I had always imagined it. The world which I saw all my life was simply fake - it only existed to my physical senses and with that I entered a disturbing train of thought about how the world really was, I was obsessed with this thought - what was objective reality really like? Nothing existed to me anymore, I completely stopped trusting my senses and this was perhaps the worst part of the trip. My metal state started deterioting, I was now in this awful train of thought and started wondering whether I could ever get out off it again. Would I be like this for the rest of my life? Always questioning everything and trusting nothing, not even my own senses. Would I be insane forever I wondered...
