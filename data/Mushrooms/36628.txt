I started to see the beautiful music glowing out of the stero, colors of light streaming in and out of eachother like a lazer show, warm tears streaming down my face. Angels singing to me from the stero, like it had a direct antennia to heaven. I look over at Joe. His world is still cold and gray as he sits there going 'I don't get it!!'. We decided it was time to walk Joe home.
