Me:Im not denying what this equipment had been for, Im really not.  I just want you to know that at no time had we been planning on growing anything with the equipment.  And besides, I thought it wasnt evidence, until you guys had made it so.  I just wanted to rid of ourselves of legal technicalities, to prevent incidents like this.  Also, we werent even planning on keeping it, a friend of ours wanted it, and so we were going to give it to him pretty soon.  You see, I had a past where I was interested in this stuff, but no more.
