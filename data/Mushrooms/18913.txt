Just after we drank the tea we went to wash D's car.  After a half hour you could feel the scoobs coming on.  Clasic aprehention, sped up thoughts, and a medium body load.  We got done washing the car and smoked a bowl of some good herb.  It's great to smoke on the come up of shrooms, it really puts me in the zone and relaxes me a little. I definitly trip harder and it can be intence but if I am familiar with both substances I can feel their distinctions.  We decided to go back to D's and see how buddy was doing.  He was happy to see us when we got there.  It was an awsome day out side so we went out and sat on the grass.
