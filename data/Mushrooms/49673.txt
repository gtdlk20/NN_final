People were fire-breathing in the back garden, which was overlooked by the room I was in. every now and then, someone would fire-breathe and for a split second it would light up the entire room. It was incredible. But now, I was conscious of a lot of strangers being in the house and the general atmosphere and feel of the house was very important to me. I just wasnt comfortable. Rob came up and spoke to me and KT and that calmed us both down quite a lot. However, I think by that time it had become apparent that the trip would not end well if I stayed in the house. Thats a big regret for me. I should have tripped somewhere that I would be sure of only coming into contact with people I trusted. You feel so open and exposed you dont want strangers around.
