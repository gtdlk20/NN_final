This was definitely one of the most fun trips I have ever had, though I would not classify it as one of the best. The come down was dominated by the girl with the strong personality who kept on trying to watch tv instead of listening to music and talking the rest of us. Perhaps she felt a little bit of that ego loss and got scared, seeing things about herself she is not ready to deal with. I am not one to judge and I just hope that she learns to give herself the chance she deserves. These mushrooms definitely showed me a side to tripping I never knew existed and, though incredible, I may reserve for the trips that I want to straight euphoria instead of the popular introspection.
