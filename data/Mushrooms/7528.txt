We finally congregated in an apartament and watched a little TV while talking.  The sad thing was that the two were already tripping and were both scared out of their minds to be without me as I was experienced with taking care of tripping people.  I didn't trip until later.  We decided to get out of the shady claustraphobia that was enveloping us and to go for a walk to a near-by bridge.  I started tripping and just feeling good.  Usually when I eat mushrooms I hit hard and fast and delve into the nether realms of my own mind only to find nothing inside rolling around.
