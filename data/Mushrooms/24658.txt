One word amazing thats what this was amazing, Never have I tripped so hard. It began at 2:30 were me and my friend who I will call R were goin to take them at his house. I took 2 fairly thin mushies with half inch caps and 3 inch stems and another half stem. I ground them up and let them sit in lemon juice for 10 min. I fasted for 16 hours beforehand.
