As soon as this idea popped into my head I had such a frightning feeling shine from inside me.  I said aloud to myself 'no, no darren dont think about this no good will come of it.'  Weeeell I couldnt stop I just had to go there I could not distract myself from this perfect chance to trip balls and ponder GOD. The next thing I know I have to puke.  And I mean this is a serious problem I MUST puke now for all that is sacred.  So I run upstairs and I sit on the edge of the bathtub with my face over the toilet and I let it FLYYYYY! I opened my eyes and looked into the toilet and saw a pretty brown (that was the chocolate :)) spiral galaxy twirling in the water with a sort of translucent cloudlike structure trailing it.  Then I close my eyes and rest on my knees and then I saw it...
