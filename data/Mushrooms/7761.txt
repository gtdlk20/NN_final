9pm: we visit taco bell. Going into the building I feel a sense of hostility and it's magnified by the mushrooms. I walk in and sit down with the feeling that everyone there knew I was tripping, and that they were going to report me. I'm sweating balls, and freaking out at the same time. My friend orders food, but I can't even look at it because the scared feeling makes me lose my appetite.
