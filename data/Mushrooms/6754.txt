I was in a black void, an absence of existence. The miniscule, unimportant thing known as existence stretched in a two dimensional ribbon along this continuum. Like a strip of film, it had frames, but each frame was a different time and place in the universe, and each was a portal to that time and place. It was then that I realized hat existence didn't exist, and my mind screamed. I pulled a giant sword from nowhere and sliced the ribbon in two. It split, and in a cartoon-like manner, it began to writhe and die.
