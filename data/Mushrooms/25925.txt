The metaphor of birth is endlessly applicable.  Were it not for this concept, I very well may have flipped out.  In waves my bodily awareness began to come back to me.  I was an infant.  The world began to form around me.  Words floated into my head, and I would attach meaning to them as best I could.  I was like a sculptor, teasing form out of a piece of marble.  Words were my chisel.  The form was the world.
