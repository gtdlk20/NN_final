While walking my friends down to a bus stop I again lost control of my legs and just fell down unable to stand anymore; I was forced to crawl on hand and knee recalling being stripped down to a child again and trying to think what the fuck was happening to me, Eventually my arms crumpled as well and I fell on my face, this was at 1:00 in the afternoon on the sidewalk where thankfully a lot of people were not around to observe this very odd behavior, they would have just assumed I was drunk as hell anyway I'm sure.  Finally I was able to stand and walked very awkwardly back to my house, later trying to play guitar I lost control of my fingers too, this is a really sad thing for a musician; I had absolutely no strength to move them anymore, and had to give up most activity for the remaining day and the next.
