I noticed myself feeling chilled and shivering despite wearing a sweater. I decided to get up and move into the sun. I could barely walk correctly. The external world was moving and shimmering quite a bit, and my sense of self was becoming very fractured. Sitting down in a chair, staring at my orange tree and the plants surrounding it, with a juniper hedge behind me, I felt as though my consciousness was a collective of all of the living beings around me, each one expressing itself through my being. The orange tree and company felt like allies, while the shadowy area under the junipers behind me felt like a source of evil. I felt vaguely under attack, and noticeably anxious. This is where I embodied the archetype of the oppressed hero, leading his plant kin out of darkness and towards a hopeful future. A song came to my mind with lyrics to the effect of We are one, we are together, and we will prevail. I felt like I had found my true self. Closing my eyes, I saw fractal geometric objects moving and turning in symmetry, and changing colors with my emotions. Within the sides of these shapes, I could see dozens of smiling faces looking back at me. It reminded me strongly of the final canyon sequence of MGTMs music video for When You Die. I realized I was communicating with the part of myself ordinarily reserved for the dream state. I was impressed by how quickly the effects were coming on.
