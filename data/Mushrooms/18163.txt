Out of the blue, Seth quit his laughing, leapt to his feet, and said, Im leaving. He only made it as far as three feet outside, however, when he collapsed back into the tent, laughing even more.  He told me later that he was planning on roaming the world from then on, that when he said Im leaving he really meant that he was leaving forever.  Matt left the tent then for a walk, and I was torn as to what to do. Leave Matt alone, or Seth?  I decided that I would accompany Matt, as he was actually detaching himself from our property and wandering the campsite alone.  I caught up with him and we made our way to lay on the beach, amazed by the incredible star filled sky above us, impossibly beautiful.  I had never seen a sky like it before, and that wasnt the shrooms either, it was simply breathtaking.  I still had minor, minor visuals, such as certain stars swirling or dancing, but the psychological stuff was all gone.
