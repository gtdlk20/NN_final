After all the equipment was placed in their vehicle, they insisted that my girlfriends mom give me a ride home, so they could follow and confirm where I live.  So once again I was hurled back into the same vehicle as my newly made worst enemy.  Fortunately my girlfriend traveled along with us to ease some of the tension.  Not a word was said besides road directions, my girlfriends mom didnt know where I lived.  I got out of the car and the agents watched me walk inside as they glared at me from the driveway.  And so it was, they didnt arrest us or even give us a handshake.  Although I did get there names on the back of a piece of paper, with there phone numbers just incase I needed to contact them. (Yeah right!)
