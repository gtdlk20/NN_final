Sitting in that same spot made me think about what else was out there, I could sit there forever if I wanted to but I forced myself to go and walk. Walking for probably 2 hours, still not checking in with my friends. I walked on a path and ended up at the cloud line on top of a mountain. It was also breathtaking. Peaceful. My heart was filled with so much joy through out this whole adventure. After walking I stumbled across a beetle, a quite large one at that. I stooped down just to admire it. It then stopped in its path and looked up at me and said The fuck you looking at? to this day I have no idea how that happened. I was so real. Speechless I stood up and walked away without saying anything. There was nothing I could say.
