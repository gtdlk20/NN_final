Its been almost two months and Im still trying to make sense of it all. The best I can do is odd metaphors but it doesnt really do it justice. Some of the more intense parts were beyond language. Imagine trying to explain color to a blind person. This cant be properly explained, only experienced. Now that Im not in that state anymore. Its like I am also the blind person trying to explain color to himself after catching a brief glimpse of light.
