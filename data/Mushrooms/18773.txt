Over a period of about 30 minutes, my state went from curling on the floor in fear to laying on the bed marred only by a slight sense of nausea and continued uneasiness.  I was able to see that the worst of it was behind me, and that it was going to be better, but I coudln't tell how much better, or whether I would be able to leave the room all day.
