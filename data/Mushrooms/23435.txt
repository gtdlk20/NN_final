10:00 p.m. Trevor and I weighed out the shrooms and prepared to eat them. Man did they taste like shit. You know that puppy chow some people make with powdered sugar and chex? Well, they looked a lot like that. I held my nose, chewed really fast and swallowed them with some Gatorade. The taste made me gag a lot but I knew they werenÂ’t going to taste like strawberries.
