After we got out of the attraction is about when I lost track of time for the rest of the night. We got in line for the Millennium Force, which is one of the biggest, and my favorite roller coasters. The visual effects started as soon as we got in line. We spent the whole time looking at all the different types of people in line and talking about them. There was a boy that looked almost like a bat. Hundreds of people seemed to have exaggerated features. Most of our friends told us the crowds would make us paranoid and ruin the trip. We both actually enjoyed being in the crowd. Keeping a positive mindset makes all the difference in a trip.
