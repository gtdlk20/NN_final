I was feeling lonely at this point. Not paranoid, not scared. I couldn't be sure whether the trip had worn off yet, considering I took the last bite around 8pm and my friend told me it could last up to 7 hours. I guessed it probably was,but I still felt off, and definitely lonely. So I grabbed my cell phone and tried for a bit to call my then boyfriend, failing. I knew it would be selfish to wake him up anyway, so instead I just sent him a long line of texts, and I had not said I love you yet to him, but I was feeling very, very loving of him in that moment (probably from the shrooms), and I said something along the lines of, everything is beautiful and I can't sleep and I miss you. In many more words.
