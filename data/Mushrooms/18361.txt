He then thought that putting me on the computer and trying to make me play a game or something would do me some good.  So what did he start up, Counter-Strike of all things.  As soon as it loaded I heard the gun shots ringing away.  I had very bad tunnel vision, seemed like the light at the end of the tunnel was my life and if it went out I would be dead.  Then I saw an image of a team mate getting shot in the head and his head exploding.  That really put me over the edge, I threw the headphones off and was in the need for emotional and physical support, so my roommate gave me a hug.  That was the only time I felt safe.  I knew that if there was someone there hugging me that meant I was still in this world and had not died or something.  After an hour or so of feeling very scared and needing a hug every few minutes, I was starting to come down.  I had to be reassured by my roommate that I was at home and not at the hospital. Even though I saw all the things in our apartment, I was sure that I was somewhere else.  I then sat down falling in and out of this shroom induced world.  Saying to myself I am at home, I am at home, but I still felt that I was somewhere else.  Finally at around 4 am I was able to take control of it again.  I was curled up in a ball with a blanket around me.  At last I felt safe and happy again.  The nightmare was over.
