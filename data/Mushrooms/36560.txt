To me, myself, those around me, and our actions were of infintesimal importance in our universe.  I began to question everything, why do we continually attend jobs when they seem to get us nowhere in life, only adding to our personal leisure.  Even when I viewed the world as a whole in my mind, I was able to zoom out and see how incredibly unimportant and small our planet was in the universe.  I could visualize it in any manner I chose, though my mind prefered some interesting analogies in the form of the Earth as an atom-sized particle buried in all the grains of sand from the entire planet (I am an avid reader of cosmology).  Then W brought up an even more engrossing topic, time dialation, I won't delve into it, but it was an incredibly enjoyable experience to talk about theories of spacetime, relativity, and black holes.  In our state of mind (W was tripping also) we understood the concepts with remarkable clarity and developed theories (probably not very good ones) ourselves.  We felt that there was no problem in the universe that we could not solve, we felt as though our minds had been able to realize their full potential.  We could think as big or as small as we wanted.
