This is an account of the second time that I have taken mushrooms.  I dosed on a complete whim one sunday evening after deciding that it would be amazing to go on a bike ride while the sun was setting.  So I swallowed them all down with some vitamin C and grapefruit juice then proceeded to smoke a bowl.  About an hour later I was feeling the first effects of the shrooms.  I was having trouble seeing clearly and I felt very removed from my surroundings.  At about this time I spotted something very odd.  Ahead of me I saw a cirle of large mushrooms growing near the road.  I rode up to them and stopped in the middle, unable to believe my eyes and unsure whether or not I was hallucinating them (actually the next day I rode by them again and they were real even if not as cool as they had looked before).  I decided that if I just stood where I was looking at the mushrooms I would draw unwanted attention so I quickly continued on my way which was lucky because a few moments later a policeman drove by me.
