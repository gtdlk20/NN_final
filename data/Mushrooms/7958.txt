It was a drizzly autumn day in West Wales when B and I had decided to harvest some of the plentiful psilocybin mushrooms that were freely available in the fields surrounding our village. The vague intention was to collect enough mushrooms that we could perhaps sell them in school, we were around 16/17 [23 to 24 years ago] at the time and this seemed like a reasonable scheme, having experienced the "magic" at fun doses on a handful of previous occasions. We wanted others in on the fun. One of the facts about these fungi that we celebrated amongst our small group of village friends was the fact we could feel so good; have such insight and camaraderie with something that grows in abundance and costs nothing. We were fans.
