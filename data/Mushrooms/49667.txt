I went back downstairs at some point and ended up doing fire-poi. There was a time where I thought I was going to pass out; my arms were just working without me being in control and the noise of the fire rushing past my head was so rhythmical and intense. Everyone in the garden was amused by the moment that I was trying to pass the lit poi to KT and for a second neither of us were too sure whether we wanted to be holding them. We realised this when we had one each. This moment was gloriously short however and we continued in a safe fashion. My ability to do fire poi did not suffer at all; it was all in the attitude, which is how it is generally. I fire-breathed shortly afterwards but the results did not please me. It was like I didnÂ’t have sufficient control over my facial muscles to do it.
