All was good and fun. I started to get a giggly body high around 9:45. The movie was funny and a good watch for the time being. I liked all the characters and sounds of the movie.  Around 10:30 I started tripping very hard. About an hour into the movie the sounds and music of it sounded overbearing and intimidating. I then knew this trip was going to be something extreme. I took a drink of water, smiled and strapped in for the ride. By this time the body high that I had was amazing I felt like I was melting into the chair I was sitting in. I closed my eyes and stood up. When I re-opened them I looked at my friends wall and it appeared to be bubbling and shaking side to side violently. It was fun to watch.
