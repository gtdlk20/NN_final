I decided not to mess with LSD any more, but still felt I was on to something. Being brought up in Ireland, the myth of the pookie was something every kid knew, tales of the mushroom. On a bright saturday afternoon, a friend and I decided to look for the mushrooms. Walking through our local park, we met a man who strangely enough, had the same idea that day and had already collected hundreds. He gave us some bags, and before we knew it my friend and I had collected an estimated 800 liberty caps. We were immediately struck by the synchronicity of the day - everywhere we looked were clusters beside clusters.
