I decided to put gel in my hair and do my hair. I was washing all this gel of my hands and I thought it was blood and I started freaking out.I washed it off my hands and me and my girlfriend went to smoke a bowl of the CHEEBA!. We finished the bowl and walked back from the park and I felt so tired and I wanted to sit on the couch.
