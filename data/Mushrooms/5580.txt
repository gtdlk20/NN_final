T+04:00ish - W lit up a cigarette, which he and R shared.  I had a drag from it, which made me feel sick to my stomach, so I gave up quickly on that idea.  We walked down the street smoking that cigarette, and as we passed D's house, it took great effort for us to avoid waking her up.  'It's hilarious: She told us NOT to come back for her, and now we know why.  She KNEW we were going to!  Let's go to her house, after all, she KNOWS we're going to do it!'  Somehow we were reasonable enough not to go back to her house, as she was sleeping.  We continued down the road, and I began to realize just how distorted my vision was.  The houses we passed grew, shrank, melted and morphed for me and I thought it was the spirits' method of drawing my attention to important details.  I would memorize an address number that seemed to wave and dance more than the others, and I'd keep repeating that number out loud until I saw another one of the same signifigance.
