We only left the dorm twice over the course of the night.  Once, about an hour into our trip, we went outside just for fun.  The entire world was frozen over and many of us were having visuals, so being outside was pretty entertaining.  We slid around on the ice and played in the snow on the main green.  Bypassers must have thought we were insane; everyone else who was out was trying to reach their destination as quickly as possible because it was so cold, while we were just running around like idiots.
