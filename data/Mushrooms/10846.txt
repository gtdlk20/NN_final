I sat down on the bed and looked at the T.V screen, The T.V looked like it was 4 feet tall and 1 foot wide, and the faces on the screen were so distorted I couldn't even begin to describe what they looked like. By that time itÂ’s about 6. I didn't even know what was on the T.V. screen, I didn't even care. I decided to go into the bathroom and look at myself in the mirror. When I got into the bathroom everything was moving, everything was shifting and morphing. I look into the mirror and I don't even reconize what is staring back at me. My head and face are so misshaped and distorded.
