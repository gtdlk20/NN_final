I felt like I had no free will, and I would want to do things, like pick up my phone to check the time, and find that I literally couldnt. Or I would want to talk to my sister and find I couldnt speak, and then she would say something to me, and I would automatically reply. I texted random things to a couple of my close friends. I felt happy, but I still felt like I had no control.
