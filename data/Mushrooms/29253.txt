When we got to the studio I sat down while A set out to do some last minute cleaning to provide us a nicer tripping experience. At this point (about 20 minutes in) I finally started to experience the effects. The curtains in the room were very psychedelic, and I noticed them moving around a bit. I was going to ask A whether the wind comes through the window, when I realized that wasnt the case  the movement of the curtain was just a hallucination. It looked as though the curtain was breathing, and bit by bit I could see this same effect all over the room, not just in the curtains. I was feeling giddy like a child discovering something new, and had a few bursts of spontaneous laughter. Everything felt light and nice and comfortable, especially when A came to sit next to me and wrapped his arm around me. My arm felt especially sensitive to his touch.
