By the time I passed the football field and entered a dense forest, colors were intensified, and the trip was starting to set in a bit more.  I walked along a path and as I passed under a canopy created by a huge broken branch, I reached into my pocket and found that all of my shrooms were gone.  Then, I heard a strange sound as if I were wearing a bike helmet and a raindrop fell on it, but it was a sunny day; oh well, probably my imagination, I thought.
