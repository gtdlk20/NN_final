I then laid face down.  This is where the most intense part of my experience began.  I began to feel reality slipping away, I would shout things pertaining to reality, such as Jessica's name, (My girlfriend whom I am in love with but sadly could not join me that day) which caused me to for a moment believe I was her and then my friend Kevin. I entered a strange world in my head; it was filled with language, numbers, confusion, loss ness, and amazement.  I began to believe that everything in my life up until this point had been an elaborate lie.  I was not Gregg Dix; I was a primitive mind with no real connections to reality except for this body I was soon going to leave.  I forget everything around me and I became one with something else.  I was somewhere new that felt familiar and real, but I was scared to leave 'reality.' Ego lossÂ….reality loss.
