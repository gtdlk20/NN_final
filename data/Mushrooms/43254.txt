The mushrooms should rarely be seen as we saw it that night. We saw it as a recreational drug but it is in fact a tool to further our knowledge about life. That night while I had all the fun, I also learned how actually be cleaner and to pick up my stuff more. I can say that it was the first of many things to show me on how to live a pleasant life.
