I struggled for what seemed like an eternity to go to sleep though it was only an hour. During that time I made calls to everyone I knew and just lied down for a while. At about 5:00am I just decided I was completely sober, no need to be worried of the room or loneliness. I went back to the room and it was locked. I went back to my car to go to sleep. I got a call from M when I was in my car he said he couldn't go to sleep and I told him R locked his door. We both decided to go home. I didn't fall asleep until 7:00 in the morning in my own bed.
