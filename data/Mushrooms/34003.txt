While we waited for Ace to get home from work, I ate a small sandwich and a soda just to give some padding to my stomach before embarking on our journey. Ace ended up running a little late and, unfortunately, did not have time to eat anything before we left for the movie theater. Once we got to the theater parking lot, we pulled out the baggie of mushrooms that we had already divided into 1/8th of an ounce for each person. This is how much I'd eaten in the past and had good results with, so I figured it would be a good amount. I took into account that Ace weighs much more than me so I figured that he'd be alright eating the same amount, even though it was his first time and he had an empty stomach. BIG MISTAKE!
