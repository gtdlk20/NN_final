Im throwing on some music to lighten the atmosphere around here, it is a big empty house with plenty of windows. I dont want to be scared. When I start playing music it feels like really I should just dance a bit. There are six portraits in this room, so I look at the one with the sternest face holding a baby and say; watch this. which I used to do as a kid when there was something that had to be seen, but never ever, really seen.
