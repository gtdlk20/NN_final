Prior to this experience, the only substances I used were alcohol, marijuana, and opium. Some other background information: if I smoke way too much weed, especialy if I hadn't smoked for a while, I tend to trip out (the visuals are nothing like a mushroom trip; much more subdued and far less depressing).
