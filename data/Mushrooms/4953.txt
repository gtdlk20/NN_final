Life is about perspectives. From what you see, feel, touch, hear, taste. When reality is removed, one nearly enters another stage of life, one that is indefinite. Life possibly on Earth: matter cannot be created nor destroyed. I have sneaked a view into this other reality by this action, and at the very least I would say it is incredibly genuine.
