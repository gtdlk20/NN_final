As I explored the wallpaper I started down and saw the tiles on her floor. They were wood imitation and jesus christ what I saw made me grin a whole lot. I tapped on my friends shoulder and was serious and sounded cautious: 'You know that scene from FEAR & LOATHING in the lobby with the carpet warping? Well, I hate to tell you that it's happening right now. Do not be alarmed - it's not carying us away.'
