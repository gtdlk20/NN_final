A few more yards down the trail, the pleasure in my body got so extreme that I couldnt even walk anymore. My legs just gave up and I had to sit down in the middle of the trail and let M cradle me. My visuals were getting more intense and I was getting very emotional. If I closed my eyes I could see fractal patterns in yellow, blue, and green. I told M that I finally understood why the 70s used such ugly colors and I laughed. Ms face became my world as he held me in his arms and smiled at me. Every feature on his face seemed so real and just plain beautiful. The trees in the background were waving and at one point one of the trees became a giant silhouette of a pudding man who was smiling down at me.
