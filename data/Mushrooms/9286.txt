I had beautiful visuals and loads of loving sensation from the mushroom. In conversation with it, I kept going about my intention: wanting to feel beautiful. I got that it is a practice and for parts of the trip, to focus my attention on not engaging my mind and just enjoying it. It took all I had to just receive it. The mushroom appeared to me at various times as a goblin looking man who was making fun. The visuals were very colourful and full of figures and people. I was happy I was close to nature as it felt warm and engulfing. I had three peaks and all of them I felt I couldn't do anything else but to surrender to the visuals and the sensation. I did not want to move nor talk.
