When I woke up, I was completely drained. My brain felt fried.. like it just went through having to make the hardest decision of my life. But I saw the world differently the next day. Objects stood out more, I was able to ask more clearer questions to myself and be able to understand others and myself better. It was almost like I had just gained 100 IQ points. After that experience I haven't done it since. Because I feel that the best experience comes from taking time in between trips to maximize effects on the brain. Was fun, I'm looking forward to the next trip in a few months.
