I just let him go, it was beyond my control now, I had surrendered any control I thought I had and succumbed to the experience. I gently slowed my heavy breathing down to a point that I thought I wasn't in fact breathing anymore. I became convince I was in some meditation trance state and was breathing through my skin. I heard voices around me, talking and asking whether I was dead, I assumed D had been found and medical attention called. These were paramedics who had come and found me dead because I was no longer breathing (actually, it was that swine I'd given mushrooms to earlier. The bastard had more than all of us but still had it together enough to bring his friends back and steal my weed and the brew of mushrooms. The worst thing was that they had taken the saucepan the mushrooms were in as well, that damned well belonged to my mum. The audacity of it!).
