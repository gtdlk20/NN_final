It was a sunny spring day in mid April of 2006. Me and 3 of my friends had been planning to do shrooms for over two weeks now. Being completely stoked for it we went up to a place we discovered called 'Snake Hill' which is 1200 acres of a biological preserve. Going at around noon after school one day, we took the shrooms at 1:00 pm. We then sat in tall green grass and watched the clouds move by as the 4 of us sat and waited for them to kick in. Although one of us was not shrooming because he was the person there too look after us, instead, he got really stoned.
