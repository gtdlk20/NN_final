'Here, take you shoes, off, get comfortable' A kid who was rolling said to me. I must have mentioned that I was feeling sick. 'If you have to throw up, try to do it in this bucket. If you don't make it in the bucket though thatÂ’s okay, we will clean it up.' I didn't want to throw up. I don't know why but I was suddenly determined not to vomit. The nausea in my stomach was steadily increasing but I fought it.
