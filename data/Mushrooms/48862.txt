The clay figure waved goodbye to me and slowly dissipated as it walked toward the edge of my bed. I felt extreme, and really unnecessary sorrow over the little one leaving me. But alas, he reappeared time and time again later on. Including at about 1:00 AM when I went to my cupboard for whatever reason, saw him catch his balance as I yanking a drawer open. He waved at me, and I think where his little mouth should have been, dimples tugged backward in a sign of glee.
