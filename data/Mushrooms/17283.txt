It was a cold day and I had 30 dollars so instead of getting the usual bag of marijuana I had called up a buddy and asked if he had some mushrooms to sell me. He said he had the last 7 grams of the shrooms and said he would give them to me for 30 dollars. I said ok and agreed to meet up with him up town. I walked uptown and saw him right away, I met him in the alley nearby where we had swapped the money with the shrooms. He had left and I went home. I waited until late night. I was in a happy mood and had nothing troubling me. I had nothing to finish up and no work to do.
