This third time was different.  My friend (W) had fifty dollars and wished to put it to good use.  My brother (R) and I had been discussing mushrooms for months and all three of us were eager to try them.  We met someone who had some to sell, so we planned to drive down the mountain to his house and buy them.  R stayed home and slept while W and I left at around 9:00pm.  We returned to my house with a quarter-ounce at about 10:30pm, woke R up, and divided the shrooms into four equal shares: one for each of the three of us, and one for a friend we were supposed to look for that night.
