It was unfortunate that I had to involve my girlfriend in this situation.  It neednt be said I never meant for this to happen.  Hell I didnt even want to involve her in anything illegal.  See the thing is, she is an adult, and the penalty, if they do anything would be far more severe then it would for me.  (Yes, Im a minor, not for long though.)  Although; she had expressed to me her growing interest and had done a lot of reading online on mycology, growing, etc.  She really wanted to do it, but I did persuade her to wait until we were in a more confidential setting, such as our own apartment, out of the country.  I do feel responsible for what happened, because obviously if she hadnt met me, her and her family wouldnt have got into the huge argument that followed.
