I sat there contemplating my role in what had just happened. I felt responsible for my friend's situation. By sending him to the hospital we may have ruined his life. Then again we may have saved it. For the first time in my life, I stayed completely out of it, not taking action one way or the other. I was simply in no condition to interfere and I had explicitly given up my responsibility before the whole event started. With the level of dissociation that psilocybin induced, I came to understand fully something that I had been struggling with for many years. My ego was absent, and therefore being the savior in times of crisis was no longer a part of my self-concept. I came to understand that I am not responsible for all the bad things that happen because I didnt stop them. Sometimes things are beyond my control. I cant save everyone everywhereand that fact was ok.
