This occured on a night in late January. A friend had the house to himself, and his family had left on vacation for the week. On the evening, I had originally wanted to get a tablet (MDMA/xtc) from a friend of mine, but later discovered that friend would not be attending. I tried to make some calls, but was unable to find anything, or contact anyone who could help me out. I was somewhat dissapointed, as everyone else already had their 'substance of choice', and I do not drink. Not exactly that I need a substance to have fun, but i'm sure most people can relate to the shitty feeling of being the sole sober person in a house full of drunk/stoned friends.
