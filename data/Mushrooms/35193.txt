We tried to do some skating in there, but the surface was crap and the shrooms made everything difficult to do, I couldnt even pull off an ollie. I attempted some Bert slides, which didnt go spectacularly well and left me covered in mud and God knows what else, but it was a very trippy thing to do on shrooms.  After what seemed like four eternities, we attempted to leave, out of the summery side of course. I say attempted because we were waylaid by some new trippy things on the wall which we discovered, including numbers counting up from 27 written all over the tunnel walls. We tried to find all the numbers, thinking that this would result in some reward, possibly enlightenment. Eventually we gave up and tried to leave again.
