The active part in the therapy was over after about 5 hours, by about 2:30 PM. I was surprised it was so quick, but possibly grinding the mushrooms before ingesting got them into as well as out of my system quicker than had I chewed them. I got very hungry and ate a medium sized meal, of an apple and some chips and salsa, while talking with my guide about the experience. We took a walk outside.
