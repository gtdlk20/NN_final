So here we are in some guys car we have never met driving across town. We took back roads that all looked so unfamiliar,and thats when I started to freak out. We started down the big hill that soon crossed a river, and as I looked at the road coming up, it was all winding and slithering like a snake. Then the driver turns all the way around in his seat and starts talking to us. I freak out to this day I do not know if he knew we were tripping out or if he himself was messed up, but I was just waiting for the car to go off the bridge.
