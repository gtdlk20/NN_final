This first part is just to explain how I got the mushrooms: it was a very 'butterfly effect'-like chain of events that led us to the mushrooms, which we were not looking for.  I also felt somewhat psychic, and that I unknowingly 'called' the mushrooms without trying.  To make a long story short, my boyfriend and I  were at my sister's pool and saw a car catch on fire.  We and a lot of others from the neighborhood went over to watch and wait for the fire trucks.  A guy was standing next to us, talking about the fire and about how he was just about to go to Shell to buy beer.  I told him that's what I was about to do also.
