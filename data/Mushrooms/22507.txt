In three seperate setions, in which I participated in the sacrament of the flesh of God (Magic Mushroom)and the flower of the tree of life(marijuana) I experienced surges of energy comming from the base chakra and crown chakra, meeting at the heart chakra. It was as though the whole universe had collapsed upon me.
