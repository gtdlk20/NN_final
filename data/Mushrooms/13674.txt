Now I am at peace, at peace with everything. Right after the realization trip I focused hard on eliminating all the stresses and uselessness that governs my current life. I began to rid myself of all inhibitions. I no longer looked at people and tried to get into their heads to see what they were thinking. Now I looked at people and thought about how they were going about things completely wrong, as if they were blind. However, this turned out to be a short selfish phase, but the realization was growing and wouldn't allow me to continue that way. At present, I realize that I have the chance to change things. I feel confident that I can make a huge difference. I still focus on myself to the degree that I'd prefer to leave what I have here. I don't think I can make a difference if I continue to live the conventional life. I want to show the world the freedom of the mind, and I will! You can't imagine the pride I now have in you, after that email. I feel like Goodness has crowned you a general in his army. As long as you continue to understand and allow your mind to grow, the realization will always have a warrior penetrating the system of life.
