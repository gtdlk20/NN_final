So... I bought a 30g container of fresh 'mexican' mushrooms (not sure of the exact variety, but I suspect it was plain ol' psilocybe cubensis, just on visual examination.) I took them bits at a time over the course of about 5 hours starting with about 1/2 hour before entering the museum, not all at once. I ate the largest cap first, then the largest stem about 2 hours later, and the smaller mushrooms whole at about 1/2 hour intervals thereafter.
