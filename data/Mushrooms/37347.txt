The Â‘shrooms came on slowly and gently, not the sudden rush we had both come to expect from previous experiences.  The tribal beats and soaring vocals took on new dimensions, and set the pace for our rise into shroom-consciousness.  These shrooms were unlike the intense caps we had had before.  They had their own sort of personality, very friendly and mellow.  More than ever before, I felt as if I had been given a penetrating insight into things.  Whatever I turned my attention to, I would come up with new connections in my mind, whether it was music, or the news, or whatever.  I felt clear and lucid, like I had greater intelligence and wisdom, and a broader view of the world.
