That was it. The visions ended. Behind my eyes I saw nothing. All I had was the buzzing in my ears, and that was it. This caused very much disappointment for myself. This disappointment soon turned into a very pissed off feeling. I started to think that I should sell the other 1/8 and return to my search for LSD. It's almost impossible to get acid around here, and I'd practically kill for it.
