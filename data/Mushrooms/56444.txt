The trip was mild for me but every one had a great time (plus plus). We dosed outside at a friends house and walked to a forest preserve when they started to kick in. With the mushies in the chocolate they kick in almost twice as fast. On the way to the forest someone lit off a firework that shot a 1/2 stick 100 feet in the air. The blast felt incredible (I felt the air get sucked in and blown out) and my vision totally changed after it went off. There where strange orange neon blobs in my peripheral vision and I felt as if I was observing everything a foot or two above my body.
