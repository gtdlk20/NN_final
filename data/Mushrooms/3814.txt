My watch had such a weird green glow to it and so I focused on it for a while. The hour markers re-arranged themselves so that they formed a smile. I smiled back and then the smiled warped and changed into a horrific mouth with sharp pointy teeth. I took my eyes off of my watch and by that time, the cd was over so I left the dark room.
