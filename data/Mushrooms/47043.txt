Walking around checking out the scenery and the wide variety of fashion statements floating around, just starting to feel the beginning effects of the shrooms, I take a deep breathe and immediately feel the ineffable energy expelled by everybody present. This is a place where people gather and express themselves in any way they deem worth it, not even worrying about impressing or embarrassment. It was like the assembly of this psychedelic camping trip temporarily erases the past, even the immediate past, and erases any worry or thought of the future. Now is the only thing that's real.
