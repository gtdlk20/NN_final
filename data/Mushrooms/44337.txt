It was very fair to say I took to much. I Tried to get up and automatically fell over. Ian took me outside. Despite the complete terror I was in, going outside did make it better. The sky looked beautiful. I looked at the grass and it looked like it was smoking. We sat down and smoked a cigarette, for some reason I felt like the catapillar from alice in wonderland. Looking at ians face is had letters and numbers zooming across it. I finally started to come down, and we went inside, I heard beats of bass in my head, voices, music. All I wanted in the whole world was to go to bed and have this maddness end. It took an hour and 20 mins. To kick in, I felt the full effects 15 mins. After that... Unfortunately, my plateau was 5 and a half hours, and come down was about an hour or two.
