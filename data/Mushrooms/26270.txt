For what I believe was the third and final time that night, I got up to use the bathroom. Again, the posts looked bizarre and the ground rippled, but as I was coming down off the trip, everything was more normal. However, every second I walked, every step I took, I heard voice behind me: my mother, my father, and at times the entire world. They seemed to whisper unintelligibly until I turned around, and all I would see was an empty hallway. As I entered the bathroom, I heard my mother's voice clearly behind me. Andy, what are you doing? In paranoid fear, I shook, and I turned around. Nothing.
