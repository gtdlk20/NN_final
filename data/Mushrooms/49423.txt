My tension grew and my friends noticed it. As far gone as we were - they were able to talk to me - even though I could not communicate what I was exactly feeling. I wasn't feeling bad - as long as I stayed on my rock. I was worried - I saw planes in the sky and began to worry for the passengers. I started to think that when I smelled the World Trade Center smoke at home, I was actually inhaling burnt remains of humans!
