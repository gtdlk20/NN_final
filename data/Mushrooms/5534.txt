Each person had a different effect on my emotions and Id go from feelings of love and companionship to that of annoyance and anger simply by looking at someone else.  Godel made me laugh insanely for a large part of my trip and my laughter would instantly switch to tears and I would cry in joy.  Peoples faces morphed instantly.  Joe seemed huge and when he walked around I thought of him as a giant troll dragging a club.  Phils eyes turned a blazing red, his ears became pointy, and his teeth grew into fangs.  I became scared and nervous and retreated to the couch alone.
