T+6hrs. I have become throughouly involved in thoughts about the entirety of my life, and meaning of my existance. I question my presense on the planet and in the lives of those around me including my friends and family. I wonder what purpose I serve and how I'm supposed to serve everyone and be a good person, which is generally all I want in life, to be a good person and live a good life. I feel a great deal of pressure in my head, and almost begin to cry again, but don't let my friends in on what's happening to me, and still try to keep on with normal conversation.
