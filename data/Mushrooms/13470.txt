OH MY GOOOODNESS. I remember saying.. ooohh my ..gg.. I don't remember exhaling.  Just bursting out of my body.  It was as if every cell in my being opened up and released all the energy within to go for a walk in the cosmos.  I found a place where reality meets nonexistence and god holds your hand.  Your five senses are gone..  Not even a small amount of self-realization, rather a unified realization of pure love.  Of course.  I want to describe something I saw.  But I couldn't see.  Because I didn't have eyes.  Because I didn't have a body.  I was everything everywhere.  I was every bit of energy that has ever existed in any form from the beginning of time to the end.  In one place.  And I was as small as a quark and as big as all of space.  I remember knowing.  Knowing something that doesn't mean anything here.  And I remember floating somewhere looking in at it all.  And I mean everything.  Like the universe beneath me but bigger.  Stars.. or a TV screen all gone to frying bacon land.  This was when I decided to come back.  Then the room came back.  I couldn't see it yet.. Or I could but I couldn't perceive it as seeing.  I felt the most intense sensation.  'The cosmic orgasm' like 10,000 (no kidding) orgasms of the soul, all at once.  The vibration.  I could recognize it again.  I could feel again although not through my skin.  I was still floating just around my body.  But I felt B holding me and rocking and he was humming to me.  Z and B2 had come into the room at some point and glowing .. With knowing.  I had entered a threshold of understanding.  And then it was all-ok.
