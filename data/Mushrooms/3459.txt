45 minutes before the music started my friends and I consumed our mushies.  Mine were dry and powdery, and I washed them down with a large cup of water.  I began to feel the visceral effects of my trip almost immediately, and long before my friends did.  The initial feelings were normal for me; slight discomfort and angst, paired with an electric twinge of apprehension and excitement.  The opening band was playing as we entered the venue, and the welcoming waves of music washed over me and made me smile.  I was steadily progressing on my trip when we arrived at our seats, and I chose to stand up and dance while my friends awaited lift-off.  The sun was setting over the water behind the stage and the music was warm and welcoming.  Everything seemed to be going fine.
