A post-trip comment after 2.5 weeks: Mood changes have been quite dramatic at times. Sometimes feeling highly elated and sometimes dreadfully depressed. A week ago I suffered mentally from bad schizophrenic depression. Thinking became very superficial and highly critical of myself. As if I could not concentrate on anything. Doing something interesting or getting something to 'boot' life helped me out of this state into a much more desirable state. Feels as if life is smiling again. Now that I have my final exams coming, my thought activity is safely bound to these realms. Escapism rules.
