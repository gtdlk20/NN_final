The bloke behind the counter sold three strengths of shroom, and seeing as it was our first time we went for medium ones (I think they were either Liberty Cap or some Mexican stuff).  After that we went back to the hotel room to chomp them down.  To cut a long story short, they had fuck all effect on me.  No one else fared much better than myself.  One of them, Dave, saw some poncy hallucination with the door, and that was it.  Waste of money.
