Before I did, however, I spent quite a long time cleaning an organizing my room - for some reason I'm very apt to do that when I feel anxious about taking drugs, or other such situations. I happened to have 2 rich chocolate mini-cakes in my fridge, which I figured would mask the taste and smell well enough, so I crushed up half of the mushrooms (I only had an eighth, but seeing as it was my first time and I am pretty small, I decided to be cautious) and kneaded them into the first cake, then put the other back in the fridge. I am glad I didn't mix the rest in with the second cake because it took me a VERY LONG 15-20 minutes to consume the first one and it made me feel kind of nauseous. At the same time I drank 2 full glasses of orange juice, since vitamin c boosts the effects of psilocybin, and because that chocolate cake was becoming increasingly hard to get down.
