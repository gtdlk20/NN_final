The trees bloomed with more life before; they took on an incredibly wise human personification. Multiple limbed, armed with the knowledge of all the questions wed never understand and misjudge as God. Yet why would they have cared if I was alive or dead? Wasnt I part of that collective conglomerate bringing their timeless information to hell? They hated me. I couldve never felt at home in their sanctity. I went back inside. I denied the cool breeze of the temperate earth tasting my nerves.
