I should note that some of my ideas may be biased toward or acquired from reading the book The Psilocybin Solution over the course of the month before this trip.  Nevertheless, I believe vehemently in what I experienced and what I have expressed here, independent from my reading.  Mushrooms and other psychedelic drugs have the ability to open our minds to new ways of thinking, and I believe they should be central to the development of any respectful belief system.
