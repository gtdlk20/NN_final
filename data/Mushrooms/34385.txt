I looked down at the blanket I had on my lap and patterns begin to take form. I became somewhat hypnotized with it as it slowly transformed into a desert. It didn't actually look like a desert, but it somehow resembled one. I began laughing again. This time it was different. My laugh seemed  dirty somehow, like a laugh from a bum. I talked to myself, proclaiming that I was 'laughed weird'. As I continued to talk, I realized I was becoming disgusted with my humanity. I tried to think of sex to get my mind off it. I couldn't become aroused, even as I tried to stimulate my dick. I felt like a primordial man, or a monkey; I became even more disgusted with my self. I had a strong desire to rise to a more intellectual and spiritual level of existence. This was about an hour after the drug started to take effect.
