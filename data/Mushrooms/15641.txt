R was panicked, his parents were gone for the day and he was scared of their return, he believed that his parents were gonna laugh at him for his altered state and he wasn't gonna escape, I tried to explain that it'd be ok but I could barely form my own solutions, I didn't know who I was except this Shaman-archetype. I said to R, 'We could be quiet.' or 'You do this all the time right? It's okay.' this didn't help much. After panic, R started to leave the house and said he was going to his cousins house. I yelled at him to go back to his room, both of us explained neither was angry here, but this was necessary. We sat in his room for a bit, it was also so hazy from here. I thought I was at the point of death at parts, I thought I was going to be taken away for being too enlightened, I started to believe my one beer had put me into a state of drunkenness, all of these delusions rushed through me.
