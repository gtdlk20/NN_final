I thought I would wait it out by trying to remember what just happened. Even by this point I had forgot what the peak of the trip was like, the memory was lost forever. It was like waking up when you know you had a dream, but you can't remember what it was. Was I even awake for it? Was it actually just a dream? Did I fall asleep? There was no way of knowing for sure, but after thinking about it, it seemed highly unlikely that I was sleeping. I was just tripping so hard that I experienced complete ego death. I thought back to some other events that happened. What about that bomb that went off? It began to make sense now. Someone must have set off fireworks. Despite it being banned in the campground, people usually manage to set off a few anyway. What I thought were screams were just people cheering, and the footsteps I heard must have been security guards running around to find the person who set them off.
