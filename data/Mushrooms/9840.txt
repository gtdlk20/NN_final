Very early in the morning we set off down a long sandy track to discover a beach. We walked along in a semi uncomfortable silence. I wanted her to be my friend but we werenÂ’t connected. She seemed a bit hostile and I could picture her refusing to take shrooms with me. I did not know how the day would pan out.
