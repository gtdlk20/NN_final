Now, it's time to start passing the bong around. Finally, it's my turn I take a huge hit, which I could not feel in the slightest, and after nearly ghosting it I spewed what little was left and my brain began to melt. Twenty seconds after my hit I was enveloped in colors, patterns, shapes, objects, designs, all melting in and out of everything, everyone, all objects had rainbow hues dancing over patterns which melted and danced in unison over my vision. I was seeing it all. I closed my eyes, it served no purpose, I saw the same thing I saw with my eyes open, indescribable colors and patterns. I saw a red liquid dumped over my vision and it started to drain inward towards the center on a background of green glowing stars which then also started to drain towards the center. I remember having the thought that the shrooms changed and warped the world, and smoking added color and texture to those distorions, it was incredible.
