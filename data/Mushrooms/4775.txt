We walked out of the hills to the street, I somehow called Jessica and I wanted her to come see me but the others thought inviting more people was a bad idea, but her voice was sweet and beautiful and I was very glad to speak to her.  She was real.  We then walked to a park, finding some more friends but eventually leaving and talking about our trip and our views on our mind and our lives.
