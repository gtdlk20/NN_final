I was grateful for my guide, for my wife, for the plants around me, for my house.  And this is despite all the faults and imperfections of each of these things.  I didn't see them as perfect, but as wonderful despite their brokenness. The lack of perfections would usually bother me, or keep me from really appreciating things. But in all these things I was content, at peace, in 'shalom'. I even noticed the floor was really dusty in places, but it was not bothersome to me.
