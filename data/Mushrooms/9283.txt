We had set the music on my friend's mobile and saved it there as the wifi was terrible. As I couldn't unlock it and the songs started to be real jarring  I resorted to 'next' them, as I knew there were some good ones I had added. The pop came when I got Chernobyl by Blanck Mass; that song is made to open you to shrooms. I put the volume up and told them all to relax and let the mushroom open them. I told them to exhale and let it all out (one was crying) as I felt some got a bit tense. I played next Forgive by Burial and a couple more in that tone. My friends were all lying down with eyes closed and tripping to the max, the newbie reported having strong visuals and one of the girls saw loads of animals and eventually tripped herself to sleep.
