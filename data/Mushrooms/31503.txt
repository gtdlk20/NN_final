We both knew we felt different but we werent sure how to describe it. My boyfriend described it as being really, really high on weed. I felt a little of the mental fluidity and relaxation I normally feel when high but it was not the same feeling. Normally when I am high, I feel more confused about my surroundings. Instead, I felt completely rational and present, if not even more so than normal. As we walked down the long main road, I saw a girl riding her bike with her dog running behind her on a leash. I was upset because I knew that the dog was probably really tired and the girl didnt seem to care. We saw a couple standing together on their porch looking out at the road and I said that they were probably tripping too. He laughed and said they probably werent and I agreed. I knew they probably werent but I thought it would have been really ironic if they were. We commented on the houses that we were passing and I wanted to stop to look at all the beautiful flowers in bloom.
