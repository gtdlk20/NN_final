Mum walks out. I open my eyes. Instinctively (just go with me on this) I told my bedroom light to get darker. And it did. Fascinated I instructed it again: 'darker!' and it bloody worked! I realised I  was in an entirely warped world. Nothing could be trusted. I lit a cigarette. I stared at it (trippers, NEVER EVER should stare!) and after some time it began to slowly curve and bend all by itself until I was smoking a completely curled cigartee.oh lord.
