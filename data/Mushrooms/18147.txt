Unfortunately, this is exactly the time that Seth decided he needed to climb a cliff.  He explained to Matt and me that he wanted to be above it, above all of this beauty. I have to explain to readers that Im pretty damn scared of heights and a shitty climber to boot, so this didnt seem like a very good idea to me.  Matt laughed at Seths idea, then began outlining various scenarios in which someone attempting to climb the cliff would plummet to the jagged rocks below and bash out their brains on them, so I wasnt exactly reassured when Seth urged us to come with him and Matt agreed. I, of course, had to follow, not wanting to be (1) left deserted on the beach with no one else and (2) some sort of group pariah too scared to commit to a group challenge and risk.
