About 3 weeks ago, my friend Josh and I bought some mushrooms. It was supposed to be 1/4 of an ounce, but we only got a little over 1/8 of an ounce. We were angry, because we had wanted to split a quarter and have a very strong trip, but since we didn't fully pay our dealer due to the shortage, it was okay.
