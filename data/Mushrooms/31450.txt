Then I put up BADBADNOTGOOD (III). I started thinking a bit again but it felt more positive now - I realized that although I was feeling down earlier I was strong enough to pull through and keep going. I was actually taking pretty good care of myself with the rowing, and I didnt need the shrooms to have any answers - the fact that I actually know what I find important in life without using shrooms suddenly started feeling like a very positive thing. I felt like I was pretty clear on my priorities: Im happy with my family and my girlfriend and Im quite happy with my job. I was getting calmer and more comfortable.
