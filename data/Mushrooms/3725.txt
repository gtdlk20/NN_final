I managed to push this thought aside for a while, and began to feel the effects take over my body. Muse and I had returned inside my room and I lay on my bed and began to laugh hysterically. I was giddy and everything seemed incredibly funny. Actually, it was the fact that I had taken such a massive dose of mushrooms that was so funny. I couldnÂ’t believe that I had willingly put myself into a situation where I would be tripping so hard. There also seemed to be an accompanying adrenaline rush that seemed to make things even worse.
