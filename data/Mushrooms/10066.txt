After about 20 minutes we were sitting out in the sunlight in Z's mustang. Everything around me started to shift. Ideas were revolving, and I felt like I had been freed from some mental barriers that had been stressing me lately. All that I saw and felt was in the car and I was really in the moment. Flowers were shifting, trees were turning and twisting. For the first time I really started to appreciate Z's mustang at a higher level. The weight and American spirit of the doors fascinated me. About that time G came out and said when we wanted to, he could give us a ride wherever. This was great news for me Z and K, to have someone not tripping able to do that for us. After about 20 minutes more we decided to go to a secluded spot with a tennis and basketball court.
