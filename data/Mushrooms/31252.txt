I had picked the mushrooms myself a few days before, let them dry under a fan before grinding them up and storing them within honey, and putting that mixture into the freezer. For some reason I was scared that they would degrade and or become mouldy otherwise. The fact that they were stored in honey may have made the onset a lot slower due to the fact that the stomach had to work through the gloopy mess to get to the fruits. I had no scales so I basically eyeballed it and I actually it turned out we had a little less than I thought.
