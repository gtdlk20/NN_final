T-4:00--The whole time we thought about going inside to see people. I could have, but I didn't want to, and Jim was still wild-eyed and pale, so I avoided the idea as much as I could. But we decided to go in. We went up to my room, at this point really comming down but still realizing how fucked up we were. Throughout the whole time I kept forgetting I had eaten the mushrooms. Everything felt truly like a dream now, and I felt a heaviness in my stomach.
