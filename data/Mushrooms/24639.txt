3:00 PM. We divided up the goomies, about an eighth each, and forced them down our gullets with some orange soda.  Its all we had.  My friend K saved a few of her stems for her friend S that was supposed to be joining us later.  We all had shroom powder left on our hands, and we licked it off, which I believe made the trip kick in much faster.  As soon as we were done, we each smoked a bowl of pot out of a two liter bottle.  Again, its all we had at the moment.
