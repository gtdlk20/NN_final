This scared me, he was almost possessed like having half as much shrooms as me and I was almost completely back to baseline. We eventually put him in the bed and M and I tried to go to sleep but couldn't. M went to sleep in his car. When M left I felt a since of loneliness. The room started tripping me out again. I needed to leave the room. I left the room and went to M's car to try to go to sleep.
