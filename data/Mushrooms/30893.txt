Each event has revealed fresh insights for me. The most pleasing insight has been the tangible sense that life, given to us by our Creator, is fractal, and infinitely rich in detail. The deeper we look at life, the greater the mystery. For a better understanding of this idea read Blaise Pascals Pensees, specifically his dissertation on the two infinities. Also read Behes Darwins Black Box. There is a supreme intelligence (logos) behind creation that has left its fingerprints on creation from quarks to quasars. Each moment should be lived purposefully and awakemoments that contain all moments.
