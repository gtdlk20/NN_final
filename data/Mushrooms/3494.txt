'Hey,' I said to somebody. 'Do you see those patterns?' I pointed to the images that were clearly visible on the hard concrete floor, but he just looked at me strangely and didn't answer. I was starting to realize that these vivid pictures decorating the floor werent even there. I was amazed at how real and detailed they looked though, but also slightly nervous by the fact that I couldnt distinguish them from reality. As I continued to observe them they morphed and changed shape.
