We finally left the stairwell after a few minutes, and sat in some sofas in the mezzanine upper-level of this building. This was definitely the most intense moment, cognitively, of the entire experience, as I delved inward and my sense of self evaporated completely for half an hour, making me wonder if I were really just an imaginary consciousness in someones dream, or if I was in the mind of an insane person, not actually experiencing anything real my whole life but living as a dream figure on the inside of his imagination. The room and building around me swirled in my eyes and lost form, and I assumed it was really just an illusion to begin with, only held together by our belief in it, or by a more complex, self-sentient karmic energy which only the Buddhist monks fully understand. I pondered with my feelings over the meaning of a sense of control, and decided that it was only an illusion caused by isolating ones ego from the rest of reality into one individual point of view which thinks it is making decisions.
