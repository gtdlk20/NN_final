I now had a good amount of 'gooms' and so did my dealer, he stated that I should do them with him because of how well I knew him. I agreed that I would do them with him the following weekend. I shouldve realized how impatient I am. The next day I went to my friends house, lets call him Jay. I told him I had some gooms and that I needed a place to do them. He said go ahead. This is where I went wrong. I SHOULD NEVER HAVE DONE MUSHROOMS UNPREPARED, EVERRRRRRR.
