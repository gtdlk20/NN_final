Wes and Manny went back inside while Jimi and I traversed the grounds by the light of the full moon. The sky looked strikingly close, like the oval roof of a planetarium just thirty feet or so above our heads. Jimi reminded me what the compound owner had told us: This propertys on a unique geographical plane. Oftentimes, when a storm moves in, it will only rain here. The neighboring ranches wont get a drop! We stared up at the moon until we had cricks in our necks, then went back inside.
