Oh well anyway, It was a really nice day outside so we decided to go walk around. E was complaining about how long these are taking to work. We usually like walking around alot but once they hit they really hit. We were like rocks..barely making it to my front door. Whenever I do when I get into my house is put on some trance on my computer and just relax. We were just sitting down on the couch listening to some good trance once they blasted us. They effected E before me but since it was my first time I was totally gone. Since trance always makes me happy I just blasted it and waited.
