Next thing i know i am at his back door and he's flipping out. I entered the house and walked over to the bathroom. I looked over at my friend and saw someone else. Not him. I felt normal conciousness(along with memories) were 'transported' somewhere else beyond reach at this time. I moved over to the mirror and began to look at my blue tinged reflection not knowing who in the hell i am or this guy is in the other room talking about demons and lying in a fetal position on the bed. This went on with other unexplainable mental situations for sometime. I began to walk in circles around his house while i could hear the wood floors stretching and moving just as if it had been some type living organic material. I began to get sick and started throwing up in the toilet and out the back door (which ever was closer at the time) and outside looked like a stage set for some television show from another dimension. The sky had become dark by this time and the stars sent messages thru 'sequenced movements'.
