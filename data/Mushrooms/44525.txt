I left my house on bike at about 1:30 and went to the pool.  The Junior National diving championships were going on there (this was at a major university) when I arrived, although rec swim was still happening.  I remember being fascinated with these beautiful athletes (all 18 or younger) who were diving off the 10-meter platform.  Not only were they aesthetically pleasing to look at, but they were scoring 8s and 9s (they were almost as good as Olympic athletes, and no doubt some of them were probably going to the next Olympics).
