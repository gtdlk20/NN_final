The next time I saw the friend who'd told the frog joke, they were wearing a shirt in exactly the same shade of green as their frog form. I found that extremely funny and a bit... disorienting? Not quite disorienting. It was trippy. My mind refused to write it off as a coincidence. That was almost two weeks after the session, and more than a week after the last microdose.
