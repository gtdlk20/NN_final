- When I started to realize that I was a channel, my role in the universe, that my subconscious has been transported into the outside physical world and taken the emotional energy into the physical world with it as well, that I tapped into it, is when I looked at N and realized that he was my arc angel, the protector, that was his role in the universe. And I felt like I understood him completely as a person and why his personality is the way it is, because he is there to protect the channel or subconscious, who is essentially a baby when let out completely, from the physical world killing it, that he exists to let it just be, there existing, creating a radius around it, I just didnt really know or think about what exactly it needed protection from (peoples egos? Judgements? Misunderstandings?). I as the baby however, felt so extremely safe in the angels presence, that when N went into the forest or disappeared from my view I would panic, feel extreme sorrow and loneliness. I thought that he is the only one that understands the channel so purely, is there to keep it alive and make sure it can do its job.
