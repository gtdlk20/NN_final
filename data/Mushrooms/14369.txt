Did not take more then 5 minutes before I felt it, and it was coming on strong, like having the titanic pushing me on from behind. I remember thinking holy fuck this is gonna be massive... Incredibly powerful. I stopped chatting and went in to the living room where bro was as baffled as I was. He had the same massive feeling I had. We smiled at each other while almost shitting ourselves. Next I felt like I was being told to lay down it was like an order and I could not say no. I felt like I was being told to lay down it was like an order and I could not say no. So I'm laying down when I get communicated to me in some way they are going to heal me. I feel subtly small beings or robots are working all over and inside my body but its not unpleasant its kind of ok and friendly. I also got one wish from them which I of course forgot what it was. When finished I get back to reality. Speak to bro who had his own experiences.
