Coming out of my head, I then payed attention to my surrounding. There were small trees nearby and I could feel their pleasure being warmed by the sun and the way they spread their branches looked like a praise they were making. Beauty was everywhere. Then the song 'One tree hill' by U2 started playing and then it was too much for me. I broke in cry and couldn't stop. All this was too beautiful, too intense, almost painful and I was wondering if one could die from too much beauty. I was overwhelmed.
