I started to feel the same sensation I had the first shroom trip, like gravity had lightened up on me and given me a break.  My whole body felt like it had been pumped with a just little helium.  This felt pretty good, but the nervousness was still there although I was doing a good job at remaining relaxed and focused.  A strange feeling came upon me, but I liked it, just as much as I liked the taste of the shrooms.
