After about 25 minutes, I started to notice the usual come-up effects, I.e. laughter and tingly legs, also the swaying/drunk feeling. It came on fairly quick for such a moderate dose. I was planning on having a bowl while coming up to set my trip in motion and help me relax, but I  started to feel like that would have been too much.
