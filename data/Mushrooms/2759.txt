I started walking back to the ledge with the notebook in hand.  I didn't avoid the sights along the way, but noticed that they were all familiar.  I had passed these spots so many times that day, the visions they produced were like old friends.  I stopped to say 'hi,'  but I didn't need to spend the time meeting them all over again.
