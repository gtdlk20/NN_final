I decided at one point that it was time to discover who I was. I had to find out after the mother figure had told me I know why I am here. My vision slowly shifted from where my head would have been and slowly drifted down towards my stomach, where I began falling into my body. I looked around above as I entered and saw all of my body falling in, kind of like dirt in a cave I guess would be a good way to put it. As I continued to descend, I hit a point where I began to slowly turn around towards my inside. I knew this was going to reveal my true self. And there it was. A small, hovering crystal resonating the same beautiful light that the mother figure had. I remember seeing it and being struck by how incredibly perfect it was. I realized this was me. All this time I felt like I was such a disgusting and dark person but here I was, the complete opposite. Everything felt so artificial, my body felt like some sort of plastic vessel that wasnt even real. Only the crystal of me was real. I dont know how to describe it It was so powerful.
