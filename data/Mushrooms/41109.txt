Visitation of Chantleberry Thinkstomp. He is the lurker on the frontier of the numinous. He is the phantasmagoric entity that stands behind my dreamlife. My personal daemon. He is a trickster. Cunning and malevolent. He is laughter in the crepuscule. The sentience from the void. He is whimsy and terror. He is the untrustworthy one. He is waiting in the shadows. He is watching me. I do not remember seeing him for decades. I suspect he visits me in my dreams but only remember him from when he visits me during my psychedelic wanderings. He is stick-man skinny and holds a cane. He jumps and clicks his heels. He wears a question mark above his hat. He laughs at my triumphs and mocks my despair. He is my entropic muse.
