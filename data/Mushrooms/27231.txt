After this, it seemed to somehow be much later in the day, and my lamp began to bend and melt with a cushion.  I had become fed up with these visions, and took my wobble body into my basement.  There I tried to play my bass guitar (unplugged), and my trip seemed to be over.  I just seemed to be in a state of drunkenness.  After I was unable to play anymore, I eventually went back upstairs and sat on my bed.  I called my friend again (whose house I left earlier), and asked what he was doing.  I was about to go there again when I suddenly found my watch that I had disassembled earlier that week (just the band from one part of it).  I remember it seemed like I spent an hour trying to get that watch band back on, I couldnt do it, but I couldnt stop trying to get it to work.
