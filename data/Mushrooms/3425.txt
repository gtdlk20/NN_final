My first trip occurred when I was in San Cristobal, the heart of Chiapas. I suppose they should had been Mexicana strain mushrooms, a guy sold me a bag with more or less 15 caps. Then I've bought some strawberry jam and apple juice to eat them, since they had an unpleasant smell. It seems they had some mould on the cap. It was me and my soulmate, we decided to find a nice place to start the trip, and we went into a wood near San Cristobal Church to find a lonely sitting. We sat on pine needles, it wasn't a very beautiful place, but we knew it would be different after the mushrooms.
