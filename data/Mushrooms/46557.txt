I think in comparison to my first trip (being a 3 out of 10), this was at least a 7.  I am really glad I decided to join in that night, and now feel more prepared for higher dose trips in the future.  I have spent a lot of time over the past few months researching and reading experience reports on erowid, which I believe to be excellent preparation for entering into a psychedelic experience.  I hope that you find this report beneficial in some way (sorry for the length).  I know I gained a whole new perspective on my mind and even more confidence in myself.
