I became aware that I was beginning to get sun burnt and decided to move to another place. Much to my surprise, the strong visuals did not stop when I opened my eyes but merely became embossed on everything I was seeing. They lost their colouring and it appeared as if the world had become 2 dimensional and these visions imprinted onto it. I wandered around the beach, amazed at the experience of exploring a 2 dimensional world. Finally I decided to go to my tent to see what that would be like. Lying on my side I began to notice colourful patterns of arrows sliding back and forth along the mesh in the ceiling. I lay there for about half an hour transfixed by their amazing dance.
