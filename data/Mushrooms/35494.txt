By the time the movie had progressed 10 minutes, me and my friend were incapable of focusing on one object for too long. I noticed I had to take a break to the restroom, I always piss alot when on shrooms for some reason, and found that walking was a puzzling and confusing activity. It took at least 5 minutes for me to locate the bathroom, then another 5 to secure myself inside by locking the doors. This was a challenge, and for some odd reason I kept thinking that I had to lock the doors from the outside, which didn't work because of the lack of me being inside once I was outside. Finally I had everything figured out, and I took the weirdest piss in my life. Such a release of body fluids caused a flurry of rainbow colors, and everything took on a different color glow. Some of the colors I tasted, some of them I smelled, and there were some colors present that I had never witnessed in my life. It took a lot less effort to find my way back to the couch, and once I sat down my body made up its mind and decided not to get up at least until the movie was over. This, I knew, was impossible, and another piss was inevitable.
