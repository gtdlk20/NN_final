After White Pony, P put in Deftones-White Pony. This seemed to make the trip more mellow. My confusing thoughts began to wear down, and after the cd ended, we decided to go into my house and look at some of the weird posters I have. The one that caught P's eye the most was my Sublime one. He stared at it for quite some time. We eventually went back to listen to music in the car. I don't remember what we played during this point. I think it might have been Incubus-Morning View. I was still tripping, but my reality had come back to me a bit.
