It was the end of the year at university, my friends and I wanted to celebrate finishing a very difficult and stressful year. Friend #1 was able to obtain some mushrooms and suggested we go for a hike along some horse trails near a few miles from his home. Four of us decided to participate. We had picked a Friday afternoon that we were all completely free from any schedule, and the weather happened to be absolutely perfect, sunny with a nice breeze. It was the best possible scenario.
