It was a normal night in April like any other night, but a friend of mine who shall be referred to as M had found someone to sell mushrooms to us. We met this person and each bought an eighth (approximately 3.5 grams) of dried mushrooms. Neither of us had done mushrooms before, but the person who sold them to us suggested that we both ingest a whole eighth.
