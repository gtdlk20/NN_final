By now I should say that Ive been pissing like a hose pipe all day, and once again I needed the toilet so we walked to find one. I had to ask at a stall as I approached the stall the people working there were all laughing very hard at something, I didnt quite understand what was going on so tried to laugh along with them and look sober, it didnt work too well and I got some very strange looks. They told me where the toilet was but I went in completely the opposite direction back to M, C and P. At this point Ms face had seemed to have collapsed which scared me a little, but I didnt say anything in case he freaked out. I then remembered about needing the toilet so I floated off.
