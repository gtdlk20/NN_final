Oct. 9  Due to the threat of apartment inspections by the maintenance crew, I was forced to find a way to conceal the shroom boxes.  I found a way of insulating them in blankets making them appear to be a pile of folded blankets in my closet.  Today, I got fed up with the slowed growth of the growing jars.  I know the slowed growth is caused by high CO2 levels in the jars.  I took a risk, I sterilized everything around the jars and the box itself and decided to open air holes in the jars.  I know Im risking contamination but Ive had 100% success, I have confidence.
