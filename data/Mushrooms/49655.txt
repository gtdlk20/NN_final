Greendave had been making several failed attempts at getting toilet roll to stream across the room in the u.v light so I picked some up to have a look at it. I nearly came off, I tell you. The texture and intensity of colour was incredible. I moved it closer to my eyes and it got even more vibrant. I was looking over a green pool, like a swimming pool when lit up at night, just in another fucking dimension, man. I was imagining being at some sort of control panel for something, I remember at the time talking about a space ship, but not in the traditional X-files beam me up way, it felt like a swipe of my hand across this would do something and because I had the light so close to my eyes, everything surrounding me was darker. I got the impression of loads of people around, in the shadows, on a lower level, stretching out for a long distance. Maybe like some huge warehouse or something? I donÂ’t know. I can still see it now, a week later, without closing my eyes.
