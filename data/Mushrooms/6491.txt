I remember lying there unable to get up and do anything as D screamed hysterically on the phone to his mum. She was a naive and sheltered farmers wife, probably unequipped to deal with the heaviness that her only son was currently laying on her. I must say she handled it with grace. As he demanded to know where he was she just gently reminded him that he had in fact rung her so she couldn't possibly know where he was. After she managed to get out of him just what he'd taken she told him to go to his sisters house, who lived in the same town as me.
