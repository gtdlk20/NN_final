One Saturday a bunch of friends and I decided to take mushrooms.  One of our friends invited all of us over and we began to eat the mushrooms.  Some of us had never experienced mushrooms before, so the amounts eaten by each person varied, ranging from 2-5.5 grams.  The time was about around noon and the experience to follow was amazing.
