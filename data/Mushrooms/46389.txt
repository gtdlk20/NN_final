The following friday A friend and I went to a B-bq and were totally sober when we took our mushrooms. My friend took maybe an eighth of his own shrooms while I took maybe 5 grams of my 1/2 ounce. We walked to the movie store and grabbed Pulp Fiction and Tim burton's Big Fish. We walked home and started watching Pulp fiction. I felt nothing until the classic opening song, Miserlou< I became enthralled in the movie and began seeing only the tv screen everthing else turned a pale shade of purple.
