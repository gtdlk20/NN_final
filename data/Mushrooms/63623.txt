Me and a few friends were at an after party (we had e in our systems; Im sure this has relevency to the experience) we were smoking weed, discusing shrooms, and smoking shrooms.  I was recalling seeing something about it while in amsterdam, and my friend was like, 'yah Ive done it before it totally works'.  So without further adieu, he produced a bag of shrooms from his bag, and began to skin up some shroom J's.  The effects were similar to eating the mushrooms, but with less intense hallucinations (more like colour bursts and a loss of sense of time)  we became very 'jovial' laughed at pretty much anything, haha.  Was a good experience, very mellowing, and chilled, a lot more mellow/less intense than a regular shroom trip, and the effects were shorter lasting.
