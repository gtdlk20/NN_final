The drive home was fairly uneventful and we reached my friend's house safely.  I received a phone call from one of my good friends while I mingled in the dark kitchen enjoying the interplay of lights and shadows on the wood floor.  I made my way to the basement where things became pretty intense.  We turned out the lights and I began to dance to the techno trance emanating from the stereo speakers.  I could feel the music travel through my limbs and my blood pump faster through my veins.  My body felt so full of life and wonder.  I looked at the ceiling and saw my shadow staring back down at me.  I reached out and shook my shadow's hand and then he extended his arm around to pat me on the back.  I felt an amazing connection to my own self through this.  My shadow was a huge three-dimensional figure representing me.  It was much more intense than simply looking in the mirror because it was like I was faced by another version of myself.
