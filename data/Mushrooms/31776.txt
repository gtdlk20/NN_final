At about 2 in the morning I came to and M was very upset. He was trying to tell me that we were going to get in so much trouble, we had to go home. My vision and comprehension returned quickly and I heard him very clearly now, although he had apparently been trying to talk some sense into me for quite some time. But all of the sudden I felt as though I was perfectly sober. It was like nothing had even happened. To this day, those two or three hours of my life are still almost completely missing to me.
