Oct 12  I have my first contaminated jar.  One of the new Tasmanian jars had a green mold growing near the bottom.  I dont know what the fuck it is but it resembles the green mold you typically find on bread, but I have no real idea what it is.  I threw the jar out.  OF the other 11 second batch jars, 3 more Tasmanian are showing mycelial growth.  Excellent.  The Hawaiian I chose for its extremely fast growth, but t takes longer than average for growth to show.  Once it does, they take off, consuming ½ pints in under 13 days.  We shall see.  Im planning on birthing two more cakes today.  However, one of them, Im still debating on, I may wait until tomorrow, but Im definitely birthing one.  These fuckers, they need to stop growing so fast, I cant keep up celebrating birthdays.  Ive had three in three days, give me a break, my body cant process that much alcohol and weed.  Hehe.
