The visual wave faded and Kevin and Scott decided they wanted to explore, but my body was too heavy to do this so I lay in the sun and Jeff came and laid under the tree.  After what seemed like a few seconds but it had to be more, Kevin and Scott yelled to me from atop the hill that lined the valley, I smiled and waved to them but then they seemed to disappear, but their yells reverberated the same way the hawk's scream did, and I felt them all around me.  I stood up and as I did so I saw reflections of myself on either side of me.  Everything green seemed to grow and stick out, and a bush multiplied along with the reflections of myself.  I reached down and touched it and saw the multiple images of myself do the same, and the one on my left seemed to look at me.  A tree in front of me multiplied infinitely and it was almost too much imagery to take in, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.
