I'm sitting here and I am NOT hallucinating. YOU're hallucinating. Ever wondered what its like to be tripping on shrooms? Well think about everything what you are able to imagine: flying elephants, pink rainbows, the standard stuff. And the FORGET about it. And after you have forgotten that and you have nothing left your mind will explode and you start seeing how things are. You wouldn't be able to live in this room if you would see whats going on right now.
