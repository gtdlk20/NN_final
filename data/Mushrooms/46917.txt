The date is now around August/September 2004 and I felt quite an experienced wreckhead, a term thought as a description of myself. It was a Friday night, I had finished work and went to a best friends house as he had bought 1000g wet from the net on the previous weekend and had given 500g to me to dry out and sold the other half. We had decided from when he bought them that we would take a large amount and I halved the dry pile and then split one half into two equal parts. Since 500g wet is about 50g dry, that gave us piles of approximately 12.5g.
