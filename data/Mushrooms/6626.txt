I was so glad to find that within a short amount of time, and with lots talking, I was happy again, and then euphoric. All my friends were exceedingly euphoric, and it probably rubbed off on me. We spent a lot of time talking, and listening to music, sharing silly things we had noticed when tripping, and we still had a good 3-4 hours to go. I realised that I still had intense open eye visuals, and this made me really happy because it was so interesting to look at anything, especially complex colourful patterns. It was also really funny now that I was happy to not care about my confusion and random though processes. All my friends agreed about the confusion, and we had many outrageous laughing sessions when we got into even slightly complex conversations, only to loose or forget any sense of meaning about the conversation. We also found that when we got into a period of conversation which then ended you got a really strong sense of your mind slowing down, contrasted with itÂ’s speedy state whilst the conversation was occurring. I also found that after the bad part of my trip I talked a lot, and was eager to explain all the things I had experienced to my friends.
