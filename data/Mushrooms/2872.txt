The thought loop revolved around second thoughts about walking away so far away from my safe spot and a slight fear of sliding into a bad trip, asking myself what a bad trip is and what it is caused by. I concluded that it could only be ones mind or ones self that makes a trip bad and I was scared to spend the next few hours under the regime of my own self, realizing that this is pretty fucked-up, yet dangerous fear, for we can never escape ourselves (nor should we!). I then asked myself whether it was a good idea to walk so far... and the loop started again, but with more intensity and speed. As soon as I realized that Im in a loop again, I left it with ease. But the questions, what makes a mind a mind, what makes me me stuck and became the main theme of the trip. the questions, what makes a mind a mind, what makes me me stuck and became the main theme of the trip.
