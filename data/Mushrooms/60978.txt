Anyways I finally give in a eat my eighth in a few friends dorms with a soda and go meet my other friends downstairs.  About 45 minutes after eating the shrooms my old roommate comes by and suggests that we go to to the convience store and get some snacks and I agree.  On the way there I began to feel the shrooms and I started to get freaked out as I was looking at some bushes, realizing that they resembled spiders then I began to think if I did start to see things they would become spiders as well.  To my good fortune or misfortune depending on how you look at it I had no visions.
