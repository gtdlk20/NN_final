Then I had a vision, this one not so clear, of some type of alien invasion.  But, what we were thinking of as aliens, were extremely evolved and advanced humans.  Some 'earth-humans' were trying to fight it with small homemade bombs, like a Molotov cocktail, or thereabouts in size.  The alien technology far exceeds our own, so our weapons have little to no affect on the force field type defense of this advanced human race.  An earth human is to an alien, as an earth human is to a monkey, much more advanced.  It did no use to fight, they knew when an attack would occur, and they could somehow know when an earth-human was about to throw a bomb.  'How could I avoid being destroyed in the invasion?  How could I be saved?' I wondered.
