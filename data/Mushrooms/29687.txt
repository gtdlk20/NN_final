A week before October 30th, I took 3.5 g of mushrooms in my bedroom and read experience reports. I wasnt attuned to the effects yet, and I hadnt yet learned of how psychedelics can give you what I call Third Vision. First Vision would be open eyed visuals (also referred to as OEVs), I consider Second Vision to be closed eye visuals (CEVs) and I describe Third Vision as a spiritual experience in which the visuals extend beyond OEVs or CEVs. I believe that gamma brainwaves cause Third Vision, which can be brought about using methods such as shamanic journeying or high doses of psychedelics. From a more experiential perspective, Third Vision is akin to daydreaming, where you arent necessarily viewing reality or seeing anything behind closed eyes. Instead, youre transported to another place inside of your mind where daydreams can feel like reality. On my first mushroom trip, I experienced third vision in which colors were swirling around behind my eyes, though they were not anything perceptible with open eyes, but I didnt recognize that I had this particular experience until after what I call my mushroom overdose.
