That is when I experienced the most amazing, yet, at the same time, most terrifying thing that has ever happened to me.  I didnt think that I had died, I didnt feel like I had died, I did die.  I was pure consciousness.  I had no body, there were no surroundings, my room was completely gone.  I had no physical body, yet there was still substance.  I understood time in a way I never had before.  Time had no meaning, yet it was so very prevalent.  I had felt that I had discovered some secret truth, but I cant remember it for the life of me.  But the thing is, while I thought about it in that state, I knew that I would forget, I realized that I wasnt allowed to remember.  I realized that everyone would come to know this secret, that everyone, at some point, is shown; then, they too, will also forget.  The last bit I remember is that I found it funny, it seemed absurd.  It seemed like it was some kind of cosmic joke.  I remember thinking about Huxleys theory of Mind at Large.  I understand why he thought that psychedelics, meditations, sense deprivation, etc would allow access to an area that is normally blocked off/dulled down by consciousness.  If a man was stripped of everything and thrown into that state without preparation, they would easily be overwhelmed.
