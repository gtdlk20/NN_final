T+5hrs. after calming down, I finally decide to venture forth from the safety of the room. Walking feels new and different, since I really haven't walked or even stood much since I injested the mushrooms. My legs are wobbily and walking feels as though I am doing it for the first time in my entire life. I walk out, down to the kitchen, conjoined with the family room. Immidiatly as I come out, K's older brother begins to make fun of me for my somewhat disoriented appearance as state, which doesn't really go very good with me, but I try my best to ignore it and sit down with a few friends. The visuals have died down abit already, though the green is still there, along with the breathing walls and living furniture. I talk to a friend (W) and we chat about my trip and other common things, such as the weekend, school etc. My thoughts however are elsewhere.
