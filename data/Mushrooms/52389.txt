After I basked in the revelation of the power in the creation which is all around us, a friend of my brother's arrived.  He had just gotten off work and had had a really bad day.  He was in a real angry mood and began recounting an altercation he had with a customer in his store. But, all I could see was how wrong his anger was and how wrong it was to let such negative feelings rule you. In short, I felt as if I was seeing the true nature of a kind of sin. It became very important to me at that moment to beware of the trap of hatred and anger.
