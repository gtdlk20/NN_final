I have been researching halucinagens for over a year now. I own every book there is to own on magic mushrooms. I decided it was time to actually try some. The only drug I had every tried before mushrooms was marijuana. I am a light weight to marijuana, one hit and I'm gone. My dealer happend to get is hands on some 'gooms.' I conjured up 20 dollars and headed to my dealers house. He gave me in return one whole mushroom and two stems.
