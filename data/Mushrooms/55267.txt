I started to feel it kicking in, while we were sitting a dealer approached us and wanted to sell some X (dealers are everywhere in Amsterdam!). He was standing up and I saw his face make those strange movements which were quite fast, his ears started growing really big and his face looked really small compared to his ears, and I was sitting there and just laughing my ass off! A thought that we were overdoing it with the dude and that we should head to the hotel to grab our jackets...
