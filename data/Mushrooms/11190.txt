Shit hit the fan. Going hysterical was I. I was feeling all the emotions that I've ever felt in my life all at the same time. And every memory I ever had was fast forwarding and rewinding in my head. My memories were pushing and pulling on and against each other as if my brain were being ripped apart. By this time I had lost all sense of time and sense of self. I looked around my room and didnÂ’t recognize anything. Then the phone rang. They really were on their way and after 10 minutes of trying to tell them where I live, they were almost there. We hung up the phone again and I knew everything was going to be ok. I was still jumpy and crying but, a calmness came over me. I started to reflect on myself and the things I took for granted. And realized what was truly important to me.
