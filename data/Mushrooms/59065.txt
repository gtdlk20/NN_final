Coming up and plateau (in the mall area)~ We ventured out into the mall after a while. We were walking around, IÂ’m not so positive where, but we wondered the mall area by the fountain in front of sterns. As soon as we came out of the hallway I notice that everything was so bright. Not bright like the sun where I had to squint my eyes, but brighter in a way of the colors. Everything seemed so heavenly looking. The walls and lights looked so much whiter and clear. The colors from stores and people we more intense. Each distinct color was noticed and appreciated.
