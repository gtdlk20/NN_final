Anyway, my friend and I had just shy of an eighth each.  We munched 'em down and chilled, as the typical body buzz began to creep.  About 20 minutes into the trip, I started to get intense visuals which mostly consisted of melting.  This was the first time that I had gotten melting visuals, so I stared at all the wonderful oddities in my friend's house in pure awe and amazement.  After about an hour of colors shooting out of paintings, wrinkles in leather couches undulating, and mounted fish coming alive, I began to hit my peak.
