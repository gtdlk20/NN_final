That centre of the wheel appeared to be less the beginning without beginning and more a dark corner of the psyche.  Perhaps it is simply a dead end road in an endless, boundless fractal flower of infinite potential.  Why dive into the dark well, into the black hole, when there is a garden of colour to enjoy?  Perhaps the reintegration of the shadow reawakens the Logos as well Â– now asleep in the back of the car.  Satan, sit behind me, right?  It is important to retrieve the darkest dark, the oily black snake biting and hissing at us, our darkest fear and pain, to give it a place in our conscious mind.  Otherwise it is in control from the unseen darkness.  Now it is at least visible in the rear view mirror, fighting with a personal image of the Divine on the back seat.
