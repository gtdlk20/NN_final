Amsterdam looks amazing in the dark.  Thats not to say it doesnt look great in daylight, just that things take on a new look in the dark.  We wandered down to the end of the street and into the opening for the Vondel Park.  This was one of the best points of my trip.  As we walked into the park, trees seemed to separate in order to let us through.  I can best describe what I saw as magical.  I had an overwhelming feeling of being in a great place.  I saw many different people, just walking along, enjoying themselves, and laughing maybe.  The atmosphere was one of the best Ive ever felt.  As our path joined the main one, it looked as though none of what I was seeing was quite real.  It had the feel of a film with bad effects, one where you can clearly see the scenery in the background has been pasted on, and that the actors are really in front of a blue screen, never actually there.
