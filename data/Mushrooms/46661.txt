The shrooms I had had before this trip were of a low quality, so not knowing much better at the time, this was this year, but early on in the year, 120 grams of fresh 'philosophers stones' variety (tampanensis) that come as subterranean sclerotia, truffles type things, were ordered from an online company, and arrived within three days. I had no plans that day, and knew enough not to make any, even though I had never even reached OEV's with shrooms before, so the whole package of stones was pulverised with an ornamental dagger to a fine paste and infused four times with warm-hand hot water (so as not to significantly hydrolyse and destroy psilocin content) acidified with lemon juice to extract the tryptamine content better, then left to chill. The entire two resulting pints of infusion were then consumed on an empty stomach.
