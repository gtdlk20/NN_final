In classic mushroom-style, A and I also appeared to level out mentally in a fascinating way, causing us to have a few great-minds-think-alike sort of moments. One in particular stood out from the others as it occurred with such superb timing: as we were discussing the fact that all the Irish and the Welsh were cheering for South Africa  that is, against England  during the rugby game, I wrote very randomly 'the welsh hate the english', at precisely the same time as A wrote, 'the welsh hate the english?'. Whilst this would arguably not be accepted as scientific evidence for telepathy, it did rather take me aback, especially as similar incidents kept occurring throughout the evening. A did indeed claim later that he experienced a 'contact high' effect from merely speaking to me online.
