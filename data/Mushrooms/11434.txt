Almost exactly two months later, I took mushrooms again.  The set and setting with this trip were much more involved.  I cleaned my house.  I planned a time when I could be alone and undisturbed for an entire day.  I had a definite goal in mind for this trip, a question: what am I supposed to do with my life?  I was at a very difficult point in my life.  I was about to lose my job.  The plans I had set in motion after my last trip had been set in motion but would not be useful for a half year.
