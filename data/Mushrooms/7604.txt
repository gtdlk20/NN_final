The memories I have are slow and lucid, not at all like a hazy drunken night, but like a slow motion replay.  The nudity and debauchery of the show grounds was shocking to my vunerable, and uncontrollable mind. Thoughts of madness came like a runaway train. We walked bewildered through the carnival, I can remember the Dead walking out on stage, and immediately the legions of deadheads morphing from their given form into balls of bright light bouncing on the grass paddock that streched out before the stage.  That was the proverbial last straw.  I immediately sunk to my haunches, hands over face, and accepted that this was to be my life.  I was beaten, with what I had seen and felt in the last two hours, what could possibly make me right again, how could I get back... seeing me in this discombobulated state of disreason and fear, my cohorts pulled me to my feet, and carried me to the back door of the first aid tent.  I can remember my friends pleading for a glass of water, and the workers, who were frenzied with similar cases of overuse, demanding we leave, citing the long queu out the front entrance.
