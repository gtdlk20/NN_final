Anyways at the c store I began to realize the full effect and my newly found 'powers' became manifest.  I could pick up items or just touch them and feel their intrensic goodness or evil depending on what they were.  I soon learned to avoid all things which would be a downer and as I touched different surfaces they began to radiate throughout my body giving me the giggles.  Finally we made it back to my dorm and I sat on an old familiar couch and I started laughing uncontrolably.  As I was laughing it sounded like the laughing was a giggle comming from a dawrf from a far away land which at the time made the situation all the more funnier.  I probably laughted for a good 5 hours on and off.  I know I'm not the greatest writer and for those of you who have suffered through this I'm sorry. I felt almost that if I had expected it, it would have been different.  Good look and happy hunting.
