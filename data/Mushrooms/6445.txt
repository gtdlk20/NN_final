11:35 P.M. - TRIPs mom went upstairs and I decided that it was necessary that I had to use the bathroom which was upstairs. I stumbled up the stairs with very little coordination and made it to the bathroom where I looked in the mirror and noticed that my face wasnt quite right. I saw flashing colors in his bathroom which distracted me for awhile but I finally finished up and left. I walked past his mom who said Im very tired, Im going to bed I replied with something along the lines of Yeaaah, me too To my surprise my voice sounded quite distant from my body, as if I was watching myself in a movie or dream.
