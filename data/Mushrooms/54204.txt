The start of the trip was quick due to the lemon-tek.  I was hearing the high pitch 'brain noise' within 5 minutes and starting to see colors more vividly.  Within 15 minutes the visuals came and I started to feel like laying down to watch something on television.  I turned the Simpsons on and it started to feel like a long time has passed and even though I was enjoying the show, it felt too strong for me and loud.  So I switched to an adult alternative station and decided to relax and look at the ceiling.
