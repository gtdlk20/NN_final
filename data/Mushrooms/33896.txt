As soon as the first glimpses of light flickered from the screen, what I saw was complete and utter chaos. There was people crashing about and breaking things, and the camera would occasionally focus on one man, who held what appeared to be an axe. It was intense, but as I continued to watch, I realized that what I was watching was Chapelle's Show! The 'axe-wielding madman' was John Mayer, playing his guitar, and the people were just dancing to the music. I laughed as I realized this, and Josh, who had perceived something similar to me, did as well. As the show went on, I couldn't stop laughing. Every single joke was a riot, and I couldn't calm down. I turned off the TV when I thought the sketch was over, and put on some video games. It was Super Mario World, for Super Nintendo. I laughed as a mushroom emerged from one of the boxes and Mario received it, realizing how the makers of the game were implanting ideas of drug use into the minds of the children who played these games. I soon switched games to The Legend Of Zelda: A Link To The Past. All of the colors were constantly changing, and all of the movement caused me to have a feeling similar to a roller coaster ride, even though I was completely motionless.
