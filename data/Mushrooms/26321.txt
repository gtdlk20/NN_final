7:45pm - Each person separates approximately 2 grams or about half of an 8th of dried mushrooms.  My girlfriend and I had another 2 grams left over after selling the mushrooms to our friends so we decided to just split what was left.  She and I each ate only around 1 gram of really small mushrooms and powder, which we had heard were the most powerful.  A little peanut butter helped the taste and texture so that it wasn't nearly as unpleasant as people had mentioned.  The 5 of us sat together in my girlfriend's dorm room and ate our doses.  The next half hour was relatively uneventful.  We watched some online flash movies and just relaxed.
