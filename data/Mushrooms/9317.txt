Hannah said I was moving around and it looked like I was doing reiki massage to the air for about 2 hours. I didnÂ’t have any sense of anything that was happening here with my body.  When I came down I was eating food at my desk with Hannah. Not really sure how my body got there. I realize this all sounds insane and you must think I am a crazy person. But that's because it was crazy. It was intense and insane and scary and the most amazing and baffling experience I've ever had.
