Im not sure how long I was in that state. I slowly began to become aware of what was going on around me. I vaguely remember sitting on a chair while somebody was spinning it around. And I also vaguely remember that later I picked up the chair and threw it across the room. I didnt realize I had thrown it. I didnt know gravity existed anymore, and so from my perspective I just pushed it up into the air. It slowly rose into the air and seemed to float. Since gravity didnt exist, I thought it would just stay up in the air. But then it suddenly clattered to the ground and waves of sound echoed through the universe. My friends just laughed at me. I was still aware that I was in this ultimate truth, even though consciousness was returning to my body again. I was still walking around, still on this incredible journey. I remember hearing somebody said something about cigarettes. I wondered if I wanted a cigarette, but then I realized I didnt smoke. I thought about how they were all smoking weed, and for the first time in my life it seemed stupid to me. There was no reason for me to smoke weed anymore. Or do any drugs anymore. I thought about the mushrooms I was growing. I was going to stop growing them. I was going to throw them out when I got home.. I saw myself at home taking the cakes and throwing them all out. Good thing I wasnt home or I probably would have.
