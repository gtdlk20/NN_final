So then I asked questions and she showed me pictures. I thought of Jesus and understood his attitude in front of the crucifixion. Either it happened or not, I decided to do the same.  I gave up all my 'belongings'  the self image I want to show others and my body too. I still had it all but it was no longer mine. I gave it all up. ( surprisingly, that same day a neighbor knocked the door and asked for me so I could lent her some money. I knew before that she wasn't serious to pay back but I asked my husband to give her the money. Coz there was no sense on keeping it if she needed some and asked me for it) Anyway, my ego came back slowly and a question arose. Will you be here for the great day, mother? She said 'of course' what can I do if my baby wont be born during the mushroom season? She said 'just call me when you need me, I'll be here with you'. I felt her leaving soon after and begged her to stay. But it was ok, she showed me the life I was missing. And without that life I could never be a 'good' parent. I had lapses of paranoia and sadness for the human race. But I had one person in the world that I could surely save. Me.
