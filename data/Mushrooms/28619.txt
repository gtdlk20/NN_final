Then the trip progressed through the logical progression that if this world were an illusion in my mind that I should be able to control it with my mind. I should be able to become god.  To shorten an already long story, I then started to believe I was god and tried to convince my wife that I was god.  I was just absolutely positive that I could do anything I wanted.  I tried to prove it to her and I failed miserably.  I kept having this phases where I felt like I was being 'reprogrammed' and that once I learned how to use my powers, I could be god.  I would eventually wind down. During a very dramatic demonstration of how I wasn't god, in which I told my beloved that when she opened our front door that anything she imagined would be outside that door.  It could even be Hawaii.  Yeah, well, that didn't work so well.
