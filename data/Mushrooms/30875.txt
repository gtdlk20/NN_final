Well during the summer of 2013, while on a mountain climb in Alaska, I had a minor epiphany. It was a hot day in August and I was overcome by the exhaustion of a hard climb. I had reached a difficult summit and was soon overcome by the scent of alpine heather, the sensation of exposed granite under my feet, and by the raw feeling of my animal strength. I felt so strong and bonded with the earth that all my material pursuits were miniscule compared to the experiences given by this mountain. The pure Alaskan sky was enlivened with young eagles awakening to their strength and souring in the mountain updrafts. It was, as CS Lewis describes, a moment that contains all moments. I could not give voice to my emotions. It was positively shamanic. Days later, as I analyzed the experience, I became convinced that there were issues in my heart that needed resolution and clarity, I knew that these issues were somehow connected with my Clearlight years.
