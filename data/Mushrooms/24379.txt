Suddenly, pounding at my door.  In my underwear, I walked to the door and looked out.  It was my boyfriend.  'Should I answer the door?', I thought.  'No, I shouldn't, I have to be alone.'  I was so scared to be around anyone, and I didn't know why.  He eventually left, tried calling, then came back.  This time he would not leave when I yelled 'Go away!' weakly from my fetal position in my bed.  He said 'Please let me in' calmly, so I threw on a robe and opened the door and immediately scurried back to my bed to assume my coiled up position.  My man came over, sat down and asked me what was wrong.  I told him that I didn't know.  I wimpered and held on to his puffy jacket as he hugged me.  He continued to comfort me and ask me questions until I was able to talk somewhat normally.  I then asked him to open the shade.  After we looked out the window for a little while he got a call and he told me that he'd be back in 15 minutes.  I didn't want him to leave because he had calmed me down mentally, and I was feeling happy and okay again, but I thought I could maintain it, so I said it was okay.
