When I sat down and started to let it really hit me, thats when things got crazy for the first time. Not crazy in a bad way, just crazy in an almost overpowering way. I wanted to look at it so much, that I didnt care what was happening around me. I remember K was throwing popcorn at me, which was really cool, because it would leave his hand, disappear, then hit me and reappear. But the best part of that room was looking up at the ceiling. There are already tiny holes and dots in all the ceiling tile on my floor, all shaped and sized differently, but on shrooms its taken to another level. As soon as I would focus on one, everything around me would start melding and morphing together. The dots and lines on the ceiling would start dancing with each other, mixing and matching with the ones near it.
