We finally sat down and I sat on the grass and began to enjoy my trip. I don't think I looked like I was having fun, I kept thinking they thought I was insane. I would laugh hysterically to myself at the funny things I saw. I was just in my own world jamming to the beats. I had a conversation with my sandals who I thought were a man and woman couple. They turned into angels inviting me into their home. Which made me feel good. I became so focused on things. I'd look up at the sky for what seemed like a minute, but I think it was more like a half hour. The sky was more beautiful then I'd even seen. That day happened to be beautiful, pink and purple clouds just enhanced my trip. It actually looked like there were different portals opening up capturing me, taking me to different times and galaxies. It was awesome. Time was nothing. If I thought it was only 5 minutes gone by, it was really an hour. Or the opposite. Very confusing. I just wished I had someone to share it with.
