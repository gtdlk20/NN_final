The whole universe, time, this dimension is in an infinite loop, time doesnt exist. Everything is a loop, having lived every moment an infinite number of times. Neurons in our brain interacting with earths magnetic field, creates a giant meta-consciousness that I felt I was on the cusp of travelling into. Like they were telling me to stay away, not to cross over, and that being human is the best part of existence. I felt that we were truly alone in our physical universe, either we are the most advanced in our physical realm or a more advanced civilization has already transcended into the ether (universal meta-consciousness) and have realized everything is forever and it doesn't really matter.
