I remarked to my friend that something was behind that area of the blazen sky(or within it?) and it was so tremendous and powerful. Then i got the impression from whatever it was that i was a primitive ape. Some kind of strange evolutionary thought was being processed via the mushroom. He also 'felt' this command to feel primitive. We remarked to one another how this essence had made us feel so small compared to what was out in the sky. Then he began to get up and stumble away back towards his house and i sat there like some kind of flesh shell. then i mustered up some control and began to wander after my friend.
