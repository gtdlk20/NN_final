I had to pee so bad, but my room was the only place I could be, I was paralyzed, and the washroom was the enemy and I felt as if it would keep me in there and never let me out if I went into it. My friend made me get up to go pee, and I came back into the room and felt so much better, my trip was a completely different situation now. Everything in my room had a meaning, and was special to me in every way. I just wanted to smile and enjoy my life. My room was the place I was meant to be, I felt so safe, and nothing outside of my room never existed, it was all a memory. I looked at the clock and realized the clock wasn't moving, the hands weren't moving at all, I had accomplished so many things in all of 3 minutes, I was living for the moment. Everything I had done before I was happy never happened.
