Mike put on a movie called Killing Zoe while I was lost in another hallucination. I had my hands crossed on my lap and the two buttons on my sleeve cuffs had become blinking eyes. We watched almost the whole movie, but it was kind of unsettling for me. Lots of anger and violence. I was able to keep myself under control, but I think next time Ill definitely want to watch something friendlier. Something G-rated. I actually didnt pay a lot of attention to it. I was too busy staring at the map and the bedspread.
