For location I chose my home, and centrally my living room. I used many of the suggestions of Fadiman's book, including pre-arranged musical selections - all of which did not have vocals. It was mainly Bach's cello arrangements, some Mozart, orchestral, The Passion of the Christ soundtrack, as well as some relaxation/meditation CDs. I got a bucket ready - in case of puking. I had ample fresh water, a blanket, and arranged 3 comfortable locations to sit or lie down. The house was free of distractions or anyone else but my guide. (I did however let the cat roam free.) A previous house guest had put blankets over some of our extensive window for sleeping, and I kept those up, but the room still had natural light. I got a few carefully selected pictures of myself and some loved ones ready. I got a small mirror ready. I have numerous plants in the house, but I still bought fresh flowers. I got eye shades ready. I turned off my phone and actually put it in a draw in another part of the house. I instructed my guide not to used his phone either. I also instructed him to bring reading material.  He was to mainly keep silent and just be a comforting presence, not necessary to ask questions, or dialogue with. In this way he was more like a 'sitter' than Fadiman's definition of a 'guide'.
