After taking about ten minutes to turn on my 360, I finally hooked up my iPod and tuned on the visualizer with Pink Floyd playing. This was very insane. I was lost in circles and tubes. The first song that played was Have a Cigar and I really wanted a cigar. The lyrics in each song I heard had a huge impact on my mind. I was seriously engaged with my thoughts and emotions as they were put on a roller coaster full of loops and twists. I remember thinking about my cat I once had and how much I wished I wasnt so young and he wasnt so old when he died. It almost made me cry. Then I would think about my most remunerable moments when I played sports and those made me very happy. It was just an onslaught of feelings and emotions that kept hitting me violently. After what seemed to be hours, I got up and went to my room.
