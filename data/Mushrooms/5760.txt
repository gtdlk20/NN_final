I felt pleasantly and surprisingly energized with a positive vibe in the morning, having a confidence in the trip, and myself, which I have never quite felt before. With no real nerves or nausea at all, the trip had a calm natural evolution, the transition from ground state through visionary states and back again was smooth, feeling absolutely integrated with my life, as natural as the tide rolling in and out through the passage of a day.
