In terms of Ayahusaca, I have been brewing and refining my own recipes for years now and I know the spirit of the vine very well.  There is some strong cross-over with truffles and mushrooms but there is really quite a distinct difference, too.  Ayahuasca is very serious right from the start and doesnÂ’t pull its punches.  It tells me what it is and where I am in the greater scheme of things.  It is very interested in communication and loves to show me the fractal multiverse as it understands it.
