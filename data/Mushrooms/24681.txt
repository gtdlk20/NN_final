We decided to go to a neighborhood friends house.  This is where my trip really began, I started to watch the cabinets melt into the floor, I saw 'dazed and confused' over and over on the TV screen, ghosts were on the wall and I could not tell whether I was hot or cold.  These were potent mushrooms indeed and I knew my best bet was to lie down somewhere and enjoy the day.
