Every bit of knowledge I retained; no matter how implausible to this reality. Every bit spanning from the gift to the Earth known as the Temple of the Jaguar in Mexico, to the Sphinx, everything was explained. I was told by the spiritual deity of the Earth that the planet we see around us is more or less the Garden of Eden, heaven that truly exists on Earth. I had seen the building blocks of life for all elements that make up everything in the Earth. We all exist essentially as a congregation of cells that we pick up from the world around us; we are a unique part of the Earth. The Earth told me it communicates to others through the use of shrooms to evoke a dream state that it must use to teach others. Shrooms to Humans: More or less like comparing a humanÂ’s mind to an image projector and shrooms as the transparencies. Reality that we know it is a separate transparency.
