We started walking over to the beach, the sun shining down on us. Despite the lovely weather - the air was quite on the cold side. I eagerly zipped up my jacket and put on my hood, melting into my own little cocoon. We sprinted across the busy road, laughing as we reached the other side. We walked down a path to the edge of the sandy beach. By this point my visuals were quite evident, the leaves of the shrubbery and plants surrounding the beach began to subtlety move and wobble. It was nearing 1:30pm, over an hour and a half had passed since consuming the sandwich. As we walked across the sandy beach, I quickly took off my shoes, feeling each individual grain sink beneath and between my toes. Despite the bitter cold wind, the sun slightly heated the sand and made for  quite a comforting feeling.
