After a good ride (about an hour?). We all agreed it had been the perfect amount when we arrived back at the house. When we went in the driveway we hung around and talked a bit. At this time I got some intense motivation from somewhere, and started yelling LET's GET IT! I felt like we were all wasting our minds. If we could combine our brains into one common goal, and provide a service or product to people we could become extremely successful. I started seeing the true potential of everyone and everything around me, the maximum possible level of achievement and it was mind-boggling. I tried explaining it to my friends and they agreed we were capable of tremendous things. At this point we were all starting to come down. Z pointed out a spider to me, and its web looked ridiculous. The web continued further than it really did for me with the effect of the mushrooms.
