That's when it got nuts. I left my body. I became all mind and I could even look through my mind and see my body, sitting there, staring at the wall. I don't know what it was, but it was amazing. Everything was suddenly so clear. The mind continued to explain things. It told me that every person is capable of thinking with their mind. They are mostly held back by the strive for betterment in life, and by the exponential rate at which life has grown away from Goodness. It explained that fundamentally every person is the same. All are capable of the same thoughts. It is through experiences that each person is molded into what they are now. Then it questioned me. The very question that I now ask so many people. It said, 'Would experience be valued, as highly as it is, if mankind had chosen the wrong path in the beginning of its existence?' Instead of constant appreciation for the Goodness that created all, man became instantly obsessed with personal betterment in life. Then the self-righteous disease spread like a wild fire. Now it's so well practised that most people don't even believe in the original Goodness.
