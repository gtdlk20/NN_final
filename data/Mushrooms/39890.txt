On our way to Vondel Park, I had an exchange of glance with a man who struck me as particularly scary. He seemed to be a native of the city of Amsterdam, and he freaked me out. I was happy to get to the park. In the park, my girlfriend remarked at how squishy the wet ground felt. When I paid attention to this thought, I felt what she meant, but I didn't find it particularly interesting. I was looking for something interesting. We drank some orange juice and my legs felt carbonated, quite a pleasant feeling.
