But there is some sense of self now, youre a sea, a churning body of water. Thousands of thoughts populate your ocean. You can choose what you like or can you? No they float up to the surface when they please strange artifacts in the depths of the subconscious rising like bubbles to the conscious mind. You watch sopranos sometime. You have a striped shirt sometimes you think youre overweight though youre not, youre actually underweight ridiculous. Hals in this tent Im in a tent Fuck, get Hal out of here.
