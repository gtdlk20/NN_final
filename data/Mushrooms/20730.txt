It got horrifying, I was hearing noises from the tenants downstairs, feeling like maybe I was actually tripping bad and making them call 911... and I could have been imagining that I was on my couch.  I kept having a hard time dealing with the noises, worrying to not upset people- not to want to disturb their Xmas Eve.  Everything from the past, including the first trip was doubted as real, I questioned my own judgement whether I made up a false positive significance to them.  I had to will myself that I am doing well and this will be over when it has to be over.  It was that seed of trust in things that was like the thread of Ariadne which helped Theseus get out of the labyrinth.
