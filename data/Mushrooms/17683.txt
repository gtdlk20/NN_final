I started to think about the different people I was friends with, and I realized that I was too judging of them. I was far too quick to point out their flaws, even though they were quite obvious and plentiful. I thought about my father, and how he was a pretty good dad, but a slacker none-the-less. I went on in this way for what seemed like hours, analyzing almost every aspect of my life and getting over a lot of the emotional shit that I was going through up until then. I don't want to go into detail, but it was tremendous therapy. I thought to myself 'Wow, now I get why psychedelic means of the mind. This is like Dr. Phil on acid!' I giggled with glee.
