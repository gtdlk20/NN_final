Armed with 600% daily intake of Vitamin C and 1.5g of Mushrooms, I told my friends and we set a date.  A date that we would all be around, a day with no school, and nice hot weather.  We chose Day in the Parking Lot; an annual event that my school has near the end of school in June.  There would be clowns, blow up slides, dunk tank, live local bands, ice cream, Guitar Hero II, friends, school mates, and sunÂ…and Marijuana, as we all smoke pretty regularly.
