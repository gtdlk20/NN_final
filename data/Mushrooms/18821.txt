I realised I have to dedicate all the free time in my life to pray. I have to connect to God as often as possible. Prayers, yoga... the goal is always the same. Connect to God. Spread love all around the world. Because god is love, and we cannot survive without love. Children of God are fighting each other and don't realise that parts of God are dying here and there. I don't know if I believed in God before this moment, but from now I was without any hesitation.
