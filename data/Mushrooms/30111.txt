I took strength in this, and knew Logos was Quite Right -- I knew as well, that the tissue of normal life had ripped  away:  We now walked a landscape of Sacred & Eternal Time Trip Time, the strange truehome which had patiently awaited our re-arrival. It and We were well-known to each other, never been truly separated -- the illusion of normal life and its succession of seemingly disconnected moments.  All Trips, All Magicks came from and returned to this One Moment under the surface where every terrifying and supremely defining thing had ever really happened .  I knew I needed to not give in to sickness in this moment, by immediately accepting  this Moment to not be sick.  Contained also in that phrase Welcome Back Old Friend! was the fact that I had always known Logos as my brother for far longer than normal life would indicate, that he was as much the Old Friend that I intuitively recognized as Magick and Trip Time and the experience itself;  He and I and we even represented in that Moment many absent others who had all been, and forever would and will be, in this same connected-forgotten reality beneath the tissue of normal life.  And that this Moment of Reality had now suddenly risen up to say hello as a bit of nausea-stomach-foam, yet wise to the fact that this was just the leading edge of a much deeper wave that had already swept us away.  It was time to let go, and ride that wave.
