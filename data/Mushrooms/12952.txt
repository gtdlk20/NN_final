Chewed for about 35 minutes-the taste is natural to me, so it's just like eating veggies on a camping trip-I would eat em just for fun-but for those weak people out there-orange juice cuts the cringy taste and makes it sloshable like a smoothie-yummie. You need to chew them for as long as possible, because your trip will hit harder on the 'coming up' phase, hit fast-within 20-30 minutes, yet might be upsetting to the stomach in large quantities, As I found out.
