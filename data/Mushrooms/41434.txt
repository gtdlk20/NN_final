In my mind I tried to keep up a narrative of what was going on, but I struggled with language. I would think about a concept, and try to say it in my head, but I couldnt come up with sentences. So I would feel like the universe only existed because I was conscious to experience it and describe it to myself, but when I tried describing it, I would think something like Exist, describe. Describe?  This pushed me into confusion, and I thought that I was the very embodiment of a question. And I would keep thinking, I am question, but then thinking I couldnt be a question, because I made a statement, so I would think I am question? and then, feeling since that was a question, it appropriately could be answered with yes, and I would start the cycle over again. This happened with other things too. I would make a statement in my head, immediately think that was wrong, and would rephrase it in my head as a question.
