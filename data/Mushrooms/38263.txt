The aftermath: I weaned myself off methylphenidate. I had very little interest in it after that trip. I haven't done it in several months now and I hope I don't ever again. I cut down on codeine and pot. I started getting over losing my girlfriend and rekindled a good friendship with her. My general mood was more positive and I felt wiser. The friends I shared that trip with became closer to me. I felt that mushrooms had taught me most of what they needed to show me and when I took mushrooms again after that the effects were less special and I felt as if I was abusing them.
