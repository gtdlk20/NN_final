The lead-up was a foreboding sense that carried through the bitter winter day, which I ignored. I reasoned it was just trepidation from my last experience with DXM, a mere 600mg that blew my brain to fragments. In retrospect, it seems some part of my mind knew this was going to happen. I made it worse by deciding to trip solo, as I prefer privacy for these deep inner explorations, but I had my roommate, J, on standby in case anything went wrong. He'd taken 1.5g for the first time the night before, and reported that overall it was a good experience, but that it had lasted three hours longer than it was supposed to. I got home at 7p.m. and he gave me the two grams, advised me to follow it down with some tea because it would taste disgusting, and brace myself.
