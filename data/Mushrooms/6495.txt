I lay there for what seemed an eternity, I don't recall much more about what occurred. After a time I eventually came to and arose from the ground. It was over. I as relived and exhausted, it was more than I'd experienced, more than I thought I could handle now I was back in normality. The house was a wreck, there were mushrooms strewn from end to end, and I was mystified as to where my weed and my pot of shroom juice had gone. I left it all, deal with it in the morning, and decided to go to bed. I was in bed for a few minutes before it all started to come on again. I peaked very hard and very quickly, harder than any of the earlier peaks.
