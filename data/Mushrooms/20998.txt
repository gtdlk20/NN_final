I had a cold and a runny nose. Other than that, I was physically very healthy, despite my trauma and depression. I'd fasted for four or five hours, which is a very long fast for me because I'm lactating. I'd been taking small doses of CBD oil more days than not, but I don't think I'd taken it that day.
