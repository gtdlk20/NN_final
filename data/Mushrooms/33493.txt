Somehow, the fuse chose a wonderful time to blow, plunging the room into quiet and darkness. This didn't disturb me, and I told the SO that we should go to the other room. I layed back on that couch and relaxed. The effects were getting stronger. Then I looked at his face. Last time I had done mushrooms, that point where it went bad was the point when I looked at his face and saw extra sort of orafices and such forming in symmetric designs. I didn't really care what I saw, but seeing distortions in the faces of others deeply disturbs me. Seeing that again was my greatest fear coming into the trip. However, I was not afraid, I just looked at him in a dull sort of curiosity, and looked away.
