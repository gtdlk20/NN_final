19:20: I went to lie in the garden to watch the sky. This is where the action really started, some two hours after consumption. The clouds were changing forms like dropping a spoon of milk in a filled coffeecup to see the milk reappear on the surface. It was pretty much like a cloud well seen from atop. This was a respectable visual effect, even though the shroom box mentioned Philosophers Stones are only mildly visual. I blinked my eyes to see it this wasnt just a hallucination, but it turned out the effect remained, so paradoxically it was a hallucination. What I liked about lying in the garden was some kind of connection I was feeling with the organic life around me: the grass was so kind to me, so accepting, just being there to softly support me and the plants and potted plants were really friendly, almost like a guest whos discrete, yet it would occur to me if he or she werent there. There was a very relaxing peace going out from nature. This was a very enrichening experience.
