We began to journey to the umph show and the waves began to kick in hard core.  Every wave began with me running as fast as I could tward the light till I fell to the ground just to get pulled under.  Now I am not a religious person at all but the way that I got pulled under ground greatly resembled jesus on the cross pose with my hands out to the sides and my feet nailed to eachother.  The most intense part was everytime a wave started I felt like more and more of my actual reality and past was forgotten.  It started simple like me thinking I was a different person to me not believing who I really was.  At one point I woke up from a 'coma' only to realize my whole life was a compleete dream and that I was someone else from the 60's who had just gotten out of a bad acid trip.
