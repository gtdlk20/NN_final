As I walked down the streets, I looked at shadows, trees, the moon, reflections... everything I possibly could. Trees were massive, mystical creatures with claw-like branches. Street lights became orangey spotlights, casting incredible shadows in all directions. Trails were visible when I closed my eyes or looked away from light sources. Something as boring as my neighborhood became the most beautiful place I had ever been to, full of wonder and amusement. We followed some old train tracks which ran alongside a dilapidated factory, balancing ourselves on the metal parts, and just taking in everything we possibly could. We made it to the parking lot of the factory, and I proceeded to stand on a bench and look down a tunnel made up of train tracks, trees and the factory. I could focus on even the tiniest details with great clarity-- even objects in the distance seemed like they were right in front of me. As Nader described it, 'Everything looks 2d.'
