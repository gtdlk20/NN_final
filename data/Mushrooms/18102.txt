Well enough of my rambling, onto the story!... a little background first. I'm in my last teenage year, and starting using at 13. My first experience was with a purple geltab (acid) and what an experience it was! It was quite odd going off to middle school tripping on acid, all these kids around me thinking I'm going nuts or something. Anyway, the years that followed saw me inviting MDMA, more acid, pot and cocaine into my system. I eventually stopped everything (yes, even pot, as hard as it might be to believe) since I figured I was wasting too much cash and needed a little something for college and what not. Well, after about a year or so of not using, I started reading up on shrooms. And growing them. And eating them. And tripping on them. And shrooming! And so I got into it.
