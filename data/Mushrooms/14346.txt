As the movie wore on, I still struggled with language. It did not work right inside my brain. My inner mind replaced words with images, or with feelings. By the time the movie was ending, I was ready to have control over myself and my words. I concentrated really hard on doing one task on my phone. It took forever, but when I did finally figure it out, I came out of the trip, at around the 5 and a half hour mark.
