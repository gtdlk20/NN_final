I awoke in the morning, realizing I had gone crazy, but I could not exactly figure out why. I was very embarassed and regretful for breaking the bong. I just wanted to lay there in my tent all weekend and I definitely never wanted to do drugs again. I sat there and thought of John 3:16 and immediately the correct verse popped up in my mind, like it was mockingly saying, 'Did I miss something?' I decided to face the music and appologize for my little epeisode the night before. They made me feel right at home telling me that everyone has to have a bad trip and after that you can truly enjoy tripping. They told me that bong was no big deal and deffinatly replacable and wanted to proove that there was no hard feelings with a generously packed bowl. I accepted and continued my weekend in a blurred, relaxing, and drug filled way.
