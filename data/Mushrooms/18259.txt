The writing ends here, because I ran off my little rock into the water at this point (~+3:30).  The cold could be damned, this was where I had to be.  I swam into the middle, and I promised myself not to come out because of simple cold.  It was not exploratory like the last time, this fourth jump.  I was mature, it was coming back to an old friend, it was rebirth.  I swam around in an intense state of euphoria, shrieking with audible pleasure every time I came up for air, screaming underwater from a core of contentedness that was so much better than the forced happiness of MDMA.  I swam and swam, letting myself sink into the black, floating on my back as the sun warmed my stomach and face.  I began feeling megalomania, yelling back to my friends that I could pitch a no-hitter right now (like Doc Ellis).
