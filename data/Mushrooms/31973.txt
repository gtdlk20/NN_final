The night continued and around my peak, about two hours in I had complete and utter ego death.  Fortunately for me, the whole process of getting to ego death had been completely salient and anxiety-free.  My spirit was soaring.  I was in a euphoric stream of endless joy.  The ecstasy that came with doing mushrooms is what truly surprised me. I had always associated highs and lows and ups and downs with drugs such as stimulants, depressants, uppers, downers, Alcohol, Cocaine, drugs that either suppress or stimulate the motor functions. Experiencing a very high-up stimulant feeling along with the psychedelic experience was glorious.
