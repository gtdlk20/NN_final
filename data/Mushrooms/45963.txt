4 PM - 0.25mg of Clonazolam still working well, I don't have the desire to take anymore as the shrooms start working. It's quite a light dose, but I'm a bit of a lightweight with edible psychedelics, so I'm glad that the Clonazolam is working to my expectations. No worrying thoughts whatsoever, even if I try I can't push myself onto a negative train of thought :)
