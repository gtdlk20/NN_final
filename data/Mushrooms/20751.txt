As I continued to sit there I remember Adam going over and sitting down with Kate. He started joking around with her and she started to relax and I could see her whole mood change as she started to smile and laugh at Adams stories. Her whole aura reflected that she was happy again and her face and body came into sharper focus to me as she smiled. This sent my mood rocketing back up again.
