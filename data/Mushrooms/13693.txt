I use 'magic' mushrooms harvested in central FL, dried in a hot air beef jerky machine.My usual oral dose is .8(8/10)gram to elevate mood and increase energy. 2grams produces mild visuals for me. I set aside .6(6/10)gram for smoking to submit a report. Sample was two small caps and several small stem pieces.All material was broken into small pieces and smoked through a single stage waterpipe with a 'one hitter' bowl.
