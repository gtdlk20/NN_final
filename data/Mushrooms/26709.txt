On this day, I had class, and this was the day a good friend of mine was supposed to visit me for the first time - but he didnt come. I spent the day with my friend J, who spent time with me the week before when I first dept into the mushroom. Then I went off to see my boyfriend at the time. I was wondering whether I should take the mushrooms on this day and he answered my question by playing me a strange cartoon of dancing mushrooms, singing, Mushroom, mush-room, ohhhhhhh mushroom! That was clearly a yes.
