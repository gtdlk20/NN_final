Overall I am intensely pleased with the outcome of the trip. Hereafter I shall be less anxious about tripping alone on mushrooms, as I find that it is rewarding psychologically in that I could examine some areas of my life that I had not let myself consider closely before, and it also let me appreciate the aesthetic aspect of the trip without any external interruption. Additionally, as A mentioned, social anxiety is eradicated and there is no risk of the confusing, messy situations that easily arise when tripping in a group of three or more people. It may be a testament to A personally, but I in fact found that his online company was easily comparable to that of close friends I have previously tripped with in real life: the same interpersonal empathy and understanding was there, and A was not even tripping himself.
