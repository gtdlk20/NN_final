We left the bathroom and went back in bed. We talked for a long time, but I'm having problems remembering what we said. We talked about anything that we felt like saying. I told her some of the things I know about mushrooms, LSD and psychedelics in general. Since she was tripping, I know that she could perfectly assimilate what I was telling her.
