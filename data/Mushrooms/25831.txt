The dream was an exact reenactment of the night, starting from when I ate the mushrooms.  I was walking around my house and walked up to my room and noticed my room had a very intense blue glow as if the moon were inches away from my bedroom. I looked down and saw myself sleeping, after I noticed myself sleeping I dove into my sleeping body and woke up.
