Last night was different. I have been going through an ongoing battle in my head recently, trying to determine who out of my surrounding peers were actually my friends. I suppose its my own fault, I'm not stupid, I know the effects of psychoactives - I live and breathe the realm of psychology on both a professional and personal level everyday. What I did last night was an immediate intrusion into the deepest depths of my mind. I've discovered this year that I'm perhaps a little too analytical, this character trait will therefore only be magnified if I start meddling with psychoactive drugs. I drew pictures, lots and lots of lines and circles in an interwoven pattern. I tried to to draw other things but got distracted whilst doing so, so my images became distorted by the endless squiggles and swirls. Maybe I actually wouldn't have noticed but I made the mistake of showing my companion my work. Comments were made, comments that would never have bothered me had I not been in such a vulnerable state of mind. Our drawings didn't match, my endless pattern seemed somehow to represent perfectly my analytical and deep nature, and all of those hang ups in my life that I had been desperately trying to address for so long.
