My friends knew it wasn't a good idea to let me go off on my own, so they said they'd come with me.  They called upstairs to the other two guys and said that we were going for a walk.  By the time they got downstairs, though, one of my friends had calmed me down and helped me appreciate the trip instead of being scared by it.  I had overcome the only bad part of the entire night, and was ready to enjoy the trip.
