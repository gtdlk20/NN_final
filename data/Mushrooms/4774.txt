Suddenly I heard shouts of happiness coming from down the hill and Jeff very excitedly told me that our friends were back. I got out of the blanket and saw these figures stretching from normal height to ten feet tall come near me. They looked like my friends but they felt like a dream.  They began to talk about what we were to do next as a sense of calm happiness fell over me.  They seemed fake but I accepted their unreality and Scott gave me his jacket. Everything still felt like a dream as I smiled and watched my reality come back to me.
