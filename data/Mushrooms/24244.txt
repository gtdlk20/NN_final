I've been smoking pot since I was 13 on a daily basis, save for a few 1-4 month breaks here and there. It's been one of the few things I had to look forward to. I loved everything about it, the smell, the plants, crumbling up a nug and packing it into a bowl, smelling my fingers afterwards, it was heaven for me, and I thought I needed it.
