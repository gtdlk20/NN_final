I came out onto a small boulder.  It was covered in bird droppings, which ran in white streaks as the water from my trunks hit them and ran down the rock.  I stood, transfixed by the chalky trickles below me, and watched them absorb into the rocks and run across them for a long time.  My friends had started slowly coming back from the ledge, and Syph stopped on the same rock, watching the water bugs swarm across the still water at the river bank.  I began exploring the rock area, walking into a secluded gully and seeing a rock that looked like a viper leer ominously at me.  I stepped on it, and watched lichens on rocks, or patterns in granite, or the trees and cliffs across the way.  It was as if I was looking for a door, a stimulus to throw the trip wide open.  I think at this point I was beginning to peel back the layers guarding the subconscious.  I was having fun, but there were no cathartic feelings at that point.
