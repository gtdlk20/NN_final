Now I've eaten mushrooms plenty of times. I've had some fantastic trips, experienced ego-loss and rebirth, and had plenty of shitty nauseous and anxiety filled trips on mushrooms as well. Basically, since I first tried LSD, I have considered mushrooms pretty much 'obsolete'. Mushrooms could be a religious experience, but LSD always seemed so much more human, enabling me to learn about myself and my place in humanity.
