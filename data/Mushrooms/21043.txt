My friend gave me a ride to my other friend ts house. In the car there was some funk on witch I could really groove to. When we arrived at ts house we smoked a couple onies of some Afghani bud he had picked up in school that day. Cannabis always makes my trip run smoother, it takes the edge off. At this point I consumed another quarter of shrooms with a hot pocket.(approximately 2 hours after I ate the last eighth) We then went for a walk in the rain. The rain felt super intense on my back, almost like a massage. Me and t beat boxed as we walked it was a super fun thing to do when your trippen. After a while we came upon a creek and just as this happened the rain stopped immediately and the sun poked through the clouds. My trip exploded it felt like the entire quarter just hit me all at once. A tingly sensation vibrated through my body. With each second it grew more and more intense. Every time I breathed in I could feel the oxygen going in to my lungs this increased the tingling sensation times 2.  All of a sudden the entire tree line started flying in and out coming at me then receding. ENTIRE trees were moving and swirling around me. This also increased the tingling feeling I was forced to sit down. I looked over a t and his shirt just shattered in to tiny little squares and then sucked back together again. There was one thought stuck in my head (nothing matters). At this moment I cared about nothing else in the world. Things I was typically self conscious about just vanished, I just didnt give a shit about anything, all the pressures of life were lifted from my shoulders. I had the courage to say anything to anyone I wanted and I wouldnt even care what they thought because I was having such a good time and nothing could kill it. I hitch hiked to my other friend ms house and met many interesting people an the way, I had a great time.
