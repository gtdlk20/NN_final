When I would walk into a different colored room my mood would change instantly and I would begin thinking about something else.  I spent a half hour in the bathroom staring at the floor because the pattern was continuously moving and I felt as if I was swaying.  I had silk boxers on and it felt like they were made of water so I took them off and finished the night commando.  I became deeply engaged in the mirror.  It was like looking directly at my self esteem.  I felt as if I was looking into myself from a different person and I could see my face morphing into the various ways I see myself.  IÂ’d go from good looking to ugly instantly with thousands of other faces in between.  I wondered what was going to happen in the future and who would I become. I was also fascinated with the way my muscles looked.  I took off my shirt and my abs seemed more ripped then ever.  My body looked familiar but something about it was new and unexplored at the same time.
