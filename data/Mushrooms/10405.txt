I stare at the sky and it's exploding with spiraling colorful fractals. I feel a totally amazing connection with the universe, I start to grasp its infinity and how small we really are. When I close my eyes I travel into another dimension. I feel sort of merged with my new dimension and there is no way how this can be described in words. The experience is so profound and enormous that I start to loose myself. I can't understand what I'm doing and I'm starting to feel dizzy. My mind is thinking along the lines of 'This is the answer to everything. Am I now stuck in an infinite space? How will I ever come back to reality?'. I start having negative thoughts and my mind is caught in a loop, 'Am I going mad?'. I'm dwelling on this single thought for what feels like hours but it was probably just minutes, sort of like a stuck CD-player repeating a sample over and over.
