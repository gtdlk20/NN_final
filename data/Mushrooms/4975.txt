The amount I ate was approximately 3.4 g, give or take 0.1 g, of Psilocybe cubensis 'Ecuador' mushrooms, seven years old, kept powdered in the freezer. I have repeatedly eaten old powdered mushrooms and their intensity keeps well for many years, as long as it is in an airtight seal, away from light and frozen.
