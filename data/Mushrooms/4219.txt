In my closed eye vision I was looking out over a vast alien landscape. It seemed simultaneously natural and technological and all the matter within the landscape appeared to be the same. There were elevations and lownesses. There were buildings and spires. There were vehicles on roads and in the air. All the movements in this pulsing, moving tableau were fluid. The sky over this landscape was dark but everything occupying the space had its own sort of internal light that was neither sharp nor diffuse but that retained a kind of pastel neon glow. It looked like a scene out of some kind of combined fantasy and science fiction mythology mixed with early-Netherlandish landscape paintings. I now refer to this space as the TRON VALHALLA.
