I asked if they were taking anything, and they said they didn't have anything to take. By about 9:30, I was looking at the floor in my basement, and I started to see shadows that looked like they were being sucked into the ground in a whirlpool. I thought this was quite great. A few minutes later the whirlpools were gone, and replaced with what I can only describe as hyroglyphs. They seemed to rise from the carpet, and float up, leaving trails behind. The hryoglyphs then started to move together to make one large shape which looked like a negative photo of 2 dogs. I thought that was really strange. The girls said that we should go on a walk, and that would really get the shrooms working, so we got up and left.
