I spent the next few hours rocking back and forth, trying to get the voices that were yelling at me to shut up.  Finally, at about 5 am I passed out.  I woke up feeling completely out of it and told my dad that I needed to go to the hospital.  I was kept in a in-patient unit for two weeks due to psychosis.
