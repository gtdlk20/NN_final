I hear the opening riff and shout OH YES! I rush towards my friends and throw down the book and pencil. This can wait! Im going to have some fun! At this point I get to the water level, the water filled with eyes watching over and protecting me. I push off the side and dive head first under the surface. I feel amazing the water is cool and refreshing. I stand up again next to another friend (let's call him Dave) Please dont splash me, Dave said nervously. At this point I realize why they were standing around in the water and not moving. The water was freezing cold I couldnt care less, I felt so confident and comfortable in nature at this point. I swim around again and my friends look at me alarmed
