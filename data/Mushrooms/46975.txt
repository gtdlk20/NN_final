It was about one or two on a sunny afternoon as me and two of my friends sat, crammed into a small Suburu, in a deserted church parking lot.  This was in the infancy of my weed smoking days, and I wasn't quite sure I was ready for mushies.  My friend, Alucard I'll call him, had already done mushrooms several times and wanted to try smoking them to see what sort of effect it had.  I decided to go along with it since we hadn't been able to get any chron that day.  Alucard broke out his bong and we started ripping dry bowls.  The smoke was almost undetectable in my throat until I had inhaled too much and then coughed it all out.
