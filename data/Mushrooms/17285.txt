At this point, my feet had melted into the floor and I felt stranded, like on an island, I began to think about the carribeans and of the life I wanted, a life in paradise, after this I thought that a half hour should have passed, when I checked the time it was only 10:23. I then got up and went onto the computer. I opened up to a message board and started recording my experience on text. The letters appeared out of nowhere, as if they had just came out of a wormhole leading to another dimension. Then, as my window was open, a breeze had came threw, knocking my thoughts out of my mind and taking them with it. My mind was blank, zoning out on the wall, then, my mind kicked in again.
