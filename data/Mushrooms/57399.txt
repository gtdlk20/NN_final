I took a seat on the couch with my friend Megz and I started to trip. There was a sparkly design on everything it was amazing. The house I was at, had 2 kids sleeping in it... And when they woke up they were super hyper and were running around the house. The little boy was on the floor rolling around like he was seizuring and his face was all bloody, and his sister was sitting on the floor crying tears of blood... When I came outta that mind trap I felt my high lower a little and I was kinda confused as to why I would see something so horrifying... But then I started yawning... Non stop and just getting higher and higher every time, I didnt come down even a little bit until 6 hours later! I remember not being able to talk... And when I did... It was scary because I couldnt feel my mouth or control what I said.
