We finished Malcolm In the Middle (it was the episode where the family goes out to dinner with StevieÂ’s family, lmao! Perfect episode!) and we started to feel the mushrooms leave us. It became easier for me to talk and remember more of what happened, but at this point it was getting late. We were yawning and we crawled into bed and went to sleep after some chatter. I slept for about 6 hours and went to work the next day after eating some lunch with my friend and dicking around at a couple of stores. Work was interesting (I work at an organic grocery store) and I felt spaced out but whole. I felt at peace for the first time in a long time. My normal social anxiety had vanished for the day at least. No HPPD or anything, and the shrooms had a very clean high similar to 1P-LSD, but shorter and with much crazier visuals.
