Profound wonder and amazement took over me, and coldness. The wind kicked up and forced us off the top. On the walk down, the ground seemed to sway, and we walked towards the other side of the park (its a really big park) and came to the community garden. By this time, everything seemed to look particularly un-real. To our dismay, the garden was closed, so we settled for walking along the chain link fence. The bushes and trees seemed to breathe and warranted intense scrutiny. The cracks along the bark took on an opaque look, and slowly melted away. M came upon a beautiful tree, which she proceeded to hug and caress, proclaiming undying love for the tree (even kissing and licking it). I wandered around (staying close to her) and feeling exhilaratingly interested in every leaf, pebble, and clod of dirt. Finally, M wrenched herself from the tree and we walked a little further down the fence, and thats when everything accelerated.
