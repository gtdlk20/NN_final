I realized that these people werent criminals as the media had depicted them to be. In fact, as it turned out, they were a few of the most accepting people I had ever met, showing me significantly more respect than any friends or classmates. I slowly began to realize how much we had all been lied to over the course of our childhoods. Here was a completely natural, life-changing herb, which had virtually endless medical uses. Its never claimed a single life and the main side effect is euphoria. It probably didnt help that I was also completely fascinated at the time with biology and drugs, and learning how they affect the individuals mind and body. Eventually shit hit the fan with that first job of mine and we were all asked to leave, though I still remained in touch over the years with the friends I had met there. They had already gone on to do more for me than the majority of people I would go on to meet throughout my lifetime.
