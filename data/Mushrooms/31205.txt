Stage 2. We had found a really nice place to sit. We sat on a bridge over a steadily flowing creek, with a tree lingering over us and traffic rarely whizzing by us from behind. All three of us sat there, deep in thought, forming the most absurd, but quite possibly theories and philosophies about life and the forces within it. We all stared at a street light for about an hour, because it would randomly shut off, then turn on yellow, then it'd  go from yellow to red, and red to white, and white to the most spectacular blue color ever, with a gorgeous radiant aura around it, and suddenly it'd flick off... and the process would start over. But after 2 hours of conversing... it was time to move on.
