My previous journeys had revealed the enormity of the pain that I have been carrying since my childhood (and perhaps before). They had also shown me the omipresent power of the life force, and the blessing of the love I share with my wife - a love that cannot even begin to be described, and so I will not attempt to. They made me see that my anger towards the old God for not helping my people or any people when they face brutality or extinction, had become a strange sort of misplaced atheism. Indeed, it now appears to me that there is no such God - instead there is Being and Sentience that transcend Time (I realize uppercase is a rather poor descriptive device). Perhaps even more importantly, they taught me that as terrified and filthy as I might have felt inside, judgement need not be stronger in me than loving myself. In other words, they taught me to honor myself in order to better honor others. How's that for a list of sweeping changes?
