The air was chill and nature was calling my name.  We walked slowly in between a few ponds and that was one of my favorite parts of the night. The top layer was frozen so we began throwing rocks in to break the ice which was an incredible site to see at our point in time. Eventually we came upon a giant field where some kids had made a giant igloo. The 6 of us huddled in an enormous igloo as we came into our peaks. Smoking ciggarettes is another thing I learned about during this trip. We then ventured to what I like to call 'My World'. The rest of the field was covered in snow, but it had a lot of texture from people running all over it.
