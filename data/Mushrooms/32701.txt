I only started to think about everything, about everyone I knew, and who I have been sort of an asshole to. I started regretting some actions I did, that I never thought of as a wrongdoing. I started getting very depressed as I realized all of this. And in one instant, I understood everything. Litteraly, EVERYTHING. I saw everyone whom I know's life. Not litteraly viewed, but I felt it, connected with it, and completely understood everything. I understood the actions of people, that I could not before contemplate. I understood everything about me, things I did not understand, and never knew why. As this continued, I got more and more depressed. But I knew this had to happen. It was a right of passage so to speak. That the mushrooms were showing me understanding.
