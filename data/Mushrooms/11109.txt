At this point I was very deep in thought.  I was looking at some trippy images on my computer, although they were not moving around and going crazy like I had prepared for.  One of the pictures which had three girls in it in some psychedelic mass of patterns and colors, and all three at the time were my mom.  This weirded me out.  Listening to music was nice, but I was so deep in thought or so deep in concentrating on the bright shapes and elegant designs my brain was creating for my viewing pleasure, I didn't really enjoy The Beatles like I had hoped. I also didn't get that 'wide' sound of music people are always talking about.
