Then the trip went in an entirely different direction. I suddenly just started making weird hand gestures that left funny shadows on the wall that faced the TV. I must've sat there for like 20 minutes just making hand gestures and rubbing the wall. Now I started to roll about my bed like a joyous kitten. Crawling under the covers, tossing the pillows, and letting my mind roam freely. I imagined black and white images of elongated people stretching and contorting their bodies. These images came to life behind my closed eyes. All the people lived in a funny town that was checkered black and white, with pointy buildings that reminded me of that hill in A Nightmare Before Christmas that Jack Skellington walked on as it stretched itself out for him to walk. I kept moving away from this alien city and began noticing all of the absurdly curved roads leading to this city, which was now miles away.
