Hours and hours passed which was noticeable because of the change in lighting around us. The shadows were getting longer and longer. We all felt that we were coming down from the mushrooms, but we could still feel the effects. #2 told each of us to choose a different path and go on a solo journey while we were still tripping. I picked the path that I stared down for the majority of the day. We all went our separate ways but I knew exactly where the other three were. As I was walking, I was thinking of family and friends, longing to see them all again and sent them good vibes. I couldnÂ’t wait to see my loved ones and embrace them!
