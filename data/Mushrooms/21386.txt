At one point I remembered the time that M got too high on mushrooms at that party I missed cause I was working, and when I came to pick him up he told me very earnestly that he had realized something important - he had realized that R was God. I had an attack of hysterical giggles thinking about how deluded you'd have to be to think that a man was God. Can a man give birth to the universe? For fuck's actual sake. No wonder we are in the state we are in.
