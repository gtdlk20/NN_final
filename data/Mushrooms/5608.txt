I had been told that liberty caps lie somewhere in between Mexicans and Hawaiians strength-wise, and so I was admittedly a little apprehensive with regard to experimenting with these fungi without a sitter or company of any kind.  However, a couple of weeks ago my acquaintance approached me with a 25 centilitre coke bottle filled up to about one-third of newly made liberty cap brew. After being assured that it contained one approximate dose I took it off him, shoved it in my freezer and waited patiently until the weekend before having a go. After some to-ing and fro-ing I finally settled on taking it at seven oÂ’clock on the Saturday evening. I had drunk four beers prior to taking the mushrooms, however as they were consumed over the course of six hours, I was no more than somewhat tipsy by the time I drank the brew.
