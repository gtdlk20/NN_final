My sitter changed the music to a solo flute lullaby, and I felt myself becoming part of a vast network of dancing pale green branches. There was no up or down, and no edges, my limbs merged seamlessly into the network and it was all dancing in time with the music. Sunlight shining into water with ripples makes a similar pattern, visually. I was experiencing it more kinesthetically.
