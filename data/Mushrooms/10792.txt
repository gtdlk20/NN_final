00:00: My friend feels seek and has a slight of paranoia. I try to help him out, but he just keeps doing stupid thing like talking way too loud, turning on all the lights and stuff like that. Eventually I am able to calm him down, but he just keeps talking from time to time. For a while a find it difficult to go with the flow.
