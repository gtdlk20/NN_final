So I decided to call one of my smoking buddies. Lets call her B. I talked to her for a bit then my mom came. She was wearing a pink sweater that was, in relity, faded. But it was glowing like a neon sign. I had 'come down' a little bit and was able to talk pretty normal. My mother and I were in the car having the most wonderful conversations about life and I was having amazing visuals. She decided to stop and take me for ice cream and it tasted incredible. I had almost completely come down when we got home.
