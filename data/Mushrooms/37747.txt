My trip was more in control then, I had a great contact with my cousin, and with his mistical visions... I understood what he was feeling, even if he constantly was saying that no one could understand him... I think it's quite normal this behaviour.  Things started to calm down, even if I was still seeing their faces with strange moving patterns on, like if some bumps were growing on them.
