One last feature of this trip, which I think is worth mentioning, as it is quite fascinating and I hadnt experienced it up until this point was the visualization of breathing which is commonly reported by users when tripping, but not quite in the standard sense of walls melting or waving. Mirrors are an often discussed topic amongst the drug community, and after this trip I can definitely understand why. I used the bathroom one final time before finally crawling into my bed for the night, and when I looked into the mirror I was immediately taken back. My face looked completely distorted and disproportional, as if it was constantly contorting. My right pupil would appear to zoom-in, causing that side of my face to appear much larger than the other. Then, in a single instance, the right pupil would zoom-out and the left would zoom-in, causing the same effect on the opposite side. This effect went back and forth between both my eyes constantly, and theres really no clear way to describe it without it sounding like complete gibberish and nonsense, but Im sure anybody whos looked into a mirror on psychedelics can relate.
