I canÂ’t remember walking home, all I know is that I left first because I wanted to play on my 360.  I do remember laying on the couch playing a demo for a WWII game and for a while I thought I was actually there, my neck hurt the next day from being so tense the whole time.  While playing Xbox the effect eventually wore off.
