This went on for several hours, and at last I thought I had a grip.  Vision was still very colorful and swirly, but at least I was beginning to rebuild my ego.  I turn to find T on the bed next to me, also slowly regaining conciousness.  We start talking about the experience a bit at this point, and try to relax as the afternoon sun warms the room from the open window.  It's about 5:30 or 6 pm.
