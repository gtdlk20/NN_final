The group I was with had taken a lower 3.5g dose and knew I wouldnÂ’t be myself. They asked if they could leave me to walk 15 minutes up the bush path to a lookout in the mountains where we were staying. I agreed and sat myself down in my hammock among the trees. I closed my eyes and saw 3D images of gods surrounded by glowing laurels and a figure I saw as myself lying on a rock surrounded by running water. The god figure came down to me. I interpreted this as the mushroom taking its place inside my consciousness. I open my eyes moments later to find the leaves on the surrounding trees rushing and flowing as if they were affected by wind although the air was completely calm.
