Planned for months I was going to take a friend on her first trip.  It was her birthday and I thought that maybe it would lead to some amazing bonding between the two of us.  Her stressful life opted her to not do it and so, behest her having paid for her share, I gave them to some other people to do with me.  Of the two people one was also a first time tripper.  The other was a many time tripper as I was.  I agreed to meet them at an apartment complex after I did some much necessary tasks of collecting people.
