So I ventured out into the cold. It was around this point that Why You Wanna Trip on Me began playing and I discovered I had a mean side. At first I tried to apply the lyrics of the song towards my parents, but then the cold began to get to me. It was painful, especially since my senses were heightened. But rather than recoiling at the discomfort, I relished in it. I think I may have actually snarled at the cold. After all, it was never comfort that I asked for in taking psychedelics, only enlightenment. I would repeat that to myself sporadically over the next few hours.
