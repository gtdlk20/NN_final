At this time I had a feeling that I needed to get home very soon because I had to wake up very early the next morning. I argued to my friends that it was really late but they didnt seem to think it was late at all which annoyed me very much. Eventually I convinced them to take me home but they wanted me to have time to start to cool off so 3 drove 1 and 2 home first and then me. The drive was the most mental segment of the trip. I began to feel as if the universe had ended. I may have had my eyes closed but I had no vision beyond what I saw in my mind. I had convinced myself that the universe had ended and I was living in a single white dot, like the one depicted in the center of a freshly broken TV on a cartoon. I spent quite a bit of time contemplating what Id do for eternity as a conscience living in the small circle left of existence, and the time that elapsed seemed like years.
