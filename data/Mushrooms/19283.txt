A bath? Sure, that would be great! I say enthusiastically, for as soon as Goopstar had mentioned the bath, I realized it was inevitable that I was going to have a bath. There was no escape. He left the room to go run it, I could hear the water running in the distance. This was another attempt on Goopstars part to get me out of my mind and into my body.
