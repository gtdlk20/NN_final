I have tried many drugs and have decided that there is nothing I like more then a good psychedlic. So far my list of experiences includes Salvia (5-10), Peyote (1), LSD(10-15), Psilocybin (15-20), DPT (1), DXM (1), MDMA (5-6), 5MEO-DMT (2), Syrian Rue (2), and my most intense and most terrifying, Ayahuasca (4) with my last trip (20 grams mimosa 5 grams syrian rue) leaving me cowering in the corner swearing to myself that I would never touch a drug again if I came back to reality. Of course I came back and was more then ready to dose up a month later. I still have not totally recovered from it (3 months ago) so I have been dosing much lower and with less frequency. I have also been slightly depressed as of late so that has effected how deep I am willing to go.
