30 - 45 min: We're now walking around in nature and I feel bouncy. We stop at some bushes to take a piss and when we're done I look at A. His head is slightly distorted and all edges of it are very sharp. When we walk towards the dancefloor a red energy flows past my feet and I stop immediately to have a look at it. It looks like a reddish barely visible transparent river flowing through my feet. My more experienced tripping buddy is starting to feel giggly now.
