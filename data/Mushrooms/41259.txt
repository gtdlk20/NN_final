During the car ride I felt nauseous, an uncontrollable yawn, and a constant feeling of having to piss. I had many weird thoughts of suicide and killing people (but these were only thoughts). I was lost and confused the whole ride. We ended up in McDonalds at one point. I felt dirty and felt that I had to cleanse myself. Water was sacred to me for some reason. While in the bathroom, I was forcing myself to puke, I had mucus coming out of my nose and I was pissing. Crazy thing were happening in the bathroom, I felt lost yet safe. I was all over the bathroom floor. I washed myself up and went outside. We got back into the car and I was tripping hard. It was more of a mind trip. Way too many questions running through my head. At one point I didn't care about life or death. Nothing made sense to me, school,the law, death, human races, nothing at all.
