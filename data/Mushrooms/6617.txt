When outside I remembered about closed eye visuals, so I sat back with my music and closed my eyes: I was amazed. On my last trip I didnÂ’t have the chance to close my eyes, so I was stunned to be confronted with amazing fractal patterns, 3-dimensional shapes, and at one time a deep-red tunnel through which I was seemingly travelling. I also saw incredible patches of various bright colours move around my field of vision, twirling round and round like fireworks leaving tracers. One of the most interesting things was the range of colours I saw; I have never experienced anything like it. Everything was so crystal clear, so beautiful.
