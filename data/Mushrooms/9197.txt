T+4:00: A blessing, but mostly a curse. The act of vomiting quite literally removed the trip. I returned almost to baseline in only a half hour. Only after this did I regret having to puke, as the positive three hours were by far and away worth the minute of anguish. To ease the pain, all three of us took five doses of MDA each, and the rest of the night once again became very enjoyable.
