Once I was awake I felt like I could move consciousness anywhere, be anything. From my bodyÂ’s organs to rocks and trees to animals and other people. Time and space was of no consequence. It felt like I could surf down through molecules smaller and smaller to infinity and back up into outer space larger and larger to infinity. Reality is a set of those wooden nesting dolls but you can never get to the smallest or the biggest doll.
