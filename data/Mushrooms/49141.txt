I was worried about nothing. After twenty minutes, the first affects were the normal weird feelings. My body felt like it was going up a mountain, the way you can feel the pressure squeezing you in and making your ears pop. It wasnt a bad feeling, just weird. I also started to get the giggles, to me, it was funny that I was starting to shroom in front of thousands of people.
