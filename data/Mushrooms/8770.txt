9:15  Weve hiked a good way up the trail so I decide to light up a joint. Shortly thereafter the roof of trees over our heads begins gyrating into an incredibly beautiful web of starry swirls and kaleidoscopic webbing. My friends, who have eaten less than I have, see the same thing, especially my crazily giggly friend who had never tripped before. I can tell these shrooms are very high quality. They were very smooth and had cleaner visuals than any shrooms I had eaten before.
