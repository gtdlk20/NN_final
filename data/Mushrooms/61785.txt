I was at a party with my cousins.  I hadn't taken the shrooms yet.  When I first went in, everyone was mad cool.  I was meeting a lot of people and I was with a good solid group of people I knew.  My cousins, 25, 24, 23 were experienced with the mushroom.  Only one of my cousins were tripping that night.  I chewed them all and downed them with a couple of bottles of Guiness.  I was a little drizzed, but nothing that wasn't more than social (nothing out of control).  Most of the people were on the deck smoking bowls of some fantastic crip, but I didn't have any of that.  I was too busy waiting for my trip to kick in.
