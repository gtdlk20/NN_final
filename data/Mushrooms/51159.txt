After i realized that i was starting to come down, i began to feel more at peace with myself and accepting of the situations i came to realize existed. I began to actually let myself feel happy. I also realized that what i had experienced the night before is a core part of my personality that needs to be dealt with. I realized that i do fear making decisions in life because im scared that i will fail...and so im just floating along, doing nothing...
