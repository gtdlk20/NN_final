How did the mushrooms do this? Was it a neurological effect, a psychological effect, or both? Does ecstacy always worsen your concentration and mushrooms always better it, or was it a matter of dosage? That fourth of an ecstacy pill I had taken did not affect my concentration at all, and my mushroom trip, although powerful, was a fairly low dose. Maybe if I had taken a lot more shrooms, I would have had so many things to consciously and subconsciously think about, that my thought currents would be as unstoppable as the ones after the big ecstacy trip. Also, it seems strange that mushrooms would better concentration. It is more likely that they relaxed my mind so that I can concentrate to my full potential. None of these things are completely clear. What is clear, however, is that that ecstacy trip severely worsened my ability to meditate, and this mushroom trip completely fixed it. Another thing that is clear is that I could not ask for a better situation for myself. I'm getting good grades, I'm almost always feeling peace and joy, I'm enjoying meditation as much as I used to, and I'm enjoying flirting with girls and dating more than I ever had in my life.
