The new jiu-jitsu lesson came... I felt like I was in control, fear is temporary,  clarity is temporary, but I could trust myself, because damn - I did it!  It was a huge ego boost, but a short one, thank god. Sadness came, thoughts of being a fool for assuming that this is the goal... no, I am a tiny speck- it is not mine to control, I don't own it.  I am serving something else.  I realized that I had a purpose to not be all, but to serve all.
