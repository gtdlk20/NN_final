I was, of course, aware of the larger-dose experience I had had 27-03-18, almost a year before, and the extreme Hell that that had been  for the part of it that I was conscious because I did pass out for a while on that.  When I came to, I asked: Why, if I am God (I experienced being the One), do I still need to load the dishwasher?  That question didnt go down well and I was thrown into exactly the same hellish algorithmic H.R. Giger Garden of Eden that I ended up on the later "15 gram" experience.
