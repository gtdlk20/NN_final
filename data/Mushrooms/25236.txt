T+0:15: First alert. I turn off all the lights, computer monitor, sit on the sofa, and prepare a 4-cartridge balloon of nitrous. As I prepare it, in the dark, I seem to be enveloped in a large hollow sphere which had tribal symbols swirling all over the inside of it in glow-in-the-dark color, and is closing in on me slowly as I prepare it. When I put the balloon to my lips, the symbols/sphere rush inside of me. I am wearing clothes at this time.
