I experienced what could be called God as this videos explanation of the 10th dimension. God as I perceived on this trip, is nothingness. The void that everything arises from. The white hole that contains everything but is at the same time nothing itself. The only perceiver. The only soul. The entire universe is consciousness itself and I had re-merged with it. All that exists is this reality experiencing itself in as many ways as it can. Its like an infinite chameleon that is playing a big game of hide and seek with itself. The really odd thing was that it all seemed so familiar as if I had done this many times before.
