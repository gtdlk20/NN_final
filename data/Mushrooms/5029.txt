I got a vibe, similar to other trips ofÂ… What are we waiting for? Lets do it now, I pictured activists who non-stop fight the system, many who are locked away now. I got sense of global awareness and all the futile things and games Western culture (now spread almost everywhere) has set up to supposedly make us happy, but inadvertently devour the planet. I deeply yearned (and still do) for everyone to experience life in this connected way, so that we could stop killing and enslaving humans, animals, plants, ecosystems, etc. Even just feeling that connection one time is enough to realize that it is real and always there.
