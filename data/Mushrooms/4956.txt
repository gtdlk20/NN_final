I did not, I repeat, did NOT have a bad trip. It was only the intensity of the trip that made me uncomfortable with losing a feel of reality. I have since this day completely changed my outlook on living life when you know it can be taken away in an instant, at any time. Thanks for the dedication in following my trip report, reader.
