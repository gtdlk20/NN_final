11:00 T made a comment to L that he smelt bad from work and had not taken a shower yet. Me being in a trip coma unable to decipher or understand the words that were being said on the movie and from my friends. I began to panic thinking I smelt bad and that I was dirty. I felt disgusting and vile. I couldn't shake the feeling. It was destroying my time. I kept sniffing myself over and over trying to see if I smelt bad but smelt nothing (nothing bad anyway). I thought my nose had broke because I was sure I was dirty. I could feel it under my skin.
