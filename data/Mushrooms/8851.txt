We found a new spot on campus which was a little nook under a staircase with some really soft rocks.  And we talked about how weird it was.  Because someone actually made these rocks, theyre not naturally that smooth, and we found it odd that someones job is to make rocks smooth.  Then we noticed large gashes in some of the rocks laid together, and realized that the gashes had to have been made after they were laid there, and began to wonder, what exactly makes a gash in a rock?  Just normal random trippy talk.
