The first time trying this drug is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I was just thankful to have such accepting friends with me, along for the ride. At one point I distinctively remember looking over at Michael. I thought to myself how much he would enjoy and how much he would gain from such a rare opportunity. Man, someday was all my mind was able to bring myself to articulate to him in that moment, as my thoughts trailed off again instantly. I had intended to speak again, but as I was trying to find the right words, I recall Michael spoke up before I had the chance.
