As I writhed around in my bed, tangled in the bedsheets, I found myself face to face with what seemed like some terrifying alien being (or beings). It seemed so terrible that I couldn't possibly look at its face, it was beyond comprehension. I was scared out of wits. Though this terrifying being seemed to reassure me, after a time it began a process of change, like a spinning wheel, it slowly revealed its other face. A face of radiant beauty and joyous delight, I saw in this face everything we as a species strive to be. But, as surely as day turns to night, this being took on its repugnant form of terror and dismay. And so it went on for god knows how long, it went through the cycle again and again. From the glorious height of radiant love and beauty to the terrifying lows of fear and loathing.
