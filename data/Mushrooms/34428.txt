It started out like any other Friday, woke up, did my usual morning routine, preparing for school. But that day afterschool I planned to try mushrooms for the first time. After school I went over to my friend 'D's' house. I called my friend 'J' over to 'D's' house because he was planning on shrooming with me that day. At about 3 O'clock 'J' came over. We sat in D's room talking about things we've read and other experiences we've read about Mushrooms.
