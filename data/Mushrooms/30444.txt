 Addie drew a comic book character.  I told her I could just SEE, and just knew he needed glitter.  We named him Senior Fancy, and his job was to spread glitter to the world, making it a better place.  Throughout our trip weÂ’d reference him and add to the story.  We added Bueno Bums as his accomplices to his glitter spreading ways.
