The effects came on very quickly. Soon we felt a strong need to lay down, like we were being pulled to the earth. Swirling spiraling patterns came out of the wood and moss. The tree branches began to lace together above us. I could feel it getting stronger and stronger, in an almost erotic way, like building to an orgasm. I could feel it move through my body and the fractals of the trees and sunlight began to knit together above my head until everything was part of the pattern and I felt this bursting, indescribable joy. I felt this bursting, indescribable joy. It felt like the whole forest orgasmed, with me inside it! I wanted to kiss everything, every fiber and cell in my body was singing how glad it was to be alive. I thought about how shitty I have felt for so long, like my life doesnÂ’t matter, like I was worthless. But now all I could think was that I was so, so glad to be here, that just existing was good and it was enough.
