I've smoked cannabis daily for the last 15 years, and have found it to be a constant in my life. When I was in my teens, my interests in altered states led me to LSD, and at that age the only sources of info seemed to be 1960's documentaries/research literature, which I eventually regretted ever having become obsessed with, as they tended to prejudice my experiences.
