When it got dark, we drove around the golf course and then went to the swimming pool. It had stopped raining, but fortunately no one was there at the swimming pool. When we first got there, the clear blue color of the illuminated water looked awesome. It had sort of a luring effect and we all just kind of looked right at the pool and walked straight to it and went in. Later, we went to the pizzeria.
