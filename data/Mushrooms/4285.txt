It took me a solid week to feel back to normal, during which I didnt think Id be able to go back to normal ever again. The next day I was a afraid of whether Id be able to function normally in society again, or as how people knew me. I felt removed and was in a limbo state. felt like I had to relearn societal norms. I had a really hard time with math and counting change at the corner store. I couldnt remember what numbers were used for. I couldnt sleep normally for the next few days either, and wanting to cry spontaneously occurred throughout the week after, especially when thinking about the spiritual part of the experience. Even in writing this report a month later it still makes me emotional.
