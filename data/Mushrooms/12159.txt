We moved on as it grew dark, and a personally fundamental difference between the mushroom and acid became apparent. On acid, no matter how I tried, I felt like the world was still intact, real and concrete, and that I was fucked in the head from a drug I'd taken. On Psilocybin, I was perfect, the world was the thing that was screwed up. My thoughts were clear and refined, my body and mind were one and the same. The mushroom let me gaze on trees and mountains with awe, and when I looked at cars and houses, I laughed! Its hard to describe, but the mushroom was directly telling me something about time, eternity, and temporality - the eternal moved me to reverence, the mundane just looked silly.
