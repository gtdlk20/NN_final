After listening to a few tracks and coming up some more, I could already feel myself getting completely immersed into the music. All I could do was bob my head and talk to my friends about how they were feeling. After another track, one of my buddies suggested we go back to the basement and smoke another blunt. Some of us were already too messed up to consider smoking more, but others wanted in, so we went back down. When I was in the basement, I couldn't really get comfortable or sit, I had to stand up and walk around. I was getting crazy visuals. I looked at the walls of my basement, and saw 3D fractals that were holographic in the foreground of my vision. It was absolutely amazing. We were all complaining about how cold it was down there, and it seemed like everyone wanted to just get back to the living room as we were getting closer to the peak. As you may know, it's very hard to make a decision while on mushrooms, especially in a group, so I decided to just suggest that we clip the blunt, and head back upstairs. Everyone seemed to agree, and we all walked back upstairs. This time, the walk up was even more strange, and we felt an even heavier drunkenness with our walk. We piled back into the living room, and I started the album from the beginning. This time, we started to peak.
