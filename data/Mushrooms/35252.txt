I was enabled to see every particle in every object, and I believed myself to be inside the newspaper. I kept pressing my face into the newspaper, and desk. I was crying, but when I finally looked up, to see my friend, I thought that she was the one crying. I had no preconceived notion of feeling. I could not feel that I was crying, and so I thought that everyone else was. That French class lasted about two years, for me. The same pattern, happening over and over again. When asked to do my oral, I looked up, and sighed, babbling some inconceivable notion, that didn't make any sense. Most likely I was asking where my 'reassuring friend' had gone. I felt like if I could see him again, I would feel better. This made me jump up, and walk to my friend, saying 'you're crying, we have to go'. She glared at me, and told me to sit down, and stop freaking out. The idea that I had been freaking out, freaked me out. (I hadn't known I was freaking out before, because I thought that it was normal, and that it happened all the time. I also didn't remember taking the mush until around four.) I went back to my desk, and watched as a pool of water soaked into my newspaper.
