I found it helpful to debrief several times over the next few days, first with friends who knew I was planning to trip that night, then with others. Each spoken debrief feels like a few random snapshots that can't possibly do justice to the whole journey. This written debrief is more thorough, though what I'm sharing with you is far from the whole story, and the longer, less organized handwritten version is only slightly closer.
