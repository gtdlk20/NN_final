After, I spent another eternity sprawled out on the floor in the sun.  The sun raining through my eyelids and the sound of birds outside made me feel like I was on the floor of an immense forest.  Later, I became caught in front of the bathroom mirror by the absolute strangeness of my face.  Luckily I had come down quite a bit by then, or I fear I might have spent the whole trip examining my face.  While looking into my eyes, I understood why my face was arranged the way it is, in order to bring certain senses to the fore.  I think I may also have contacted a dormant personality within me, one which seemed like he could have lived a few centuries ago, somewhere in Europe.  He was extremely arrogant but charming, and I could see that some of his traits were expressed in me now, though to a milder degree.  I can only speculate.
