Two of the people we were with, A and his girlfriend E, were particularly slow to eat their dinner. Their plan was to cook two giant steaks for dinner, but I had already eaten shrooms by the time they even started cooking. It was in around the time that they threw their steaks on to their barbeque that I first noticed the effects. I noticed that the raw meat really grossed me out. It was then that all the familiar signs began, a feeling of giddiness, nausea, and excitement, all at the same time. The nausea that is sometimes experienced during come-up never really bothered me that much, usually because I was so excited for what was to come. This time was no different, and more than anything I could feel the excitement pouring over me as I got higher and higher. I started to notice everything around me looked really beautiful. The tents, the trees, the grass, the sky, the people around me. Except for one thing; A and E's steaks, which were now cooked. They looked even worse now than they did going on to the barbeque. If there is one word I would use to describe the look of the steak, it would be... dead. Everything else around me felt so full of life, but in the middle of all of that was this dead hunk of meat sitting on a plate, with blood oozing out of it.
