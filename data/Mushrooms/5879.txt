I finally reach the house, I get in kick off my shoes, and then I'm greeted by two people with a plate of shrooms, they ask me to divide it for them, and at this point my mind was in a world of its own, people didn't look like people, objects took on images of in releif. I mash my hand in the middle of them and make two sperate piles, which I have no idea are equal or not. I was tripping mad.
