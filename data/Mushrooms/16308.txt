I chewed approximately 1/4 oz of fresh mushrooms by myself [discrepancy with Reported Dose of "4 grams"]. I'm not a big fan of taking a small amount. If I am going to take a journey, I should make sure I take enough to ensure that I fully experience the experience. That is part of the reason one should be fully aware and knowledgeable when taking this type of drug. Why would anyone want to take it, and just get a buzz is way beyond me.
