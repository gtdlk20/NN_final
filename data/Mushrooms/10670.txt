I started to think about my life and started to realize how horrible I had been to everyone. I didn't feel anything for anyone so I didn't know how I hurt people. Now I was being hurt and I was forced to realize the pain I caused those around me, and how we all caused pain to those around us. I realized that the reason we are in pain is because we do pain to others. I discovered there are 2 basic reasons why people hurt other people. The first is out of ignorance, and the second is out of fear. People hurt other people because they don't understand the pain they cause. And they hurt people because they themselves are afraid of being hurt.
