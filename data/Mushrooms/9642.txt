     All in all, this recount does not do the whole expedition justice but it was indeed a memorable experience. I came out of it with a sense of peace and knowledge of my individual existence as a self-contained entity/experience moving through and as Space-Time itself in a wonderful relativistic waltz. Thus, the magic of the mushrooms.
