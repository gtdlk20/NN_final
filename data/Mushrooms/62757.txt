Just when I thought I might have a bad trip someone said something that was sort of funny and we all began to laugh.  It continued on and on. 20mins or so of straight laughing might have occured (not sure, time gets distorted).  Then, those laughs you get because you can't breath and you make that squeek noise happened.  That would continue the laughing.  It happened so long that I was like 'I can't stop laughing, I'm going to die like this' MY friends nodded and a couple minutes they subsided a bit.  At any moment though they would start back up and we would spend minutes laughing about nothing.  Then the night became blurry and unrememberable.
