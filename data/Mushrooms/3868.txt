Then I am laughing at myself. The spaces I see and feel are all familiar. I have been here many times while journeying sans-entheogens. I am pleased that I can get to this state in other ways... And without the buzzy mushy shroom distraction. I thank the ally(s) for the journey and the medicine. I am grateful to Earth, Sky and the shimmering life everywhere.
