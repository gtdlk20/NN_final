Suddenly, I found myself focused on a single idea: death. I remember thinking about our culture and life, and realizing that death is the one thing that is truly unexplainable, the one thing that artists and other people don't 'go over'. I realized that I could die at ANY MOMENT, and I remember the question 'what about death?' kept moving through my head, and I imagined what it would be like to die. BIG MISTAKE. The shrooms fed off of my thoughts, and seemed to react with them. My world started to darken as I imagined this death, and I became COMPLETELY afraid...more afraid than I have been in my entire life. I started shaking and tried to pull myself away from these thoughts, but it was too late...I was fully entrenched in a bad trip.
