About an hour in the trip things started to get dark and I started to get slight anxiety similar to my bad trips in the past. After that one bad trip I had trouble even breathing deeply without feeling like my body was shutting down and going into panic mode. I saw mostly darkness at this point no visuals at all besides a face in darkness and the face was constant never changing. I kept telling myself that I am more than my mind and I have nothing to fear. It was then that I felt my own energy. I felt my vibration pulsing throughout my whole body, it was a feeling I had felt before especially during meditation but I never understood. Now it was all so clear. I saw it flow through my skin and through me. I felt the energy of O who was sitting next to me and I felt his vibration and continued to feel his emotions and energy through the whole trip. This was around the peak of the trip. I came to realize that this energy is around us at all times and we always feel it but only when we learn to recognize it can we understand it.
