Despite having just experienced this unpleasantness in my guts, I was really hungry. I hadnt really eaten much all day. Despite my better judgement, I used an app to order a bacon cheeseburger deluxe and a milkshake from a diner. I dont remember what I did while I was waiting for its delivery but when it arrived I wolfed it down. I felt like Id made a bit of a mindless and decadent choice in food considering the deep spiritual experience I just had but I didnt get too down on myself for it. Soon after I was tired. I smoked a little more pot and went to bed.
