I believe that the mushrooms helped me rediscover my unrestricted personality because they lessened my attention span which caused me to apply my awareness to my momentary environment and to my racing thoughts. I was able to experience myself without the protective barriers. I now have a reference of my favorite self which I can emulate in my daily life.
