And then came an overpowering need to babble ad-lib poetry in the dark.  I got on my computer to start writing down what I was thinking, excited that the shrooms had come to a point of creativity.  I opened notepad and typed a few lines.  Then I typed a few more.  And I couldn't stop.  What was meant to be a few lines to be remember in the morning turned into a long, rambling, part-poetic, part-inner dialogue, part-complete nonsense.  This is the part of the trip that I found most fulfilling.  In retrospect, I see that I took these because I was immensely curious as to the inner workings of my mind that was clouded to me due to barriers that I had put up that even I could no longer see through.  I made some incredible realizations.
