Eventually I made it back to my room and this is when everything went terribly wrong. Suddenly I felt very naseaus. I thought I was going to throw up. This is when I panicked. It was about 5:30am now and my mom was awake. If I went into the bathroom and threw up my mom would hear it, come to see what was wrong, talk to me and instantly know that I was stoned since she herself had done acid and possibly other substances in the 60's. Panic hit me like a train. I decided I would go outside and vomit in the bushes outside the apartment building. I thought this was a very bad idea but I didn't have many options. I rushed to put on my pants and after I did I was trying to find my T-shirt. I looked under the bed, but it wasn't there. I should have just opened up my closet and gotten one out of my dresser, but I was too stoned to figure this out.
