I stepped outside and was blasted by some fresh winter air, and was comforted by this soft glow that looked as if it was a dream. The road and grass shined and appeared to be softened like when they put the cloth filter over the camera for a show like the bold and the beautiful. Everything looked nice and just wobbled, grew, shrunk and melted, I even noticed a strobe like effect in my vision as IÂ’d notice points of interest and my vision would dart around the place. I went running down the road, which eventually turned into a skip and then weird flowing movements, basically whatever I felt like, it always feels so good sober, and thus even better now. I was lost in the beauty of my body, my energy and the world.
