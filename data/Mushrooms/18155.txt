We walked along the cliff back towards the campsite, enjoying the view and freedom of our elevated height.  Eventually, we found an easy climb down the cliffs near the campsite and started to make our trek back down the beach towards the spot where we had left our backpack. I saw an old hippy looking man sitting in the sand with his dog enjoying the sunset.  I realized I must have looked like a mess, but he didnt seem to mind and neither did I.  Seth and Matt kept remarking on how dirty I looked, so I took a swim, this time not bothering to take off my khaki shorts.  We began to make our way to the camp and this is when I slipped into my first really negative shroom experience.  For some reason I was certain that a boat sailing in the distance was watching us somehow, a police boat waiting for us to do something that we could be arrested for. I insisted on leaving the pipe case underneath some rocks and sand, it being the only illegal thing that we had brought with us that we hadnt consumed.
