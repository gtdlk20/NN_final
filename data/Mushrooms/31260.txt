At 12:40 I noted that by now visuals should be obvious, as I paid close attention to the sounds my stomach was making, churning its way through the honey gloop. I figured that the honey really must have delayed on the onset which kind of sucked, but just at that moment I noticed that the walls were ever so slightly starting to breath, and what dim light there was in the room, was starting to give objects that colourful 'fuzz' that appears when a trip is incoming. It was obvious that my thoughts were not that of somebody sober, but I was very happy that I was not the least bit anxious. I often used to have major anxiety attacks on trips, especially at the start. But tonight things felt different. I got into bed with my gf and lay down with her resting on my chest in the dimly lit, calm room. Rumbles of thunder started to appear outside with the odd flash of blue lightning (this was not a hallucination).
