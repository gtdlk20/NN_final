A short part of the walk later I knew the knowledge I had available to me. I felt I was controlled by a god, nature. I was answering any question bought up but I would not say it out loud in fear of sounding arrogant or striking an argument with less spiritual members of the group. I felt small but protected and guided by this godly presence that was the Mushroom. This feeling continued for the rest of the trip.
