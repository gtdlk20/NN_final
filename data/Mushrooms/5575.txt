Any mention of the stomach or vomiting, even the name Ralph, would make one or all of us feel queasy.  So we also tried to forbid any mention of the stomach, which ended up bringing about the same habit of randomly shouting things like 'Hey Ralph!' into the night.  Our voices echoed throughout the whole valley, and on several occasions we wondered if the whole town knew we were on mushrooms, though we didn't really care if the whole world knew at this point.  A great deal of inhibition was lost, we felt truly free from the confines of society.
