My friend B went back and was talking to himself very loud and fast regarding science and the meaning of life. It was his 2nd doing shrooms and i was past this stage so i decided to go on a journey of my own I went and sat in an opening and discovered Dear bones. I just sat pondering society and how beautiful it would be just to live on your own in a forest like this and live off of survival.
