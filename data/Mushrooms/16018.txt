1:00 - Sitting on the couch, eyes closed.  Sensation of being in a large open space.  CEV slowing coming into focus.  Im sitting in a chair in some sort of a strange lobby.  It feels like its maybe 300ft wide and what seems like 600ft high.  The centerpiece of this lobby is some sort of golden, ruby studded, banjo (for lack of a better word) shaped machine.  I have no idea what it is or what its for but I dont seem to be particularly alarmed by its presence.
