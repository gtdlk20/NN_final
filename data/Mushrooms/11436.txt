A bright light filled the room around me.  It seemed like it was being emitted from a small sphere floating inches above the center of my head.  The light became almost blinding and then disappated, leaving a series of visual anamolies in its' wake.  I saw visual anamolies because that is the easiest way to explain things.  It was like my field of vision had been fractured jigsaw puzzle style.  Each small piece of fit together to make up my everything I could see.  However, within the pieces the colors seemed to separate into three distinct layers.  blue receded, the green floated in the mid-ground, while red seemed to be the closest to me.  When I closed my eyes, a single buttercup like flower spun behind my eyelids.  They were a bright orange color and they looked like flowers except that instead of pollen markings they had hieroglyphic markings that changed in a counter clockwise manner as the flowers spun clockwise.
