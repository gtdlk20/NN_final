We go to the conservatory, which I had earlier understood to be closed. It is actually open and being inside is thrilling. The cacti are all strange to look, but interesting and cool. We go back to Z and E, intending to tell them to come to the conservatory with us. Reluctantly Z gets up, and E, excited to see the conservatory also comes along. The conservatory is full of thrilling tactile and sensory experiences, but nothing of such a serious nature as A and I had experienced earlier. We all find plants to name after each other and thoroughly enjoy looking at and touching each individual plant.
