We decided to walk down after talking about school and our psychedelic experiences. While going down the hill I asked if we should head back to his house or go for another nature walk, at first I was adamant about the walk but something strange happened, I immediately recognized the feeling. I started to talk about mushrooms in general how this might be a little scary but just remember you're on a drug and you'll be ok, only to pause mid-sentence, realizing that my words were echoing and replaying in mind my words were echoing and replaying in mind. I said to R, 'We need to go back to the house for a bit.'
