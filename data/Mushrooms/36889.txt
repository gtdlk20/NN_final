We got to the dugout where we were suposed to meet this guy, and he wasn't there, so we called him. He said the dealer would be there in 5 minutes. We sat around and waited, feeling very excited. The dealer showed up. I knew him from back when I skateboarded nearly every day. He walked over and pulled out his wallet. There were 5 slightly golden nuggets wrapped in green cellophane. He told us to take any two we wanted. We gave him the $30 and took the biggest two he had. He asked us if we knew about shrooms, and we nodded and the dealer took off.
