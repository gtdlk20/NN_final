During that whole trip everything was in symbols to me, nothing of course is as clear as I have pictured on what I may have learned. Emotions were 1000 times greater, I felt empathy as I have never had, I felt love for my friends as I never did. The trees had life, there was one judging me, another that was too ugly. I would see the face of one friend turn a bit into a demon. I would see my body stretch into a super thin being with a friend being massive in front of my feet. I would see a friend dancing and a whole of tracers as he moved. Colors were amazing. I would go again into places that I cannot describe. I would associate temperature with some friends, one was warm and the other one was cold, I grabbed my warm friend with my hands and it felt so nice, if the other tried to touch me I would slur him about how cold he was. The tastes of stuff was so odd too.
