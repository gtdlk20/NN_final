Inanimate objects seemed to gain consciousness, while at the same time my perception of body weight and dimensions changed.  At first, it was almost overwhelming, but I took heed of Leary's philosophy which states that one should sit back and embrace the ego loss to experience true light.  This I did, right as we left the house to ride downtown via bus to explore modern society from an altered perspective.  Luckily, before we left I familiarized myself with and essentially embraced the state of mind.
