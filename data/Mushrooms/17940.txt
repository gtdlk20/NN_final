Me and a friend are driving home from work trying to sneak between rush hour traffic after dropping our boss off.  We pull out of the driveway and are suddenly struck by a bus doing 40mph. We both walked away with no scratches, amazingly. I was worried that this near death experience may come up in my trip, but that turned out to be the least of my problems.
