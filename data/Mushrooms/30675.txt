 After the fractal-flower show had come to an end behind my eyelids, I decided to try my hand at the Troxler effect. My hypothesis in this case was that my current state would cause the Troxler Effect to be more intense as compared to my bored-at-work experiments. My chosen spatial point ended up being the very center of a beautiful red-blue-cream-gold oriental carpet from the early 1900s. This carpet had been given to me by my father,  which had been given to him by his father, which he obtained during the purchase of a late 1800s cabin near Paradox Lake, New York. As I focused, the lovely floral patterns began to shift and grow together, creating a more tight-knit, complex, impossibly detailed textile than it originally was. For those who are familiar with the various elements of oriental carpet design, the previously mentioned floral patterns residing within the spandrels, medallion, and main border began to float several inches above the field, which was a very deep red color.
