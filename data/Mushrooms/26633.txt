Her mom leaves the room, but not before telling us the DEA agents wouldnt be to the house for another two hours (They had to travel some distance).  I immediately started pacing the room, thinking of ways to rid ourselves of the evidence (or to be evidence).  Fortunately her mom stupidly trusted us enough to think we werent going to do anything to protect ourselves and that we would leave everything alone for the DEA gentlemen to look at, so all the equipment was still in the room.  As soon as her mom stepped out the door, we grabbed the half full mason jars and began to flush the remains of the vermiculite/brown rice flour substrate (food for the 'to be' mushrooms, for those who dont know) down the toilet, along with two full spore syringes.  We successfully rid ourselves of five jars of half year old substrate.  Fortunately, there were only five jars, so it didnt take long.
