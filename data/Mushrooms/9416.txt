The rest of the party reached the top of the mountain before I did and I stood with my hand on my chin contemplating life and the vast view. They decided to listen to music together through their headphone splitter. I decide to stay in my own head. I stare out into the trees as they form fractal patterns consisting of eyes and many shapes in yellow read and blue. I close my eyes and can still see these patterns. I open my eyes again and stare out until my vision is filled by a sphere of fractals with myself at the start and the furthest pattern way in the distance. I eat a cereal bar I had in my pocket and chew it for ages and ages before I have to ask myself to swallow it. It was difficult. I lay on a rock in the sun for what must have been 15 minuets, I felt the rock breathing beneath me and I felt as the world spun as I rode it like a surfboard. I close my eyes once again and cover them with my hands to prevent all light from getting in. I see machinery tuning and working with different bright colours of springs, gears and pistons. As their twenty-minute song ends we begin to leave back down the track with myself leading. At this point Im leaping and bounding down the rocky path knowing exactly where each foot will land and where to jump to next. I didnt tire throughout the steep walk up or down.
