I decided I needed to go to the bathroom so we walked down the beach till we found one. That was a weird experience. Then I decided I was hungry so we went on the quest for food. We ordered a snack plate and sat down to eat. Eating was one of the weirdest feelings I have ever experienced. My lips were super sensitive. It was hard to swallow because of the dry mouth. The coke was very good tasting and had an exotic feel to it to. We started to become self conscious because there were people everywhere and it was really bright and the shrooms were so strong we could not talk to normal people for more than a minute without them knowing something was up.
