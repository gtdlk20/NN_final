I was simply a part of a whole, no better or worse than the trees, plants, and animals around me.  It seemed pathetic to me how humans quantified their existences;  religion seemed to me to be obviously wrong in nearly all its suppositions about man and his place in the Universe.  Heaven?  It was a laughable idea.  The Bible, Koran, Torah and any other piece of religious doctrine that stated without qualms mans superiority and place at the head of all mortal existence seemed simply ludicrous to me.  It was a planet, and we were its inhabitants.  Man had created religious dogma and structured beliefs to rationalize his existence and somehow make man more important than he really was.  I felt sorry for people who worked their whole life, molding themselves in the perfect image of whatever religion they subscribe to while shunning their own wants and needs.  And why did they do this?  To walk streets of gold that dont exist in some fantasy city in the sky.  I knew at that time that the after-life, if it existed, was simply merging my life-force with the grand cosmic energy of the Earth and universe.
