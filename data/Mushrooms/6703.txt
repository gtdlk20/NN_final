I try to stumble up the hill and keep falling, I try to crawl and my arms start giving out resulting in me falling on my face, this really tarnished that 'I love myself' notion I had gained last night unfortunately.  Finally I crawled to a fire hydrant and pulled myself up, after a few tries I was able to walk-unsteadily and very unnaturally-back to my house.
