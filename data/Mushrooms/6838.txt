I thought some music might be nice so I put on some tracks off of The Flaming Lips' 'Soft Bulletin', followed by the entirety of their album 'Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots'. This turned out to be a most excellent decision. At first I was a little conscious about how loud the music was and turned down the subwoofer a bit, but once I convinced myself it wasn't too loud (even though it wasn't too loud to begin with) I fell into a kind of a trance, following the music on what seemed like a very deep level. Music never sounded so good before, and I've taken a lot of psychedelic music-enhancing drugs!
