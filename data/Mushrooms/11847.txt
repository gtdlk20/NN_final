Furthermore, this is the point from which I notice that the entire room, and later what I will discover as the entire house, has turned a very mellowed, emerald green color. Just about everything in the room has assumed this color, save for the television and stereo system, and the people, who are more of blueish hue. My one friend to my right however, we'll call him B, has turned or is turning hues of blue to purple, and appears to have little orbs, which I recognize as tiny planets almost orbiting around him. This strikes me as both strange, but also normal at the same time, and so my mind does not question it any further. I talk alittle to B as if I don't notice the orbiting globes at all, and don't make hims alert to it in any way.
