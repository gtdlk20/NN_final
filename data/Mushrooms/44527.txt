I got in the water, and it was beautiful.  Everything I saw was echoed like a Van Gogh painting on the inside of my eyelids when I closed them.  My body took a few minutes to loosen up, but when it did, the effect was amazing.  Swimming had become a fight with my body to get it to do what I wanted it to.  But this time, any mind/body separation dissolved.  My body was an extension of my psyche and did exactly what I wanted it to do, flawlessly.
