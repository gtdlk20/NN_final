Over the next three hours I walked around the festival grounds sipping from the cup.  It only took about twenty minutes of sipping for me to start feeling the effects. At first, just walking around, I started to feel kind of edgy. In the past when I have shroomed I normally just sit down in a dark room with some friends listening to music. The festival grounds at Bonnaroo were packed, with people still coming, so at first I was worried that I would tweak out with so much going on at once.
