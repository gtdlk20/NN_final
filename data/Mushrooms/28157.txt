T++3:37*: I open my eyes, I didn't realise how long I'd had them closed or when I closed them and was initially surprised because before deciding to try and induce ego loss when I'd closed my eyes I'd had remarkable, colourful, arbitrary visuals and hadn't noticed any whenever I did close my eyes. Obsessing over this (only for a few seconds) leads me on tangents and tangents of tangents as I always do when on psychedelics, I check the time and when I do this, I realise I'd forgotten the paragraph, though the memory of the process I went through is still vividly clear. I try writing down notes and end up with things like 'Live in the moment. Live in the future.' , 'Money is the shiniest toy in 'playground' of the world.' , 'Learn, Work, Play, Love.' some with small elaborations. [see notes!]
