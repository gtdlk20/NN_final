Then, as I was staring at myself, and my huge eyeballs, nobody other than my mom decided to come upstairs - I got so paranoid. She never comes upstairs, I thought, what the hell could she possibly want/know?! I didn't want her to see me with my eyes all bugged out, seeing as she knows a bit about my drug excursions, and she would not be happy. But I let her into the bathroom, and tried to bury my face in a hanging towel. I have no clue what we talked about, but it wasn't as bad as I thought, and I was pleased that I could at least talk to my parents.
