At first, we were just plain silly and giggly.  The tent we were in, although big, all of the sudden seemed like a humongous palace.  Other visual halucinations centered around distance perception.  Additionally, everything became much harder to accomplish, although in a very pleasant and hilarious way.  Part of it was due to clumsiness, another part to forgetfulness, and another part is unaccounted for.  (For example, my boyfriend announced to me that he had to pee, but was a good 45 minutes before we actually made it out of the tent to do so, however, wonderful 'problems' kept happening.)
