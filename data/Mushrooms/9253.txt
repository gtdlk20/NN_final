When I returned it was 12:10 and I could feel that I had ingested something that was a shock to the system, that notorious sensation when swallowing a potent substance such as mushrooms, MDMA and so forth. It sort of feels as if I'm about to go on stage to thousands of people, or I'm at the top of a rollercoaster free-fall drop. At around 12:30 I noticed that my head was becoming increasingly light on the very top, and the rest of my body was beginning to feel very heavy as it so often does with mushrooms. I asked my gf how she felt, and she stated that she felt a bit intoxicated, but no visuals yet.
