This trip, more than any other I have experienced, changed the way I will experience the rest of my life. I dont think I will stop thinking about some of the things it made my mind believe, and I think I am more aware and open to the possibilities of what this great contraption of reality really is now. Uncertainty is still paramount, but I can say that the magic and insight I experienced that day was limitless and eternal, and it went beyond satisfying my desires and curiosities about shrooms. My eagerness to plan the next trip has abated somewhat from my previous trips, now that I have reached this level. Im still excited for the next potential journey to that realm, but the things I took back with me this time are enough to keep me content even if that is not for a long while.
