They told me that this world is not real, its a simulation, to see what would happen if they linked with another universe, and this link is our brains, and to open this link is mushrooms. I will send this again, once i refine it, I need more time to shrugg it off, I want someone to email me to tell me that they have experienced it aswell. 'Robert.W' the one who wrote The Meeting with the Mushroom, said something similar. All I know that this is not reality. We are a device.
