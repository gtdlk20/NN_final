Meanwhile my boyfriend was across the living room, walking around and examining the weird tapestries and such on the walls.  He'd put on some enormous aviator glasses with yellow lenses, which I thought was hilarious.  None of us could stop laughing, and that's when the visuals really kicked in.  The walls were throbbing and pulsating with color; I waved my hands in front of my face and saw colored trails.  The ceiling was sparkling with light, even though I knew it was painted a matte white.  My cat ran through the room and I was certain he stopped and winked at me before running right back out.  Musical notes and little red and blue and purple polka dots were dancing around the stereo.  The phone rang and I answered it, not remembering that the ringer was off and I sat listening to the dial tone for a few minutes, fascinated.  I'd hallucinated the ringing phone, but apparently my boyfriend heard it too because later he asked me who had called.
