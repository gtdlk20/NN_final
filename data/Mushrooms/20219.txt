The trip itself proceeded with a very mild peak, visuals being almost negligible. Thought activity was also quite slow, perhaps due to the mild depression I had had all day. Thoughts ran along a single line and I could not concentrate on the music. My physical position during the trip was in the most awkward of postures, nevertheless I was successful in forgetting my body. The trip was extremely low in any kind of revelations or the sort, for I was not set for meditation. Only a few things of significance crossed my mind: if only I could get hold of some DMT - let it be the only and sufficient motive why I would study to be a chemist. Also, I confronted another minor problem of mine. This might sound schizophrenic, but it is actually nothing really serious. Sometimes I think I have two mes: one living life and socialising and enjoying, feeling, the real me, and sometimes I sort of flip to this other more undesirable state of mind: I am confused, unsociable, more afraid of everything, criticizing the actions and thoughts of the other self, watching my own physical actions and almost everything else very evil and unwanted. This other me seemed to occur when I was fundamentally depressed a few weeks ago with a lot of pressure due to the upcoming exams. This same state faced me during the trip at certain times
