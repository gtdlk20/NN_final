I feel her hand on my left wrist, and her other hand tickling my right tricep.  I open my eyes to ask her to stop tickling me as I was in 'skin sensitive' phase, to find her other hand was not touching me at all. We have a conversation about that experience, and I fail to be coherent enough to explain what I'm feeling.  This whole 'guts cycle' as I'll call it, probably lasted an hour or more. I found it more comfortable for me to lay with my back to her, and I figure this was emotionally driven, because we tried switching sides on the bed so I could lay on my side and still face her.
