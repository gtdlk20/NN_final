I have to admit, I was hoping to end the cluster entirely.  Perhaps that requires even bolder doses, or my body is just one of those outliers.  I might try a full gram at some point, but at 0.3g I can see the mystic lands in the distance, and not entirely sure I want to visit them again... in the past that usually happened around people I trusted, today I'm basically in this alone.  But, still, being able to end individual headaches, it's more than I had before! :-)
