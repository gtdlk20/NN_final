As I was treading there, I realized that the river and the blanket were the two fighting parts of my life -- the blanket was trying to hold me back to home, the water was like the cold, but wonderful, sting of a new start.  I yelled out, 'I'm torn between nostalgia and rebirth!' to anyone who was around to listen.  It was everything I had felt for the last year in a sentence.  That calmed me down a bit, but I couldn't leave the water yet.  I went near the opposite shore, looking at the little secret place I had found, shivering violently.  I had been in the water so long that I couldn't feel my feet or control the shivering.  My friends were getting concerned, and I felt like I had proved to myself that I was willing to put up with hardship to find new horizons.
