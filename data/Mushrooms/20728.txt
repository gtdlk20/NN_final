Laying down, I was telling myself to take care of myself because I didn't want to hurt myself.  Normally, people would say this brings a bad trip, but I felt like awareness and knowledge can help me challenge myself instead of get involved in subjective entertainment.  Boy, I realized that when you ask 'god' or whoever for something, you will get it and pay for it!  (As Gurdjieff has said, pay full and pay in advance-  how's that for non-linearity and trust?)
