It was about 7:30 when I first ingested them. The coming up was slow. I was filled with somewhat scary thoughts but I was very excited still. I sat there watching That 70's Show and a smoked a cigarette. I could start to feel a little weird. My stomach kinda hurt but I was also very giddy and easy going. once we decided that they were definitely kicking in we packed 2 bowls and we had a blunt already rolled. We decided to go to out favorite smoking spot which an old abandoned press box. It is by far the best smoking/chill spot I have ever found.
