I have no interest in taking another therapy session again anytime soon.  In fact, looking back it is sort of terrifying (in a non-terrifying sort of way). But I am thankful for the experience, thankful for my guide, thankful for the love and support of my wife, and thankful for all the preparation help I got reading things online and in books. Perhaps in 6 to 12 months I will undergo another therapy session. For now I wish others like me the very best in their quest for healing, and only advise them not to take this sort of therapy lightly and to do lots of homework.
