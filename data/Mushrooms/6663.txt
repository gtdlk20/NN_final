Back to the trip at hand. 20 Minutes into the trip it was when I started hearing the same scary auditory hallucinations. I couldn't really properly describe it nor could I imitate these sounds/voices. However I did distinctly remember a few phrases , but since they were in Dutch, I won't bother you with them. I also remember very clearly how I could hear a very alien sound much like something you would expect from some alien spacecraft with like beeps and clicks and stuff. I think this must have been the sound of my computer since it was on during the entire experience, but I also heared this background sound when I had my ego death experience.
