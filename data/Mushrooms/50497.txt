Going into the experience I really underestimated how powerful mushrooms are (I expected something akin to a powerful weed trip).  At about 3 in the afternoon on a saturday, I left my dorm room and my friends after eating about half the bag a half hour before, and I brought the rest with me.  I walked through the buildings and trees in my college heading towards a forest on the edge of campus.  On my way there, I walked through a small park, and began to notice mild visuals, like the common effects people see on mushrooms (i.e. The ground is breathing, trees are breathing, the ground is like a wavy pool).   I continued reaching into my pocket and eating whatever caps and stems my hands grabbed.
