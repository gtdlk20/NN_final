At one point I walked in to the bathroom and looked at the tiles.  They were 6x6 white tiles.  They turned in to white whirlpools, and I saw a frog doing a backstroke around the perimeter of each one.  I think it was Mr. Frog from the 'Frog and Toad' series.  This is no joke.  Other hallucinations were mostly limited to pot-like animation hallucinations, and peripheral vision movements that kept startling me.
