From there on everything seemed sorta like a dream. I was talking to this boy Josh and his eyes kept shaking andpoping out of his face and turning pure black and they were very clear as apposed to everything else that was blurry with spiders then he got 3 more noses one on each cheek and on his chin. Then somehow i got in to this room and saw a face on the ceiling and it looked very sad. i got out of the room and started walking around and i went into the computer room where i saw a face in the curtains that i though was my grandma i knew it wasn't but it really seemed like she was there and she looked like a hippy with flowers in her hair and stuff, it made me wanna cry because i missed her so much. I kept going in and out of the room to see her.
