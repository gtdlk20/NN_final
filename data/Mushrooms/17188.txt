The first effects I started to notice was this spider-like tree that was very close to the bridge.  The visuals definitely started first, as the tree and the bridge were both swaying in a breeze like motion, while I still had the sense to notice that everything was still.  My friends and I talked a little bit, waited a bit longer, and decided to go walking along a really nice path.  The visuals continued, as the trees swayed back in forth in unison, and at some points they turned into very geometrical, sharp objects.  I could tell that my mind was being influenced as we approached a soft mulch patch that was just put down that day on the path.  It was night time, and it looked to us that it was a huge lake!  We all stopped around this mulch lake, and I was the first to figure out that it was mulch.  I walked across, and all my friends gasped as I was talking on water!
