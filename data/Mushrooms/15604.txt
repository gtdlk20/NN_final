Every time I have tried shrooms they have made me cry and this occasion would be no different. Some of my personal demons quickly began to surface and I felt the need to acknowledge the lifetime of hurt they had occurred. This stage might have lasted about 20 minutes but itÂ’s difficult for me to say with any certainty. I really believe that Shrooms force me to get real with myself in a way that can be very confronting.
