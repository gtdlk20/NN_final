The time was 9:45pm and I was watch that 70s show on tv in bed. I wasnt really paying too much attention to what was going on. I was slightly stoned and waiting for the onset of the mushrooms to kick in. My first inkling that things werent quite right was when I started to notice how fake the acting was on the show. The laugh track was really noticeable, and the show seemed different. I started to get drawn into the show and felt like I was in the scene with them. The big stopper though was when the dialogue in the show started to revolve around current themes in my life and then they would start to mention my name. Woah I staggered, this is really different to my other trips, the actors and actresses then started to talk to me. Holy shit! I must be tripping hard I thought to myself. I reached over the bed and quickly turned the tv off. A sense of relief came over me as the horror of the tv trip was no more. That feeling was quickly replaced by physical pains as I realized I was now in complete darkness with the body load coming on really harsh. The darkness was replaced by vivid spiraling patterns in full colour, similar to DMT visuals.
