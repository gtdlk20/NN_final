By the time I got back to my friend, I couldn't feel anything at all.  The tunnel had shrunk so much I could barely see my friend (about 10% of my total visual scope).  I remembered trying to communicate with him the idea that I need to leave, but I couldn't feel anything, let alone my mouth, so I just turned around to leave.  And that's when it happened.  I turned around, and was suddenly without form, floating in this cloudy realm of intense blue light.  There was 'Aurora Borealis' type light all around me, all pointing towards me.  I could not control where I moved, but I could control where I looked.  I spent a good 15-20 seconds looking all around.  I had a feeling of terrible foreboding, like I was not meant to be there, like I was trespassing.  I felt an intense fear I have never felt before.  I KNEW I was not on Earth.  I was somewhere else.  I was not even in the Universe.  I don't know where I was, but it had no geographical location.  It was simply 'elsewhere', somewhere outside my little human realm.
