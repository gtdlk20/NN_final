We went to eat lunch at Sloppy JoeÂ’s, which is a wide-open, famous bar.  While we were waiting for our food, I slipped into the bathroom and ate about 2.5 grams of dried mushrooms.  I liked the taste, and I ate them right out of the bag.  My friends were not interested in trying mushrooms, and I did not tell them that I had eaten them.  They would not find out until it was all over with.  About 30 minutes later, I felt it kick in.  The immediate effect was that my head seemed to float about like a basketball in zero-gravity.  I would give it the slightest nudge, and it would float all the way from one shoulder to the next.  I had done plenty of research on mushrooms, and I was excited, because I knew that the best was yet to come.
