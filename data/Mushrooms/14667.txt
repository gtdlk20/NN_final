Most of the time was spent in the living room, each of us in an introspective silence of some kind or other. As for myself, everything around me rather quickly start to feel very warm, cosy and 'nice', and I closed my eyes and allowed the crisp warmth of Carbon Based Lifeforms' Interloper to narrate the beginning of whatever journey was about to happen. The build up seemed to last for many lifetimes, and it was consistently growing and growing and growing, and while I knew the peak had yet to hit, everything felt spectacular and wholesome and warm anyway.
