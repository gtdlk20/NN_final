For a while I felt nothing but was told it was normal by friend 2 (I was the only one of the 4 that had any). After about a half hour everything seemed to be getting darker, which was odd because it was only about 4:00PM. The four of us then moved to the front yard to sit while I waited to trip. Things began to obviously look off, the grass was a magnificent color of green and as I moved in for a closer look it began to grab onto my shoes. I then looked up and noticed a sign with the name of the coffee shop on it and as I gazed upon it I began to feel a powerful force pulling me towards it. I said, Dude That sign is pulling me in. Friend 2 said, Dude! Hes being pulled into that sign! Then he laughed heartily. As I clung to the table I was sitting on to avoid being sucked into the sign I remember thinking it was good the grass was holding on to my shoes, to help me from being sucked to oblivion. I looked all around, the street we were on was a pretty busy one, with many people passing in cars and on foot, I started to feel like nothing existed beyond that street at all, that we were all that was left of the universe.
