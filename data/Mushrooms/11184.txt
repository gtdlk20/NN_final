After an hour, I hadn't felt anything. I got tired of waiting and decided to jump start my trip. I turned off the t.v. and starred at the blackness that was my room. I began focusing on my breathing and realized it was strange. Then I felt a little nausea and my body was warm all over. I began listening to my floor fan and it started to make the strangest sounds. I kept listening and then it all changed. It was like my hearing came into focus and I was hearing stuff coming from behind me. I soon saw strange shapes and lines and things exploding but they were all in time with what I was hearing.
