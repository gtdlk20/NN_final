We split just shy of an ounce of mushrooms between five people. It was a combination of 7 grams of wildharvested liberty caps (Psilocybe semilacenta) and 20 grams of cultured Psilocybe cubensis. I found it humorous, when Alice incredulously asked You guys are going to do FIVE GRAMS of mushrooms???
