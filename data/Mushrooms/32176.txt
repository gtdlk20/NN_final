Once silence took over, we lay down in the grass and looked up to the sky again. Time passed for hours, but it was irrelevant. #2 and #3 began to hum together, creating beautiful melodies of a C drone. #1 and I joined in and built chords and harmonies over their notes. We were connected to each other, and the entire world through this music. I burst into tears because of the beauty of the moment. This humming continued at different moments throughout the entire day.
