I have tripped on mushrooms 4 or 5 times prior to this. None of those experiences have been very spiritual or mystical in any way other then interesting visuals and a strong body high. I have also taken salvia twice, and the first time I ever tripped on salvia I had an extremely moving and disturbing experience where I felt as though my reality was crashing down around me. I literally went from being in my friends apartment to being in a small suburban town where children were telling me that my life wasnt real.
