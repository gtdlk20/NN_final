I have no idea how I got to that conclusion except that it started to feel like I was becoming all powerful and all knowing and all important. I felt I knew everything. I could feel every piece of knowledge I had ever acquired immediately at my fingertips (and maybe knowledge I hadnt acquired, thats how much it felt like). It seemed like I knew every property of every object around me and knew the mysteries of the universe, and that the mushrooms had unlocked this knowledge that I had somehow hidden from myself. Revelations were coming fast.
