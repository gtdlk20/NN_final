As I noticed this 'waiting for the worms' came on and now the entire room, all 4 walls and my bed plus other furniture was indeed breathing a constant breath. This was a little overwhelming at first but I was able to handle it. I smiled and giggled at the idea of my entire room breathing in and expelling me out in a breath of air. I left the room and went to the kitchen.
