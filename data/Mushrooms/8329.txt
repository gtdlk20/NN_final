The whole time I was remarking and yelling about my experience and itÂ’s all painfully embarrassing. I screamed to the others that I was god, and that I was google, and that I was going to fold the universe back into perfect nothingness again so that bliss would be eternal. That they were lucky I was a good god who loved them so much and wanted them to be so happy.
