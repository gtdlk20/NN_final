You can imagine my joy when I found a wallet washed up on the rocks.  This was perfect!  All these things about a person, in this case little Timothy H.  I went through his cards:  A junior high student ID, a gun club membership card, and some other stuff.  I yelled to Syph about the wallet.  He called out, 'Is there any money in it?'  It hadn't even occurred to me to look.  The true treasure was the mind trip of finding out stuff about a total stranger's life.
