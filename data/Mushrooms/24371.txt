Eventually after a while, I started feeling my teeth with my tongue, which felt weird, like my teeth were mountains.  Then I found out that I could use my hands and arms, which turned out to be amusing, especially since I could detatch my left hand, and stretch my right arm abnormally.  Then I started to pull on my sweater, I found out that my sweater was liquid, maybe that was why it was making me sweat so much.  Then, amazingly I found out that I had a voice.  I hummed for a minute then exclaimed 'Hey!  I just found out that I can talk!!'  Everyone just looked at me, and I felt sort of embarrassed.  So I got up to test out my legs for a minute.  After I sat back down was the start of a downward spiral.
