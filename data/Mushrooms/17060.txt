After a little while, my friends came back and I was starting to really leave the planet.  I moved while I was still mildly coherent into another room and turned on some music.  For probably an hour and a half, I sat by myself in a room absolutely dissolved in the enormity of the experience.  The open eye hallucinations were a lot of a powerful 'pulsing' sight, and bright patterns on the walls that I could only describe as 'Mayan' in appearance.  When my eyes were closed I was rapt in a world of swirling globes and I felt as if I was diving under the earth, but that the profoundly odd image of music itself was guiding me on the way.  The most distinct memory I have of this stage was noticing that my mouth was wide open the entire time, and I felt a deep sense of awe.  It felt like all the stars and nebulae had lowered to around ten feet above my head and I was permitted to view them close up.  Very cool.
