I hope you all can get something from this. I wanted to make sure there was information out there about small doses of psychedelics and still having life changing experiences. Next time I take mushrooms Im going to take 0.5g because I honestly believe I can get the same experience from an even lower dose. But it is worth noting I have a very hallucinogenic mind. With meditation Im often able to dissociate, go to new universal places and even have have synesthesia like psychedelic experiences.
