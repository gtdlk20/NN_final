After that I went out into the living room and sparked a bowl of weed. I've learned the hard way a couple times to not smoke pot while peaking on acid or mushrooms. It makes me feel retarded and paranoid for the rest of the trip. But it was nice on the comedown to amp the visuals back up a bit. I took advantage of that by laying back down in bed and listening to some tunes with my eyes closed. Which was once again amazing and beautiful. After that I picked up my hula hoop and had some music on the computer speakers and literally became one with my hula hoop. Complete state of flow. It was like it was a part of me it felt lighter than usual and so effortless. I had an EPIC time hula hooping. It was absolute freedom I simply didnt care about anything else I did it for about an hour and wish I had that feeling all the time while doing it! I barely dropped it or faltered once and it felt so good! I sat down on the bed once more and pulled out some pictures on my phone of my man and family and thought about how much I loved them and basically had a moment and cried from appreciation and sent them all texts saying I loved them and made plans to visit. After that decided to wind down and eat some more blueberries and listen to Alan Watts before bed.  Love Alan Watts that guy had it all figured out. Very inspiring and nice to listen to during an introspective comedown. Only complaint is my guts kinda felt heavy and like garbage for the last hour or two of my trip. But that's always happened to me when tripping.
