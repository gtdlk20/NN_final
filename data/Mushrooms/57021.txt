I gulped them down with some orange juice. I hadnt eaten all day (doh!)My dad rang and I spoke to him on the mobile while pacing around my garden in the warm summer afternoon. My legs began to feel as if they were curling towards my head.somone had turned up the colour to full on my vision and I was realy enjoying walking. I said goodbye and ventured to the mirror (always a bad idea kids) my puils were HUGE and I got this 'what have u done to yourself?!' giggly feeling within. I retired to my bedroom.
