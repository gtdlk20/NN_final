I take a moment and look around at everything in the shed. Every single thing in the room is shapeshifting, moving, bulging. My friend L looks at me and says, 'Does this look sweet?' and takes his hands and wiggles his fingers, his fingers looked like they were a hummingbirds wings flapping at an incredible rate of speed so I say, 'Fuck yea that looks crazy.' ThatÂ’s when my friend Dan does something with his hands and I notice his fingers look like they are a foot long each and he has about 10 fingers on each hand. Again at that same moment me and J look at each other cause we know we have just seen the exact same thing and start laughing again.
