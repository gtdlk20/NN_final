A couple of days ago I purchased 25g of Thai Mushrooms. The next day after saying the appropriate prayers to the mushroom spirits, my spirit guides and power animals, I cleaned them and ate most of them the night of the full moon (saturday). I left a small mushroom to be offered back to mother earth the next day.
