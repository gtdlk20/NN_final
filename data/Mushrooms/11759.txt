When I was watching him the outline of a face appeared in front of my eyes.  Only the outline in rainbow colors.  I decided that I didn't mind it and didn't say anything.  I kept feeling as if the world wanted to talk to me.  I saw a face smiling in the clouds and asked H if the clouds did indeed look like a face.  He told me 'no' and laughed.  H told me he was interested in doing shrooms too and to tell him about my experience when I could.  We finished playing frisbee around 8pm and I was still frying pretty well so I asked him to take a walk with me.  The thought of being indoors worried me and I was affraid that I'd freak out and be confined.  We walked across the feild quietly to the on-campus convenience store.  I enjoyed all the colors inside.  All the labels were so bright and made me feel great.  I grabbed a Lipton Ice tea because of the bright yellow label.  When we left the store I was feeling incredibly detached and I tried to explain this unsuccessfully to H.  He nodded and told me that he understood.
