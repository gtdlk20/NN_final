After dinner we walked through the forest, my visuals were all but gone and had been replaced by a feeling of enormous euphoria and excitement. I was also thinking on a level far clearer than ever before, my mind seemed to be free of the usual encumbrances of personal issues and I was able to appreciate the universe and our tiny part in it. Walking back down the river the beauty of the world over took me and I stood transfixed by an enormous tree, doing a monologue about the how infinitesimally small man actually is in the universe. Upon returning to camp I felt entirely normal except for being exceptionally happy, and philosophical. That night it took a long time to fall asleep because of the huge thoughts that seemed to be playing across my mind. The next morning found me with no ill effects, simply a better understanding of how tiny we are and how beautiful the world is.
