After the fire was over and I had the beer, we were at the pool and I kept wishing the guy (I never got his name or anything, at that point) would come by, confused by my strange desire.  Eventually, he did show up.  And later I found out why...I think I sensed he would provide us with the mushrooms that gave me the strangest and most amazing experience of my life!
