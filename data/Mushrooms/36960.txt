At this point, I decided to go down to our secluded beach where our tent was still standing.  During this stage, I entered the most mystical experience of my life.  I felt like a divine being on the brink of a mass collective consciousness change on planet earth.  I also felt complete gratitude & awe of my life and of all life and the fact that I was given this journey.  I felt I had a responsibility to others to love them and to share this message with them.  I felt my soul in an eternal context.
