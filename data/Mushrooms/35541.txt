I ate the dose of mushrooms, dried and chopped, on the teaspoon, straight in my mouth with some hot tea my friend had made for me.  We waited around his apartment for around 60-90 minutes.  Nothing happened.  I felt OK, not nauseous, weird or anything.  A little happy, probably because I had just eaten some drugs for the first time in almost a year, but nothing special.  I was not hallucinating at all.  We ventured outside.  The sky seemed normal.  Every other time I had tripped on shrooms, the sky took on an 'infinite' atmospehere, looking at it for too long made me feel like I was staring into infinity, and it was hard to look away.  It was usually awe-inspiring and tremendous.  This time it wasn't, it was the same normal sky.  We decided to go down to the local pub.  It was a Wednesday night, and usually we had many friends there, so I thought it would be a good place to go.
