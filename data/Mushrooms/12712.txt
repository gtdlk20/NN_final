Then about a third of the way through the movie, the mushrooms came on slowly. Reality started losing its grip. So many thoughts went through my mind that it would be impossible to record them all. Time slowed down to a crawl. The entire trip seemed to last days, when it only lasted until the end of the movie. Eventually I thought that the theatre was the inside of my head and everyone in it was part of my imagination, and I was seeing out into reality (the movie). The screen began to change. It stretched and morphed. Characters' faces flowed like liquid, a whole range of hallucinations came and went. Then something incredible happened. I obtained a higher level of consciousness. The world around me became unreal, unimportant. The five senses became unimportant. I was beyond them. I was conscious of everything without having to sense it. I closed my eyes and could still 'see' everything happening on the screen. It was as though the human body and it's 'senses' were nothing but a filter, allowing only so much through to the consciousness. I lost all fear of death on this plane of existence, because I knew there was so much more beyond it. I wanted to leave this place, because it was no longer real. I felt as if I were a white ball of blinding light, consciousness, pure and expanding with every minute. I experienced much more than the five senses, I could fell another person's emotions and desires. (sometime during this, the big battles scene with Sauron was replayedÂ…there was a FLOOD of thoughts from the people and orcs on the screen).
