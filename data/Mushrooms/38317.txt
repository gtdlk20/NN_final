I perceived that there was no separateness among things. Everything was of one essence, and every being was only one small part that made up the essence. Every person individually was only an interpretation of what the essence was or could be, each person with his or her own comprehension of the word life. Every thought and action I depicted slowly reformed and shaped the essence into something new. I realized that the essence and us were of one mind, and were coexistent with each other. This gave me the feeling that we were a part of something much more than ourselves.
