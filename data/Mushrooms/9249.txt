Me and my gf are 29 years of age, and I've been with her for a little over 2 years at this point, and during that time I've seen her drunk a sum total of 2 times. She had never tripped before on anything, and I myself had not tripped for around 3 years prior to this day. I have much experience with LSD, truffles, mushrooms, 2bd and 2ci, to name a few substances from my past, so I know what was in store tonight for us both, or at least, I thought I did.
