I hadnÂ’t touched magic mushrooms for about 3 and a half years. I have never purchased them, I have only ever pick wild ones. Briefly, I am 35 years old. I have been through a few pot-smoking phases in my life. I have used shrooms every now and then if and when I found them and that is the limit of my drug taking experience.
