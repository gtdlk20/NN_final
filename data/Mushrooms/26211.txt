By 10:35, my parents were asleep, and I took the mushrooms. I poured the entire contents of the bag into my mouth and chewed. I have found that chewing mushrooms before 10 minutes before swallowing made my trip much more intense and profound, with pronounced visuals. I also ate with them the vitamin c lozenges and drank a glass of orange juice. I experienced almost nonexistent nausea, which only lasted for a few minutes. I then put on some John Coltraine, turned on all my colored lights, and turned off my regular lights. After this favorite setting of mine was prepared, I lay down on my bed and waited for the mushrooms to take effect.
