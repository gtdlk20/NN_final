I had been heavy drug abuser in the past, but I was putting it all behind me.  I decided after my first mushroom trip I was done prescription pills and marijuana.  From that point forward, I decided in order to get high I'd use a very low dose of mushrooms, for several reasons.  The most important reason is to save my lungs and to end my psychological addiction to getting fucked up in any means possible.
