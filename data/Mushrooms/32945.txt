As we sat there, the intensity continued to rise, but the disorientation and slight nausea of the shrooms were giving me a bad vibe and uncomfortable disorientation that I trusted from previous experience would dissipate very soon. However, the discomfort continued to rise and I found myself turning in on an intense introspection, which is not the right direction to take to enjoy shrooms. At this point, I was in the midst of a not uncommon phase of the shroom trip that my friends and I have started to refer to as The Stacking. This is a stage that occurs, not every time but occasionally, usually earlier on in ones shroom trip, where the mind seems to become sticky or choppy, and every thought leaves an afterimage that stacks above the last, creating an uncomfortable clutter in the mind. This also feels like every time you try to internalize a thought it gets chopped or deleted before you can finish it. I had changed the music from Debussy a bit too soon; I chose upbeat music that would be better suited for the later blissful and euphoric stages of the trip, and listening to Bassnectar now was just a little too intense.
