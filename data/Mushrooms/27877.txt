You want to seek refuge in the comfort of others, but you must wear this night out alone. If you are lucky, a voice will visit you and sing you to sleep. This voice will sing strength back into your body. It will infuse you with sorrow and hope. It will tell you little jokes about yourself. It will share childhood memories with you.
