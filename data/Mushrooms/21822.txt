After talking for 15 minutes with Goober I felt a WAVE of vertigo overcome me, and I became almost sea sick. I told Goober and he just looked at me with this empty stare and began laughing! For some reason this pissed me off. Yet I just simply started laughing. The body sensations seemed to be tickling my brain. The world became a confusing mess. It was almost as if I were tanked, and standing on the edge of a building looking down. We just LAUGHED and LAUGHED, before I knew it we were laying on the ground running in circles (homer style). In five minutes Seattle and Datsun came running out of the house. But Datsun just bashed into the screen door *THWAP* the sound warped in my mind and played over and over. Then we all just started laughing. Laying on the ground laughing out asses off as Datsun sat there Dazed, rubbing his head. By this time the body sensations were becoming a little intense.
