Then some more bad news. I had to walk home. It took me another 3 hours to find my way back home, but I was coming down by then so it was a little easier to find my way. I got home, finally, and very releaved that the mushrooms weren't toxic (I was a bit paranoid as I said earlier). The comedown kept me awake for a while afterwards. I was all antsy and couldn't sleep, but the visuals were gone for the most part. I finally fell asleep around 6 in the morning, and slept the sleep of the dead.
