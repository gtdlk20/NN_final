The next morning I woke up and found the tinfoil covered package, and remembered what it was and hid it in my room.  Being cautious, I consulted one reputable website in particular because it was coming up a lot on my Google searches. (and have been using it ever since)  I read all about how Vitamin C in the stomach gave you a stronger yet shorter trip, I thought what the hell so I went and bought a 750ml Sunny D bottle, which I hadnt had since I was 10.  Also, that it takes about an hour to hit you, or in my case 1 hour, 10 minutes, exactly.  Also the same amount of time that it takes Dextromethorphan to hit me in.
