Shortly after 8:00 it began to kick in for me, but I was well prepared, expecting a quick onset from the liquid mushrooms. By this time everyone else's trip was also beginning, although three of us had left to grab something from a nearby car. When they came back the energy level shot up, and the physical sensations of the trip became apparent. I began to get nauseous, and an attempt to leave the room in search of Phil and Walt led to me vomiting up everything I had consumed. My error seemed to have been in making the tea too diluted, forcing me to drink two huge cups, and leaving a third unfinished.
