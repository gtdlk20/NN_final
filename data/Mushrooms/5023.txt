I had the sense of being a wild human, like indigenous people. I remembered back to thinking about people in our society and how they grow up and have to find jobs. Also, how we are restricted and put into some stereotyped personality, which governs how we live. I thought about us claiming to be free. I was thinking of all these stupid restrictions we have, people telling us what to do. We think we are free, but we are withheld in invisible ways, the way we eat, talk, laugh, carry ourselves, see nature as observers, not participants. We think we are free, yet for example, I was recently taken to court for writing positive messages in chalk on sidewalks around town. The worst thing about our oppression is we can barely sense how we are oppressed. We must find where the bars of our prison are, and begin to escape. These prisons are perceptual prisons, mental prisons, habitual prisons, social interaction prisons. There was never such a thing as social akwardness until we became so separated from each other and ourselves, that we forgot how to interact.
