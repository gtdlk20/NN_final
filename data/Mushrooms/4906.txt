For those whove never had a bad trip, believe me when I say, you dont ever want to. Ive been lost in the woods during a freezing thunderstorm (and again on a mountain during a hail storm), I went through physical and emotional abuse as a child, Ive spent months wanting to kill myself, but none of that comes close to what happened to me the night I ate a bunch of little mushrooms, in a good mood and sure things were going to work out fine. It can traumatise you and it has a high chance of turning you off psychedelics for good. Take care.
