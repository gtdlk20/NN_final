Within minutes I could already tell the intensity of the trip was going to be outrageous. I could already see archetypal Egyptian patterns and objects going around my friend, the color of the air was almost a goldish yellow like a midsummers day, I saw DNA strands twisting through the air. I looked at a crystal, its split into 5 patterns, I laughed as I realized how epic it was going to be.
