Oh this festival has been going on from the dawn of time and will continue to go on till its end. Its a celebration of hedonism, collective narcissism, believe what you will about higher values, these are things that matter most. A brotherhood in sin. But it's not sin, it's the very opposite, vice is virtue. Goddamned convoluted bullshit dogmatic catholic church goddamn politicians and cops and who knows what else Im Noah Paytas now am I? whoa not anymore.
