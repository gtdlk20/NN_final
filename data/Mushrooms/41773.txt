One of the single most important details occured very early in the game and came as quite a shock; Relief! The complete and sudden removal of the debilitating, chronic pain I suffer from every day (I am one of at least three of my close family members with fibromyalgia, on of two that has it badly enough to need pain medication). To a person who is not plagued by constant pain and fatigue, pain relief may seem insignificant but to us unlucky few it is a godsend, it not only allows for greater ease of movement but can lift the cloak of depression from a stressed and distracted mind.
