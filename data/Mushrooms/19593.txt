I decided it was time for a change in scenery and I headed out for a run.  My mental processes were fucked by this point, and if there were other factors motivating my run, they escape me.  I took a route out by a lighthouse, and that proved to be a valuable landmark.  I felt like I was running well and my body was feeling quite normal.  At this point my hallucinations were still based on the real visual stimuli surrounding me, such as waving grasses, trees, cars, etc.
