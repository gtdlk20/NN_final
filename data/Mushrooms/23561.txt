At the end of my local Renaissance Festival's season last autumn, I had my first opportunity to try mushrooms.  It was around 10pm, and the sky was a brooding gray with huge clouds that threatened rain.  I was not intending to have a psychedelic experience of any kind that night, but as fate would have it, one of my fellow Festies happened to have a bag full of blue shrooms which he felt obligated to hand out.  He asked me if I would like one, and after a moment's hesitation (I hardly ever trip or smoke) I withdrew a small dry mushroom from the bag.  The cap was a weathered blue, like old faded denim, with a bone-white stem.  It seemed so small and insignificant, that I thanked him and ate it without giving it too much thought.
