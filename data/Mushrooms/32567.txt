8:30- we began walking aimlessly. Whenever I would check my cellphone or I-pod, I would get lost in it, and all I could see was my device, and nothing around me, however out of the corner of my eyes I would see groups of people, people that were out to get me or something, but I knew there weren't real, so I stayed cool.
