Lsd was ridiculous. I've always likened acid to someone grabbing me by the balls and twisting them - if they get it right, it's quite a thrill, but if they get it wrong it can cause serious pain. I've had uncomfortable experiences with acid, but nothing I couldn't handle. The good parts of acid were phenomenal. Deeply spiritual, emotional times. I can recall one time when I was just staring at myself in a mirror, straight into my eyes, and I ended up crying because I just felt so unbelievably privileged to be alive and young. Experiences like that have changed my life for the better.
