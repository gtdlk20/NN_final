     That's when my mind took over. Without putting effort into thought, my mind explained that the reason my brain is stuck on the dealings of life is because I know nothing of anything else. I've lived my whole life trying to better adapt myself to life, the way every person does. Instead I should have spent that time bettering myself, period! The voice was like the voice of Goodness. Every time I questioned it, it replied with the perfect answer, the right answer. I don't know how long this event took place but it felt like hours. The mind explained to me that the path to Goodness is through the mind, not the brain. The brain is only capable of dealing with life functions. The mind is so powerful, that it can communicate with other minds in a realm that is undefinable by man.
