In the morning, we went into town and had a light snack for breakfast, and didnt eat anything else until after the trip.  At about noon we set up beside a stream in the woods behind the house and took our doses.  We hung out for a while, and after what seemed like 20-30 minutes, I could begin to feel the effects.  (I had expressed concern about whether the amount was enough; were the doses too old and no longer active?, etc.  My friendlets call him Dassured me not to worry)
