Halfway through the second cup, I noticed my vision tracing was being altered in a subtle but noticeable way.  Here, Radiohead's Everything in its Right Place came on.  This song has a lot of meaning for me and is an immense comfort to me while I trip.  At this point, I was positive I was being protected by some higher force and that this night would go well.  During this entire time, I had my notepad with me, recording observations.  After noticing the 'subtle' vision changes, it was a downhill spiral into Wonderland for the next I don't know how long.
