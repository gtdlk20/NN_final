The original plan was for me to take the mushrooms with my girlfriend, Muse. She was going to take a dose around 2 grams while I would take roughly 4 or 4.5. Muse has only tripped once on acid, and she did not handle that well. I was a little nervous about her trying mushrooms, and when the day came she said that she felt the same way. She was comfortable with the idea of sitting for me while I tripped, so I decided to take a full two eighths myself. I put the seven grams of dried mushrooms in a blender with OJ, and drank the concoction.
