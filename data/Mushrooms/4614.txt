My body was starting to feel extremely heavy and the disassociation also started to begin. I no longer felt like I was in my bedroom, my house or on earth for that matter. As I stared into the spiraling mechanical patterns it occurred to me that unlike the DMT trip this wasnÂ’t going to be a 15 min blast off, but maybe a 6 hour roller coaster. That thought started to scare the shit out of me, I quickly grabbed my phone and started searching for some music that would calm me down. The phone itself felt like a toy, and navigating the various screens felt completely alien. The only music I was able to find was house rave music, not quite what I needed but it would do to help get me through the physical pains that were kicking in.
