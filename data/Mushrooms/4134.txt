Thinking back, that was more like the middle of the session. I spent the rest of it in a beautiful fractal rainbow spiral world that had a sense of order to it as well as a sense of freedom. The words "cosmic consciousness" appeared visually, exactly the way I'd written them when I was writing down intentions for the session. The two friends I'd talked to on the phone showed up in that space. One was just being a frog. The other was dancing in almost the same way as I was, and I remember appreciating that. Some simple word-thoughts floated through my awareness: "Love," "Trust," "Healing," "Grateful," "Working together," "Dancing," "Growing," "We're all on the same team." It was obvious to me that "all" really meant all, that there was no being or pattern of any kind that was not involved in the same healing work as me.
