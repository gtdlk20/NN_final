I was looking into Tiff's eyes and realizing what children we had been for so long, fighting with each other and such.  I knew then that I loved her perfectly and beautifully.  She was looking at me with the same warmth.  Ian, not feeling very at home, was almost crying.  I had him sit next to me on the floor and I just held him.  I held him and soon Tiff crawled up under an arm.  I felt so much love and I never wanted it to end.  I felt as though I would have been happy sitting in that room forever just holding them.  They felt like the warmest family that I had ever had.  I didn't ever want to leave and I almost started crying because I knew it would.  I was holding Ian when I realized that I could easily kiss him romantically, that I was sexually attracted to him.  That was the start of my acknowledgment of my bisexuality.  It was so amazing.  I felt at home and complete for the first time in my life.  I was watching the walls melt all around me and it was so amazing.  At that point it was around three in the morning.
