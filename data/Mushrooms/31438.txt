My parents have an indoor rowing device and I have started working out fairly regularly recently (mostly for health and a bit for appearance). I thought I might as well just spend the evening doing things that I would normally do and continue my day as if I hadnÂ’t taken shrooms, and it seemed like a good idea to do some rowing. I got on the machine and the first stroke was quite intense - the way the world was moving around me gave me a very warp-speed kind of feeling. I laughed.
