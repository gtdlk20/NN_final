Under the shower again I wanted to sit down and sink in, feeling quite dark. But again there was this voice saying come on, dont be like that, keep going, stand up and dont let this take you down.

I finished the shower, dried off, and lay down in my bed thinking maybe I should just go to sleep so I would wake up fresh in the morning with all this behind me. Then I could let the rest of mushrooms go through their cycle in the garden and leave them be - perhaps this should be the last time I use them.
