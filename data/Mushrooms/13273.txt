Throughout my auditory hallucinations, the visuals slowly crept up on me.  They started out very mild, fleeting tracers coming from the green glow of the sticky starts.  The tracers were enough alone for me to step back, stop giggling, and analyze the situation I was in.  There was so much information being sent to my brain from my senses that I was literally overwhelmed!  Every color or object I saw, every sound I heard, everything seemed to be echoing in my mind, I kept thinking over and over and over that I would never make it out of this wild state of perception but I would just giggle and dismiss it because I would have already forgotten what I was even worried about.  The best way to describe it is to say I was stuck in a loop of thought.  I could watch myself thinking over and over about my sense of perception and forgetting over and over about the same thing; it was so funny I couldnt help but giggle out loud.
