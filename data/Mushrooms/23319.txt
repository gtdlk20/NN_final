I let the cat back in and feel having done so, I have just come full circle back to when I had originally let her out, I feel like I am now running everything in reverse and returning to my original state of mind. As it turns out I was. I end up on the phone with the girlfriend I have been none too happy with. The more I talk to her, the more coherent my sentences become and the more of reality I begin to remember. There are other people beyond this room, other people own cats I am able again to apply context to what I am saying, but it is still completely absent of the preconceptions and precedence. So I can say crystal clearly and in a matter I have never been able to pinpoint what it is that she does that bothers me.  By the time Im done talking to her she feels immensely happier and actually begins to grasp what kind of reality I live in normally. It was an incredible feeling to be coming down. Everything is new, all the sounds coming out of my mouth, (now that I can remember having said them and know that I am a person.) are so fresh I want to speak in every tone I can.
