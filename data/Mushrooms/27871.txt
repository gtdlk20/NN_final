Leave your body with an exhale. Travel through time, merge with the ether, contact beings and gods and long-lost friends, return to your true home. This is your home. This is where you came from, this is where you will return. Have tea with god, make lightning bolts with your mind, sing creation into existence. It is all possible, it is all real, it is all wonderful. You are pure light, pure energy, pure bliss...
