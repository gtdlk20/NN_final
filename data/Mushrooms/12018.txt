I remembered that I had fixed myself a goal for this trip. In the past few weeks, I had been asking myself if I was more important than anybody. Even though I strongly beleive that everybody is equal, sometimes, when I find myself confronted to some people who don't seem to have anything good to them, I tend to put myself in front. It doesn't show in the way I act, but it shows in the way I think. I was wondering if it was normal, and if I needed to fix it.
