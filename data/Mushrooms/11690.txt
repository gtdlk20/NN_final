We headed off down the street. Walking down a busy street on hallucingens can be a bad idea. Especially when a storm is blowing in. The wind was howling and pushing us from side to side, and clouds were zooming past us. This part I know I wasnt hallucinating because my girlfriend saw the same thing and told us we should head home for fear of getting caught in a rainstorm on strong mushrooms. Not the best idea, Im sure, so we headed back home. Walking was hard. Every part of my body felt like it was being pulled in different directions, and my vision wasnt exactly trustworthy. Luckily we made it back home and sat down on the porch for a while because, well, I guess it seemed like the right thing to do.
