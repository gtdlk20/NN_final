There were nine people in our group and only five of us were gooming. Then we walked down to taco bell while it was still light out. Around 5:30 I started to feel it kick in. I started to see the sidewalk craks flow together and it looked like one huge square in the sidewalk. The walk felt like it took forever but I didn't care I was enjoying this so far, I liked the first hour of my trip.
