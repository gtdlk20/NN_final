It has been quite some time since I have written so I may ramble a bit.  My boyfriend R and I took a trip to Lake Powell for fall break.  We headed down to try out the new kayak and the sail that he had spent several weeks planning and building.  We brought along some lovely blue mushrooms for the journey but didnÂ’t seem to fit them in until the very last day of our trip.  I had so desperately been wanting to trip with him because I hold a strong belief that one never really knows another until having the opportunity to explore their ego.
