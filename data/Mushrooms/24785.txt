I felt that perhaps, by taking such a dose (or doses, if repeat trips were necessary), I might be able to obtain some knowledge which I had not during my high school trips.  Perhaps I could move beyond what seemed like so many questions (why isnt the world a kinder place?; why do people fight all the time?; why dont people cooperate?), and instead come up with some answers that could help make the world a better place.
