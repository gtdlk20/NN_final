I started at about 10:15pm by taking about 2.5grams of shrooms. I then relaxed in bed for about 20 minutes at which point I smoked 1 bowl of cannabis. I then returned to bed and watched my lava lamp and listened to the radio. The trip started very gradually around 10:45 and didn't peak until about 12:00 at which point the lights in my room and the radio became too intense to be able to handle, so I proceeded to turn them off.
