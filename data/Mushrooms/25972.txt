Philosophers Stones are fresh Psilocybe Mexicana Truffles (apparently they are not-yet-fruited Mexicana magic mushrooms). Very similar to magic mushrooms, the main psychoactive compounds are psilocybin and psilocin, although there are thought to be other alkaloids present which influence a trip, as with many other magic mushrooms. The big advantage of the Stones is that they are legal in the UK (I dont know where else), and unlike magic mushrooms they resemble a nutty tasting breakfast cereal, although after drying they become very hard, and class A/schedule I!
