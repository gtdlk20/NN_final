1:30: Still lying on my bed I managed to stop looking around and start thinking of myself. I felt a strong sense of Deja vu, like I'd been in this mental place before. I felt like my brain had been hit with a hammer and shattered like glass and now it was up to me to reassemble the pieces. I figured if this was the case then how I reassembled the pieces could change how I was after the psilocybin had worn off. I said to myself well I'm going to reassemble myself into a wonderful and improved new person, the mushrooms have given me a chance to change myself how I want. So I made some decisions. I was going to stop letting methylphenidate consume me. I was going to respect my body and mind as it is my temple. I'm going to be more loving and caring. I'm going to be beautiful. At the same time there was a definite negativity to this procedure as I was seeking out all my faults and fixating on them and how to change them. I don't know why but whenever on magic mushrooms I always think about what's wrong with me and not what's right. Other drugs allow me to think about what's right with me like ecstasy for example.
