My dog was sleeping on the kitchen floor. She looked quite content, and I gave her a good rub. Her fur felt good, and I knew she enjoyed the rub. When I returned to my girlfriend's room, she was playing the video game Bugdom. It was fun to watch, but the music was orchestrated to fade out slowly, then start again at full force, over and over every minute. I found this pattern very amusing.
