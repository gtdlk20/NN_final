Onset~ After sitting in the food court eating my burger, me, Lisa, Casey, and Chriss went out the exit next to express to have a cigarette and wait. Lisa and I were the only two who ate the burgers and Casey and Chriss were there to babysit us just incase anything happened. Outside we met a really tale guy with green hair who worked at Spencers (he shows up again later). While me and Lisa sat on the ground waiting, I noticed that I was getting the chills every now and then. Nothing too intense but mild chill feelings. Casey was trying to test to see if it had started by lighting a lighter semi-close to my face...if I twitched, then it had begun, but if I didn't think twice about it, then I was fine. But about the third time Casey did this, I jerked back a little and giggled...it had started....so after smoking another cigarette we went inside to hang out and play. This is where my day all begins.
