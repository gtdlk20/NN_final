The rest of the night, I didn't see any visuals, but I felt very good emotionally, and enlightened. A little later, I listened to some weird laser-sounding music and I closed my eyes and right before me was Obi Wan fighting Vader in a lightsaber duel. That was interesting. A little later, I got mild heartburn and some stomach cramps so I smoked some mary jane and I felt better.
