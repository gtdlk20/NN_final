The most valuable insight revealed to me is that I needed to connect with my fellow man on a deeper level. This too may seem obvious to most people, but it has never been easy for me. The mushroom experience blasted my ego, removed all pretense and façade, and let me experience, in a very troubling way, my fear-driven guardedness in personal relationships, and my lack of empathy. I could not escape, I had to face it. This is one of those hard lessons that would be called a bad trip on LSD, but the mushroom is gentler. This lesson is still a work in progress.
