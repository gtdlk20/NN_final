NOTE: Ive been reading over various trips online and I have seen a few fools who have been tripping and driving at the same time.  First of all, people who do this aren't doing a very good job at being safe, second, people who drive tripping don't give us safe/wise trippers a chance in the general stereotyping eye of the general public.
