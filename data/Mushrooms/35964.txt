When the song on the Coldplay CD 'Yellow' came on, I kind of asked her wordlessly if I could leave the trance for a moment to hear the song (it's one of my all time favorite songs).  I felt like she laughed and said okay.  I think I opened my eyes, but then I kept them closed and just enjoyed the song and the feeling it gave me, like I was doing before I met my spirit guide.  The beauty and wonder of the experience and the song hit me really hard all at once, and I began to cry tears of divine joy.  I heard J say my name and ask if I was okay.  I kind of just nodded and grinned while the tears were flowing, so he would know they were happy tears.  I noticed how strange and incredible the tears felt rolling down my cheeks.  I continued to cry and just enjoy the feeling of letting my emotions go.  It was amazing.
