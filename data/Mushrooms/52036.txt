We went upstairs and hung out in one of our rooms.  I was completely lost in my thoughts, and one pattern that recurred throughout the entire night began at this point.  This pattern was my propensity for deep self-reflection.  I spent a lot of time in front of the mirror, thinking about how I go through life playing a character and how other people saw me.  When we sat in the basement chain-smoking cigarettes later in the evening, that kind of thing dominated our conversations, which tended to be very profound and on much heavier subject matter than what we usually talked about with each other.
