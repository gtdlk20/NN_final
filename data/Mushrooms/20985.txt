I was hoping, desperately, courageously, that Psilocybe mushrooms would take me from the lonely space that I'd been in for 20 years to the place of total connection. If they did, I was confident that that would help resolve my trauma, or even make it sort of irrelevant. On another note, a whitewater kayaking instructor had once told me, "If you get stuck in a whirlpool, take off your life jacket, and swim down. You'll pop up somewhere. That's what the water does." I took that idea into my session. I didn't know exactly where I was going, but I'd had enough of feeling stuck.
