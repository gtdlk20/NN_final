Needless to say, this was probably one of my most interesting trips, although I must admit it will be my last, at least for a few years.  I noticed the familiar rush of heat to my body and face as they were beginning to take effect after half an hour or so.  I knew I began to see the visuals when I looked up at my ceiling.  The popcorn ceiling does not lie.  I see shadows, relflections, vibrant colors, and 2-D images hovering over everything.  The trip was quite pleasant so far.  I should also mention that I did smoke a couple bowls of chronic prior to ingesting the mushrooms.
