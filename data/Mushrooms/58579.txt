I shield my eyes from the light to create darkness and enjoy the rapid moving neon object, pictures, etc, that I am seeing. I slowly release my arm that is covering my eyes, while keeping my eye lids shut, and a picture of the devil capsizes my mind, and I start speaking words I am not controlling, I quickly think of God and give myself the power to overcome this. Surprisingly this doesn't scare me, and I am still in a very happy, laughy mood (odd thing was I think it was still 6.6.06 at this time).
