I have tried many drugs, such as; salvia, 2c-b, marijuana (although I cant smoke anymore), DMT, 5-Meo-DMT and 2c-t-7. But this trip was by far the most spiritual. While I was in my dream state, I decided to start seriously meditating, I decided to get more active and get physically fit. Above all I learned to respect drugs! This trip report is but a fraction of what happened.
