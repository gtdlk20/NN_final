It was a Friday afternoon, around 1:45 pm. Jeff, Kevin, Beck, Scott, and myself left my house on foot headed for the hills behind my house.  With us we had two backpacks, a pillow, a big white sheet, a very fluffy and warm blue blanket, four water bottles, one big jug of Sunny D, some pencils, a radio, and of course the most important part of our 'trip' the mushrooms.  Five bags, each containing an eighth (except for Scott who had about ½ - ¾ an eighth due to it being his first time) of what we were told to be very strong cubensis psilocybin mushrooms.  Kevin, Jeff, and Beck had all tripped on half an eighth earlier that week, but it had been a few months since my last mushroom trip. So it was my second time, Scott's first, and Jeff beck and Kevin's third.
