We then, stayed up and watched the Sun Rise, It was beautiful. This was the conclusion to my trip. The most beautiful, mystic, and Inspiring Mushroom trip I or anyone could ask for. Mushrooms are the pathway to the unknown. Wether it be a beautiful emerald green sea, or a devestating black pit of horror. Each trip created by mushrooms is one to remember, Something I could never take for granted such, tiny organisms that can defend themselves to a state to put the creature who is harming them in total chaos and insanity.
