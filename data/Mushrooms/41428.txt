We started watching the Animatrix, which started out great, but turned violent really fast and did not help me at all. We put on Inside Out instead, and though it helped make the visual environment of the room colorful, it was just too weird for me to watch. Every character seemed to have multiple sets of eyes, and were all deformed. About ten minutes into the movie, we stopped, my sister assured me that she was okay; she was barely tripping at all, and she made it clear that she was fine taking care of me. So I let go. I closed my eyes and let the trip, for good or bad, wash over me. I was immersed in a red tinted world of 3D fractals constantly moving, and vague entities interacting with me. It was really negative. I would occasionally open my eyes and check the time, and each time my stopwatch on my phone had advanced very little. Each time, though, I was really glad I had set the stopwatch at the beginning, because it reassured me that at the very least, time was moving in the forward direction and I knew it would be over in 6 hours.
