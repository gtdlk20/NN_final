We all felt invisible, myself and my girlfriend were never closer as our bones rolled into each other when we embraced, similar to experiences on acid where parts of my body would melt, which felt beautiful.  One friend thought he was dead - I told him he was but that we would be back soon.  He didn't like that much. Up the hills to the forest, and the peak began to fade leaving that MDMA-like feeling of love and connectedness.
