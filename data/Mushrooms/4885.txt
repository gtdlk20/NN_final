I told myself to hold tight. In a little while, this would pass and Id remember what was happening. But my head was a confused mess. I tried, but I really couldnt remember a damn thing about the nature of reality. And after that, my language went too, devolving into glossolalia soup, and it left me sitting on the carpet bringing up random images that I tried to craft meaning out of. A blackboard and chalk. A dog barking. Little fragments of my old life that made no sense out of context. I stood up. I pissed my pants. I only realised this was what had happened hours later, after Id gone to sleep.
