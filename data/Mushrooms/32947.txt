It was Camille who, feeling similar discomfort, made me realize this important assumption about the shroom tripping process. She noticed my tension while I actually started to pull into a fetal position on the ground, and discouraged me from pulling so into myself and not focusing on what was around me. She finally solved our feelings of discomfort by the end of the hour when she made me try changing positions and looking at different things to observe instead of pulling in. When she made me turn in the opposite direction and face across the lake, we started to feel our tension lighten, and right when we had finally relaxed, something I did made us both chuckle, and this seemed to free our spirits and connect us with joy so that as one, we broke through to the other side of the dimensional barrier and it felt like we were finally there. This was the true beginning to the mushroom trip. Everything before had just been a challenging digestion.
