T +2:30 - I'm amazed by the gorgeousness of this street.  I live in such a dive, but I remember now why I picked this town.  There are actually trees here that have lived hundreds of years, which I guess will become a rarity.  From my window, I can see cherry blossoms, pear trees, houses painted (painted wood, not built with plastic) every shade of blue, pink, and tan.  Vintage porches and real, red brick. I'm also feeling a lot of body aches right now
