It's about 1:15 am and we are starting to trip. I decide to call my girlfriend, E and talk to her about it because she is very interested in magic mushrooms. I call her up and a guy picks up and tells me that he is E's man. I didn't believe it and thought it was her uncle or some other family member joking around. I say, 'Ha, this is probably her uncle, right?' He replies with a 'Fuck no, this isn't her uncle, I'm making your woman scream.' I had the phone on speaker and M and T were both listening very intently. I hung up on him. I told T and M that it was probably just a family member playing a trick on me. T told me that she was cheating on me for sure and that I should 'kill her.' T is not a violent person by the way, and the mushrooms were getting ahold of him.  My phone rang and it was the same guy. He asked me if I thought I was a wise guy. I heard E in the background grab the phone and explain to me that it was her cousin. Thank god for that. We all relaxed quite a bit and E took a walk so she could talk to me. I told her what we took and she wished she was there with us.
