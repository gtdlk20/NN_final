Throughout I had felt strongly attracted to nature: the blue-purplish sky, every luminescent blade of grass and every form of life hidden from view.  Lying in bed and getting ready to take my first step into the more familiar surroundings of the room I found 2 memories in the mental palm of my hand.  They lay there like glistening jewels: tell the story of how consciousness reaches back into itself and how any sentient being could never ever be alone.  And BUILD IT.  We have to make the leap off this planet.  The details are there to be discovered when consciousness reaches out, and beyond a certain point of exploration the beacons and fuel-stations have already been built.
