After an utterly indeterminable period of timed, I found myself lying on my bed, almost completely re-attached to my ego. I still don't know if I slept or not between my euphoria and this next period, and will never know. Although I was no longer in a state of pure bliss, the bliss had left a strong mark on me, and felt comfortably carressed by the embers of its dying afterglow. At this point I got up, glanced at the clock (my sense of time had fully come back, and it was about 2:45AM I think), and turned off my computer. I spent the next two or three minutes sitting in total silence and darkness, feeling as though my ego was infinetely stronger than it had been before. This two or three minute period, while on the surface somewhat inconsequential, bore a great deal of symbolic significance. Here I was, in the exact same conditions that just a few hours ago had served as a catalyst for my darkest fears and anxieties, feeling nothing but fulfillment. I don't think I've ever felt so comfortable and happy in total darkness as I did in those few minutes, and I'll never forget how strong and confident I felt.
