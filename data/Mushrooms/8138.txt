A and E finished their steak, and were getting ready to eat their shrooms. At that point I had a sudden realization: I wasn't at the level I wanted to be. I felt like if anything, I was starting to sober up. I looked at my watch: it had been around an hour since I dropped the shrooms. How could I be sobering up? That didn't make any sense. Maybe the shrooms I got were a weak batch? I don't know. All I knew was that I was looking forward to this trip for months now, and I didn't want it to be a disappointment. I announced that I wasn't feeling the shrooms that much, and that I might redose. My friends seemed unsure if redosing was a good idea, and suggested that maybe I should wait it out. My friends seemed unsure if redosing was a good idea, and suggested that maybe I should wait it out.  So I did. I waited about 15 minutes, and I did not feel like the shrooms were getting any stronger. By that point my mind was made up, it was time to redose!
