Her roommate L stood up and they started talking.  In the upper corner of the room beams of light raced around rapidly.  I just sat on her bed and watched this amusing display while laughing at myself.  My girlfriend finally decided to go with me to fet some food.  As we walked across the parking lot I kept my pace slow so I could look at all the pretty lights.  Once again I was at a dining hall tripping and enjoying the colors.  I could actually enjoy them now because I was feeling attached to myself again and the only effect left was a feeling of calm and pleasentness and I could still enjoy the amazing colors.
