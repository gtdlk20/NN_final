I welcomed my own death, reaching out to it with open arms, longing to taste it, to experience something completely new.  I was ready.  I remained in this deeply meditative state for about an hour and a half, jostled from my dream-like trance by the noise of the camp around us.  I heard voices of the other revelers outside the tent, whoops and laughs and raised voices.  It was time to go rejoin society, I thought.  I put my clothes on and someone opened the tent and we re-joined the gray and wasted world outside.  I took with me the knowledge that I had confronted death, stared it in the face, embraced and explored the threshold and then returned to the world of the living unscathed.  Any substance capable of allowing a person to leave themselves in this way is truly a gift from the divine.
