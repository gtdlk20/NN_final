It was beginning to get dark. I saw my employer pull up in his car to the front of the property, at the mailbox he was installing earlier. My eyes widened in fear. I figured someone reported that I was outside being loud and being weird. I was like oh crap! and stealthfully jammed back to the backyard. I was so dreading to leave the carnival and go into the dark underground room, to hide from the impending doom of my employer or the cops coming in and taking me away, and me losing my job and lifestyle I have worked for. I walked down the stone steps and closed the door in the pitch dark room, leaving the lamp off so it wouldnt shine through the ventilation openings. I kept thinking, I dont want to go back there as though I have been in psychotic confinement before. I felt as if I had always been in a reincarnation loop of having a good life of freedom, then going back to mushrooms and getting locked up because I was crazy. I set my phone on the floor so I could put a fan near my face to cool off.
