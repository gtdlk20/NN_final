I saw something like a shoe-print crossed with a dollar sign and made up of little metallic orbs and colorful liquid. However, my most memorable vision was of two, two-dimensinal, aztec-like heads made of a brown kind of stone. they were built into a seemingly endless wall. The two faces were conjoined, in the way that one's mouth formed the other one's brow. I can still see this image in my head, but I can't quite describe it, the way they were conjoined, it bent space in a way. The rest of the day was pretty typical after gym, besides the fact that I couldn't concentrate very well. It was a great learning experience, and I plan to repeat it within the week. Thanks for listening to me babble on.
