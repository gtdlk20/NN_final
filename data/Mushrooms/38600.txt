The first thing I saw was a girl with flowing golden hair and a bluish tint to her skin. She sat on Johns lap. I approached her and started to shake her hand.  Much oblige, Im Ethan my friends call me Ether but Im not flammable, hu uh ha, I rambled to her.  Yeah, I know, You told me that when you first got here, she answered.  Well Ill be damned. Pigs really can sniff out truffles. Would you like a toffee with your teal waffle? Jolly good show! Savor the flavor of those fungus wafers, I explained to her.  What do you mean you didnt notice her? You have been jabbering to her since you came here, chuckled John.  I was startled by the sound of sirens. I felt as if I was being watched by the ghosts of slain CIA agents.  Holy shit guys! There coming for us, run to the hills! They know we know that they know we know! I ranted.  I ran over to the door to Johns apartment and thrust my eye against the peephole.  AHH! I shouted. All I could see was another eyeball looking at mine.  I looked away and peered through the hole again. There was a man dressed in a black trenchcoat, and he wore a circular brimmed hat that shrouded his face. I watched in panic as he pulled out a wallet, and opened it exposing a badge of a seven pointed star.  Oh shit yall. The thought police have arrived, I slurred.  I looked again, but the man was gone.
