We walked outside and I told M how the voices were in the room and I needed to get out. Outside was very nice with the breeze and the stars. Though it had been over an hour since I had taken the shrooms, the visuals were not as strong as they had been the first time I had done them but I was feeling totally shroomed up and tracers were everywhere. We decided to go to my car and lay on the hood and windshield and just look at the stars. I don't know what it is about shrooming but every car looks like an aerodynamic speed demon. My banged up slow ass car now looked like it could outrun a Ferrari. We laid down on my hood and just stared at the stars.
