Alright so one day I decided to try mushrooms, wanting to trip. I wasn't expecting the trip to be anything like it was. I ate my shrooms around 9 am and I started to feel the minor effects at around 9:30. But at around 10 am it hit me...I was tripping hard. While I was in my room I saw faces and weird designs and I thought my rug lifted up off the ground. Everything is like a dream and I had no sense of anything...its like one happy cartoon. I had thoughts in my mind and I was thinking of the most bizarre things ever, but they were positive.
