2:00 - A very curious sensation that is difficult to describe.  Like I was a slot machine that hit the jackpot.  CEV of lights pulsing, spinning, rapidly flashing and shifting quickly through the spectrum in fractal like patterns.  Physical sensation matching the lights pulsing. I am laughing hysterically.  Sensation of knowing the answer to every question in existence, but nothing specific.  Just the sensation.  Around this time I experienced the very unnerving sensation of my body folding into 3 dimensional geometric shapes.  It wasnt physically unpleasant but my brain just was not having it. I experienced the very unnerving sensation of my body folding into 3 dimensional geometric shapes.  It wasnt physically unpleasant but my brain just was not having it.  I said aloud too much, too much which seemed to work as McKenna had suggested for dealing with intense trips.  As soon as my vocal chords made the sounds, the contortions stopped.  Another thing that happened during this time period was moments of complete loss of connection with time/reality.  I found this fascinating.  It happened maybe 3 or 4 times and only lasted maybe (Im guessing) 5-10 seconds each time.  It felt like an explosion of light that would freeze at peak intensity.  In that light there was only the sensation of knowing all or I guess you could say emotional closure and pure white light (or a complete lack of definition like an over-exposed picture).  There was no physical sensation, time or thought.
