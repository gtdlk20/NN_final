10:40 p.m. After leaving my bathroom, I went to the living room. I took a seat on the couch and could literally feel myself reaching a new plateau. I was hit by the psychedelic train. When I looked down at my shoe, I felt as though I was looking at it with kaleidoscope eyes. They were so many circles. They whole room was twisting and shouting. I wanted to see straight but that just wasnÂ’t happening. I stood up, and the room just stopped. Throughout my trip, I noticed that when I stood up and walked around, I was a lot more in control of my functions. But sitting down was like entering a different world.
