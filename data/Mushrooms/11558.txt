After that we talked about religion and how there has to be a god because life couldn't be this beautiful from some big bang thing. We talked for hours about random topics. We even got to a point where we thought that shrooms could make blind people see by using CEV or closed eye visuals. The entire time we were talking I was still seeing the car stretch out and little things in the car move and change. I remember going outside to take a piss and I pissed on a plant and the plant seemed to grow and bloom when I pissed on it. It felt like a burden was being pulled off my back and made my night. Earlier M left to take a piss and I remember feeling scared because I wasn't with anyone and I was going to die alone but he came back and I was fine.
