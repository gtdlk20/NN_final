I decided I would take the rest of the 1/8 (I didnt want to overdo it by taking too much at once for my first time) and make tea out of it. Next time I trip, I'm just going to use tea. Its not bad at all, and easier to get down than the raw, dried mushrooms. I broke up the remaining 1/16 ounce of mushrooms and put them in a metal tea ball, and put it in a cup with some honey and a bag of earl grey. Put in the nearly boiling water and let it sit for ten minutes and then sipped it slowly while watching 'the Wizard of Oz.'
