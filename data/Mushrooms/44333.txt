I had done mushrooms once in my life, I only ate about 2 grams. I'm a pretty hardcore druggie, so it didnt do much for me, besides make my sponge painted walls look pretty cool. Besides that colors just looked a little moor vibrant. So, when my boy friend ian got a hold of 7 ounces, I decided to take a lot more.  I ate a 5 gram cap at first, and after about 10 minutes I decided to eat 5 more grams of a combination of stems and caps.
