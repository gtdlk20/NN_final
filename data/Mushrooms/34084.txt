Everything I was seeing was so beautiful. 'Vegas must be the perfect city for shrooms' I though, admiring all the lights as I watched Hunter Thompson and his lawyer drive through the strip. I paused the movie and went into the kitchen, but I can't remember why, not now or when I got there. When I got in the kitchen was when I realized I was SERIOUSLY hallucinating. A dirty pan was out, that was filled with grease looked like it was bubbling and moving. The pattern on one of the plates began to move in beautiful ways. Everything was oozing. I was very excited and was hoping/expecting for the whole trip to go like this. I must of been in there for 20 minutes half because everything I looked at was beautiful and amazing, and half because I couldn't walk without wobbling. My eye-hand coordinations was almost non-existant. In addition to that I felt like I had no energy at all.
