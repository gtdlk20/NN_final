Eventually I come to myself, but slip almost immediately into another experience: 'Floating paint on water'.  I saw reality as being painted on a surface.  But that surface was like water...and then it was if someone stirred the water with a stick, causing reality to swirl together without actually mixing.  It was less intense, and I wasn't totally lost..I tried to explain it as it was happening, but I do not remember the words I used. My partner asked if it was 'melty' and I agreed, but only because I could not find a better word. 'Melty' was inaccurate.
