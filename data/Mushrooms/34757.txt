I would definitely do this again. It turns out that my friend's trip went bad because of a single thought that his parents knew what was up. When I came into the house to find chaos, it nearly sent me over the edge, I felt my whole understanding of everything melt away, and I HAD to go outside to piece it all back together. I felt vibes coming out of everyone and every room and light and the slightest change was felt intensely. It was the most weird, scary, fun, exciting, and confusing thing all at the same time that I have every experienced.
