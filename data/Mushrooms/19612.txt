We manage to reach the hotel, and we decide to stay calm at the desk. But while I get the key I start laughing violently. We run in our room and lock in. Inside its dark, with only a little yellow lamp. She throws away her cloths, deeply wet. I think it's a good idea and I do the same. I try to take off my shoes but it seems so hard to do it, I can't understand how strings go. Then I lay on bed. I didn't realise the blanket is so beautiful! There were flowers fluctuating on it. I like that so much that I decided to merge with them. Then I stand up on the bed. There are 3D tiles on the floor that give a sense of space beneath. Suddenly I feel like I'm at a party in California, lots of people having fun with drinks in their hands and music in the air. I'm having fun. All sounds are amplified like they have an echo. Maybe its for this reason that I felt like there's a lot of people. Probably it's just someone outside the door. I want to listen to music, to feel how it sounds like. I put on Radiohead, that seems appropriate for the experience, but I can't stand sounds that much. Too complicated. I prefer visions.
