The setting was as follows: three of my good friends came to me and asked if they could try some mushrooms sometime, knowing that I have done them many times before and could help guide them through. I told them the many faces of the drug and gave a long run down on how to prepare, what to bring, etc. After a few days of preparation, we set aside an entire day to eat them.
