The peak of the trip had evidently passed (23:00?). I still had some hallucinations, but mostly we just fooled around with various 'trip toys' that we had brought along. Interesting. I felt hungry, and decided to peel an orange. I felt sorry for it, and despite the beauty(!) of the flesh, felt bad about eating it...
