12:50. I began to think about my brother again (Due to Dane cook, again) I sat in the chair feeling sad. I began to cry and I called out saying I missed my brother over and over. My friends were very concerned for me and instantly turned off the TV and began to talk to me. They had no idea how hard I was tripping and that it was a disaster.
