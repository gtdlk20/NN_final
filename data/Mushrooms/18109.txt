Ego death was crazy. I mean, nuts. It was like our bodies our surrounded by a thick layer of warmth and happiness and we feel so safe in this, and in this, our dreams can become realities, and the real world is far from us (at least my layer). It's like my mind is in a retreat. I didn't know this until shrooms, because they took it all away.
