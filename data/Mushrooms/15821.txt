Then that is when I saw it, I looked down my room and it looked like a spiral tunnel to an alien dimension. The complexity of the visuals was such that I have trouble even explaining to myself what I saw. It looked completely not of this world. Then I could see, almost like 2 sets of auric fields were crossing over each other, perpendicular to each other. I realized I was seeing hyperspatially, looking outside of normal spacetime, at another dimension of reality, that was cross sectioned over our reality. I could look around it, and depending how I looked I was crossing back and forth over from our world into its world. At this moment I felt like I was not having a hallucination, but was picking up on and tuning into some other level or reality, I was actually looking at something. I was literally DMT tripping of 2.8gs. I could not believe it.
