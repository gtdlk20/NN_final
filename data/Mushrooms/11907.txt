I went up to see how R was doing (even though I was in no condition to accurately evaluate anything), he was staring at his computer clutching his stomach, obviously deeply regretting his soda.  In order to comfort him, we talked about the same things as W and I had talked about, I was as fascinated as ever and so I picked up W's guitar and set the bass on the highest setting and the treble on its lowest, and strummed the C string as we looked up images and information on black holes and time travel on his computer.  The sound of the single string was deeply comforting.
