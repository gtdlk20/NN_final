We were in a major inward trip until 2.45 pm. Every so often I could feel that someone cried, shook or tensed up and I kept reminding them to relax and exhale. We all are avid meditators and have body-related practices, so our bodies are super sensitive and we all reported a major increase in sensitivity, not only visuals. My body basically vibrated with the music and entered full synaesthesia at the rhythm of the musical waves. My body basically vibrated with the music and entered full synaesthesia at the rhythm of the musical waves. I could feel how the music was used by the mushroom to travel in my body and open it up. At some point, in one intense bit I could feel my buddies were getting a bit tight and I recognise the spot, as I was there in my first trip. I told them that was how love felt like and to receive it. One of my friends told me that hearing that helped her relax and welcome that level of sensation.
