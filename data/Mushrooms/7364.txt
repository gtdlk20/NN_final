Since our time at the cabin was to be relatively short- we had only obtained permission to use it for about 8 hours- we ate our beautiful fungi as soon as we arrived.  We ate our shrooms with a Chex party mix.  This might sound strange but it gets the job done.  We just would add a few mushrooms here or there to a handful of the stuff and scarf it down;  I recommend this method, or even better eating shrooms with Cheetos, to anyone who doesnt have the luxury of adulthood, an independent place of residence, or much time, money, or patience to go through any sort of time-consuming preparation.  We also ate powerful Vitamin C pills.  I have heard that chemically this doesnt increase your trip in any way, but in my experience it has done nothing but.  I usually eat freshly picked tangerines when I shroom and it seems to produce an immediate affect, especially after you peak.  Hey, even if it is just a placebo, it works for me.
