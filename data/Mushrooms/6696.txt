15 or 20 minutes go by, A and Z are playing chess on the floor while I sit on my bed EXTREMELY HIGH (despite the fact we haven't smoked anything yet, in retrospect this powerful 'coming up' period probably was an indication of the impending trip's intensity), out of the corner of my eyes I see some objects start to grow bigger and smaller; in another couple of minutes I can distinctly see my closet door bulging out in a circular shape.  At this point I proclaim I'm starting to get visuals, A and Z say they're not yet (though they later said in another few minutes the pieces were starting to slide around); I lay back and the room was starting to spin around, I heard A and Z talking about the color scheme of green I had in my room and that it was good to trip around.  The game finally over A suggests we go downstairs to watch a movie; at this point I get up and am feeling really dizzy, A looks at me and goes 'Dude, you look fucked up.', and then we all laughed about it (by this time we were probably pretty gone already, we just didn't know it).
