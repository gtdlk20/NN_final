After an hour, we left the park to go smoke a blunt, I was feeling pretty good.  The intense hallucinations were gone, replaced by milder hallucinations such as ground patterns and walls breathing when focused on.  The giddyness feeling was still there.  I was able to understand english again.  However, after we smoked the blunt my friend P started to really trip.  Marijuana intensifies ANY drug I take alot!!!  The marijana propelled him into a state of complete 'what the hell is going on'.  He crazily stumbled around the room and halls of his apartment bullding that we were staying at.  He must have said 'what the f*ck' at least 100 times.  At least me and G were their to help him calm down, which you should always do on shrooms. This is at about 3 hours into our shroom trip.  I was already mildly coming down, I could still see patterns on the ground, and people looked really weird
