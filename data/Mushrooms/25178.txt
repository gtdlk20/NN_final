Everything looked so amazing. The sound of the rain drove my thoughts as I stood in awe of everything. One thought echoed in my mind, 'everything is expanding in and of itself'. I'm not really sure what that means or how it applied to my trip, because everything just looked so in place and perfect. Intensly harmonious.
