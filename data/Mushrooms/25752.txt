The whole experiece seemed as though we had been put into the 'perfect place'. Alittle later we all found ourselves inside surrounding the dinner table, this is where my night got worse. I asked what time it was... I was quick to get an answer. '2 o'clock'... We sat there.. staring.. waiting.. talking of such things as 'Nothing is Not' and comparing our sanity to that of the common equation '1=1'.. after what seemed to be a couple hours I asked what time it was again, and was quick to get the reply.... '2 o'clock'... With this in mind.. Time stopped for what I calculated to be about 8+ hours that stayed '2 o'clock' and NO the clock was not broken. All in all I believe that if one doesn't mind losing oneself in mind and body, shrooms are excellent. If one has trouble with sanity as it is.. this is not one's drug.
