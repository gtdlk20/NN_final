We didnt sleep that night and just lay there, occasionally rolling up a bit of charis that I'd bought upon arriving. We came out of the tent around 1000 and decided it was time to drink beer, yesterday before we were peaking (2200) I had drunk some and decided that it wasnt going to agree with me, but now I felt ready for the TOMSO effect. I think that my friend having some to drink may have added to his stomach upset the night before. We went to get something to eat, all I could manage was a few small doughnuts, this stuff is very anorexic.
