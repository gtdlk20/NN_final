We discovered life, and the universe and how every day is a gift to us.  And how we need to stop worrying about what others think, and try and do more of what makes us truly happy.  Another plus of tripping, is we always learn more about each other, become closer, and take away memories and jokes forever.  I always tend to grow little closer with whoever I trip with.
