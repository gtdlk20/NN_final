Then my trip started to take shape. My head felt heavy and I just felt all around out of my mind,which was nothing new same as every other time I took shrooms.I started talking to myself and pacing back and forth.Then we decided we needed some fresh air.So we went outside and started smoking a bowl of cannabis.Then I looked up at a tree and seen double.I heard a noise from the ally.It sounded like an engine and it was.Of course my First thoughts were police but it was just a friend of mine we climbed in his car the walls were breathing in on me.After that We went inside were I repeated 'I'm going to die' and started pacing again.Then I started peaking I curled up in a ball and rocked for what seems like minutes but was actually hours.Every time I closed my eyes it felt like I was flying through my head and soon I could not open my eyes.And just like that it was done.All in all it was an ok trip the next day I shroomed again.It not being anywhere nere as intence as the night before,Dawm Tolorence.Write you guys next time I shroom.
