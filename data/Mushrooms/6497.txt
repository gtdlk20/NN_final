It instructed me not to fear it because this is what we are, this is where we are heading. It was as if they were us in the future, that was terrifying but the terror reached a point where it simply became love. It was the most mind-bending experience I have ever had, it is the intensity of this trip and the reverberations it created in my psyche that has prevented me from doing breakthrough doses of DMT. This was as close to that as I am ever going to get without actually smoking DMT. Most of the trip was incomprehensible to me in the days following it, only time has given me the perspective to actually come to terms with what actually went down.
