It didn't work for a while, I felt trapped, like I didn't go to my room with my own free will, every time I closed my eyes, I saw visual hallucinations, textures and shapes and patterns. They seemed to all morph into eachother forming whatever I thought them to form like faces or objects in real life, like a car. It was as though I was not in control of my outer self, but my inter self was more controlled than ever. So I kept my eyes closed. I wanted to be renewed, and in control again. I wanted to be reborn so to speak. And so I took some sleeping pills.. hoping that I would be able to sleep and wake up, sometime past this, so I could share what I learned. I wanted sleep at this point, and so I closed my eyes and watched the patterns move until I did, I didn't know how long my eyes were closed but I just wanted to be able to come back to planet earth, and as soon as I stopped caring, I feel asleep.
