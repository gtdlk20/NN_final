In about 30 minutes, I began to feel the effects.  Silence fell over me like a curtain.  Speech seemed a profanity, to disturb such precious thought.  I was moved by the beauty and comfort I experienced.  I loved everyone and everything.  Lying on my back on a pile of sleeping bags, I contemplated the tarped ceiling above me and, lo and behold, I began to make out the perfect profiles and flowing golden hair of angels, their visages tesselated for me and me alone.  I stared at the tarp, undulating slightly in the perfect breeze, and heard their sweet voices, whispering assurances to me, sounding like heaven.
