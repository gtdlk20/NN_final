All this time we had been listening to Orb. As the mushies started to have a tighter grip (iik!) on us, we decided to switch on some meditative music. Correct choice! I can't tell when the music started to control my thoughts, but as I neared the peak of the trip, my visions changed acccording to the music. Beautiful sceneries, each colored according to the particular song being heard, entered my mind, and I let go... The feeling that was to follow was the most beautiful, warm, safe, amazing euphoria, that could never be expressed in words. All I can say is that I was floating in a roundish space, colored light blue (but unlike any blue I had seen before), filled with beautiful, soothing things I thought were strawberries! I completely lost track of time -hell, I lost track of myself! I was snuggled warmly under my blanket, feeling perfectly safe and comfortable. The music seemed to cradle me in her arms, rocking me the way a mother rocks her child.
