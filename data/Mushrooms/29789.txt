Well, back to my first experience: It was a long day and I found myself exploring small ravines and clear frozen pools, I felt like I had been given a childÂ’s sense of wonder! In addition, my vision was sharpened so that I could see things, in fine detail, at long distances. There were cycles of ecstasy and withdrawal during the trip and just when I felt that the experience should be over I would be pulled to the earth again and fascinated by small things.
