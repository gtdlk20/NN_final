I was in Koh Phangan for the Half Moon Party on the 12th of March 2011. It was 5pm and we had been out on the beach the whole day. Feeling pumped and happy at what a good day it had been, my 5 friends and I decided to head to a famous bar for infamous mushroom shakes. We each had one full glass each (about the size of a regular Coke at McDonald's). I was feeling quite nervous because this was to be my first experiences with shrooms. After about 15 minutes, I felt my insides warming up. I was the first to go, as I tend to get 'hit' fast by everything from marijuana to rotten food. Most of my friends were there after 20 minutes or so. I went to the toilet and I noticed that it was starting to hit when I looked at an insect and I felt like I was talking to it and it was going to attack me. So I immediately rushed out of the toilet and joined my friends once again. I felt the sensation of drunkenness at first so I lay down and looked at the lights. The bar was built on a cliff overlooking the sea, so in the distance we could see the sea as well as lights coming from the bars on the beach. It was lit up around where we were seated as well, so I stared at the lights.
