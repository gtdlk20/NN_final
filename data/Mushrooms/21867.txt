That I ate with some orange. About 30 min later, I couldn't stop myself from laughing almost hysterically over anything I could think of. Aware that the trip had started I felt pleased and hopeful. I felt that I was being gently pulled towards a tunnel made of whatever the whole universe is made of. I tried going deeper into it but it just faded. I was using the will of my physical body to transport me there and not my ethereal will. Thats what I felt like and eventually heard it.
