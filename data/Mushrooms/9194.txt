T+2:00: I was tripping very hard; much harder than any experience Ive had before. Id achieved a certain euphoria, to the point where the nausea was barely noticeable although present. Id fallen silent for a long period of time although my friends were talking a lot. I couldnt follow their conversation if my life depended on it, so I listened to music instead.
