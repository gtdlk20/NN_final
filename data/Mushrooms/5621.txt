However, I still found myself utterly entertained by As and my stop-start, sporadic conversations. It was quite clear that he has had plenty of experience of sole tripping, and his obvious understanding for my state of mind was very comforting. I was still being assailed by frequent stabs of intense empathy and a sense of deep connection, especially for A but also for the players on TV, the rugby commentators, actors appearing in adverts, objects in my room and everyone/-thing else crossing my mind. I was also suffering from the occasional flicker of social anxiety whilst speaking to A, a few times, as I was about to write something inane and trivial, my 'salvia mind', as I have come to consider it, broke in and forced me to stop typing for no obvious reason. This led me to sometimes being entirely unable to type anything for a couple of minutes whilst waiting for the writers block to pass.
