T+8hrs 8 or so hours later, it's time for me to leave. my only ride back home, a friend named G, is taking off, and he's my only ride back home. The mental assualt is fairly over, and the though I'm not completly back, but as back as I need to be to confront and communicate with my parents when I return home. I get home, feeling especially good for some reason, like something brilliant has happened to me. I talk to my parents about the usual shit, tell them I'm going to bed, and that I love them and will see them in the morning. I have myself a big bowl of honey-nut cheerios, call a friend, and chill in bed watching TV, feeling good, before finally getting to sleep.
