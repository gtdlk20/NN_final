It felt amazing to laugh out loud, and to just express myself. I felt a constant impulse to be creative in living, and express myself whether through dancing, walking, beatboxing, or whatever. I just felt like grooving to the beat of life. I would beatbox and it would sort of set the mood, but it would also flow from the mood. Dan was singing and dancing and having a great time too.
