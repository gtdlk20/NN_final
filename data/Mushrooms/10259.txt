After 45 minutes the stoning effect kicked in and suddenly I started laughing uncontrollably. I went and sat on top of a hill overlooking trees and grassland. My friend who was stoned came up to me and gave me my ipod to listen to. Listening to a song I had never heard before tripped me out and made me extremely happy. I played the song probably 200 times before I got sick of it. When the visuals kicked in I was still sitting on the hill and the trees started to take shape of a lion. I simply looked at it and smiled and it roared.
