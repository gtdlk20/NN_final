T+ 00:45. We finally left McDonalds and we were pretty close to peaking at this point. My consciousness seemed to overlap into my senses. Everything I thought about I could pretty much sense, and see. I had a complete change in depth perception. Everything around us looked as though it was 50 feet tall, and I felt like I was shrinking by the minute. Sound took a whole new meaning. All of the noise from the cars and the wind seemed to flow much smoother. Everything we heard had a certain depth to it, like we were in a giant auditorium.
