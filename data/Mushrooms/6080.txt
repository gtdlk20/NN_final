What I thought was that people that never use LSD or shrooms can't understand what you see. They expext you to see aliens and pink bears coming out of the ceiling but for me it was different: everyday objects were so twisted and new to me like I've never seen them. I didn't realize I was hallucinating - I just saw things.
