We smoke half a bowl before deciding we're ripped enough and save the rest.  I start playing my guitar and discover I have this intense musical energy, I probably played for about a half hour (by now it's like 12, though I don't know how it became that) while my friends just sat around and had 2 sentence conversations, I was completely lost in my own world; soon they start talking about me and my playing, A says something like 'Whatever happens to you I know it's going to be good' which the shrooms turned into a god telling me I was a chosen leader - cool.  We finally get tired and veg, lying in bed listening to dark side of the moon and burning nag champa, this is how it ended; a beautiful night, yet the worst was yet to come.
