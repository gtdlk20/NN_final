The light didn't really help. I would make sense of my room momentarily but then it would disappear from sight and I would be back inside that awful machine. I can't describe how horrible it was adequately enough. I remember laying face down on my bed praying to a picture my brother drew of his Pacaso skull pleading for it to stop. It gave me strength. I was so scared that it would never stop and in the morning my father would have to deal with a spastic vegetable right before he was supposed to leave on holiday. It was awful. Incredibly loud, colourful and uncomfortable. But in retrospect, totally worth it. At midnight it started to fade and I was so incredibly thankful. I felt a bit foolish but I was so much in awe of what just happened to me that I didn't mind.
