I was signed up for a school trip for the end of the year to the Galapagos islands, Quito, Equador, and Cusco, Peru. Prior to leaving the country I stocked up on a 40 sac of buds and an eighth of mush. Getting it through the airports was no problem by the way. When I got to Quito, one of the days we were going to climb the volcanoe Quotalpaxi or something, I took the eighth at about nine in the morning with some cheeto puffs. I gulped down two glasses of orange juice with it too.
