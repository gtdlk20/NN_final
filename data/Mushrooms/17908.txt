The setting was good; friends and good music and trees and clouds on a sticky summer night, but the only problem was that to avoid having to deal with my friend's little brother and parents, we had to eat them really late at night, and, from my previous experience, I know that it is almost impossible to sleep very well while still tripping (well, at least for me). Earlier that night I had smoked one bowl of some very good pot, and was still feeling it for a long time after. A few hours later, still feeling relaxed albeit excited, we all ate the shrooms in my friends room, and sat around and talked (besides one other person, it was everyone's first time shrooming).
