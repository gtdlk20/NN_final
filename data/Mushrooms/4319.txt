Then I went downstairs to see what was what. I stood surveying my altered kitchen for a bit, until the thought of kids coming down to see me standing there like someone on drugs made me move out to the deck. Opening the door I stepped into a new world. Everything was fresh and dewy. The trees welcomed me. The stars sparkled overhead. The deck was wet and I nevertheless walked across it, soaking my socks, to where the full moon was rising between the trees - oh sister moon! We shined on each other for a while. I could feel my hair on my shoulders and it felt so sensual. I felt like Daughter, Mother, Lover to the world. And Creator - when I turned my gaze, darkness followed behind, but what I looked at was illuminated. It was so beautiful. The insects were humming and even the noises of cars in the distance were part of the symphony.
