At 11:45 M said he needed to take a piss we walked back up to R's room and saw his dad talking to him. For some reason this made me laugh but made M go in a completely different place. He became very paranoid and didn't even want to go inside. When R's dad left I knocked on the window and R just looked at me and closed the blinds and walked away. It seemed as if R was in a horrible place. I felt bad for him and I started getting in a bad place. M would have totally freaked out if he had to go inside to take a leak so I told him to piss in the bushes instead. We decided to just leave R alone because he told us all he wanted to do was sleep. We wanted to explore so we left his room and continued our journey.
