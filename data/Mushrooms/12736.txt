I'm a high school student who generally has a pretty positive outlook on life. I consider myself intelligent and philosophical. I am fairly healthy. I am not however very steady, in that often I am depressed, and often I am elated; perhaps a slight manic personality. Nonetheless, most people who meet me think of me as a generally cheerful person.
