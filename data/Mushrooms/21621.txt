Losing touch with reality is something I would have never even thought was possible. I was in an existence where I completely thought I was dreaming, even though I was fully awake. I kept having to go to the bathroom to urinate because of all the orange juice we were drinking and it was starting to become annoying. I would take a sip and I could feel the juice pass from my mouth, to my throat, to my stomach, and into my bladder giving me the have to pee sensation like clock work. I focused hard on the sensation and discovered to my amazement that I could move the unpleasant feeling in my full bladder around to different parts of my body. I moved it to my arms, to my back, and then I made it disappear entirely. I no longer had to pee. I thought that everything I was happening was too incredible and I thought if I wasnt dreaming, theres no way I would be able to get out of this trip with all the knowledge I have gained from it. As a reminder, I changed Dees name in my phone to I dont have to pee. I was starting to lose touch with reality more and more and more. I started to black out on and off and my memory from here on is incomplete and more a slide show of a few short scenes.
