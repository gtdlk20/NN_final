To start off I'd just like to introduce myself briefly so readers can get a somewhat view of my mindset and background. I'm a 21 year old college student with no prior experiences in psychedelics but I have experimented different states of mind (meditation) so I believe myself to have a more flexible mind than the average person. I would also consider myself being not more than 'normally neurotic' so trying a psychedelic felt like something that I could handle. Ok, let's begin.
