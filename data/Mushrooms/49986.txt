The most obvious thing was how difficult it was to smoke as depite it's ability to burn, it felt like nothing was being inhaled. It was like a 'really' tightly rolled joint (you know the ones that dont smoke too well) and despite how hard I pulled, it was almost impossible to get a decent amount to inhale.
