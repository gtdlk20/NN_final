I returned to my camp chair, fondly remembering that only a short time ago that this had been my entire existence. I talked to the few people at the campsite and told them how I unknowingly ate 6.5 grams of shrooms and had an unbelievable experience. They thought this was rather funny. G and L emerged from their tent, and I asked them what happened during their trip. They had tried to walk to the festival but never made it, and eventually returned to their tent. It wasn't just a figment of my imagination when I heard them talking earlier.
