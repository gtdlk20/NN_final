They barely resemble the thought process I went through and I truly can't make any ties between them, but that's probably because I didn't make much of an effort to put my mid-process musings/conclusions into words. Also, as soon as I opened my eyes I felt like I was forgetting them. I don't seem to have came to any amazing conclusions, but basically everything seems beneficial and entirely worth integrating. Nearly 300 legible words, written mid trip (probably JUST started coming down), I amaze myself. :P
