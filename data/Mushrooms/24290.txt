I quickly realised that the album was wrong for the mood, perhaps contributing to conjuring up this imagery, and I turned it off. Unlike Shpongle, the music felt cheap, disingenuous, non-organic, especially the jarring samples from 'Alice in Wonderland'. I even had to put it back on the CD shelf, to get it out of the way, beyond my sight. I came face-to-face encounter with a female entity. Part of this is wiped from memory, and only echo remains. I give her a look as if to say, 'I don't deserve this' which she reflected back at me and relented in agreement.
