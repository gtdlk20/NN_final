For days after this first experience (at least 2 weeks) I felt an unusual openness and vulnerability to others and a quiescence in my being that was long overdue. This awareness was with me at all times. It was healing and I have desired it for so long! Now the challenge was to integrate these lessons into everyday life before the euphoria diminished.
