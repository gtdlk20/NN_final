Then, I  ventured back into my bathroom, for who knows what, but I realized I had toxic, permanent substances all over my face and body - which didn't unnerve me very much at all, but I tried to get some of it out of my hair, to no prevail. While I was in there, I came up with a 2-word phrase that I just could not get out of my head, and I wanted to write it down so badly but had no marker or anything on me, so I began searching my bathroom for something to write with. What I found was a tube of thick lotion, which i squeezed out onto the sink counter, into an unrecognizable re-statement of my great mantra.
