When K and all of them were in my room, the room itself started to take on a patterned like feel. I could look up at the ceiling or the walls, and they have patterns of lines and shapes curving and transversing through them. Not moving a hell of a lot, but they were there and they were distracting. I can honestly say now that I dont want to trip with other people that arent on the same drug. They ask too many questions, which my mind cant handle when its being bombarded with so much other sensory info. Even after an 1/8th I could still keep up with the conversations and what was happening around me, I would just rather not. Its a matter of choice, not force.  Everyone except K and T left, and we decided to go outside.
