About 4am, another friend came over and we smoked out. Around 5am, I took a shower (which felt amazing). We finally fell asleep around 7.  I felt great the next day...a bit tired and RAVENOUS (I ate almost 3 plates at Ponderosda).  Even up to a week later, I was still caught up in the afterglow of my experience.
