We passed a building on our journey, an old water tower (or something) which has been graffitid by some strange people. One of the pictures is of sort-of Liberty Cap shaped shrooms, with spots, and LSD written around it. Someone needs to get their drug facts right before they start spraying stuff that makes them look stupid. Anyways, one side of this building was made up of large sandstone bricks which stuck out unevenly. On shrooms, this was extremely trippy. My friend pointed it out to me, and then I couldnt stop watching the bricks switch around, change size and move in and out of the wall. I dragged myself away knowing that there were trippier things further on.
