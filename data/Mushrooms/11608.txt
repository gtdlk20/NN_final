I still don't know...but that experience with my 'friend' felt like the beginning of something wonderful that I will discover more with time, and probably with the help of mushrooms.  I know that early American Indians used psychedelics like peyote and mushrooms to find their spirituality, and I guess that's what I need or want to do.  Friday night/Saturday morning I felt very at peace, and one with the Earth and the Universe.  I told J I felt like a total hippie .
