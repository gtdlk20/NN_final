So this time I made sure I was going to get in. I decided to go with my friend right after school, so there would be no line up. I skipped last period (about 1:45 before the movie was supposed to start) and went home. I ate my two grams slowly, breaking off little pieces at a time. This, I've found, is the best way to take them, if you can stand/like the taste. I love the taste :). It took me about fifteen minutes to eat the two grams and then I sat around for half an hour watching TV. When I had an hour to go before the movie, I went outside and spent some time smoking my gram and then walking to the theatre. By the time I got to the theatre (about fifteen minutes before the movie was to start) I was feeling nice and high from the pot, with the mushrooms just starting to kick in.
