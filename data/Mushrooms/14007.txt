At times I felt comfortable to lay openly on my bean bag chair with my arms and legs sprawled out. I would eventually feel cold, and have a sense of fear in my racing thoughts, so I tucked into a fetal position to feel a cozy, comforting hug from my own arms and blanket. Then after a while of that, I felt restricted and I sprawled out again, relieved of the pressure. I kept doing that like 15 times while I was in a loop of worrying about whether my thoughts would lead me to logically justify why it was okay to kill myself. I would realize For gosh sakes, Im just laying down limp and Id totally know if I was going to make a bad decision. I was in the silent darkness for an hour and 44 minutes, but it felt like 45 minutes.
