I move to the bedroom.  I have extreme visuals.  Much of the landscape is covered with this pattern.....indescribable. My lover and I contemplate the night/morning, the problems of the world. We turn on some Futurama.  The beginning is intense.  It is short, and just about killed me with amusement. The episode is Benders Game.
