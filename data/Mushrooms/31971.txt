Anyhow back to my trip, I remember looking towards J who had his head in his hands.  He seemed to not be doing so well but what I was going through quickly distracted me from my friends in the room.  Every time I looked at J sitting across from me I could see a parallel dimension of his own body, as if there were two infinity mirrors on either side, but instead of seeing an infinite amount of JÂ’s I just saw the J in one dimension over to the right and one dimension over to the left and the regular J in between. The next intense visual was in the center of the room; I saw a complex and intricate oval shaped object made of pure energy. It was a beautiful object, reminded me almost of a crystallizing igloo, made with translucent tubes that had blindingly powerful plasma circulating throughout its design.  It would fade in and out of my perception.
