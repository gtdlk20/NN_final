Eventually I told myself that I was being stupid just psyching myself out, so I decided to just flow with it.  I was chilling with some people I didn't know and a few I did just talking in a living room with some soft music.  Within about a half an hour I began to feel really relaxed.  A tingling feeling began to pulse quietly through my body that made me, extremely giddy and happy, yet relaxed.  I didn't want to move.  It felt like I was putting on some kind of magic helmet and I was exploring some other world.  Everything looked the same, except for the colorful tones, and light rippling visuals.  Music was the most fantasic thing in the world to me at the time.  Bob AMrley was playing in the background and after a while, I felt like hugging everyone around me (I suppressed the urge).  Eventually I began to get really  open, and deep.  I started to be able to use some sort of extra sensory perception, and really began to notice the way people communicate through invisible means.  It was quite fascinating.  Everyone seemed to have an aura, and sometimes when I communicated with certain people, and we weren't on the same mind 'wave-length' I would get a bad vibe and it would kind of hurt me, like an insult from a good friend.  Other times I would get really good vibes from people, particularly people who were trying to help me talk about what I was experiencing.  The worst vibes came from observing people try and mess each other up with glowsticks, and also when other people that were tripping on shrooms looked like they weren't being respectful of the mushroom 'being'.  Weird.  When we finally left the party, I left feeling like I knew more about people in general and about the subtlties, we keep from each other.
