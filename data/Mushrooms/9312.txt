Imagine your sense of self is an ice cube. It was like being thrown into the ocean and instantly melting. Your identity as the ice cube disappears into the ocean but in the process you become the entire ocean. You realize that the ice cube was really just water this whole time. Dying wasnÂ’t like falling asleep, it was like waking up from a dream. Imagine you had this really vivid dream you were living another life. You wake up in the morning start to move around and the dream fades from your memory. Where did that dream go? Do you really even care? It was just a dream.
