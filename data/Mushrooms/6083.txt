She just stared at me blankly and was kind of freaked that I was so out of it. I didn't realize that I was tripping hard and not even peaking. Indeed - I could have sworn with my hand on a bible: the tiles were flowing or accelerating. And I stood on it. I even touched the tiles with my fingers and the visions didn't stop. I told her I'm having a serious time believing that she's lived in the room and never seen what the tiles do.
