We finally got back into town and sat at a table where we normals smoke bowls and drink beer. I started to smoke a cigarette, and really didn't like the smell of it for some reason, so I put it out. A few minutes later I smelled my hand, I said, 'my hands smell like cigarettes, I don't like that, I don't ever want to smell like this again.' I haven't craved or touched a cigarette for days now, and it's going to stay that way.
