I obtained 5 dried grams of mushrooms from a guy I'd got some off previously. I decided to ingest 5 grams on this occasion because I did 3 grams last time, I had a very good experience, but thought it would be interesting to increase the dose and push the boat out a little. When I acquired the shrooms, I didn't ask what kind of they were, I assumed they were the same as the ones I got before (Psilocybe cubensis).
