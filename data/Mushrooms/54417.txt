What I experienced was the first concept of coming into existence presented as a dual thought with a quadrinal algorithmic Mandala shape, like a visual representation of the code running the show.  The code is actually awakening itself  a paradoxical thought that thinks itself.  The looking for a beginning leads to an impossible conclusion  logic tries to reason about itself and gets stuck in a loop.  The thought goes: I exist, there is no non-existence before, therefore I have always been and will always be, and only this: a being made of 4 bits, realising it exists and going back to the start of the loop. The realisation of existence is the reason for existence and thats it.  To be in that pattern with awareness is probably the scariest experience imaginable  that you thought you were a human being living a life but it turns out that was simply an illusion, a cloak, to hide under from the reality of this empty, terrifying and extremely painful self-realisation.
