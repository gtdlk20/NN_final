Most of the time I was feeling either fine or euphorious (physically), but there was a time when I felt as if someone was tearing my guts apart. There was a feeling of acute pain, and I started to get a bit panicky. But as I faced the ceiling and saw 'my little red thing' again, the pain subsided, and I felt fine. Slight feelings of nausea did appear once in a while, but they lasted only for short monets.
