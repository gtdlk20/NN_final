The rest of the night we felt very gassy and stoned. Jim didn't like it but I was used to it. We toyed with the idea of smoking pot but we ended up not. I didn't feel like rolling a joint. All in all, I'd say it was the best and most intense shroom trip I've had, as well as the most memorable. I found out a lot about the way I think and the way I view other people. Me and Jim are going to remain close, and remained close the rest of our time there.
