At 1400 I decided to take some more so that I didnt start flagging later on. I dosed myself with 2mgs this time and again it took 3 hours before realy starting to notice it on top of the residuals from the night before (there was still some visual distortion at 1400 but it was past its peak) and I remembered reading about 2CE and DOI making a good mix together. This was about 1700 again, so I took 10mgs of 2CE hoping that the fact that I hadnt eaten much would stop the 2CE from wreaking its usual havoc with my guts. It was fantastic! The two synergised really well, the 2CE added just enough psychedelia to satisfy me without me having to risk unwanted amphetamine effects by taking more DOI. Dancing felt fantastic and royksopp (headlining band)  were amazing. Everywhere I looked there were happy faces jumping around, everyone I had eye contact with was smiling or shaking my hand, a very good sociable mix. Unfortunately my girlfriend felt that she was totally down at midnight and declined more as she wanted to sleep, meaning her 1 1/2mg trip had lasted about 28 hours. She does have quite a low tolerance for these things.
