At this point things took on a new character.  I could not tell whether my eyes where open or shut and soon there was no I at all.  For the sake of clarity I will continue to use I, but keep in mind that this is misleading.  There was only a sense of raw awareness.  I was overwhelmed.  I was evacuating my body.  It was all I could do to keep breathing.  In.  Out.  In.  Out.  Just keep breathing.  I was being drawn out into the cosmic stream of energy.  I was a breaker in a circuit.  The flow of energy was so great I had to let go of everything; my body, my identity, language, and everything about the world I knew in order to keep from burning out.  Let go.  Breathe.  Just let it flow.
