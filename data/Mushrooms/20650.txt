Once the veil had dissolved away, I was left staring into eyes filled with terrifying wisdom, love, and emotions I cannot begin to understand or describe. They looked like cuttlefish/octopus eyes, though what I was looking at was definitely not an octopus. I remember a roundish head that was vaguely outlined, but that was about it. In place of things like arms and legs, this being operated solely through pure intent and meaning. It felt neither good nor evil. It simply was, and it was absolute perfection. The blues, greens, and purples of before simply dissolved and gave way to rich, awe-inspiring shades of gold and orange. It was like the most beautiful sunset you have ever seen, only the sun was alive and unmistakably looking back at you. I remember the edges of this being were hidden in darkness, and I could still see the same colors from before leaking out and back into its form. In retrospect, I know that whatever this thing was, it was presenting itself to me in a form that was at the comfortable limit of what I could understand and accept. Still, I could sense there was much more to it. I didnÂ’t ask to see more though. I had gotten what I came for.
