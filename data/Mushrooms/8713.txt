It was a normal monday night, bowling league night for my place of work, a few coworkers and a manager making up the remainder of the team. I sit at home after taking a shower and getting ready for the night at hand. The remainder of the mushrooms were sitting on my desk and I had intended on taking some for the night of bowling. I knew I had about 7.5 grams left and I didn't want to really have to deal with having them in my possession any longer than I already had. I save a gram and a half for one of my team members and pour the remaining 6 grams onto my desk and prepare to consume. I start to eat them, downing them with a handy soda. Typical mushroom taste and stomach feeling. And then it is time to leave. **Disclaimer: Driving while intoxicated or under the influence of any mind altering substance is extremely dangerous and is probably not a good idea (of course it took this experience to realize the severity of that claim)**
