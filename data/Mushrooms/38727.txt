We turned off the lights.  Shapes of cages and wire designs and transparent cubes and swirling things appeared in the absence of the light.  Nick brought out the four bottles of whipped cream and balloons we had bought earlier.  The colors on his painting were changing.  The blues would shift within a range of very pale blue to very dark blue.  The greens would go consecutively through every shade of green as well.  India on the globe light was slowly crawling and blowing north like sand.  The map of Japan was fluttering against the wall, and the bookcase was still bending.  I became intensely excited when I saw the package of balloons.  I didnt want any nitrous, I just wanted a balloon.  I asked James for a balloon and he tossed one at me.  I blew it up and tied it and threw it up in the air.  It somehow escaped so I asked if someone could give me another.  Nick handed me another balloon which I blew up and managed not to lose.  Instead I rubbed it and squeezed it and chewed on the end of it.  It was covered in a thin layer of very light dust.  I tried to wipe all of the dust off of it but I couldnt so I gave up.  When I touched the balloon delicate little spider-webby strings from my fingertips attached themselves to the balloon.  This also happened when I touched the chair, so I was unable to stop touching it.  I watched the other people.
