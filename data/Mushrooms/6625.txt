After the metal battle had gone on for what seemed like hours I managed to bring a degree of sanity to my mind, and I felt slightly calmer because my uncontrollable internal dialogue had slowed and was more controllable. However I was still very unhappy and worried. I then looked up and started talking to my friends, explaining that I had been on one hell of a ride. Talking made me feel much better, and it took my mind off my mind, and I began to get happier and less worried. When I looked at my watch and realised that I had been curled up for about two hours I felt even better, because I realised that I was coming down and that the torture was over. Although it surprised me that it had been that long, I had become horribly aware of how slow time seemed to be passing whilst the trip was bad. At times it really did feel like I was living out a mental hell for all eternity.
