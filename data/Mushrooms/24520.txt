I hear thumping like someone running down stairs as quick as they can, and then someone screaming as loud as they can. Then around the corner comes in one of my good friends with sparklers in his hand running in and out in circles, screaming. He destroyed everything, my reality, my state of mind. But I loved it! It made me laugh, and smile how he was having fun and tripping out just like me. I could hear people breathing in so deeply and letting out like they just seen a ghost or people sometimes screaming once they feel that urge that they can't take it anymore.
