About 20 minutes in I noticed some effects.  A gut-feeling, some excitement.  I joined my friend in the back -- he was feeling it too, but he wanted a cigarette.  I suggested we take a walk (read: he smoke it outside), but nothing doing.  The thought of tobacco smoke at that point was sickening me, so I walked to the front room.
