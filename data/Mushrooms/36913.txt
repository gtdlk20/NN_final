The next thing I remember, we were in my old bedroom, and I was hanging on to the closet door. I was saying to T, 'If I let go of this door, he'll die! He's sick! He needs me.' T was busy jumping back between the closet and the desk. After about 30 minutes of hanging on to a door: I was baseline. My trip was ended. I let go of the door and walked T back into the hallway. We went on a walk and T discovered the beauties of light, color, and nature.
