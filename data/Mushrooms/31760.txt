As I stepped out of the car I noticed my limbs were starting to get really tingly, in a very good way. It was pleasurable and I was having a really great time. I started rambling about how good I was feeling and I said, You know what this is? Its fun, thats all it is! All my hopes for a mystical spiritual trip were forgotten. I was simply enjoying myself. My body was starting to feel really amazing now. I have read and heard from many mushroom users that the physical effects they get are usually unpleasant but for some reason I felt like I was having a full-body orgasm. The pleasure was intense and it didnt let up. In fact it only got stronger with each passing minute.
