As I finished clean the backyard I just stood there listened to their conversation and I started to get noticible visuals for the first time, I saw their faces change a little bit, the surrounding were starting to get this bright light energy to the lines that defines the edges of things, however when I looked directly it would dissapear. My wife's face looked funny and I was laughing so naturally while they gossiped about thing and told amusing jokes, one of the best feelings ever. There was no music, just conversation with normal people.
