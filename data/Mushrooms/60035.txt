We had all come here on previous nights in the summer, and discovered that it was a very reliable and safe place to purchase psychedelic, and other soft drugs.  Being that it was a clear night, and with nothing else to do, me and several other friends decided to head down to the beach to see what was happening. Upon arrival, we all purchased a few grams of northern lights, which is an exceptionally good strain of Mary Jane.  After sharing this herb with each other and few travelling musicians from Arizona, I decided that tonight I wanted to have my second experience with the magic mushrooms.  This was also the case for a few others in the group, and we departed the circle in order to scan the beach for a suitable dealer.  We ended up buying from a large African man with several earrings, who offered to sell them at a buy three grams Â– get one free rate, at five dollars a gram.  This being a very good deal, we all agreed, and I purchased three grams.  This would normally be more than enough for a dose, but because I got an extra gram for free I decided to go for it all and eat four.
