And then I went on to a 'whole nother level.' I don't know how long it lasted, but I remember looking at stars, pulsing with rainbow light, like I was looking at the whole universe, and then realizing that everything I was seeing only amounted to one guy doing a drug, and being blown away by this. I literally did not know who or where I was, or that 'being somebody' was a thing. There was zero self-awareness.
