Not long after this I decided I want to explore with my friends so I cross the river to see them. They look at me with concern, as if they knew the high dose I took and wanted to make sure I was okay. They were looking at a native Australian bird called the lyrebird. At this point the world around me started to stretch and my field of vision increased. The leaves on the trees around me were flowing like a river. I continue to walk behind them hearing what they were exclaiming and I thought to myself I dont want to be hearing this I rush back to the campsite and pick up some ear protection ear buds and walk back I can still hear them and like Terence McKenna said the mushroom speaks. The mushroom said to me Why dont you listen to what they have to say So I do.
