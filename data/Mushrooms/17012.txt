I was even friendlier. I noticed that my friend did not have a cookie. He was lying near to me, with his back against my friends bed. Without saying a thing, I put a cookie on his stomach and then turned my attention back to Aqua Teen Hunger Force. There was a rapping spider on it, and went by the name of MC Pee Pants, which the name alone, made me giggle outrageously. A humour I'm not often prone to.
