In retrospect I can now understand that some of the thoughts going through my mind were ridiculous  nothing more than drug-induced delusions that would never make sense to a coherent mind. The fear and paranoia that came along with the thoughts of never sleeping again and tripping forever was a foolish and immature way of thinking. The greatest thing about traditional psychedelics like LSD, mescaline, or magic mushrooms is the lack of physical damage they present to the human body. The user can go into every trip knowing theyre not going to overdose or die from the drug alone. The only physical danger stems from the decisions made by the user while under the influence.
