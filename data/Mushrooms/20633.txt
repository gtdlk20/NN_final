I did have some concern for a while though, I know that mushroom is hard on the body, my previous six gram trips I found to be rough on the guts and muscles, especially  my last 2g-2g-2g trip over 2 hours a few months back was a bit hard on my body, my muscles everywhere felt like they wanted to spasm but the trip itself was very good. (However I had been exercising intensely during those months and using testosterone at the time.) So I worried about what will happen to me this time. Other then feeling the gut churn after consumption of the first three grams. I then ate a full supper and then afterwards consumed the rest of the shrooms, the trip came on so hard yet it was fairly smooth on the body and no problems with muscle spasms. This may be due to some factors, 1: I had supper early in the trip (usually I cant eat) , 2:the trip came on so hard and fast I had no time to even consider my body, 3, I was on a very low testosterone dosage this time.
