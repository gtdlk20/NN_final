With eyes closed, it seemed vaguely hilarious that these could be called 'closed eye visuals.' After all, if I really tried to LOOK at them, they weren't there at all! Instead, they were just the familiar shapes and colors that I'd been failing to notice most of the time while 'sober.' Music DIDN'T sound better, colors DIDN'T look sharper, visuals WEREN'T more vivid... and THAT was the epiphany. Things always just WERE! There was no 'trip.' Things just were.
