Somehow, I finally stopped this crazy train of thought and focused on what I had been looking at the entire time (I almost forgot that I was even conscious); the glowing stars on the ceiling.  I saw (what I thought was) the most amazing thing:  the stars started swirling, right before my eyes!  This was my first true visual hallucination, and soon the stars (and the rest of my room, including me) were spinning at a high speed.  When I closed my eyes and re-opened them, the spinning would start over, slowly at first, and working its way up to top-speed.  The fact that I could control this hallucination fascinated me to the point where I did not stop for almost 45 minutes straight.  I decided to take a rest from my spinning, and looked at my entertainment center, trying to see how much time had just passed (it felt like 4  5 minutes).  As I looked at the furniture and T.V. the shadows seemed to grow.  Now, I was watching the shadows and knew that they werent actually moving, but my mind believed that they were growing and becoming taller (either that or I was shrinking).  The mere fact that my mind was contradicting the very things I was seeing baffled me, and almost sent me into another loop of thought, so I quickly looked away.
