At my college campus (I'm a design major), drugs are readily available for those who seek them. Growing tired of pot, I decided to throw in $25 for a lump of chocolate supposedly containing an 1/8th of shrooms. Seeing how thanksgiving break was just around the corner, I saved another $25 and purchased a second chocolate, and saved the 2 so I could trip with a good friend of mine over break.
