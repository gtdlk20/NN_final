One evening my wife and I decided to each imbibe 3 grams of a strain of Ps. cubensis that we had grown out from spores that I received back in the early 1980s, S0371, which was collected in Eastern Brazil.  This strain produced carpophores that had caps that were more domed in shape than the McKenna cubensis strains, the Lux Natura Amazonian and Brillo Nuevo strains, and we thus dubbed them 'the domes.'  We generally found it to be a very friendly strain with no hard edges.
