Lately, I have experimented with low-dose mushroom consumption before my very intense (Hatha-based) power yoga class and I have found the benefits to be phenomenal.  I should note that my class is both crowded and heatedÂ—not to Bikram levels, but still hot.  I have experimented between once and twice a month for about six months for a total of ten experiments.
