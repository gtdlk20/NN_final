We were camping at one beach in my country, not crowded at all, we were basically my friends and me. I ate 2 hours into their trip, and there was a sober friend. I completely acknowledge that this kind of substance in this kind of dose can really really go bad, because I had no control of what was bombing my mind at all, even when I had done enough research before I ate it. The dose is unknown and will remain like that my whole life, which was definitely irresponsible.
