Yesterday night was my fourth, and so far favorite shroom trip. It is late October and me and 2 friends of mine went to an amusement park that is open late for Halloween time. Most of the normal roller coasters are open, as well as many haunted houses and sections of walkways turned into a haunted walkway.
