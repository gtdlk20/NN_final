It was a school night, and we had a half-day the next day which started at about 11:00 in the morning, so we figured we could trip that night. It was about 8:00, and after some deliberation regarding if Josh's mom would notice the extreme pupil dilation caused by the mushrooms, we decided to eat them. Josh split up the bag as evenly as possible, and we ate them, chewing for about 10 minutes, as that will supposedly make the trip more intense. I enjoyed the taste of dried fungus as I thought of what was to come. I went into Josh's bathroom and smoked a cigarette underneath the vent fan, hoping this would bring on the high a bit faster.
