Melissa was getting an uncomfortable vibe from the spectator people, so she left us and went back to her room by herself. We were all getting cold, so we went inside to my friend Alexs room. Hes an artist and does virtually all of his work while hallucinating. We stood and talked for a little while, before it finally hit me. As I was standing next to his dresser, the patterns in the wood grain started waving and sliding. I was elated and enthralled by them.
