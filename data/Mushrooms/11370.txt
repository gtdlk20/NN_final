As the sun set I could feel the shrooms reach a plateau, and I was tripping hard, but not nearly as hard as I had imagined to be off 7 grams. My friend was feeling the full extent, however, and he was lost in his own world. After a spectacular sunset, we withdrew back into the cabin and put on a movie (Fantasia). The second the movie began I knew that the shrooms were not done with me yet. Up until this point the only hallucination I had was the glass door and an amazing light show of shapes and colors, but nothing beyond the normal shrooms experience. Once the movie began, however, the shrooms doubled then tripled its effects. It started with my couch throbbing in a breathing motion, and the room was alive with activities and movement. The lamp would become a small white elf hanging onto a large golden stick whenever I focused on it. The ceiling fan was a labyrinth of dancing skeletons, and as it continually went in circled the skeletons would take on different dance partners.
