T+02:30ish - We reached the waterfalls.  Normally this would be a five minute trip from the parking lot, but we were distracted by many things on the way.  We followed the path parallel to the creek and came to an obstacle in the path that couldn't be easily overcome in our current state of mind, so we found a place to rest once more.  The three of us lay down in the dirt, not far from the smaller waterfalls and attempted to meditate.  The feeling was very spiritual and serene, and I couldn't keep myself from describing out loud the absolute beauty of this night.  Though I would not be silent, the meditation was greatly enhanced by the mushrooms, and all we had to do was sit there to feel connected to all things in existence.
