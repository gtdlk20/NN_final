10:20 am, 11/7: Went to partners house around 7:00pm last night and felt so relieved. So happy and calm. I felt much lighter and her presence was incredibly refreshing and reassuring and helped reinforce the point I had reached in realizing that I am not alone. I felt like my thoughts were a little disjointed and disconnected at first. I noticed myself responding to things my partner was saying with slightly unrelated things, usually having to do with myself. Got quiet for a bit after calling myself out on that in my head. Her laying on me, on the couch, me half-asleep, stroking her hair, kissing intermittently and watching Cheers. Then, making love  feeling the power of release and relief within both of us, lost in her eyes in my eyes. Then, holding her and her holding me as we collapsed into sleep together. I cant think of a better way to have integrated my mushroom experience and the message I was left with  I am not alone with this fear  than that. While I do still feel I am processing the experience, I am thankful for it and I feel like a weight has been lifted from me.
