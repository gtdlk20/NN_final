I yell for awhile, getting very worked up in the situation. eventually my friends manage to calm me down, taking the drunk friend, who I will call N, out of the room. For some reason however, which I still don't know, I begin to cry for about 5 mins, while I sit and talk to Blais. At this time, my emotions shift up and down very rapidly and I'm laughing and crying and smiling and frowning alot all within a 15 mins period until I begin to calm down and relax abit.
