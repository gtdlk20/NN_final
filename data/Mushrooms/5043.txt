I believe we must learn the full breadth of our situation, look this medusa of a culture square in the eyes, and not turn away. We must realize the roots of our problems and transform our way of relating to the world. I believe we must live as participants in nature, not observers. I absolutely recommend reading the Ascent of Humanity by Charles Eisenstein, which is online for free. If anything in this essay rang true with you, this book will definitely resonate with you. I believe meditation and other spiritual exercises are very beneficial. They have been helpful in order to become grounded in being, and diminish my egoic-mind domination over my life. The only thing I can do is live a life that makes sense to me, given my situation. Thank you for reading about my experience and after-thoughts. If you are planning to try psilocybin mushrooms, I recommend taking caution, having a positive mindset, natural, outdoors setting, and not abusing them. Namaste.
