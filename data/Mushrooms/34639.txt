I cannot explain the extremely visual neverland I was in.  It felt like being born, or what I could imagine what it feels like.  I felt completely weightless with a feeling of anxiousness to get somewhere, but I couldn't figure out where.  Technicolor surrounded me and I felt like I was one with my surroundings, completely covered by its beauty and mysteriousness.  I stayed in a trance like state for almost 3 hours, flowing with the mass of people and dipping in and out of reality.  My trip lasted a total of 12 hours and we finally went to sleep in the back of a friends car after a large smoke session which made us all pretty much pass out right in the middle of it.
