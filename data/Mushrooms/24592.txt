Within minutes I started to come up and did my normal routine of putting on music and lighting candles. The trip intensified so quickly that during a quick trip to the bathroom I somehow ended up on the tiled floor giggling like a lunatic. Then there was a great lapse in memory and everything I was, was no more. The infinite suffering, horror, sadness, apathy, love, awe, wonder and fear kicked in but the feelings had no positive or negative connotations. Then the last emotion struck, all on its own, loneliness.
