I did significant journaling in the week prior to focus my attention on what I desired to accomplish, and what I wanted to think about in therapy. Yet, I was well aware that despite all the prep and desired focus in the world, things may turn in unexpected directions. I desired to focus on my depression, my anxiety, my low self image, my marriage, my job, my insecurities, my back pain. I also asked God (my Higher Power as I understand it) to reveal himself to me, reveal his love to me, to give me love for him, give me love for others, and to show me his presence. But ultimately, I knew my mind and my Higher Power would take me where they wanted regardless of my hopes and desires.
