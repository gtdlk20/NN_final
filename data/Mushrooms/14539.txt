The day started fairly early, my friends and myself decided to meet at my friends house. Since his parents were to be gone all day we thought it was the perfect time. Me and 3 others decided to try mushrooms so we called my friend to pick them up. All together we picked up 3 eighths. Two of my friends split an eigth, myself and my other friend decided to go all out for our first time and take a full eigth. (Sure this may not sound like a lot to some more experienced users, but for a first time it was plenty... trust me.) So we all took them, I decided to eat them with peanut butter and fluff.
