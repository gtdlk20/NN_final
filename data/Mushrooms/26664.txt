I think the only good thing we had going for us is that the two agents took a liking to my girlfriend.  She is a very pretty and has such an innocent face; its hard for one not to find her charming.  So of course they treated me like the evil manipulative boyfriend who was forcing his girlfriend to grow psychedelics in her closet so that he was not caught by the law if the shit hit the fan.  The one little bite sized piece of humanity we observed in these cold agents was one of there references to a poster on my girlfriends wall.  It was a poster of the band Static-X.  I think the agent said something to the extent of how badass Static-X is.  Of course thats true, but it was shocking that he said it.  How can this be?  How is it possible that someone so authoritarian and rigid could dig a band like Static-X (basically hard-metal), who basks in chaos?
