It was 5:30 (T+5:55). My girlfriend had to lie down and rest, and I felt the dissociative state rapidly wearing off. I tried resuming some needed business E-mail work but found it difficult to do so with good accuracy.  Some important numbers I needed to type in were difficult for me to copy, and I couldn't process more than three or four digits at a time without becoming distracted. I went to the back yard and enjoyed the fading afternoon, then watched television.
