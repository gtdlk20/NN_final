Overall, it was a positive experience.  That thing with the vibes was really insightful.  But, some things did piss me off, like I kept telling myself how I don't tell my parents I love them enough and dont spend enough time with them and how I shouldn't smoke cigarettes, just stuff that can get on my nerves and doesnt lay right on my conscience.
