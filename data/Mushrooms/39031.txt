A bit nervous as this was my first trip over 2 grams, I noticed a slight 'head change' after about 45 minutes and decided I had better tell my parents goodnight and get to bed, or I would have to tell them after the trip started, lol. I climbed into bed about 11:00 or so and relaxed in the quiet as if I was going to sleep, although I knew there wouldn't be much of that tonight.  I was still nervous and calming myself with slow deep breathing (nervousness is normal for me, even without shrooms). I waited and waited for my trip to start, unaware of what was going to happen.
