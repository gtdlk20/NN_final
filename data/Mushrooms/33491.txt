I decided I would rather come up in the house, after all, so we began to walk back through the park in the direction of the house. I asked my SO 'was the pavement always curved like that?' and he said 'yes'. I remembered it being that way but not this much, it seemed very significant at the time. By the time I stumbled into the house I was definitely feeling the effects. I went to the sitting room and layed on the massive leather couch on my back and stared up at the ceiling. I slowed my breathing, I was very nervous but this didn't seem too bad. My laptop and its pre-made playlist lay unused on the floor. The TV was still playing some black-and-white comedy but I payed it no heed. Upon looking up I noticed that the walls had begun to breathe a little and the lines around the edges of the windows had begun to ripple. The lights above my head were waving too, and the colors seemed more intense than usual.
