D (so he told me later) came into the lounge-room- after having gotten trapped in the hallway for awhile, unable to find the door out- and found me spread-eagled on the floor, half-naked and being literally consumed by the carpet. To him it seemed as though I was being swallowed by some fearsome, living, breathing, contracting, beast that intended to have its way with him next. Ky was sitting on the couch with a look of abject terror on his face and was evidently no help. I remember calling out to him that it was all good and he just needed to surrender to the experience and that when you did it was all beautiful. I urged him to just lie down like I was and just close your eyes and relax. D didn't see it that way. Be buggered if he was going to lie down and just let that pulsating beast swallow him, so he high-tailed it.
