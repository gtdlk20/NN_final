Just before the end of the album my parents came in. They said hi, my mom asked if the music was good for me now and said dont worry Ill shut up. I felt bad that she felt like I didnt want her to talk. She left the room to do something and my dad sat on the couch next to me with his laptop. I asked if the music was ok for him, he said sure no problem, I said he didnt understand - I wanted music to be playing that would actually make him feel good. He said he liked the music. Soon the album finished and I put on another album that I know he likes (Benjamin Clementine - At Least For Now).
