Just as we left the house, one of the girls pointed out a small child on a bike, which seemed so hilarious to me a the time. I was laughing out of control. We walked up to a local conveinience store, and the proceded to a nearby forest. The woodchips on the ground seemed to shine baby blue at me, and the rest of the forest looked very dark. As I looked at the ground, I noticed the white parts of my clothes looked like they do when white is placed under black light. I also started to loose my balance at this point.
