As I entered the house again, the sound of the television consumed me. It was an extremely intense sound, almost too intense. All of my thoughts seemed to be building inside of my head as the trip became more intense. The experience was becoming very amazing. My thoughts alone are indescribable, as though I was thinking through a soul from a past life.  It seemed as though everything had its own essence. I felt strangely connected to my environment. Although I was amazed by my initial thoughts, I was also getting agitated by the fact that everything was happening so fast.
