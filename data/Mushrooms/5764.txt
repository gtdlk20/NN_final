There was the feeling of vast amounts of ancient and alien knowledge being stored in hitherto unused parts of my brain, which I moved my thoughts through as if I were rediscovering and exercising them. Wondering what 'powers' I may have gained I later, half jokingly, tried to make Socrates and myself levitate. During the onslaught of information I telepathically asked 'Why me? Why this time?' and received the answer 'It's always like this. This is what always happens!' The essence of what they were imparting/teaching me was a message of promoting harmony and interconnection, the notion of 'god' in everyone with a Jesus style acceptance of responsibility. I felt deemed a potentially harmonious man, with a sense of congratulations towards me for trying to be as good a person as I can.
