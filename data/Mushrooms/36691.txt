I had planned this trip out for months; Shroom with my two closest friends, connect in a special way, freak out, write some music, just a good night.  Something was different from the start; the dealer was a friend of ours who picked the shrooms locally, we sat in his house smoking a bowl and talking about the trip we should expect for about 20 minutes before he showed us our bags.  These were different from varities I had used before; long and skinny with tiny caps vs fat caps with broken stubby stems, they were in perfect condition denoting that this dealer truly had the welfare of us and the drugs at heart, they weren't even bruised or broken in any way.  We were strongly advised to do a tea method with these; wanting to think we were hardcore we just crunched them instead, this was poor choice the first, the dealers last words were 'if you eat that whole bag you'll freak out'.
