	I started to get scared that I had perhaps eaten to many shrooms, and that I might freak out and have a bad trip, but I grounded myself and remained calm.  Then, just as the sun slipped behind the horizon, a lightning storm in the distance erupted into a frenzy of glory.  Lightning came crashing down into the ocean over by Delta.  This is so crazy! I remarked as we began to walk towards a log that was pointing out into the ocean.  We all walked along the log to the end and we were surrounded by water on both sides, and when I stepped onto the water, expecting to pull a Jesus and surprise everyone, I found myself knee deep in the ocean.
