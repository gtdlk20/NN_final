The spawn run chamber is basically an aquarium with filled with a saturated salt solution (salt will keep germs, bacteria, and other stinky stuff from growing in the water).  The solution is of water and rock salt and extends up the half pint jars to the bump before the lids.  The solution is heated via a submersible aquarium heater and an airstone to turn the water a bit.  The water temperature has been set to 86F, the optimum spawn run temperature.  Fresh water is periodically added to make up for evaporation to maintain the proper water level. If you do not use an aquarium, I DO recommend that you keep the jars in a humid environment.  Also, I recommend that one uses 1/3 cup of water rather than the 1/4th recommended by PF.  Lastly, I used a heaping 1/4 cup of brown rice rather than a level one as PF recommends.
