Despite our lack of time perception I believe it was about 1pm when we boarded the Nemesis, another rollercoaster and my favourite ride in the world. We went on this ride twice, once near the back and once up the front. During this I was tripping pretty hard, I could see swirling patterns on the floor and the ride before I got on it, M had a few visuals if he concentrated hard enough, I thought heÂ’d passed out when we got on for the first time because he was relaxing and trying for closed eye visuals. The ride itself did make me feel as though I was flying. The second time we went on it we had thoughts of ascending to heaven as the ride moved us up towards the sky.
