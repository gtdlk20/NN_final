We started to ingest the grained mushies at around 8:30. As this was my first time, I felt hyper and excited, even a little nervous. The actual ingestion was no problem; the mushrooms - despite a yucky smell - did not really taste like anything, and it was easy to swallow them with water. During the first few minutes nothing happened. I even tried to meditate with Ea, but it was rather impossible to concentrate. Then (probably after 15-30 minutes; I couldn't track time), I started to feel a strange, yet nice tingling sensation moving in waves around my body. I closed my eyes, and the tingling changed into a feeling of 'heaviness,' I felt languid and at ease. Then the tingling sensation took over again, this time stronger, and I sensed a light buzziness in my head. I opened my eyes, and focused on the little, round, white fire alarm situated on the ceiling right above me. I began to see tiny red and green squares dancing in front of my eyes. All of a sudden there was a red flash of light. It was in the shape of a small, 'multi-horned' star, that blinked for a fraction of a second and then disappeared. Wow! I closed my eyes, thinking 'Here we go...,' and the letters fused into squares that sank down as if forming a staircase...
