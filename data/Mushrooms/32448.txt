My wife started to ridicule my parents expounding on all their quirky ways, we found this hilarious and we dealt with a lot of our angst in this way. Then my wife started telling me how I really am and what it is like to live with me and giving me a really hard time. Everything she said was true and I agreed with it all. I did not fight or contend but I agreed. I didnt just say that I agreed I really saw it from her perspective and I thought to myself what do I do to this woman? It was pretty intense but we got through all of it until there really were no more grievances. Then we fell in love. Everything that she is all, the crap that she has put me through, all the things about her that annoy the hell out of me and an ocean of good things that I enjoy about her all the time for all of this I am in love. We are in love.
