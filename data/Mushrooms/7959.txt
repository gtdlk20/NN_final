So we took our harvest to an older friend (P) who was something of a guru figure to us, guiding us on our pyschonautical adventures and suggesting music or art to study whilst doing so. He was happy for B and I to boil a saucepan of water on his AGA, in which we dropped a few breakfast tea bags and, what would later prove to be a questionable move- our entire harvest of earthy, moist field mushrooms. So much for making a few quid to spend in the school tuck shop.
