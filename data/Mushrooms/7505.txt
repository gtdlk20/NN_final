My shroom trip began to accelerate as soon as my two friends decided to go to campus and smoke.  I knew I was too fucked up to go, but somehow tripped myself into going along, despite deep misgivings.  I took my guitar along to ground myself.  I recall nothing of the walk to campus; I suddenly found myself on campus, very worried, and being hounded by my friends to get myself together, and go smoke.  I blanked out another stretch of time, and woke up to find myself in the midst of a seemingly endless forest of eucalyptus trees.  I had never been there before, and was absolutely lost.
