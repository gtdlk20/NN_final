At first it was a great trip.  I was seeing crazy stuff, sounds were exaggerated, I heard silly music, and everything was swirling and changing colors.  What I didn't know was that this was only a stage in the high, and that many more intense stages were on the way.  Doing shrooms was kind of like getting more and more high in increments, and having to adapt to each new stage.
