My brother laughed at me, then began to play Zelda on the Nintendo 64. What a boring game. How could my brother be interested in this stupid game when there was so much to explore in the world around us? I got a bag of tortilla chips and ate them. I wasn't particularly hungry, I just felt like experiencing the act of eating. It was incredible. I could feel the chips begin to break down within my salivating mouth. Swallowing was particularly enjoyable. I was reveling in my body and the amazing feat of eating. I thought it incredible that we obtained our energy in such a disgusting manner. I loved being human. I also told my brother than I loved him several times. He seemed more annoyed than touched, but he always repeated it back to me which kept me content.
