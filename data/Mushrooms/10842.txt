We finally reach my friend L's house but I am reluctant to go inside. I feel like I want to keep walking, looking at everything. Me, D, J, And L go into his backyard and into his shed. It is a comfertable inviroment with couches and a chair. I take one of the cushions off the couch and sit on the floor against the wall of the shed. My friend J Sits on the couch. My friend L askes me if Im feeling anything yet. When I look at his face his features are bulging and breathing, his face is distorting, his eyes are bulging out and sucking back in. When I see this I just start laughing. My thoughts are so introcate and deep. At the exact same moment me and J look at each other and just start laughing. Its as if we're telepathicly communicating about everyone in the room through our eyes.
