#2 was about a month ago and I had about a gram left over after a fun night.  I only take mushrooms maybe 3 or 4 times a year, and eating two grams of these had me flying for about 8 hours.  That was on Saturday, Wednesday I found the remnant sac in my pocket (needed to do laundry), it was almost exactly one gram, which we smoked out of a schwag (mota) pipe, it took 4 bowls to smoke all of it, and it smoked SLOW, but in the end it was.....nothing, for either one of us, it may have not been enough but it was a pain in the ass to smoke that many bowls and get nothing, not even the tinglings of a rush or anything.  In my opinion, If I want to enjoy shrooms, I eat the mf'ers.
