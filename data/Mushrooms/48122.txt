Opening my eyes once more, I was confronted by the wall that faces my TV screen, which was now covered in morphing images that looked like the background of those old Black Sabbath videos, only some-what fainter. Once more I began to play with my hands and casting shadows on the ever-changing wall. Overlapping the morphing images on my wall was a barrage of eyes. An endless number of eyes stared back at me. Not realistic eyes, but eyes that looked like they were drawn onto my wall and arms. Once more I found myself rubbing my wall and noticing its smooth texture.
