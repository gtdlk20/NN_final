At this point I was seeing fractals all over the ground and trees. Hypnotic lizard patterns were every where, it was overwhelming, we later left that spot and started walking, I looked over at the river and stared into the water. I met up later with my freind, he was peaking at this concrete structure and colors were swarming all over us.
