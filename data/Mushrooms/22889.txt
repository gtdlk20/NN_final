I answered without thinking even though that probably wasn't the best idea. She asked where I was and what I was doing. So I told her that I was going out for a walk because I enjoyed it. She told me to come back home because it was cold and I refused. And then I looked up and saw a bright blue galaxy with yellow Mario stars transposed over the night sky in between two palm trees. I'd never seen such strong visuals and I sill recoil a little when I remember this one. I told my mother I had to go, even though she wanted to keep talking. This gave me a huge surge of confidence and put in a good mood to start off my trip. I was an adult - my own person free from the desires of others - and I had the power to stop talking when I wanted to. I began walking again and I passed the playground. I contemplated walking out into the dark bushes beyond the park where it was easy to get lost even while sober. I hesitated at first, but then I reminded myself that I come from a long line of explorers, poets and adventurers. My ancestors sailed unknown seas, climbed peaks they considered impassable and wandered beyond the edge of the map. They created kingdoms, stole knowledge from the inscrutable grasp of this strange reality and laid out the foundations for everything we have today. I come from a long line of being human and am heir to thousands of years of accumulated knowledge, cleverness and imagination. The spectre of being lost simply could not compete with the potential I held inside me.
