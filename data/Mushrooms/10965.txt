As he was saying these things, I kept laughing, and then the world started to spin, but not all at once. Like on the brick wall, each individual brick spun around, all clockwise, but separate from each other. Things changed colors, and when I turned my head, there was a visual of water flowing and melting the images together. There were colors I'd never seen before, in patterns I never knew existed. And they kept weaving back and forth, in and out of each other, so that I could barely stand it. When I tried to talk, all that came out was a thought; there were no verbs involved. We were listening to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and there are parts in the album that I only noticed when high. The words I said most were: 'Discovery....' 'You gotta DO this....' 'Experience..... an experience from one mushroom.....' and 'This guy..... different.......... disCOVery.........' all in a really breathy voice, which changed from high to low without warning.
