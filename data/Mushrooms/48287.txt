I guess this was the peak of the trip, as the sky was green, and foggy. There were 4 trees in front of me, one appeared red, another yellow and one was blue. The fourth was in front of a street lamp. As I walked, the street lamp would move behind the tree, and as it did, the tree would change color from white, to red, to blue, untill it seemed to flash white,red and blue all at the same time. Then the girls and I went back to the house. I stood at the door with my key in my hand, but I was unable to fit the key in the door. I had to ask one of the girls to open it for me.
