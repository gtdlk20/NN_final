By now I was tripping really hard I was peaking at this moment. I got up and decided to lie down and think about life and where I'm going with life. This is when things get very hazy but yet so clear. I went into a dream state and everything was a huge closed eye visual. I felt myself leave my body and fly away. I just flew for what seemed like a million hours just endless. When I looked back I was outside our galaxy looking in on it. I could see earth way out in the distance and I remember going in and out of this. I would think to my self and picture my dorm room and all of the sudden I could be right back in my dorm. The first time I went back I was scared I didn't not want to be there it was an unwelcome place it gave off bad vibes. So I went back out the outer edges of our solar system in an instance. This place was very comforting. I sat out there just thinking about life and why we are here. I would not call it a very spiritual trip but it was definitely a life changing trip. I now know how small we really are and how there is so much more out then just us the universe is huge place one that I can only comprehend in that state of mind.
