A few days ago, some friends were doing extasy. Last time I did E, I was up for 2 days, so I opted for shrooms. They had blue spots on them this time, which I took for bruising (P. cubensis bruises blue). They did smell a little different than usual, too. Maybe it would have been wise to steer clear, but I wasn't going to throw out the night, if you know what I mean.
