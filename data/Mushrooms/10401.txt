45 - 60 min: We arrive at the dance floor and there is a bombardment of the senses. Lights, sounds, people laughing and dancing. After around 10 minutes of dancing I start to trip more intensely. The lighting and sound is really fascinating and people are more goblin like. I hear a lot of laughter that sounds really bizarre, sort of like a mad witch or those stereotypical mental patient laughters. It's quite scary so I walk away from the dance floor and sit down to take a few deep breaths, A joins me. The whole experience is quite weird but I let go of the fear and everything becomes more 'happy'. The light show is very beautiful and the trees look almost like human brains. Visuals are getting more intense
