I decided to distract myself by talking to my friends, K, G, and G's girlfriend L. Pretty much every time I had tripped K and G were also there, and it was always a good time. Even the one time I had a bad trip, there wasn't anyone else who I would rather trip with. They were feeling the effects too by now, and we talked about all sorts of things, laughing our asses off half the time. Our campsite was right near the edge of the campground. The boundary of the campground consisted of a chain-link fence, and on the other side of the fence was a wide open field where the sun was due to set. K and I went over to the fence, and noticed that a security guard on the outside of the fence was talking to people on the inside.
