And then....the music. THE MUSIC!!! My world would change shape, size, color and mood, depending on the music and so would my body movements. The whole time I was laying on the floor I was moving. Different parts of my body took on the characteristics of different parts of the music. I could hear every beat and sound with crystal clear clarity and my body moved accordingly. My leg was the bass-line and it would move to the bass beats while my arms were the melody. Also, the different layers of the song would come from different places. Some came from the floor, some came from the trees and some from the sea.
