So I decided to do shrooms alone for the first time.  This was my sixth time doing them overrall.  I did them around noon.  I chopped up a cap and mixed in with a little stir-fry, and ate two fat stems, which I washed down with tea.  Having done these particular shrooms before (I do not no the name), I knew they were quite potent and I was guaranteed an opening experience having waited about a week before I did them last.
