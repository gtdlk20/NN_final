It was at around 20:30 that I decided to have the first cigarette of the evening. I already had half a one left that IÂ’d rolled and smoked from earlier on, but I still found wrapping myself up in a jacket and heading to the window a complete ordeal. Once I was safely ensconced on the window sill, however, I had no regrets. The world outside was bathed in an atmospherically red light, and the night clouds, soft and smooth and nearly covering the black velvet sky, were illuminated in grey and neon orange by the city below. Never have I seen anything so beautiful as those clouds: as I looked on in stunned silence they swirled and morphed sensually from one shape to another, and soon I was in the midst of a trip wherein the lower surface of the clouds consisted of a thin, glowing wall, moving quickly upwards from the horizon and across the sky. Now and then the clouds would shift allowing the white, mysterious face of the moon to peek out solemnly at me. It was sad to consider that once I was sober again, the world would no longer look anything like that.
