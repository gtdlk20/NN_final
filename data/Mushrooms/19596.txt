We soon left for the beach, where I was antisocial, being focused inwards.  I had a moment of sober thinking, and introduced myself to a girl who was nearby.  We made small talk for a few minutes until I was flooded with the effects of the psilocybin.  I immediately broke off the conversation, and I cannot recall how.  I retreated to a dune and was soothed by the sound of waves crashing.
