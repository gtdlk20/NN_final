After that I understood everything, I cannot explain how, or why. I just understood, and I knew that every single thing understands, even this computer that I am typing on. But in it's own existance, it just Understands. Everything understands, and forgives, and accepts, for they understand us. Understanding became everything to me. As if it were the key to life, to nirvana. As I started feeling better. I felt extremely, extremely wise. I felt I could connect with everything, because I understood everything. I went outside to see what was going on there. Not much had changed, still the same spider trees, and wavy bushes, and now the dumpster was smiling at me, because it understood.
