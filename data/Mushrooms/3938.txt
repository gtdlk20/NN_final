Either way, in my pain and struggling I was too distracted to focus properly on the experience, and all I was getting were very dark and confusing thought loops. I was angry at the psychedelic community for lying to me, then angry at myself for maybe just not being cut out for this stuff, and then finally angry at the mushroom for not giving me what I wanted. For the first time in my life, I managed to convince myself that life is nothing but a cosmic accident, order is simply an illusion necessary for survival, and existence is truly and completely devoid of any meaning whatsoever. I felt alone, completely defeated, and absolutely out of my league. I was genuinely worried I would be stuck in this pit of anger and sadness forever. I think this final thought-loop was what really crossed the line, because at that exact moment the nausea became absolutely unbearable and I rushed to the bathroom. The next 30 seconds were followed by violent and difficult vomiting; however, I immediately began to feel much better. I went back to lie down and drink a lot of water, hoping I had absorbed enough psilocybin to continue the trip.
