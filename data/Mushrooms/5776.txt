The music line up was again a mixed bag. After the iconic Floyd the Super Furry Animals album 'Phantom Power' was an okay album to trip to, it filled the gap fairly pleasantly, if a little disappointingly. There was a doubling and tripling of images and ancient/alien text/symbols I have seen many times before rose up through all surfaces emitting meaning beyond ordinary language.
