I started to think too much about life and freaked a little, so I decided to meditate.  It was hard to do but after I calmed down I saw some insane CEV's.  They looked like the art of alex grey along with some wizards and goblin looking things.  I got lost many times in these visuals and saw so many things I really need to paint, it was incredible.
