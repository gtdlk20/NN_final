That was much of the time I was learning a lot of stuff. Then comes the time where I am reconstructing myself, my body was still meaningless, and the picture of that guy I was seemed to be so far away from what I was at that time, but my friends would say something about me, who I was and I would have flash backs, I would have like photos of how I look go through my brain, and I was accepting that was me but It felt so distant. Then at some point I learned to reason, to make a conclusion, because all the time on the trip thoughts would just come at me, I wasn't reasoning at all, and just slowly felt myself coming back. But that only happened completely the next day when I woke up.
