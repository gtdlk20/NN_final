The next stage of my trip was a bit uncomfortable. I sat back down to watch the show, and started to fell as if my chest were caving in and I felt like I had no energy to move. This was very short, and soon I felt fine. At around 11:15 my friends had to be picked up, so we waited in the kitchen for awhile. I thought I was coming back down, and I was sad because I didn't want it to end, but also relieved because I had many things to do before I went to bed, and I needed to remember everything so my parents wouldn't find out. I had to wash my clothes so the weed smell was gone, I had to clean the house so it appeared only I had been home, and I had to close all the windows and doors.
