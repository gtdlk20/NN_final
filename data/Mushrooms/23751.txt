At my parents farm (northern louisiana), I and my friend were set to go fishing for the day.  After opening the gate, I drove my Runner through while he closed.  Driving down the path, my friend - let's call him Trip - said, in a muffled, excited voice, 'Oh my God!  Look at the shrooms!'.  Nothing new to me, they've been there since I was a boy.  Little did I know how these would add such a change to my life perspective.
