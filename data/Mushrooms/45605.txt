My fellow voyager from our P. mexicana - cocoa experiment tells that he was presented with a bringing into awareness of past traumatic material, a confluence of which is currently unfolding in a business relationship that he ventured into with a less than fully developed partner, who was not in compliance with the original agreement that had been established between them and was skirting the issue by casting blame upon my friend. This has been occupying his mind over the past several weeks, and he reached an inner resolution on a course of legal action that he had undertaken to manage the situation. He also noted that there was a lot of work being completed at a deep inner level that was both beyond and beginning to become emergent into his awareness. The opening proceeds in each of us at its own pace and at levels that the ordinary mind can begin to intuit, but cannot fully grasp. He commented some time after the experience. that Â‘presence' was active at a deep level and apparent in the responsiveness of those he is currently working intensely with.
