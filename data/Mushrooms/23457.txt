1:15 a.m. I came down hard and fast. This was, to my knowledge, one of the most enjoyable parts of the experience according to other people. For me, it was coming back down to Earth and gathering my thoughts I had before I ate those shrooms. Shortly after collecting myself, I felt very normal, but with a strange euphoric feeling. It was very satisfying. Trevor seemed to be on the same page and I took quite a liking to his explanation of his trip. I felt a closeness between him and I, and I believe our friendship was made a little stronger after that night. I knew though, that I had been on a voyage that took me far from this normal life and took me to a world that only I know exists. I look forward to exploring these strange new worlds in the near future and hope each one opens my eyes just as well as the world I had just left.
