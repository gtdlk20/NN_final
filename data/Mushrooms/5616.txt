I have never taken mushrooms alone before  except for one disastrous occasion during my naïve teenage years when I was living at home with mum and dad  but the come-up of this trip went a long way in demonstrating to me why doing so can be a fantastic experience. When I later commented on this to A, he agreed that solitary tripping has a lot of advantages: not only does it eradicate social anxiety, but it allows you to lie down, relax and trip for as long as you want with no immediate interruptions.
