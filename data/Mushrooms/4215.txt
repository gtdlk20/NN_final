When I woke up on the day of this experience I took my daily escitalopram prescription of 10 milligrams. I hadnt drank for a few days. I had not eaten any food in at least 6 hours prior to dosing and I think that, even then, Id only had a croissant and a cup of coffee. If I remember correctly, I took this dose sometime between 10:30 and 11:30 PM on either the first or second Saturday of the month. It had been slow at work and Id cut out around 9:30 PM. I went home and consumed all the mushrooms I had left, 5.5 grams. Today I almost always make tea from mushrooms but I cant remember if I did on this occasion. Considering the gastrointestinal discomfort I experienced late in the trip, I think I probably ate them dry. I was alone with the exception of my cat.
