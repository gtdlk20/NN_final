Waves of beauty and harmonic ecstasy crash down upon me. I am pulverised by beauty. Endless, limitless, infinite beauty spinning me through time. I am the words at the building of the the first stone structure. The hewing of basalt. The architecture of the infinite. Dust in the the looking glass. Remnant of the ice ages. Riven with the shame of poison. We are the tip of the spear, the algae in the pond, the moss on the gates of the castle. Into the marked sphere of relevance.
