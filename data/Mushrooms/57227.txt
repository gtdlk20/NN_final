They decided to go to a street Market close to my house. I wasn't sure that I wanted to go, when I already decided that I didn't want to go that sadness struck me again and I changed my mind and decided to go with them. I got inside the car and for a few moments I thought that I was inside a really fun spaceship, with all the sounds, the wind blowing on my face. We arived at the street market and as we walk through it everything sounded alien, I couldn't understand what people were saying, I also had a hard time to know what money meant, as my wife asked me if something was expensive and I wouldn't know the answer. I didn't know what monetary values meant, this also happened on acid. There were a few kids running I thought that they were those ET's that you would see in movies a little green, gray or blue. I saw a few animals meat hanged and it really but really made that street market look even more alien than before.
