I was now immersed in it.  My thoughts were jumping around so fast, and at first I got a little worried, but remembered that the key is to just let go, so I did.  And as I did, everything that happened or any thoughts that may have seemed troubling suddenly became quite hilarious.  In my head, I would keep coming back to a specific idea (this particular one being that I needed to go pee), and then concluded that it was essential to my well being for me to accomplish this task.  I went to the bathroom and saw someone's throw up in the toilet and was surprised that it didn't really disgust me, since it would normally.  As I washed my hands I knew that this was a room of complete wonderment.  There was water flowing all around me, down the walls and the room was emanating an incredible warmth.  I was somehow within the sun.
