  We arrive at our meeting place and decide to all do the lemon tek since we want a relatively quick but intense trip. We all agree to eat 2.5 grams each. We chop it up, put it in lemon juice, let it sit and have conversation for about half an hour and then we consume. This concoction has an overwhelmingly strong taste! The drive there is rather normal but as we pull into the parking lot I see the giant planetarium and a sense of giddy anticipation settles in. And so the night begins! We walk in and get in line to buy the tickets. I immediately notice the vast varieties of people; yet at the same time notice the similarities in everybody. My attention rapidly shifts from one person to another as I wait in line with a sense of curiosity but an uncomfortable odd feeling as well since I dont usually perceive this nuance in my daily life. Its finally my turn to buy the ticket from an attractive girl whose sight comforts me. My friends had already bought their ticket so I join them in the line which leads to the inside of the dome where the lightshow would take place. I take my place in line and as my friends converse amongst themselves I am aware of all the other conversations taking place inside the planetarium and it feels as if my mind is racing/chattering but with the thoughts of others. (Approx. 200 ppl where there)
