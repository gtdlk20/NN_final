Well, after my first grow and drying, I figured I might as well try it (hard work for nothing? I don't think so!) It was a regular day, but I was a little down since I hadn't registered for my fall classes and I had just quit my job, bills were piling up, and well my personal life isn't in the best condition. But I figured what the hell, and tried it anyway (call me stupid if you like) but since I'm pretty experienced with drugs, I thought I could handle it. And the dose was low. And my screensaver is cool. And I have lots of music. And I've read so many experiences it's like I've done it already.
