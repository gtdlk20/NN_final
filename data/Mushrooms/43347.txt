Imagine if you will a two dimensional world. Its inhabitants know two things, left (width) and right (height). They know nothing of the words up or down for they have absolutely no meaning. If a normal 3D person was to pass through this two dimensional world it would seem quite strange to these 2D inhabitants. They would see a cross-section of our bodies as we skimmed through this world. Starting with a very small circle (the top of our head), getting wider until it reached our chest where it would form two circles around an oval (our two arms aside our chest). Eventually it would reach two circles for our legs, then our footprints, and finally nothing as we passed through their world. A four dimensional object would exhibit the same display as it passed through our world. It would appear as a blob of matter with different colors and shapes until it eventually disappeared. Now hereÂ’s how it ties into my visualization.
