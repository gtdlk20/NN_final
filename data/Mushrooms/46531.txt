Saturday night we were to meet at Mark's house just to hang out and have some drinks.  I came right over after work, feeling unusually good.  Upon arriving, Mark, Luke, Stan, and Phil (all very good friends), told me that they had just taken their pills about 15 minutes previous (9:00pm).  I felt surprised, having thought that it was to happen the next night.  There was no pill for me, as I had told them I wouldn't be dosing.
