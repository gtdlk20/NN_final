Then we come out of the wood, there is a boy on the edge, staring at us curiously. It's like I can perceive his questions about us. We start running under the rain, with no care at all. I say: it's just water. When I stop I feel like there is someone behind me, following me, but indeed, no one is there. I tried to cross the street, but I know I could be wrong evaluating the distances of the cars, and their speed. So I wait watching the raindrops making circles on a puddle. Gorgeous. We cross. While we walk I feel a increasing euphoria inside me, I start laughing. The world is just a moving tunnel while I run, then I stop. I am lost. I don't know where on the Earth I am. No idea. Which country or place I'm in. I don't know how I got there, the only thing important is that my girlfriend needed a toilet. Everything around was so colourful (Mexican reality), so you can imagine how deep the perception of colours is. I don't know yet so we stop again. There are other tourists, staring weirdly at us. Maybe because we start laughing like crazy. We try to calm down, but its so hard. There's also a policeman, but we don't care much about it (how fool!). I felt a total junkie and I liked it! Everything was so exciting!
