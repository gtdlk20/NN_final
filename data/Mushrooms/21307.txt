- And after realizing this, that the angel exists in this meeting place so fully all the time, while the channel is only there completely while on powerful psychedelics, or partially in hyper vivid lucid dreams (because like drugs, the sleeping body gives access to the entire emotional subconscious while essentially being debilitated from physically being able to function), then I am the angelÂ’s protector in the physical world, to protect it from complicated systems of our human physical world so that it can continue to exist fully in the meeting place. And after this profound epiphany, every time I the channel, but also as N the sister, looked at the protector, also N the twin brother, I could tell that he knew that I finally discovered the meeting place and who I am (the channel), as if he was waiting patiently for me to discover it for a long time, was always quiet about it, just waiting until I got there when I was ready to get there.
