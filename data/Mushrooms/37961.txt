I got back to the tent at 0500 and actually properly slept until 1000. I awoke feeling fantastic and raring to go, if a little hungry. This was the last day and I was determined to make the most of it, so at 1200 I took another 1mg, reasoning that this would probably come down by 0200 the following day, ready to get a good sleep before coming back home. I also rolled 2 small DMT pinners for the last set of the festival to share with my reunited friends that had been treating me to goodies the night before.
