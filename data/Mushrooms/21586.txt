Here's the unusual part where my mind starts fuckin with me. So I'm lyin there and after a while of not knowing what's goin on and forgetting that period of time, I started hearing people outside who were yelling really violently (or maybe it was just the shrooms, I dunno, but it is toronto, always crap goin on), and to me the shrooms made it sound like it was the voices of my family members fuckin yellin at me like more pissed than I've ever heard them. I know I live far away from toronto, but I was convinced it was them cuz of the state I was in. Strangely enough, I got up, looked outside, and actually said 'I gotta go out there' (to deal with the yelling) and I was gonna do it but my friends told me not to. I started thinking I wasn't actually there where I was, that I had gotten too fucked and done something really really horrible and couldn't remember it. So lying down again, it felt like I could barely move at all it felt like I could barely move at all, I don't know if this is normal for shrooms. I was hearing car alarms and lotsa sirens from outside, and it made me think this horrible thing I thought I'd done involved me stealing a car and crashing it while killing people, being the reason why I'm on the ground and can't move and I'm hearin all these sirens and people freakin out. It was all in my head, it was nuts. These sounds were really amplified to me so it seemed like everything was goin on right around me.
