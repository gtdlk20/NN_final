Basically, the peak lasted about 30 seconds -- I sat down in a less crowded/hot area of the club, I felt like I was reeling, and then my entire field of vision was overlaid with little lower-case S's -- a shuddering, intense hallucination.  I staggered to the bathroom, thinking I might (or might want to) vomit.
