Thats all I can really say.  I've taken them a couple of times since, but kind of moved away from these experiences as I left my twenties. Now in my 30's, and with a hole in my life, the old spirit is rising again.  I look 4ward to this september, and natures bounty. Its time to go back, the synchronicities have been enough to make a sceptic like me believe they're trying to get in touch.  I reckon they have something to show me.
