As soon as I emerged through the trailer door, I was awestruck. The mushrooms had really kicked into full swing, and it was like stepping through the portal into a brave new wonderland of untold treasure and infinite possibility. Do you remember the scene from Hook when Robin Williams awakes from a stupor to find himself inexplicably in Neverland? I imagine he felt the same way I did when I embarked onto brand new terrain, except I was less fearful and had bigger pupils.
