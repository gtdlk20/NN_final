I am lost. I am not Iost. I am nothingness floating through the inner void. This formless chaos of existential beauty lifting and lulling, rolling  and whorling. This is Kantian mindscape. Glades of everprescence. Voluminous waves of orgasmic beauty lost in the teleological splinterings of the heavenly void.
