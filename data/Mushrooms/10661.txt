I got a piece of bread, drowned it in peanut butter, sprinkled on just over 2 grams of chopped dry mushrooms, folded it in half, and ate it with a glass of some very crappy lemonade. It was at 4:30am. My mother was asleep in her room in our tiny apartment. It was only about 15 minutes into the movie (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas).
