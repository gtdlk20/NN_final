..Whoa, was pretty much all I could say to sum up my trip.  We retired to bed soon after, but then a couple of our friends came in our room to ask us about our spiritual journeys.  We explained to them as best we could, and I was made fun of when trying to explain the loss of my senses of identity and gender.  So youre sure youre not gay? I was asked, are you coming out right now?  We all laughed and joked about it, but it was an experience that I will never forget.
