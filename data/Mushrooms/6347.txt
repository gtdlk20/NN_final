Steven D. is up at [ ] Street calling me to come to him. Steven is my age; five and a half. As I approach things go dizzy. Steven is pointing down at something. It doesnt make sense at first and it takes me a while but then I begin to understand. Its a dead squirrel; head crushed by a car. My first encounter with DEATH!
