    Once outside, we walk towards the car and as I take in a deep breath of air I have this Solid sense of self. An indestructible I.  We get in the car. As the car ride home progresses, I grab my phone and begin to google Albert Einstein, Special Relativity, Quantum Physics, Consciousness I am in my own world reading about Einstein and start understanding his theories with more clarity than ever before. I begin to pretend what it must have felt like to be him during his moments of revelation. I look outside the window and understand my point of view is my own, my own relative universe. EUREKA! The world is an interactive museum of matter with individuals experiencing their place in space with their pattern of movement and stream of consciousness relative to the world dictating what we deem our Lives and experience of Time. Of course, I could be mistaken and this epiphany will require further inquiry. But at the moment it was beautiful. One other peculiar moment which I will never forget is while driving along, I had the window seat in the back and I had just finished reading the biography of Albert Einstein and put my phone in my pocket. The whole time, my buddy next to me was talking to his girlfriend so he was not aware of what I was doing. Then suddenly for some strange reason I look out the window and see a chubby, white-haired white-bearded homeless man sitting on trash bags. I then wonder what it must be like to experience the world from his viewpoint. THEN, as we slowly pass by him, my friend apparently sees him also and exclaims Haha that guy looks like Einstein What an intriguing coincidence.
