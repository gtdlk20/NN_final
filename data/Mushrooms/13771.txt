T+8:30: I closed my eyes and felt myself travelling through time and space. I felt that my thoughts transended any language. I had the epiphany that my thoughts were transcending reason, I realized that it was in fact possible for something defying any reason, logic, or possiblity of any, even other worldly, explaination could be factually and valid. I called the spot that I found in the woods the Time Rift. Eventually one of my friends came looking for me and brought me back to the others.
