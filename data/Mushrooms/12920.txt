I opened my eyes, but I was no longer in the apartment. Now I was crucified on a cross, floating face down above sand dunes. I thought I was Jesus.  Some one call the Enquirer, weve got Jesus passed out dead on the floor over here, I heard Fat Chads voice from the other side. It sounded like he was talking through a fan at the end of a tunnel. His words brought me back to reality.  I jumped up off the floor and was happy to see I was still alive. Duddey sat in the same position before, in his own little world. Fat Chad glared at me with a smirk. John strummed an acoustic guitar. I still felt like I was going to die. I knew what I had to do. I ran into the kitchen and began to take down glasses of water from the tap. It tasted like dirt. I drank the water until I felt completely bloated. Then I rushed into the bathroom. It was also illuminated by candle light.  I dont want to die here, like this. I better call my parents. No! Im fine, Ill do it. Call an ambulance. No. Ill be okay. How many trampolines are there in China? Terrible vibrations are all around. Dont teach an new dog old tricks, it could get brain cancer. Excursions. Toilet. Death. Onyx stalagmites are splendidly attractive. Ohh shit my coat has run away. My dear Giligan, tell those clowns they need to get out of Mayberry. Lights, please stop flashing. Ohh god ohh god Im going to die.
