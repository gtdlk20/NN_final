I wanted to write this trip report because when I researched trip reports on 1g of mushrooms (psilocybe cubensis) I found absolutely nothing. But IÂ’ll start this off by saying that I had a really bad trip a couple months ago that I thought would scare me away from psychedelics forever. I learned to deal with what I saw through daily meditation and weekly therapy. I had a brush with what I whole-heartedly believed was schizophrenia but I later learned was symptoms of loss of ego and slight HPPD. I chose to take 1g because I was trip sitting someone else and it was their first time tripping. I took it with them to make them feel comfortable but instead got way farther than I expected and had my own experience as well.
