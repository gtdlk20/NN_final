30 min. after consumption:  BLG eaters giggleing.  I was releaved that the classic pre-trip symptoms were kicking in (correct identification), because if we didn't trip, who knows what the hell we ate!  Shifty perifial vision, slight nausua, increased noise perception, slight visual distortion.  The virgin was running around asking 'why does everything look so weird?  Why is the stream so loud? ;)
