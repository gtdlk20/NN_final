Kate started to repeat that she didnt like this and wanted it to stop. She was going into a full blown bad trip trying to fight it off and this was my doing. I had always been able to control the trip on my prior doses and told her before we tripped that it was all mental. So she tried unsuccessfully to fight it off which made her more anxious. She began rubbing her hands on her thighs and even slapped herself to get out of it. She started begging Adam and Jen to call a friend of theirs who was a doctor for help. I knew what the answer would be even in my state; you just have to wait it out. I tried to get Kate to relax and stop fighting and go with the trip but there was no way to get this to happen. She became afraid she was going to die or that someone would find her high and take the kids away, or that something would happen to the kids and we wouldnt be able to help them, basically every major fear a parent has was amplified by the shrooms, and no amount of talk could convince her otherwise.
