I eventually collapsed to the floor and entered hell.  I knew that I was suffering eternally, and that was what hell was - eternal damnation.  It was the worst terror in my life by far.  Eventually I realized that I could get up.  I raised up off the cubicle and saw people next to me.  I was not sure at that point what was real and what was not.  They said my friends had left a little while ago.  I left and found them.  Strangely, after 3 hours of the worst trip of my life, I was completely sober.  I found out a week later that my friend's scales were off by two grams and that I had eaten 7 instead of 5 g of shrooms.
