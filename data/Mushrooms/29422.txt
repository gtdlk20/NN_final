I felt like everything in the world was a machine I had set in motion. I could interact with it, and it was very interesting, and it was all me. People were not necessarily real, just other puppets I had made out of myself. If I concentrated I could affect it, but mostly it just ran on its own, doing interesting things to keep me engaged.
