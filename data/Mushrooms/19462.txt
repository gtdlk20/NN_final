I then looked to the sky and I saw the stars melting downwards.  They were very pretty and I asked one for its permission to hold it.  I then reached up ito the sky and pulled it down to talk to it.  I played with it for a moment and then let it snap back into position as though rubber attached it to the sky.  Then the stars took me over, I battled them.  They captured me and all that I can say was that I was locked into their gaze with this orgasmic like feeling all through my body.  I know that I was moaning very loudly as it felt amazing.  When I finally accepted the stars into me I saw the face that was in the stars.  Later I associated this face with god, but not until later.  At this point I was just communicating with it through my mind.  My ex's friend had grown cold (she had eaten maybe a half of an eighth) and she had my ex walk back to the car with her.  I knew that I was losing my mind and that I was on the verge of not being able to make rational decisions, so I voted to follow them as Julia, my ex's friend, had thoughts of real things like cold which I could only understand that I could not understand.  She seemed still sane to me. My friend, Ian, was in the bushes raving about how we were all fucking idiots and we could not leave it behind.  I somehow convinced him to come with me, I think because he cared about me and knew that I was too scared to stay without the sane one, Julia.  I went to them and just sat under a streetlight with my ex thinking and telling Julia that she was sane and I didn't want her to leave or we would be lost.  She decided to walk home, about three blocks, and then we were lost.
