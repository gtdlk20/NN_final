All in the same mind set, we decided to stumble into the house and partake in the pop rocks we had purchased earlier. It was simply amazing, It felt as though my mouth was a volcano, my tongue felt numb but the top of my mouth was exploding. I then said 'ITS STARWARRRRRRS IN MY MOUTH' this was a mistake, because the peak of the trip seemed to hit everyone at once. I looked at Datsun's face and his sideburns turned purple, I just said 'wow...' and trailed off. Datsun tried to utter a 'you fucking idiot' but it sounded more like 'Joo Trucking IDOT!' this made Seattle go wide eyed in expression, he ran to his room and crouched over an empty box of ritz crackers and started dry heaving. We all heard him horking from the other room and we started to panic. I layed down on the ground and closed my eyes, and the visuals suddenly hit me like a cosmic truck full of, well... Psilocybin. The colors swirled around each other and danced. I could ACTUALLY see buddah with a spinning star around his head and a swirling vortex of a background. But wait... I was being sucked into the vortex. I felt a chilly wind on the back of my head. Although I was laying on my back. And was squeezed through the little hole in the middle of the vortex. Buddah seemed to be inviting me into his land. I entered the vortex and entered a room in my consciousness. Confusion overtook me as swirling patterns convulsed all over the hundreds of walls. The sun rose behind my eyes, I saw myself as an old man. I saw so many unbelievable things. I had kind of broken through the tension of the come up and broken into an ego loss state. This continued for an eternity.
