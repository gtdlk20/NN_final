I had a bad habit, being inside my tube as I was, of floating off forcing people to come fetch me. Eventually I floated off so far that neither they nor I knew where I was. The trip was pretty much in full effect by this point, I have to say it was one of the strongest I've had. Things no longer mattered, whatever I did didn't seem like it would have any implications on the world, therefore nothing was real. It was kind of like being in a video game, in the sense that I felt no obligations to behave or respond to people.
