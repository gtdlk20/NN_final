Mushrooms make me have to pee quite frequently (does anyone else get this?) and during one of my trips to the bathroom I really understood how hard I was tripping. My self-identity had not withstood such a beating in years, and it seemed as though I was trapped on a downward spiral. When I emerged from the bathroom things became worse. Muse was sitting on my bed crying. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me that she was scared for me. She thought I was going crazy and she didnÂ’t know what to do.
