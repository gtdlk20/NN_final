I'm not sure what that force or being would be, but I could sense something there. It could've been some instinctual feeling, some 'one with the universe' thing. I felt totally merged with the flow of not just my home world, but planes I have walked. I was just another jagged turn in a fractal pattern, another crest in an endless wave. Another wellspring of thoughts, of consciousness contemplating itself. A face that blends with an infinite amount of other faces to make up the whole oneness of whatever we are, whatever the Universe is, whatever consciousness is. Nothing else mattered.
