I went to sleep around midnight. The trip was getting exhausting, even though the effects of trippiness were declining. I had also gotten up at 6 in the morning that day, so I was physically exhausted, too. Then a strange thing happened. Even though the effects were going away, I was experiencing visuals again, and at a certain point some nightmareish stuff came in my mind: thoughts of death, images of old and crippled china dolls appeared and as things go with bad trips a veil of death and darkness covered reality. I got up and had a large meal and a vitamin drink (Vitamin C is said to help gain control again). I went to sleep and got up with a very soft head ache and a slight feeling of being depressed. The other day I was OK and the conclusions I had reached from my thinking were integrated assertively in my personality. So, Im very satisfied with the episode of subconscious rubbish clean up therapy. It was all by myself and I made it by myself. I feel stronger, now, and empowered. I dont know if this is an effect you can actually look up, but in my case I cleaned out my closet and all is well now. Maybe it turns out differently for you. Also observe that there was no giggly part. It was all pretty serious.
