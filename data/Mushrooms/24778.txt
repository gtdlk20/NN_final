Three friends and I took a trip to the Grand Canyon.  We had under a half ounce of shrooms and quite alot of cannabis.  We were constantly getting stoned during the car ride, and while on our way to the Canyon we split up the shrooms between the four of us.  It was quite intense.  As with all of my psychedelic experiences, I believe the sight changed my life.  The masses of land and hills seemed to bob around and move, as if they were purposely trying to mesmerize me.  I'm somewhat disappointed in some of my sober friends, however, because I'm sure I was acting like a lunatic by getting so close to the edge of the cliffs.  It felt like the Canyon wanted to suck me in.  *note, I should always have a sitter when experimenting with shrooms.
