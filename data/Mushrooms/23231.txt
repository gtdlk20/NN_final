To introduce myself, I am a white male, age 17, and my previous drug experience include AMT, DPT, DXM, 2ct2, marijuana, xanax, alcohol, caffeine , nicotine, bzp, 5meodipt, 5meodmt, salvia, ether, kava, adderall, ritalin, and a few other substances I can't quite remember at the moment. This was my first trip with psilocybin mushrooms. I've had pretty positive experiences with psychedelics prior. 2 previous unpleasant trips had occured, both on AMT, during a time of great stress in my life, having problems with former gf, etc. I'm not a particularly spiritual person in the traditional sense and consider myself an atheist. I use psychedelics for the purposes of gaining insight into myself and my reality and for general recreation. I've been diagnosed with 3 mental illnesses which I don't believe to be accurate: Bipolar Disorder, ADHD, and minor OCD.
