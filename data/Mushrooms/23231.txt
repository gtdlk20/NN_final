The police carried my writhing body down the stairs and out of the house, onto the street and into an ambulance. They put me on a stretcher and I was terrified and out of touch with reality, they might have given me a sedative I don't recall. All I could do was take in my surroundings and feel anguish. I have no idea why I thought all of these awful things, but in my head I believed them. I entered the hospital where within moments I saw a nurse. I looked right at her and said something so horrible I regret it to this day. I figured she was there to torment me for the mistakes I made in life. Once in the hospital bed, I have vague memories of them attempting to use medical equipment on me and I flipped out. The nurses left the room save for one. She tried to put heart monitor patches on my body but I slapped her in the face. I saw a cop watching me from outside in the hall and made crude gestures at him, I couldn't think rationally. He walked away ashamed for me. My mother came in several minutes later after they sedated me and hit me again after I was babbling about something. I just recall her telling me the world did not end. The trip was beginning to lessen and the sedatives calmed me down. When I realized what I had just done, it was hard to balance the relief that came with me being alive, but also having to live with myself after what I had done. It was a silent car ride home.
