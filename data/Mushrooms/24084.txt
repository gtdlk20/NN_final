I got up and started towards the kitchen to retreive some cheetos..in order for you to get to my kitchen you must pass by the christmas tree, and when I saw that damned thing, I hadnt the foggiest notion what I was looking at - The lights were swirling and the tree was bending down at me. I particularly remember the sweet smell of pine (I love that smell) however I then realize our tree does not have a scent at all. As soon as I realize this the smell is gone.
