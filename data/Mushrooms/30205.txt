Let me just say that this one experience, was life changing and changed the way I thought about everything from that day forth. For the people who want to know about religious and spiritual experiences, this is one of my first, and after the initial anxiety it was very very intense and good. I believe my state of mind at the beginning of the night was one of the deciding factors on the possibility of a bad trip. It was a good day and I was in positive spirits before taking the mushrooms. And if I had not been in a good mood, this could have been a very disastrous experience for my mind to go through.
