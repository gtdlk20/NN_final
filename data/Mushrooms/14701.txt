I left my bike behind after getting off this bench and wandering around a bit. Some random person walked by and I ran right up to him. From this point on everyone I spoke to either thought I was fucking insane or I mind fucked them into believing what I was believing because people were actually listening to my conversation and contributing and agreeing that nothing really mattered and everything is a circle. This person seemed very entertained but very tired so I left him to sit with two guys eating pizza after about 5-10 mins. These, guys, I think I seriously mindfucked. I convinced them that time is an illusion and nothing we did that night will matter because everything has already happened and looped on forever. We do have free will and I can choose to move my right arm right now but the loop still exists. Time does not exist, I might not even exist, I might have lived this moment more times than is possible to count, but, it doesnÂ’t really matter.
