I could actually see across all of my vision these very intricate patterns of lines and circles. It wasnt moving, but it was always there and would sometimes turn fully 3 dimensional and pop out of a wall or the floor, or out of K's face. A really REALLY cool effect, as he was smiling at the time. When I would close my eyes, which I didnt do much because Im sure people would think I was wigging out or something, but when I did the visuals were intense. At certain points I cant remember what I saw, but once, right after seeing the amazing double-visioned patterns, I closed my eyes and all I saw were circles flying through my vision, some colored, some not, leaving tracers of other circles in their wake. I wish I would have been alone for that; I could have stared at those for hours.
