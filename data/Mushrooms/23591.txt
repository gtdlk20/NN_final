	Well, after many hours of extreme fun and excitement and an incident involving a talking Bengal tiger made of galaxies, the visual effects began to diminish, and the sun began to rise.  We all gathered again, climbed the stairs back to the city, and took the long bus ride home to normal reality.  This was by far one of the best nights of my life and something that has changed my awareness significantly for the better.  If that is illegal than arrest me, but IÂ’ll never forget that experience.
