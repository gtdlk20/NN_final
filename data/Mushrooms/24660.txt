During this time my other frined K was playing the stariway to heaven backwards on an acoustic guitar. I was amazed and humbled by the site. It was too cold to go out side (which was not good because if I start to get trip anxiety I like to go outside) so we stayed in. We went into R's room again, I looked at the ceailing and I saw it covered in intensly colored pink, baby blue, white, and black paisly. It pulsated and wouldnt go away even if I tried. Among all this were what seemed to be eyes in front of my face that would follow  if I turned my head. If I closed my eyes I would see colors kelidescoping out of control too intricate to comprehend.
