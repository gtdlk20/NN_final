The mushrooms finally realized that I was not listening to a word they were saying. Instead of continuing, they called upon my soul and transported my consciousness further inside of myself. I opened my eyes to find myself sobbing in fetal position inside of a tent. A beautiful woman dressed in warm animal skins entered the tent, and introduced herself to me, explaining that she had been expecting me. She soon came to the understanding that I would be entirely unresponsive. She took my hand, helped me to my feet, wiped my tears, and led me out of the tent. Behind the tent, a ways off, was a series of campfires and tents. She explained that those tents belonged to her tribe, but as a shaman she chose to live slightly apart from the rest of her tribe to focus on her spirituality and connection to the earth. She began walking, leading me hand in hand away from the tent and deep into the surrounding brush. There was snow on the ground, and there was ice covering all of the nearby shrubbery and the occasional tree, as if an ice storm had just struck before my arrival. She spoke to me of our shared purpose as we walked, telling me how we are on this earth to raise the spiritual awareness of our fellow humans and aid them in full self-realization. She told me how to best aid our own endeavor, by studying the powers of spiritual healing and using our abilities to heal the spiritual and physical wounds of others, and that along the way we would find kindred spirits who needed the healing to realize themselves and understand their own distinct purposes in their lifetimes. She fell quiet for some time, until we stopped on the edge of the brush before a clearing. She told me to listen and feel very carefully, for what I was about to understand would be forever life-changing.
