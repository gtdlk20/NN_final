Some positive changes I've noticed from that trip (and psychedelics in general) is I find my self much more open and compassionate. I no longer care about the competetive games many of us play in our social lives, careers, and society in general. I have a much deeper appreciation for nature. Before that trip I was a unhealthy, repressed, depressed, insecure, confused Christian who had not yet to learn how to truly enjoy life.
