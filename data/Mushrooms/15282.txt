I am always eager to try new things, sort of. Anything drug related IÂ’m willing to give a shot on the condition the positives are better than the negatives. I had been reading up on mushrooms and psychedelics for quite a while, eager to try them. My friend H had gotten a 10g sack of shrooms he was planning on taking during Marley Fest 2009. I and four other of my friends decided to do the same.
