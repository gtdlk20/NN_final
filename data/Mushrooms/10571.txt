By the time I got back to Josh's room, I could already feel something which wasn't quite right in me. Josh was feeling the same way. He put on headphones and listened to my Nine Inch Nails CD, but he took the headphones off about a minute later, complaining that the music made him feel nauseous. I began to notice the nausea too, but it wasn't very bad, so I just ignored it. As we decided to turn on the TV, the trip began.
