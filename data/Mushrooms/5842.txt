After about an hour I just seemed to relax completely in to the big black leather armchair I was sitting in, comfortably numb and drowsy. The other two where like cut-out figures to my left and right, I was unable to talk or relate to any conversation for some time and any attempt interact ended before it had started with manic giggling. This seemed to be affecting Kelly as well while Chris in his camping chair slipped in to silence. It felt like the trip was coming in waves, each stronger than the last, each taking me to a new unexplored level. I tried to relax, avoid panic and let the waves wash over me. For the best experience I find it is best to stay calm and still and meditate while coming up.
