My sober roommate was watching Any Given Sunday on the TV so we decided to watch that for a little while.  I was getting very good visuals and Al Pacino was a fucking hoot to watch,  He was talking out of his eyes.  Not where his eyes would normally be, but where his mouth was, he had eyes there, and they were talking.  Fucking funny shit.  We also had a ferret to play with which was very cool, he felt as if he were made out of Jell-O, but furry and soft.
