At 10:45PM, not being able to wait any longer, I decided to begin eating the Copelandia Cysancens that lay strewn before me. Two mouthfuls and five consecutive minutes of chewing later, I decided to take a shower in order to both kill time and blow off the day's steam. As I was walking to the shower, it was with a slight chill down my back that I realized the effects had begun. I felt slightly out of place and energetic in the extreme, and felt midly dizzy. After my ten minute shower, these effects became more pronounced, and although the speed of the onset had caught me by surprise, it was nothing compared to what was about to happen next.
