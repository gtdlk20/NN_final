The other people in the house became so frightened by this raging bull of a wasted human that they called 911.  I was woken by a New York State Trooper at 4:37AM in my car.  Everything had seemed hazy but I looked around and saw that there were 10 police cars, two ambulances, and a fire truck, which I thought was absolutly absurd.  But apperently it wasn't that absurd because it required 6 men to restrain raging demon insde the house, and they promptly shackled him to a strecher and rushed him off to the hospital, where he fell asleep than woke up at 8:30Am and was fine.
