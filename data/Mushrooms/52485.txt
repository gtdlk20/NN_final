20 minutes and a joint later after a bit of meandering we packed a little bag and headed out to the stretched out cotton fields behind my friend's house. This is when the mushrooms really started to kick in. The mushrooms were beginning to take some effect during our walk past the horse stables toward the fields. The next thing i know it was raining! Out of the middle of sunshine it just exploded leaving us nothing to do but run for cover. We made to an isle of trees that seperated the fields and nestled into a comfortable dry spot. Then just as soon as it started, the rain stopped and the the sun bursted out into our faces like a door opening in the sky. This is when we really fell out of reality.
