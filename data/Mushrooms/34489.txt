I was very experienced with mushrooms and LSD or at least I thought I was. One year, I grew mushrooms from an easy grow kit I purchased. I had some knowledge of cultivation, so I was able to extend the growth cycle and probably increase my yield by about 6 times. Unfortunately my crops finally did succumb to contaminants. Well, one night, I was sitting at the computer browsing the web and watching TV while consuming beer. I had a 3-day weekend, so I decided that I would take a very strong trip.
