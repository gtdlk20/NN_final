I considered the spark of energy and attraction I sometimes feel between myself and one of the women at work. I had had a vivid dream recently in which we had expressed love towards each other, with the true feeling of falling in love again, exchanging a passionate emotionally explosive kiss, only to be upset to wake and find it all to be a dream.
