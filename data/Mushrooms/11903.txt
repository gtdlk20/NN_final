I walked to the second floor of our house (the basement held the TV room) and entered a W's room.  He had some rave and trance music blaring over some speakers which I considered most unenjoyable, he told me to sit down and proceeded to take a glow-stick and swirl it around in quick motions in the darkness, I was uninterested.  I staggered out onto the balcony with W and we began to discuss something that was occupying my mind.
