I had not eaten since noon and it was about 6:45pm. I planned for a 7 oÂ’clock departure. As I laid it out on the plate it seemed like a lot and I was somewhat uneasy about how this might go. Each time a trip I go through a ritual of self-evaluation and kind of mind cleansing or purge in order to get ready for whatever might come. I take each trip very seriously and I try to clear my head and resolve myself to deal with whatever comes my way.
