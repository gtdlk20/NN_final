6:20: starting to notice the invidual phosphors on the computer screen. Seeing more pixelation in the on-screen images. Feel like it's reminding me that what I'm looking at is only an illusion but I'm cool with that. Illusions are part of life too. The spaces between the paragraphs seem significant, maybe lighter in color than the blank spaces in the paragraphs themselves. Colors running together and all that, I'm sure it's an optical illusion.
