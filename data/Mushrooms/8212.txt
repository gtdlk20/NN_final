If I were to plot my P. Cubensis experience on a graph and then combine all other P. Cubensis experiences by all other consciences we are left with a kind or 'meta-object' (like the cone above).  And from the vantage point of this object it contains an almost countless number of experiences.  At the time I could only explain this object as 'the mushroom' and the term seemed clumsy and ineffective.  My experience of it was that of something incredibly ancient, something like a database of experiences and I had found a way to look down its corridors and open its doors.
