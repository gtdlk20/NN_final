I knew exactly what shit the voice was talking about. There was a lot of shit. I felt a feeling of what it might be like to not do ANY of the shit that saps me of my mental and emotional and physical energy. The drunken rage and violence. The hungover in bed all day regret. The up all night seething with silent resentment. The empty, habitual, narcissistic, mindless time-wasting and procrastinating. The unattended health issues. The secrets and the lies and the keeping up appearances. The things said and done that cant be taken back. I felt what it might be like to be free of all of that and actually live a fully genuine life, accepting of others and accepting of myself. It might have been the most sane and whole and true and at peace Ive felt in my entire life. I was happy.
