We stopped at W's friend's house at T+00:45 and told her we were shrooming.  She (D) knew exactly what to do--she went back inside and retrieved her rave lights, and the four of us walked across the street to entertain ourselves while the shrooms began to do their magic.  D, who had tripped before, told us what to expect in our trip, such as some incoherency, directional stupidity, short attention span, and nausea.  We all watched, fascinated, as she spun her lights about and made beautiful patterns and orbs with her photons.  I began to see more pronounced tracers from her lights, and couldn't help but say 'whoa' and 'wow' as the sight became more and more trippy.  For the first time I felt that I understood the art of light shows, and felt compelled to join in with a pair of finger lights I had in my pockets.  I twisted and turned my hands and wrists in ways I might not have thought to do under normal circumstances, and the lights stayed in my vision for many seconds after I would stop moving them.
