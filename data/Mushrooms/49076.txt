After a half hour of watching cartoons I still hadn't felt anything. Inwardly, I was very disappointed. I was worried that we had been ripped off or that I didn't get enough mush. T said he wasn't feeling anything either, and not to worry. I decided to have a shower and left T sitting on the couch.
