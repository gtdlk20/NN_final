I opened Quake 3 and went on a freeze tag server. I was fighting a whole bunch of monsters and the computer screen was glowing brightly, looking like it was a floating portal. It seemed as if this was another dimension, into the 'un-realistic world'. The person I was controlling, seemed like someone I was trying to control away from the people chasing him. I was trying to protect him. I ran but wouldn't keep attention, for at least 2 hours I was doing this. Until I noticed it was almost 2 am. The trip was coming down. I had regained a normal state of mind with mild visuals(Mist mainly). My body felt weird and I was happy with the experience. Since this I have treasured the mushroom as a delicacy.
