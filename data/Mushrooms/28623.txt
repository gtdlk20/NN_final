Wow.  Total mind blowing experience.  I still haven't gotten buzzed on DMT yet because there is a part of me that's still a tiny bit scared that it's true and that once I blast off that I leave the world behind me forever.  Research tells me otherwise and tells me I am sure to survive it, but it just seemed so real and was so freaky that it has been impossible to completely dismiss the idea of this world only being an illusion, especially with somewhat recent evidence that seems to show that we could be living in a 'hologram'.  More of a 2 or 2.5 dimensional world than a true three dimensional.
