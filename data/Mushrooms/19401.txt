The set: I had had my mushrooms sitting around for a while in my house waiting for an appropriate time to take a dose. I had already experienced a low 2g dose with my partner and experienced some mind blowing connection, love, empathy and of course sex and since had been waiting for my tolerance to drop back down and try a more intense heroic dose. I have previously tried a maximum of 9g tampensis, however these were cubensis, and noticeably more potent. I usually find many similarities between mushrooms and MDMA, a lot more so then LSD and they often leave me with the same afterglow, same euphoria and same sociability + psychedelic soup of confusion, I like to refer to as mushed.
