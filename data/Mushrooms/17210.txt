I've been using drugs since the age of 16. I stopped a year later because my best friend's little sister died and I was afraid I was going to think about her while tripping. My best friend and I started off with meth en MDMA. Since both of our parents are drug addicts, it was extremely easy to get the stuff. Later on we tried coke and shrooms. To this day, I'm a daily marijuana smoker and I drink almost daily too.
