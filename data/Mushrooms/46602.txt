T+20...I'm in an elevator going up very fast, but I can still move around. Suddenly I hear myself repeatedly saying, 'Ohhh man...Ohhh man...You don't even know... Ohh man...Wait till you feel this...' I am almost out of breath trying to convey this nonsense to him. P is hysterical at this. He's actually on the ground laughing, while I continue to feel more and more light-headed. P's fit of laughter would be the theme of the night.
