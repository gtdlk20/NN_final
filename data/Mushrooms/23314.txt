Someone phoned a while ago, it turns out it was a friend of mine. The phone is an amazing tool, he is far far away, yet right beside me. I try to talk to him, but every word I say is influencing my reality, if I ask him to talk slowly, I start slowing down and so forth. He tells me to phone him back, he doesnt have many minutes left. This seems very important. It is probably because it means whatever I imagine it to mean.  He says I have to ask for his room number, hes in a hotel out of town. (The plot thickens.) Then he hangs up. I phone and politely ask to be put through to my friends room. Of Course, he says. These two words embody far more meaning then I can write out. His tone is interpreted now with every scenario I can imagine. Of Course is a bouncers snarled reply to my query over entry to a pub. Of Course is a waiter smiling grandly, as I ask for a glass of champagne from his tray. Of Course is a friend doing me a favour without asking for one in turn. That is all the weight attached to words right there.
