Now it is almost 2 weeks later and I am either still slightly tripping or having flashbacks.  I noticed yesterday when I was extremely tired and I was looking at this textured ceiling that it was swirling and moving a lot.  It is hard to concentrate on things without spacing out.  This doesn't happen too often, but it is kind of weird.  I loved my experience with mushrooms and it really changed me in a way. Before, I used to litter and disrespect the environment, but now I think twice about it and have some respect.  Mushrooms are great if you do the right amount, but just like many other drugs, I've heard of some scary trips by people who've taken too much (like my boyfriend).  It's definitely my drug of choice, and even though I also love Ecstasy, last time I did it all I could think about were the wonderful mushrooms :) So eat up, and enjoy!
