Then I was typing on my keyboard and all the keys stretched out! They reminded me of an army marching around. Then I went and layed back down by the heater and my foot melted into the door and I saw a boat sticking out of my ceiling! So I went and layed back down and just had crazy thoughts. Going to different planets, falling through my bed and stuff like that. I then opened my eyes and my room was only 2 dimensional! CRAZY! I didnt know how it was working like that. I couldnt understand why I was stuck in such a small place. That seemed to had lasted 20 minutes but when I looked at the clock, not a minute had passed. After that I looked at pictures on my wall and they spun around eachother. Things seemed to move out of place alot that night.
