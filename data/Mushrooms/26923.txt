'The alien invasion is the mushroom,' He goes on, 'I invade to you and with you.  I am more invasive than any other biological organism or weed.  I am consciously invasive.  I invade your consciousness.  I invade what humans call reality and am very open about it.  I am good; I do not come to harm you, but to evolve you.  I am evolution.  When we talk we talk in thought.  You, as a species, are stuck without me.  You face the ultimate, extinction.  You are stupid; you just think you are smart just as every stupid creature does [I agree].  I am here.  I am your consciousness.  You can choose to speak to me or you can choose not.  Evil deceives, you are warned, evil IS among you [as a species].'  That is verbatim.
