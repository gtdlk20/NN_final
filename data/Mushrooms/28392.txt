We decided to trip in our dorm room since we guessed that weÂ’d probably be too incapacitated to go outside; we turned out to be right.  We ground up the shrooms as finely as we could and let them sit in lime juice for about 15 minutes.  We proceeded to choke it all down (the mixture tastes far worse than dry shrooms) and waited to blast off while playing video games and listening to music.
