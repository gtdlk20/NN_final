A cluster of infinite strings all parallel to one another and extending in both directions to infinitely are vibrating each to its own frequency. One linear string resonates the other in a harmonic exchange, creating a powerful and all encompassing cosmic song.  Im part of this song, riding an energy crest along my own harmonic string. The song sings of intangible geometric shapes, densities, magnitudes and mathematical equivalencies each string sharing all its information with one another in a song that has no beginning. I am one such energy string, disembodied, without substance vibrating in perfect harmony. with no perception of time or space no sensation of awareness, just.....  ALL!
