One Friday night about 11:00pm I got a call from a good friend saying he had some 'dank shrooms,' so I ventured out and purchased a few. My plan was to eat them the following night (sat) and I was indeed excited. Having eaten shrooms before, I figured I would have a blast. Saturday morning rolls around and I decided that today, 'I must fast,' so no eating the entire day and only drinking water. I believe this prepares me for the 'big trip' and makes it more intense.
