The DMT desire during the trip goes to show that I was looking for something much more intense. My first trip on shrooms was without doubt the best most incredible experience I have ever met. With a marvelous setting and all, the revelatory content was extremely high. I saw myself as virtually nothing in the whole universe and the tremendous unity with all of it - this on the other hand brought the greatest euphoria I have ever felt and was carried on for many months to come. It totally blasted my life at that time. In comparison, the third trip was nothing and very superficial. Ei who had a first-time experience in mind-expansion was totally bewildered and had a truly good trip. It goes to show, that doses do not necessarily have to be large and effects are highly individual dependent. The trip was very visual-free which again subsided the euphoric side to everything. Visuals were more like square pixels forming figures, which I thought were not very interesting. Again the first trip had been swarming with color and spirals with a great intensity.
