We smoked couple of small bongfuls of these (maybe 2 grams per head), and then decided to take a little time to listen to FSOL's ISDN and Isaku Sakaros Ohm.. Nice.. Both very nice for this ultralight-paragliding of the conciousness. Both are of very high fidelity with large hall and space-echoes even when sober, and my stereos are also very HiFi, so almost immediately I was swept along into the spaces and places in the music - every detail and overall perception of music was of very hig resolution. I was on the verge of literally tripping - nice visuals.
