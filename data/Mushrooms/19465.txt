I had already begun talking the vitamin C bottle and communicating with it.  It kept telling me to eat them so I was sucking them down one after another.  I finished off half of a very big bottle quite easily.  Approaching Tiff's side I realized that I needed help, why I don't know.  They had to open the door for me, though, because I could not figure it out, what it was.  They opened it and I still didn't know if I wanted to get in or not.  What followed was a ravingly lunatic conversation consisting mostly of the word 'fuck.'  I was yelling at my best friend because he would yell at me to get in the fucking car and I would almost decide to when I would yell at him to shut up and he would.  Then he would turn and yell again and betray me so I always ended up walking away and talking to the stars again.
