It was May 5, 2018 the weather was suppose to be around 23 degrees Celsius and sunny all day. I set out at around 3pm to go pick up my friends Mitch and Justin. I realized we were a running a little late on schedule but Mitch and I had been sitting on these shrooms for months now waiting for a nice day to do them. My friend Justin was a last minute addition to our party. I had mentioned to him that Mitch and I were doing them today and he said that he wanted to join. I asked Mitch if it was cool and he said he was alright with it so it was the three of us.
