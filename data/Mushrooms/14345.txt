I was always thinking about how I was going to remember the trip and what I was going to take away from it, and decided that this trip was showing me that what I wanted more than anything was to question the world around me, and to describe it through language. Because of the muddling of cause and effect, it felt as though this trip was holographic of my life as a whole. In other words, there was no appreciable difference between this trip, and the rest of my life; that this trip would be the cause of the rest of my life, or that my life ultimately would ensue because of what I experienced. I texted a friend, I think I will spend the rest of my life trying to explain this experience.
