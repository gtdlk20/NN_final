Hi, I'd like to report a very unusual experience I've had with the mushroom.  Recently I'd gotten hold of a very large amount of high quality shrooms, who were reported to be very visual and jumpy in nature.  From that batch I took about 1/3 ounce, ground it up to a fine powder and let it sit for 24 h in one Liter anhydrous methanol, shaking occasionally.  I'd read that psilocybin extracts better in acidic conditions, so I added 10 drops concentrated sulfuric acid as well.  Both methanol and sulfuric acid were bought at the store of all stores, Home Depot.  The next day after a final shaking, I poured the solution through 2 coffee filters in a glass dish and let it evaporte over the next 2 days.  The extracted shroom powder dried very quickly.  To have a feel for how much was extracted, I shared the powder that same night with a friend.  He didn't feel anything, whilst I, being simply more sensitive than him, felt a tiny bit stoned.  Barely threshold.  This meant it worked!  I was never so happy to eat powder and not trip!  The next 2 days I thought about hardly anything else than the drying shroom-extract, and how I wished to try it.
