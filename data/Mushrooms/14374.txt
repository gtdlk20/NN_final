Then comes the really bad one. I'm going outside cause bro is out talking to whatever hes talking to. :) We are both standing in the grass looking out at the forrest when I see darkness approaching. Its a massive hord of shadows maybe a kilometer away moving in fast. I get the feeling its my own darkness and evil thats coming for me. Its like a stream of shadows maybe 80 meters wide and as long as I can see and they are coming for me. They are going to take me with them or/and kill me I'm sure of it. I have nowhere to run but I'm not panicking I'm preparing to die I think. Not that I want to but it seems I'm fucked. They are really close now. I can see separate beings, ugly twisted shadow demons. While standing there waiting I come to think of karma and out of nowhere I hear myself speak to the shadows. Saying hey you can have me. Just take me. Do whatever you want, but do you know about karma? Whatever you do to me will be done to you later on you know. Now they hesitate and I think we are exchanging some more words but I cant remember what. I know they are having a discussion amongst them about what to do and to my surprise they choose to withdraw. That felt like the biggest win ever.
