Before long, my brain seemed like it was pushing on the inside of my skull, like it was getting bigger. Not a headache, exactly, more like I was learning so much in my thoughts that I needed more space for my mind. My first hallucination occurred as I attempted to smoke a bowl of shake. I watched, in the dark, as the small buds caught alight and burned. Suddenly, I was out of my body, and one of those thousands of tiny flaming particles. I was sucked down from the bowl of the pipe, into the long chamber. I rushed down the chamber, and into a gaping mouth. I burned my way down my own throat, and into a large, cavernous set of lungs. About here I snapped out of the vision, coughing wildly. It was like being hit by a train, as I had grown quite accustom to smoking my smooth little ice-bong, Ghengis. The harsh smoke from the bowl literally knocked me backwards, off my feet, dropping the pipe, and against the wall of the house.
