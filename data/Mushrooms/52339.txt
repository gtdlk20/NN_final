Although having fun with hallucinations, I never expected what would come next.  As a meditator, I think maybe it would be cool to meditate while tripping, so I sit in the lotus position and begin a slow breathing technique.  Seconds later I see myself in a bright light with clouds all around and what seems like music from a lute inside and out of me.  Then I see what I believe to be the vision of Buddha floating on a cloud staring at me but not saying a word.  Also, the Dalai Lama is walking towards me and then becomes me and walks away. FREAKY.  The weirdest and most unusual of all is the vision of Jesus. It's giving me chills as I write this.  He stood upright and kinda floated over to me, but then suddenly darted fast and entered my body from my chest and then swam out. This revelation to me was the most intense vision I had ever experienced and it has changed my life, I do believe. I have tripped since and nothing compares. Nothing.  I believe that was my peak trip and I just hope that one day I can experience that again. Have fun.
