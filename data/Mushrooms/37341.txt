D and I began scanning the cow-pies, because they were the most likely places for the mushrooms to grow.  The crew ahead of us, however, had mostly ransacked these.  After a brief search, we had gathered enough for our personal use, but decided to press on ahead of our co-farmers.  We walked up a wet cattle path, looking along the sides for errant shroomies.  Every so often, one or the other of us would get a feeling that we should look in some particular place or other, and BOOM!  There would be a fat patch of the little toadstools, winking from underneath a clump of grass or a bush.  It seemed like the shrooms were calling to us, telling us where they were, and this happened more than a few times.  As our bags filled, we became ecstatic with the thrill of the hunt, and its copious rewards.
