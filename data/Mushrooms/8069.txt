The main thing that remains prominent of its own accord, from the experience, is this observation/realization that senses are not separate from the rest of an experience. That the sensory is not cleaved, in some sense. This is most apparent now in my meditation/sitting practice: when I sit and observe thoughts/percepts/etc, they don't feel separate from the rest of the experience. Overall, this helps me move in the direction of the state I'm looking in.
