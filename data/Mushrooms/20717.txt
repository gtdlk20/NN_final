We downed the tea in about 5 minutes. And very shortly I realized that not only was I not in Kansas anymore, but that I had no idea whatsoever as to how powerful a psilocybin trip could be. I thought my little trips prior to this were as far as you could go. After all my, 1.5 gram trips I remembered as no less powerful than my 2.75 gram trip with Adam. This was something entirely different, and unfortunately I had 2 newbies with me that I had vastly misrepresented the trip that they would be embarking on.
