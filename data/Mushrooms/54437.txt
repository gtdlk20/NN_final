Osiris body self-scattered over the land, the soul refracted into character archetypes and at once also over time.  Time is a clever invention to be able to forget constantly and to go through the cycle of Samsara over and over again with cycle durations just short enough to never figure out who or what you actually are, to never find the scattered pieces of your soul again and reconstruct the truth.  This illusion of Maya  space and time and the One as many, can achieve beauty, Love, Grace, forgiveness, peace, togetherness, companionship and so on  it may be a make-believe world but at least it is a warm one.
