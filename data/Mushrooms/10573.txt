Josh and I then proceeded to look at a book of Mandelas, which are pictures meant to aid in meditation. One particular picture caught my eye. The picture consisted of a waterfall, with a man swimming in the water below. Along the forested sides, there is a crocodile on each side of the pool, looking at the man. Well, as I looked at the picture, I could see the man's arms moving as he 'swam', the crocodiles beginning to plunge into the water, and the waterfall moving. And as I looked closer at the picture, the borders between the different colors began to shift, moving back and forth, as though they were 'pushing' one another. I pointed all of this out to Josh, and he laughed, telling me he could see the picture coming to life as well.
