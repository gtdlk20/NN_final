Its July, 1955. Im 5 1/2 years old. Im in front of my house [ ] Street in [ ] Massachusetts. Im walking towards [ ] Street. Its a hot sunny day and Im wearing a blue outfit. As I pass under some maple trees I enter my character and cross the intersection of [ ] and [ ]. To my left [ ] street is paved. To my rite [ ] Street is still a dirt road for the last hundred feet as it terminates at what was once called the Bumpity road. I can hear birds, crickets and the traffic up on [ ] Street. I can see and smell blacktop and tar. Kerosene road lamps are on the ground in front of the Millers house, theyre lit and look like black cannon balls with flame and thick black smoke billowing from the top. Theyre about to finish paving the street.
