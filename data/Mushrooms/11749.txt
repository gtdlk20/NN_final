At 5:50pm H told me he had to go to dinner and that he would come back and play with me after he ate.  I didn't want to be alone so I went back inside with reluctance and said to my roomy 'dude, let's go outside.'  He wanted to watch FIGHT CLUB so he declined.  I sat down at my desk and felt confined so I thought about where I could go.  J came to the door and asked my roomy (call him W) to go to dinner at one of the dining halls way across campus.  W asked me to come because I could look at all the colors and watch the mountains and sunset from the dining hall.  NOTE: I go to college in Southern Virginia so I'm surrounded by the Shenandoah Mountains in a small town.  We began walking outside and I just couldn't ignor how lost I was.  I just felt completely lost.  I was myself but all the sensations of the trip were becomming intense and I knew I had to be peaking or at least close.  I looked at my watch: 6:05pm and I thought 'I still have a while to go.'  I wondered whether this was a good thing or a bad thing.  I wondered that if it got worse could I handle it?  I decided to go with it and live each moment of the trip as it came.
