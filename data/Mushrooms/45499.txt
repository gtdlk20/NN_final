I started to get really anxious and confused. I didn't know what the hell I should be doing so I decided I would just lay in my bed and stare at the roof. I started to see the most complex geometric patterns all over my roof just flying around at high speeds. I told K about it and he said I was being really weird. He decided to go  home and J and I decided to go to sleep.
