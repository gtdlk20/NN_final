It wasn't long after this that he started to freak out thinking he was poisoned and demanding to go to hospital. I settled him down for a moment and asked him, in what seemed like a moment of clarity, whether a hospital was really where he wanted to be right know. After a few seconds the implications of this question sunk in and gave up on the idea. By now I was tripping way to hard to deal with much more of this so I decided to have a nice, restful lie-down on the carpet and maybe try and escape the manic tension that was gripping the house.
