Me and My best friend wanted to try mushrooms (shrooms) and so we fought and fought to finally get them..15$ a gram.  I'm at a party and I eat all of mine.  30 minutes later I didnt feel anything, so thinking I just wasted my money I try to forget about it and just try to have a good time.  Then maybe 10 minutes after thinking that, this weird feeling came over my entire body and its like I was no longer in control. My body felt as if it were being massaged from the inside out and it felt amazing, like a never ending orgasm, or better!
