My girlfriend hands us a bottle of Nantucket Nectars juice that I decide is the most important part of the survival kit for the journey I now see myself setting out on. The strangest thing for me was trying to communicate with the 2 girls who were not tripping. I felt as though I could physically see that they were not on the same planet as me and my friend. They decide to leave us to ourselves. The visuals all the while had been becoming steadily more intense. My friend tells me that it is time to leave the room and explore this strange land.
