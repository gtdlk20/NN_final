We all felt very happy and were discussing in detail what we were feeling.  We often forgot that we were standing on a public road in front of houses after midnight, and our voices would get louder and louder until we'd realize once more that we were disturbing the peace.  Each time this happened, we ran further up the road to avoid bothering the people who must have been sleeping in the houses near us.  We kept moving further up the road in this way until we reached the end of the houses and the beginning of the road to the tourist area, not far from the creek and the waterfalls.  We debated for a while the idea of continuing our accidental journey to the places we had been warned not to go, and eventually our impulses got the best of us and we went on our way to the tourist area.  From here on the time was unknown and I am guessing when things happened.
