I remember seeing normal human waking life as one small, dark loop in the pattern, off the one side from where I was, and knowing that it was what I was about to do next. The prospect was neither pleasant nor unpleasant, it was a minor chore that I didn't mind, like washing my hands or tying my shoe.
