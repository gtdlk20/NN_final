I woke up briefly because I realized I had to pee. My wife had to help me to the bathroom as my legs were wobbly. After peeing I, came back into the living room where my daughter had messed up the remote and there was a code I had to put in. This was immensely difficult. I learned that while visiting the far reaches of the universe, I was relatively useless in this physical world. But alas, I fixed it and shuffled my limp like body back to my bed.
