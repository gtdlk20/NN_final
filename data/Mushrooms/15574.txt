I felt kind of bad because he dropped Justin off then drove back to my house. I had early mentioned that I'd let him drive my car to his house then I'd be good at that point to drive home from there. But after a while I retracted that statement just because I still felt stoned and out of it. He had about a half hour walk back to his house, but Justin gave him some cold water and I supplied him with an apple and two cereal bars for the trip.
