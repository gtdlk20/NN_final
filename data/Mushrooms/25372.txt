I felt nothing in the car on the way there.  We got there and bought the tickets.  Still nothing.  Then I just started to feel funny.  I found it hilarious that the mushrooms were starting to take effect.  I tried to buy gummy worms at the consession stand, and I couldn't figure out how much money to give the woman or what change back I should recieve.  I thought to myself 'This lady knows there's something up.'  I giggled at the thought.
