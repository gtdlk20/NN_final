Near the end of the path, it joins a second path that runs along the water near my place. Here, the weather was more calm and a sudden quiet overcame me. I felt like I was deflating and relaxing after my adventure. I sat near a graffitti wall and drank some water. The wall was so cool. There was fresh paint and some beautiful artwork done by the local kids. I spent a good deal of time staring at the wall allowing myself to get sucked into it. I used to do some graffitti as a youngin and I just love to see it when I'm tripping. At this point I was probably about an hour and a half after ingesting the shrooms. Nearby, there is a shrine dedicated to some kids who had died in a tragic car accident. I spent a moment reading the poems and reflecting on the nature of death. Just recently a previous acquaintance died so this was an appropriate moment to think of him and send a prayer into the winds. A shame for young lives to leave us so soon. Again, I was grateful to all beings for being allowed this time to experience the universal bliss.
