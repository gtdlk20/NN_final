After that, we watched 'Friends' on DVD and talked a lot, about religion, our relationship, life, everything.  I felt very close to him, closer than ever.  He said he felt 'proud' for lack of a better word that I experienced what I did.  I also then told him about my strong and confusing desire for the guy from the fire to come to hang out with us at the pool, and said I must have felt that something important would come from seeing him again (we would not have had the shrooms if not for him).  That's when I finally understood my need for him to come to the pool...and wondered if he felt my need, because we never invited him to the pool.  He just...showed up!  And he wouldn't have been coming to hit on me and my sister, since he knew our boyfriends were there, and he also said he had a girlfriend with whom he lived.  I have felt like I have mild psychic powers before, but usually with silly things like songs popping into my head, and then them coming on the radio, or thinking of something right before someone says it (like the guy asking me if I liked mushrooms when I was about to ask).  But that night...wow, I felt like some sort of powerful witch!
