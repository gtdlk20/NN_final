The guy we met outside with the green hair came into the hallway for a cigarette break. We talked to him a little about his job and stuff. he was really nasty. He punched the walls (which were made of cheap plaster) until a whole was formed. He punched the walls so hard that his knuckles were bleeding. I thought the color of the blood was sooo pretty, but still gross. After noticing the blood he held up his hand and licked it. ewwwww. I felt my skin tighten up at the very sight of that, but I didn't bug out about it. He went back to work and said he would be back later on.
