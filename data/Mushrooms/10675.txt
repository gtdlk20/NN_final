Today I am feeling completely sober and though I believe that to have been the most painful experience in my life I am greatful for it. Now I am a much better person, and show people respect. I do not regret taking shrooms at all, though I still don't plan on taking them or any drug ever again. However I expect I will use Marijuana again, but certainly not anytime soon since the mere mention of taking drugs makes me want to vomit.
