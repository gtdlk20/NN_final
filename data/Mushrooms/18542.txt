In the car on the way I started to feel the effects.  First a slight numbing of my sensations and a little feeling of being too cramped in the back of the car.  We were only a few blocks away at that point, however, and I was able to get out in the parking lot and get a little space.  I stayed with my two friends who were experiencing for the first time while my girlfriend went to ferry back the rest of our party.  We talked a little bit and I began to point out to them the lovely reds of the poison oak plants that were covering the trees, and how amazing the trees were as they waved back and forth in the breeze.  I took them over to look at an anthill and pointed out the smooth stones at the bottom of a nearby dry creekbed.  They were starting to feel the effects and were responding really well to the visual stimulations and things I told them to think about.  The world around me was almost slowly rippling, as if I was looking out from a still pool.  Colors started to seem more vivid and I felt an intense connection to nature.  It was early evening, about 45 minutes before the sun started to set and very comfortable.  Once the rest of our group arrived, we began walking.
