Before I layed down for sleep, I took a good look at my 2 dogs. As I focused on their shapes, they began to 'breathe' in the same manner the walls had as my trip first began; their paws and ears and tails shifted proportions. One of them is white, and the other is brown. However, as I looked at the white dog, I mainly noticed darkness in his fur, and as I looked at the brown dog, I mainly noticed the highlights cast upon him by my lamp-- an example of how everything I had encountered that evening was perceived by me in an abnormal fashion. I probobly fell asleep around 7:30 or 8 AM.
