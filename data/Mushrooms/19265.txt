I was a multidimensional being existing on multiple planes of counsciounsious at once. The shrooms freed my counsciouncious so I could see the different levels of myself. I had to remember which plane of existence I freed my counsciounsious at. The concept of me I or mine became very foreign. I realized one of the main reasons we are existing on the physical plane is to learn the lesson that no matter how many things you try to get or needs you try to fulfill there will always be more there waiting for you when you are done fulfilling those. If someone could learn not to seek constant gratification on the physical plane they will have advanced their soul very far towards the final goal witch I think is pure existence or being one. I was then shown what it would take to achieve that on this plane. That would have meant a total change of lifestyle and the little bit of me as the physical self defines it was not ready to go that far. I understood that that was ok. I would be allowed to move at my one pace and there would always be nurturing spirits that would help me along. There was no such thing as failure, you just would make less progress than you could have.
