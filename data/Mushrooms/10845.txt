After that I start walking around the back yard looking at everything I can, and everything looks indescribable. When I try my best to explain what its like, it makes my friend L and my other friend D excited and curious to try mushrooms. My friend L is the one who got me the mushrooms so he calls the guy he got them from and gets 2/8 for himself and my friend D who is still drunk. The shrooms arrive for the two of them and they ask me if I think they should take them now. I look at the shrooms they have in the bag and they look like they are moving around in the bag, trying to escape, pressing on the bag and wiggling around inside. I say, 'Fuck yes, eat them right this second' because I wanted them so badly to experience what I was experiencing. They ate them and we went into L's house to watch a movie.
