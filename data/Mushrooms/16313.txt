At some point I stopped. I looked at the galaxy. At this point I was some point up its spiral arm and decided to go down to a planet. I felt a rushing feeling, as if I was moving so quickly that my mind could not comprehend it. Everything went black, exactly at it did during the beginning of my 'trip.' I was conscious and fully aware in a place without sight, but a little bit of sound. The sound I heard was water dripping into a pool. As my vision slowly resolved itself--it was as if some fog or cloud was moving away where all that was there slowing burned through, exactly like the first view of the galaxy I experienced earlier--I realized I was inside an clay/adobe hut. Sitting across from me was another human--a homo sapien--squatting with a spear between his legs looking at the water dripping, just as I was.
