I drifted off into this jam- for days or years or minutes or seconds. A voice interrupted it- the make voice. Michael- pay attention again!  I felt a touch of amused annoyance- as if the mushroom god was standing by, arms folded while I jammed with his son. I felt this part of the trip was over. I heard a voice say Stay in your seat until the ride comes to a complete halt.  I saw the voice shake its head- one of those odd synestesia things  and I took the mask off. I could have gone on in the silent darkness for hours but something said get up and go back outside. So I did.
