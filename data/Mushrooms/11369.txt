Within the next 5 minute I was caught in a full on trip. I was oblivious to my surroundings, and everywhere I looked there were intricate swirls of colors and patterns. Every minute or so my mind would think up something so ridiculous that I would burst out laughing, and my friend would join me in laughing hysterically until we were practically in tears, only to start again. Then the sliding glass door caught my sight, and as I stared at it the door slammed open by itself. I stared in disbelief for what seemed like an eternity, but must have been a matter of minutes for the sun was just beginning to set. It was then that my friend reminded me about the sunset and we found comfy seats on the porch. My friend suggested that we pop open a few beers, but I wasn't quite up to it at the time. After a little thinking, he agreed and we sat and enjoyed the bright colors lining the sky.
