I got up to the ledge and sat with my friends.  We were all beginning to come down now.  While most people hate the denouement of the mushroom trip, I've always enjoyed it.  We sat there, talking about our trips and watching the sunset reflect off the clouds.  Mostly, though, we just sat there silently, smoking a bowl or two to deal with the comedown and enjoying the tracers that were coming out of the colors of sunset and the flocks of geese flying by.  I said to them, 'I'm going to miss you guys.'  I meant it like I had meant few things in my life.  I felt a tear streak down my cheek, and wiped it away quickly.  It wasn't a tear of sadness, I was quite content at the moment.  It was just a little outlet of all the emotion that had coursed through my body all that day.
