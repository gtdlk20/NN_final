Well, that's what I've heard so far.  What's it mean? Well, it is possible to cultivate your own.  From what I've read from what people have sent, it would seem to be best to be as paranoid as possible about sterility.  A recent posting mentioned the use of a 'glove box'- you would have a transparent lid on a box, with gloves on one side you could put your hands in to work.  The inside of the box would then be sterilized, and all transfers of spores would be done inside this box.  I don't know if one would need to go that far, but definitely avoid drafty rooms, spray down with Lysol first, wear a mask, etc.
