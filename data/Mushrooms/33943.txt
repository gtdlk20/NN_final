Being an experienced explorer of the psychedelic realms, this night proved to be one of the stranger ones that I have experienced. I wont go into what happened during the day before the trip in detail, but it seems that mushrooms were the focus of the days investigation. My dear friend who is also a shamanic initiate (well call him Merc) introduced me to a man that night, a shaman, who possesses secret knowledge, proof about the connection of the mushroom and Jesus Christ. Proof of secrets that the Christian church has been hiding, and the real truth about the sacred sacrament proposed by Christ. As this information is totally secret and I am afraid if I release too much the man Im talking about might be in danger, Ill let you figure it out on your own. It involves ancient paintings of Jesus Christ depicted with the mushrooms as the sacrament. Anyway, after hours of hearing the man speak it was time to go home. We knew what had to be done.
