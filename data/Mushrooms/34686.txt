I ended up smacking my face with my knee as I danced on the ground, which resulted in a nosebleed. In C's bathroom, I sat on the floor, holding my nose, talking, looking at curtains which kept moving around, and looking at the flowered wall tiles. They didn't look like flowers until the next day, there were a lion and lioness, which transformed into a head of a human being, and other things which I don't remember.
