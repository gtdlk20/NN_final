Now, I never dance. I never really liked dance and thought watching people dance was boring as hell. But I tell you I was doing all kinds of crazy interpretive dance to the Flaming Lips, using every part of my body, and I realized the power of dance is equal to the power of music. Although that doesn't change the fact that I still like music better than dance
