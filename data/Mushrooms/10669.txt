In a conversation I had with my mother a week earlier we were talking about the movie we had just seen; Batman Begins. In the movie there are a couple of scenes where people have very vivid hallucinations. She said something like 'all hallucinations are are brain spacims'. So now all through this 'Black Hole' my mother saying 'Brain Spacims' is going through my mind over and over. It really felt like I was in hell. The mushrooms felt just like poison going through my body. It felt like I was dying. I was so afraid. I was afraid that I would lose the people I love. That I would be helpless to stop it. I tried bargaining with myself. I said told myself I would never do drugs again, that I would always treat my body with respect.
