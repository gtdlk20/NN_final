On a Tuesday my roommate and I both bought an eigth of shrooms.  On Wednesday my roomy ate them and successfully tripped and endorsed the quality of the shrooms.  He smoked a lot throughout his experience and told me he had seen a lot of things and during his peak he wanted it to end.  After hearing this I decided not to smoke any during my trip.
