Eventually we ended up upstairs where there was a Nintendo 64 and we all played Mario kart. I started the race off all right, held first place for a while but then began to slouch down and stare at the floor, completely lost in my thoughts. Still holding the gas button my character was pounding into a wall and noticing this my friend sitting next to me jostled me and asked, Hey, you alright? I replied with something like Uuuuugggghh, yeah, why? he said Youre crashing into a wall I looked up and remembered I was playing Mario kart so I started to race again but this lasted only a few moments as I lost myself in thought once again.
