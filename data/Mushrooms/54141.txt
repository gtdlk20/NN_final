At first I watched this unfold with curiosity which soon turned to panic then fear as the spiral got closer. Also as the image became clearer and closer my identity and sense of self diminished. At the last minute I decided that I did not want to surrender all of me so I switched on the lights and hoped it would all be over. The experience just kept increasing in intensity however and I just held on for dear life it seemed. There was no separation between me and the weather...a storm of massive proportions was blowing through me. I could barely stand. My mind was full of faces of people I had seen recently...all disapproving and negative. I tried to warm up by sitting in front of a gas heater.
