Looking out from the bridge to the sea, everything began moving. It was like that of a dream, the entire scenery was warping and breathing, colours fading into each other and objects bending on angles. As the music continued to play, everything around me appeared to be moving in time with it. I felt in sync with both the notes and my surroundings. Suddenly the uplifting tune being absorbed through my ears was replaced with ringing- I answered the phone call and peered across the bridge to find my friend waving at me. She ran over and embraced me in a hug, and laughing at the size of my pupils that had engulfed my light blue eyes. I handed her the plastic baggie and watched her wolf down the remainder of the mushrooms, laughing hysterically as she did. I She particularly hates mushrooms and I did not even stop to think of making her a sandwich. I cried in amusement as she choked on the the taste of them, tears rolling down her cheeks. This filled me with an overwhelming feeling of joy, I thought it was the funniest thing I had ever seen.
