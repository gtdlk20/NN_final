8:30pm Â– driving down a street where an old friend from grade school died due to drunk driving. As I pass up the place where he was killed, I get stuck in a thought loop of how I never really got to know the kid before his death. This gets me sad a little, and pushes me towards the thought train, of how there are so many people on this earth, all living their own lives with their own problems, and how throughout life I'll only get to meet a few of them.
