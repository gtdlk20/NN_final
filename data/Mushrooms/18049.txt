I'd obtained some of the most potent mushrooms I've ever done in my life about a week earlier, and with only seven left, I said fuck it. I chewed each one individually for about five minutes each, gulping down each one with love. I don't know about all of you who say mushrooms are so terrible-tasting. They really don't bother me.
