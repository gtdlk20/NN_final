This world is as real as your reality.   It was like there were 2 parallel universes sitting next to each other and I could see them both. I knew reality was right next to me and I remember feeling very reassured that it was indeed there, but I didnt want to go back yet.  It exists side by side with the world you live in but it is just as real. You can never see things this clearly in your world but you can come back here anytime you need to. Remember this clarity and use it in your reality to remember what is important.   We both laughed and the kaleidoscope patterns started again as I merged together with trip Doug and felt his lightness of spirit and appreciation of life.
