On to the important part. Within probably an hour of ingesting the shrooms, I got fairly contemplative. I thought about my life, and how incredibly fortunate I was to live in such a wonderful situation. I live in a great house, I have *very* caring parents, I have a job that I like, I do well in school, I have a lot of friends, and I'm an accomplished athlete. I thought about all of this and it just completely overwhelmed me. Before this, I knew I was well off, but this experience REALLY made me grateful for my situation. I felt tremendous gratitude towards my parents for giving me this life and for raising me to become who I am now. I also realized that I often just take all of this for granted, and I vowed that in the future I would try and be more appreciative towards my parents, and also just towards *anyone* who goes out of their way to be nice to me.
