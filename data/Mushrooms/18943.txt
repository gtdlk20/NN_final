In the living room, I stared at the 2 large cd cabinets packed full of cd's, searching for the Beatles. It shouldn't have been too hard since the cd's were in alphabetical order, but I was still hallucinating and the cd cabinets looked absolutely gigantic... it looked as though there were a billion tiny little cd cases all stacked next to each other. They were so small I couldn't even read the words on them! It took me several minutes to actually locate the Sergeant Pepper's album and put it into the cd player. It was worth it though... The Beatles are always great to trip on. I went back to the bedroom and watched patterns form on the ceiling and move in rythmn to the songs.
