Probably the only downer about this trip was the personality clashes I could see happening. One of the group members has a very strong ego and had a very hard time letting go. It seemed that she never wanted to just sit back and enjoy the company of others, rather she was just hoping to laugh, see things, and constantly be doing something else. It caused a large rift in the group that I did my best to amend (which we finally did) but it solidified the fact that tripping partners should be chosen wisely. I typically trip with 3 other guys who are all experienced and have incredible ways to heighten trips. Our personalities blend well and utilize the intellect we are so blessed to have, talking about issues as complex as economic theory or as elementary as the origin of the word 'cool.'
