There were no more visual hallucinations, but I was starting to get a very warped sense of my own body. For example, I would press my fingers into the desk, and I perceived the resistance between my fingers and the desk as something that wasnÂ’t happening in Euclidean space. It had no location. It was just a feeling. There was no direction, no distance, nothing, just the sensation of pressure. I realised that, indeed, our sense of things happening on different parts of our body is a sort of illusion. The feeling itself, of pain, heat, touch, etc. are pure sensations, without locality, just experiences.
