I shouldnt have taken 7 grams of mushrooms, plain and simple. But I dont regret the experience I had, because ultimately I discovered my spiritual path. I only regret the consequences that came with my mushrooms overdose. I gained greater appreciation for the life I live, and since my trip Ive been pursuing meditation and holistic medicine with great passion.
