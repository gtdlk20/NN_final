On the way we were sidetracked by the discovery of an incredible shroom field. We had always thought that they should grow along that route but had never found them. The grass was quite long, but amongst them we couldnt stop finding shrooms. We only picked about 10-15 each because we didnt need them that day and we wanted to leave them for another time.  Plus it was starting to go dark. The journey back was even more insane than the journey there. The darkness strengthened the trip, and then the mist came in. We encountered a few more people, and I definitely remember saying strange things to them, but I still cant remember what we actually said.
