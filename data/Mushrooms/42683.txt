14.	 I come back to my body realizing IÂ’m still on the ground lying on my back looking at this beautiful star that was surrounded by a bright white light with the most sublime writing on it. The star itself is half fire half white light, it resembles the star of David, I am not sure how long I was staring at it but next to the star Jesus appeared to me, he looked very handsome and perfect, extremely symmetrical, He helped me feel calm, I laid there until I was able to get up.
