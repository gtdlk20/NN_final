Another lifetime passed before I finally felt myself starting to come down. What was happening? Suddenly I came to perhaps one of the most mind blowing realizations I've ever had in my life: I was on mushrooms. I could feel my jaw drop. Everything that had just happened was due to a drug, a drug which I completely forgot I had consumed. I could feel my mind re-entering my body, and I realized that I must have eaten a lot of mushrooms for this to have happened. How much did I eat? I remembered my initial dose was 3.5 grams. Then I thought to the time I redosed. Another 3 grams. I struggled to do the math, but eventually I figured it out. I had consumed 6.5 grams in total. What the fuck was I thinking? That is A LOT of mushrooms, far more than what I had ever done before. There is NO WAY I could have been sobering up back when I thought I was, redosing with 3 grams is not a decision I'd make sober. I was reminded of the pain in my stomach. Oh man, it hurt. I wanted to get up, but it hurt too much. I was reminded of the pain in my stomach. Oh man, it hurt.
