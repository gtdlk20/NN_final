4:00 - All patterning has stopped, but I'm still unable to believe that what I'm seeing is real. I cannot integrate the experience at this point. My friends drag me to the car, but I think that they are strangers in the hallucinatory guise of my friends and might be tricking me. I get really tired on the way and stop caring who I'm going with, get in the car, and fall asleep. This was the most intense spiritual experience of my life. I felt like the entire area I was inhabiting represented my mind, and several characters I encountered seemed to correspond with inner fears and thoughts. I haven't tripped in 8 months, and feel like I've learned a great deal in the time between. Perhaps this mental change caused the intensity, but either way I feel like I just got back from Mars and it was absolutely shocking and awesome.
