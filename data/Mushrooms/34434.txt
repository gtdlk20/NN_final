By now it is about 4:20 and I am definitely noticing a change in my mind and body. My thoughts are confusing and very deep, and my body feels cold and still drunk. My friend J says he's starting to feel a bit tipsy. By now we are on my friends street, nearing his house, as Im walking I start noticing that everything around me looks 'weird'. Every little thing that moves gets my attention. When I notice that Im noticing every little thing I just burst out laughing and cannot stop. I try to think of things that would make me stop laughing but that just makes me laugh even harder. I close my eyes and put my hands over my mouth to keep me from laughing. It works, I stop laughing, and when I open my eyes, everything around me is moving and shifting, morphing almost. When this happens to me my friend J starts laughing. I know in my mind that I am a couple steps ahead of him in this mushroom trip. I know whatever I go through he will soon follow me.
