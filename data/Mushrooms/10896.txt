I picked up an ounce of, hands down, the most incredible mushrooms I have ever eaten (I have probably tried about 10 different strains). He has told me these were from Oregon and, man were they potent. I have used this strain before in teas and eating them raw, finding that chomping them up with some chocolate and OJ truly is the only way to experience mushrooms.
