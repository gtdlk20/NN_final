While this was going on, Ann had lay down on the couch and wanted it to stop too. I told her again that it couldnt be stopped and that the dose was way more than I had expected it to be. She began seeing kaleidoscope colors and even more scarily ended up with a tic every 15 seconds or so. This seems like it went on for hours but in retrospect it probably only had gone on for about 30 minutes at this point. I had been fighting to maintain a grip on reality in order to talk Ann and Kate down but I disintegrated at about this point. I can remember thinking that perhaps I had cultivated poison mushrooms and I was dying and had killed my wife and Ann. I fought off the next wave and remembered that I did test a mushroom last week and that it hadnt affected me at all so I knew I wasnt dying. I still knew you couldnt OD on shrooms. I realized that this was a trip to be experienced and enjoyed and there was nothing else that could be done for Kate and Ann other than waiting it out.
