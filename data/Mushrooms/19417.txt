     The next time i tried muchrooms i tried smoking them. i smoked a large quantity  and began to  feel the same beginning effects as before except this time i didnt wait 30 minutes to feel effects they were damn near instant. I was feeling early begingings of a good trip  i.e.  trails breathing walls etc. I felt the effects become slightly more intense  before quickly wearing off. All effects had worn of  in less than 30  minutes.
