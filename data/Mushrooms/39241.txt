My friends and I planned a trip up to my friends campsite in Yosemite, and naturally we thought that it would be a great place to take a journey on mushrooms. We bought an ounce and headed up to the campsight. The next morning we got up and had breakfast, got dressed abd sat around the table by our campsite and divided up our bag of mushrooms. I ended up injesting 4.5 grams while everyone else took a little less. For the first hour I had the usual anxiety and nausea that is common during the onset of mushrooms. I went into our tent and laid on the bed till my stomach felt better. Eventually I decided to go out and have a seat by the river. The small river beach had a wonderful view of Half Dome and if it were in the spring you would be able to clearly see Yosemite Falls. I brought a lawnchair out there and sat down. Then the visuals began.
