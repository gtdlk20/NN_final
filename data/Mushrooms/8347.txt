-I could see that no one human could solve all the problems of the universe, but we could work together on that goal. I repeated Its going to take a long, long time. Perfection at the end of time must be achieved slowly, or the game would be no fun. That we must ever die and live again in new shapes with new minds, each life seeking to solve a few problems in its time, to leave the puzzle a little more solved for their children so they can be gods in their time.
