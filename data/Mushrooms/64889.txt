I get ready to go down the street, takes about a billion years because I'm abnormally self-conscious (dunno why). Eventually get out, trippin balls something baaaaaaaad. I reach the train station, sit down and wait. While I'm waiting I all of a sudden come to the realization of 'holy shitt, I'm on very hard drugs and I don't think I'm ready for them. uttttt it was way too late for that. The train platform starts moving in a pattern similar to that snake optical illusion.
