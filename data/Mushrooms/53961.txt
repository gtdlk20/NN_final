For one thing, the last time that I had taken them (1/16th ounce of broken, dried cyanescens) I had not tripped but only become very confused, excited, and seen some boring patterns.  This time I could tell it was different, every few seconds I would have to shake my head to bring myself back in to the real world. I became very disconcerted every time I was passed by a car and felt that I was hearing the noise for an unusually long time before they arrived.  I called my friend to see if I still sounded coherent enough to confront my parents when I arrived home.  He had no idea that I was tripping until I told him after a lengthy conversation.  This gave me heart and I made it home without much more incedence.
