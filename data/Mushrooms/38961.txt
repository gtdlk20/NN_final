Higher levels of realization expressed as concepts are more accessible now. It has seemed to him lately that the human universe is an island in a vast sea of possibilities, perhaps as conceived by quantum physics. With the aid of some kind of medium such as crisis, sensory deprivation, deep meditation, or psychedelic agents, a psychonaut can swim to the horizon (here be dragons) and be voluntarily slain just as the old shamans did, his bones scattered to the deep. Yet his bodhisattva-like mission to return with something to benefit his fellows makes him stronger when completed.
