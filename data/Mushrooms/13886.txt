I will layout a timeline to roughly chart the experience, but before doing so, just a bit more info. I had not eaten much, but had, two hours previously, had a big meal. I chewed down the dried mushrooms with water, not pleasant, but I only took 1g, so there was not too much to chew down, after this I knew it could take up to an hour before things got really interesting, so I decided to have a bath.
