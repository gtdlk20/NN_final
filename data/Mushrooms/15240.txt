We get into my room put on some music we all like (Blind Guardian) start to talk. However I can see it in their eyes they are anxious, I feel I am the only who truly wants to try it. Rocko takes out the weed and Gimpy goes for my pipe. I stop him and convince both of them to smoke afterwards seeing as weed enhances taste and mush smells terrible.
