I managed to get all the way through a relatively challenging workout without missing very many sendoffs.  As long as my head stayed in the water and I didnÂ’t have to talk to people, the trip was beautiful.  When I tried kicking with a board, there was too much sensory input, so I abandoned that and kicked without a board.
