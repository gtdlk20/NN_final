The walls were turning really yellow and had beautiful geometric patterns on them. I was focused on this when I heard a voice. It sounded like my own but much deeper, and negative. It was threatening to make this trip into a bad one. It threatened to take away my sanity. It threatened to expose my secrets and take away any control I had over my mind. It was really freaking me out. I closed my eyes and I saw a new world with my eyes shut. Mostly white landscape, like if grass grew white instead of green. I saw a figure and tensed up. This voice was personified just as a shadow that morphed around into humanoid shapes. I decided not to listen to this thing and I made it disappear and opened my eyes. I decided not to listen to this thing and I made it disappear and opened my eyes. I was back on Earth in the room that was previously morphing around and my friend was sitting there with me. I didnÂ’t have a problem with this voice again.
