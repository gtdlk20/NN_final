I started my day by drinking some green tea and listening to Pink Floyd, I wanted to get a good trip in before college started back again because I knew I would be stressed out from all my homework and research papers, etc. So I decided to get 4 grams from a close friend that I knew was reliable. I decided upon returning to my house to just eat the 4 grams, I thought to myself, I'd rather have one amazing mind-altering experience than 3-4 somewhat interesting ones. So I ingested them and then played the waiting game for about a hour.
