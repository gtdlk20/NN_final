The strangest part about this trip was how fast it kicked it.  I ate the chocolate, which tasted strange but good, and probably 10 or 15 minutes later I started to feel different.  I got extremely nauseous and thought I was going to throw up.  When I got up to get a trash can (just in case) It was difficult to walk because I had tremors in my legs.  It was difficult to do anything because of the tremors, but it wasn't that unpleasant.
