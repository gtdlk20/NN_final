I also do not subscribe blatantly to any of the ideas expressed in my experience. I prefer Mr. McKennaÂ’s sensible view to listen to what the myconid has to say but not to believe a word of it at face value, and instead consider it. Meditate upon it. For example, just because the experience is filled with unimaginable Truth such as what awaits us after death, how we are all One and how everything is going to be all right in the end, it does not mean that I will cease to act and behave in a productive manner. On the contrary, it inspires me to act more, do more, and consider more. It spurs me to continue my battle with my own fears, and serve those around me. It encourages me to improve and elevate every aspect of myself while not idly sitting by.
