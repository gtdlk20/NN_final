Eventually a part of me starts thinking rationally and convinces me that I am not going insane and that I need to stand up. I can barely stand up but when I do I get an enormous energy boost and I can now easily run. I run on a nearby field with my arms spread feeling like a bird traveling at very high speed. The earlier full-blown, totally dominating open-eye visuals are more toned down now and I can see things that actually are there in real life, making me comfortable running. The hallucinations are still very strong though, with a fire red sky and exploding firework-like effects around me.
