When she went to give me a hug, I kept my eye contact minimal and just held onto her, realizing she gave me LIFE, and the opportunity to experience these amazing things. I let go and followed her down the hall to my room, where the door was open and on the Tv screen was Alice In Wonderland.. 'oh no,' I thought, 'she'd going to know, because I'm watching this movie..' All she did was say 'aww you're watching this!?' and left. Phew! I survived my first human encounter! I don't think she even noticed the art all over my arms.
