The most profound realization I experienced during the trip was that free will is an illusion.  I feel the capacity to understand this was due to the psilocybin-induced information-integration state of mind.  I saw how everything we think, feel, and do is completely a result of the interplay between our genes and our environment.  The interaction between the two is completely determined by fundamental laws of the universe.  I still believe this today, in my sober state of mind.  Comprehending that my life is pre-determined has paradoxically granted me a new sense of freedom.  I have less fear of death.
