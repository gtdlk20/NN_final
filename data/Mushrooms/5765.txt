To counterbalance this positiveness, thoughts turned to the issues I'd been having with a person at work I had got along with until recently, who in the trip I saw as both a reflection (He has a slightly similar temperament to me, or rather how I used to be) and utter diametrically opposed contrast. I must admit to feeling some jealousy, as he is a talented guitarist, sometimes playing gigs, which reflects my wish to be musical again. Recently he seemed to have taken umbrage at something and appeared to mock aspects of my outlook on life.
