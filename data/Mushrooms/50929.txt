Walt and Phil were found talking on the porch, and Walt eventually came down to the basement to hang around with everyone else, but the disappearance of Phil, and then Walt and Pete who went to find him, triggered a mildly stressful situation as the rest of us hypothesised comical and grim scenarios. Suddenly we were hit with another grave problem. Initially, Walt's 200-CD player had seemed to be a blessing, something we could just stuff with the night's music and not have to worry about again. But a mix CD of Pete's, (who had now left) would not cease playing, and featured parts of a book-on-tape rendition of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, read by some absolutely horrible actors who drove us absolutely nuts. In one of those drugged quests that always seem to spring up on strong psychedelics, me and Andrew struggled with the machine for what seemed like an eternity, until we could reassert our dominance over technology and play Andrew's preferred choice of music, my Paul Okenfold album.
