The next ride was Submission, a pirate ship type ride that takes you 360 degrees around. M was feeling very apprehensive about what we had just done but I felt very excited and let myself relax. After the ride M felt a lot more comfortable and we walked towards the next ride, Enterprise, a big wheel type ride. By the time that was over we had both begun to feel the stones work their magic. I felt slightly disorientated and giggly. M was in a heightened sense of well being. We crossed the park to the Corkscrew, a rollercoaster. M got a serious case of the giggles as we ascended to the first peak of the ride, the view was stunning, and we wanted to stay there forever. We laughed our asses off for the rest of the ride.
