I then ventured out to where I saw the purple flowers. After walking for about 15 minutes through tall green grass I grew closer to the flowers and they turned out to be dead, grey, twigs on the floor. From a distance they covered all the hills and looked amazing. Being a little disappointed I turned around walked up a hill. I then sat under a tree and watched the clouds. Seeing the clouds turn into fish was amazing, it was like the ocean in the sky. Beautiful. Sitting there thinking about so many things, I went into the deepest thoughts that have changed my life completely. I couldnÂ’t even begin to describe the things I thought about on that day. I figured out my life.
