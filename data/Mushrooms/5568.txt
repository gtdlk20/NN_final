At T+01:00 I had to take a piss and D had to go home and sleep.  She told us not to go to the creek and get wet or we would forget that we were wet and cold and might get sick.  She also advised us against going into the woods, because we could easily get lost on mushrooms.  With that we parted ways with D, and though she was no longer with us, we thought of her as our guide.  She had told us earlier to try hopping up and down or running, which we now did.  Hopping felt more exhilerating and fun than doing so on a trampoline, to me it felt as if the ground were bending slightly under my weight and pushing me back up for the next jump.  By now R and W were feeling the same floating sensation I had described, and we all ran up the road toward the direction of the waterfalls.  Running was even more exciting than hopping.  We ran so fast, the world seemed to just fly by us.  My legs didn't exist for a few moments as I floated up the road behind my brother and my friend, watching the bright porch lights drift by.
