I started looking around the room and the walls and floor were moving too. Alex gave me a book of some of his work and I stared at them all for what seemed like hours. The colors were so bright and fantastic and they were swirling around into beautiful mosaics. Eventually some of them took on recognizable shapes, like faces, or animals. One pattern looked like a green mermaid playing a trumpet. In a landscape picture, I could see the ground waving like grass blowing in the wind, and the rocks and mountains were three-dimensional.
