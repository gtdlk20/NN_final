Everyone except Andrew and Phil, who was still under the bed, converged in the living room. We were all coming down now, and were able to look back and share a few words among friends. Soon, Walt's sister came home with some people and Andrew was forced to leave the downstairs and join us. Bryan had apparently had a good time, and I concluded that he was indeed a good individual to have on a trip. Pete had also seemingly smartened up after being exposed to some saner company, and he had written a short paper on why drugs were not for the faint of heart. We bitched a lot about Phil, and I re-evaluated my opinion that he wasn't worth trying drugs with again. Finally I decided that we should never again leave so much around for him to take.
