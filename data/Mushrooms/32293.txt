T+ 01:30. B starting feeling slightly nervous, considering a  group of people started walking through the park. We decided we would walk back inside. B's house was about a block away from the park, so we walked the trail over to his road. The whole walk felt like a ride in a plane. The ground, and everything around me had a certain blurriness/tint to it. The ground also moved up and down like waves in the ocean. Once we made it to the road, cars looked like giant space ships. As the cars drove by they looked like giant, bulky spaceships just hovering by with a gust of wind that almost knocked us over.
