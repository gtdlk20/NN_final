I decided rowing for about 15 minutes was enough for now, I was hot and sweating but was still unsure whether I should have a short break and row again, or take a shower. I went to the stairs leading to the shower, then headed back to the device. I went to the stairs again. Back to the device. I stood on the stairs a bit wondering what the hell I was doing. Back to the device and sat on it. I started rowing again but after two strokes decided this was really not what I wanted to be doing right now and I should be nice to myself and get a warm shower.
