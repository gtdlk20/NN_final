The most important thing about sterile technique is to clean everything twice.  Take a shower, wipe down the work area with soap and water, then spray it and yourself with Lysol or some other disinfectant.  This doesn't take more than 10 minutes and will almost insure success. I usually work nude from the waist up to keep dust from clothes from getting involved. If you wear clothes, make sure they are freshly laundered. Work in an area without a draft, and use a glove box (best case), or on a flat table underneath some sort of cover to protect from stray contaminants from falling down.  Keep the lids on the jars or petrie dishes and only open them for the minimum time necessary to add spores or transfer mycelia to another jar. Don't make any sudden moves, though, as this causes drafts and may lead to contamination.  Use a pressure cooker, and sterilize at 15 lbs for at least 30 minutes. I generally go for an hour.
