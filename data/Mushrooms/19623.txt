After this more visual part, the trip becomes more conceptual even if some images occur. A first concept is related to the multiple layer reality we can access through the psychedelic substances. It is visually represented like a virtual room with every wall in a hexagon shape. In the middle of it there is a round window that leads to a different world (I've also drawn a picture of this). Will power is in the centre of this geometric room and can move from one world to another through this kind of dimensional porthole. I only have to choose one of the infinite worlds I wish to experience. I understand that also in ordinary life I can shape my reality with a strong will. Then I want to explore the concept of death, that is one of my favourite topics. I feel more or less like if I am in a death state in order to explore other realities, but this is not like being in ego death, since I'm aware that I'm under a drug effect. I'm full of joy for the discovery of this chance, and I would like to communicate it to others. I develop a sensation of pure love towards my dearest. I see love as the only chance for human development.
