Worrying that the potency would be deminished if we ate our vodka rigitoni first we ate after ingesting my new friends. Within about 20 minutes each of us had eaten about half of our meals when the wood work on all his cabinets started to appear as if they were melting of the hinges. Upon inspection my brother correctly guessed I was 'feeling it' and even that I saw melting wood. We both enjoyed a good laugh at that for while and decided to continue eating only to find out that this was an increasingly difficult activity. Something like 10 minutes later I felt so incredibly cold and sat down on the couch. My brother still enthralled by the faint hallucinations found his way to where I was and informed me that I was completely flushed and my face pale white. As soon as I heard that nausea swept over me. I had a nice (for me) vomitting followed by a nice sense of comfort but my face was still pale. Enjoying the comforting feeling I noticed the visuals were virtually gone so me and my brother just sat talking until 5 in the morning when we FINALLY felt tired.
