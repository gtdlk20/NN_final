At this point the nausea was steadily increasing from ingesting the plant material. I was still coming up extremely hard and the visuals were intensifying greatly. My room was morphing and shadows were moving indiscriminately. Objects around my room were beginning to warp, and my entire field of vision was covered in a rainbow wash, similar to that of oil on water. By 12:20am, my nausea was almost unbearable, to the point where I thought I might have to throw up. After a further 20 minutes (which felt like a few hours) my nausea subsided, and the full extent of the trip started.
