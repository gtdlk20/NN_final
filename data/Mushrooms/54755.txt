I now find myself in a more modern time.  The development of the modern church.  The large masses of humans around has instill fear, anger, and greed into the human soul.  The teachings of God are remembered, but it is forgotten who he is.  The religious leaders proclaim that the mushroom is not to be eaten, it is forbidden. The church has convinced the masses as to their warped perception of God, heaven, hell, what is right or wrong.  They work together with royalty to demand riches from the masses.  But some still remember the sacrament given to us.
