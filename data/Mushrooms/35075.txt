I took two ass-kicking mushroom chocolates. I finally know what Terence Mckenna is talking about, when he says you need to take high, high doses. I think I took the equivalent of at least 5 dried grams of cubensis. I was sitting at my computer looking up some shit on the internet, and it hit me all at once. I couldn't move, I couldn't function at all. I was completely immersed in an other dimensional world, the hallucinations came on very strong and very fast, non-sensical images and patterns exploded out of the blackness. They built up and built up. I thought, oh shit, I took waaaay too much. I tried to just go with the flow, but this was way more intense than any drug I've ever done.
