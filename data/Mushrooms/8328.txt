The world seemed like nothing more than the biggest, most insane, cosmic Rubik's cube, a tangle of nothingness, and that through my awareness of it and my own power within it, I was solving that puzzle. Every single piece of knowledge or interlocking information that I figured out fit somewhere else and cancelled out, leaving an increase in bliss in my brain- as though at the point the rubiks cube was solved, the universe would cease to exist and the bliss would reach insane levels. I was seeing all kinds of weird shit at this point that I dont even remember. I think everything in the room was rainbow and buzzing and alive as though every atom had woken up with me when I realized that my true nature was god.
