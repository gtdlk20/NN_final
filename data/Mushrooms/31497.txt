I had read details from shroom trip reports and one concept that kept resurfacing was the partial or complete loss of ego.  Going in to my experience, I spent the week before taking very good care of my body. I ate normal amounts but tried to eat more fruits and veggies and less processed food, while making sure to take vitamins and get a good amount of exercise. I went into the experience expecting to come out with a new understanding of myself and the world around me. I thought it was fitting that my first trip was on the Spring Solstice: a celebration of spring, the season of rebirth.
