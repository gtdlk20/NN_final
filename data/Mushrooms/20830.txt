The thought was that I remember being an Ancient being, a timeless being, living in an endless cycle without beginning or end.  That can be a beautiful realisation but for some reason, this time, it made me panic.  What did endless actually mean?  How did it start?  I had no choice in the matter of these questions and the black hole I was sucked into by asking.  I had absolutely no more control  I was being thrown down a Cosmic rubbish shoot, into the dumpster of nasty realisations.
