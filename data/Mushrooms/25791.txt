Soon after chanting I picked up an acoustic guitar which happened to be lying right next to me and began playing some melodies that I had created on a previous trip.  The melody was particularly effective because it can be played for long periods of time without seeming repetitive, and the transition from minor to major reflected some sort of transformation of spiritual energies from negative to positive.  Critical to the spiritual transformation is a fear-inducing freeing of oneself, until a clarity and transcendence is found.  I felt that I could reflect this somewhat in my music.  The fear I had pre-singing/guitar playing had amplified my appreciation for the healing power of the music.
