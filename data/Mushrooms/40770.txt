Everything was so beautiful: Old buildings, the 6-month old fruit forest, work trucks, the sky. I was in love with plants, even the dead ones. Looking at a small dead tree I shrugged my shoulders and said, Hes dead. Thats fine. I was so, so appreciative that I had such a big colorful place to be loud and dance around and do goofy things. I kept thinking about how it was like a carnival. It didnt matter to me that I was alone. I put my crossed arms at the top of an old, short white painted brick wall (a bit above armpit height) to relax and view this big playground in astonishment. Seconds passed I felt as though the wall had grown taller and I had to hold onto it as though my feet were dangling from a high cliff, then I realized my feet were still on the ground and I busted up laughing.
