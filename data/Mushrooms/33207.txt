So no actual sense of any other entities but I believe I was on a sort of threshold, and I can totally see how I could have interpreted the strong sense of presence of the drug effect as personalised entities (goblins, elves, aliens etc) in line with the other worldly theme the chemical induced in me. Since the trip was already kind of sinister, I didnt follow that thought through. I chose to regard the sense of other as my own brain dealing with the alien substance within.
