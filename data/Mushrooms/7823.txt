At this point the trip took a turn for the worse.  I suddenly was losing the ability to know what was going on around me.  I somehow created a false memory and began to think, horrified, that people outside of our room were somehow alerted to the fact that my roommate and I were ridiculously fucked up on shrooms.  This paranoia grew until I thought that RAs and cops were onto us; they knew exactly what we were up to and were coming to get us.  I thought that I might have thrown up in the hallway or something, and hallucinated voices outside of my door that presumably belonged to RAs.  They were saying things along the lines of, You cant tell me you didnt just see that. EW. Those kids are disgusting. Were gonna have to call somebody about this.  I began to grow very scared, although realistically I had no reason to be since I didnt actually do anything incriminating.  I asked my roommate again if I had done anything sketchy.  I dunno, he said again.  This seemed to be his catchphrase for the night.  He was probably off in his own hallucinatory world.
