They were laid out on two little plates in my front room. One for me and one for Neil. Neil was on his second plate as the first one smashed and sent the shrooms flying over the carpet. Maybe we should have took this as an omen? A sign of the potentially mind shattering night that lay ahead... but we didnt. Instead we quickly munched them and flushed them down with a pint of water. Neil even licked the plate. Good god - how were we supposed to know.
