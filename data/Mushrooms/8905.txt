Coming into the trip, my set and setting couldnt have been better. Coming into the trip, my set and setting couldnt have been better. Ive recently made some big life decisions and gotten out of a job that I hated. I feel really good about the future and quite honestly I havent felt so good in a long while. Im currently living with my parents (Im 20 years old) properly for the first time in a year and a bit and it feels so good to be back home with them after living with a good friend of mine for a year and previous to that living at university. My parents are open and loving people and knew that I was planning on tripping. Whilst they had their oppositions, knowing that they were aware calmed my nerves and put me in a good mindset.
