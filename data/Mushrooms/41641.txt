Okay. So I'm in the middle of my trip and suddenly I get a pressure pulsate in my head. Its the same pressure that occurs when I yawn. The pressure kept pulsating very rapidly and more intense with each wave. I had my hands on my head as it was really intense. Then, something extremely bizzare happened. My consciousness exploded and I could see these cicada-looking entities looking and inspecting me. They were everywhere. They were hyper intelligent. I felt as though I cracked out of an egg that was inside one of those things and was born. That everyone is in these eggs and if you're ready you hatch and this is transcendence. This is what I was being told. Nothing really others havent heard. But then... I experienced it....
