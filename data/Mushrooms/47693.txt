I had never noticed so many different colours in my room and all I could do was to slouch on my bed and stare at them all with fascination. The colours would reach out and touch me. I understood why I had designed my room the way I had done as if I didn't know it at the time. I put on under the bridge and we sat back and looked at everything, pointing it out to each other and talking about what we were feeling. We just couldnt stop talking about tripping and trying to explain it. My mind was racing thinking of my life and the way people in my life saw me. I thought of how differently my friends look at me than my family or people at work. I would then think about how other people would view me even though I had never met them. This was all going around in a big loop and I kept reminding myself I had already thought of it a couple of seconds ago.
