This was early autumn 2014 in sweden. My brother and I had a few months earlier bought 25 grams of mushrooms and tried the 'heroic dose' of 5 grams each. Surprizingly we had very mild trips on that, maybe what you could expect from 1-2 grams. But set and setting werent the best. We had both worked to much and slept to little so maybe that played in, what do I know. Maybe the mushrooms just decided to be nice to the silly monkeys who were in over their heads. :)
