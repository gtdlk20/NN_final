I picked Ei up at her house before we were meeting K and J. Talking about our feelings, it was clear that we were both a little nervous, since this was the first trip for both of us. I had expected myself to be hyped up, as always when I am about to experience something new and stimulating. However, as I had spent the day trying to smoothen and open my mind and to meditate, I was very calm.
