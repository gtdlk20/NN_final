On the other side I want to explore the concept of evil also, and I have a visual of a black heart-shaped obsidian, inside a dark cave. No light at all but I perceive it emanates pure evil. Every beat is a wave of pure evil. Then it takes an anthropomorphic shape, made of black fog that is the essence of evil. I don't fear it, I'm detached because I feel it's going to balance the good forces in the universe. Then I think of death again. This time things are worse, I imagine the end of everything with the dissolution of the body, and it is so sad. Still. My mind is lost, wandering in confusion. I'm afraid, and I think that this is due to the psychedelic drug. I feel its danger for society, we must keep control of them because they're too powerful and can destabilise the system. I think I'll never use them again, because I like  reality the way it is.
