4:35 pm: I am having a hard time coming back from this fear, but it is coming. In waves. Waves of joy and composure. Between crying on the floor of the bathroom. Man, all these feelings. When would have been a good time to experience these? It had to be now. It may as well have been now. It needed to come out in order for me to move forward. I am thankful for this opportunity to focus solely on these fears and anxieties  what I keep calling them  but really, these are just strong feelings needing to be felt that I have been neglecting. I feel light. I feel happy, again. I am just faced with weight, with seriousness, now, and that will pass eventually. Just feel it out. I can feel the grasp of these feelings releasing on me just through the simple act of acknowledging them.
