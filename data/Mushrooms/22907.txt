After I got out of the park, my memory left me until the middle of Black or White. That's means there are at least 11 minutes that I just don't remember. My memory kicks again again with me looking at my black nails and thinking that I am Michael Jackson. Not the hurt Michael of the later years or the innocent child, but the exuberant Michael of the Thriller and early Bad era. So I danced along the street and I thought I was Michael Jackson. That may not sound special, but it's a memory I will treasure for years to come.
