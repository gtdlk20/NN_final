I stood up and felt a presence in my body that I never thought possible. The only way I can describe it would be to say that my body felt like it was full of electricity and at any moment I could shoot lightning out of my hands. Words like 'awesome' and 'power' were redefined. This energy continued to pulse through me with a force that is beyond this world, for I truly thought that I was no longer a part of this planet, rather I was giving a taste of what it would feel like to be a god. It was, without a doubt, the highest high I have ever had on a mushroom trip and still cannot believe the power that I felt, the absolute feeling of pure energy within my body. Everyone else came and explained that they have never felt anything like this and that their music was rich, full of life. One described it as having liquid music poured into your ears. The intensity of the experience was rivaled only by the beauty that surrounded us.
