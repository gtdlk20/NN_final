In hindsight the reason I experienced this bad trip was because I didn't know what to expect. The mushrooms hit me very hard, very fast. And since I had never tried them before I was unaware of what to expect. This story isn't meant to scare people, but to meerly let people know that this is not a light drug. I haven't tried them again, not out of fear, but just because the opportunity hasn't arose. I would definitely do them again, and I  would definitely take the same dosage. I'm now aware of what to expect and I honestly believe I could handle it again.
