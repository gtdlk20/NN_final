I had been wanting to try mushrooms for a long time. I had already been an alcoholic, stoner, and coke head (in that order). It was time to hallucinate. I drove to the city where I was going to purchase mushrooms at a really good price, so it was worth the drive. I picked them up and me and a few friends went cosmic bowling. I decided that eating a little bit wouldn't hurt. I had tried them once before this experience but it was nothing extraordinary.
