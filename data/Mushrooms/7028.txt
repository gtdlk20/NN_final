A said, I like your stuff. I like your stuff, too. I want your stuff in a jar. I like our stuff together. We had become reduced to what we were; STUFF, just stuff. A bunch of atoms and particles pooling into one blob of human stuff. Eventually, we switched and I got on top of him. Thats when I had the most intense orgasm ever. And it wasnt physical. Yes, the sex felt good, but we werent having sex to climax. We were doing it to experiment with our non-tactile senses. So I had an epiphany that the world is, or could at least become, perfect. The way the music was lapping up against us like waves in the ocean. At that point (I imagine from the heat from our bodies), I almost completely believed we were lava on the ocean floor, melting and resurging together in this hot, molten explosion. It was fucking nuts, but incredible. I started bawling, and I felt like I had been reduced to something more substantial than stuff; that I had just been shown the secret of the world. I felt like a newborn, and that I had just entered into this amazing place for the first time. I cried my eyes out of happiness for recieving whatever revelation the drug had given me. I have never cried so hard from happiness. (Which kind of makes me sad.)
