I was a few decades into eternity when I remembered I had eyes, which I then opened. I was leaning against the car door with my face melted into the bottom of the window. I pulled my face away from the door and realized that I had turned into a puddle that was then sitting in the seat of 3Â’s car. I tried to remember what I was as I stared at the passing trees out the window which looked like they were moving with us. Any shape I had once held had been lost in the years I spent in the end of the universe. Along with the memory of who or what I was I also lost all memory of anyone I knew or places I had been. I thought as hard as I could and remember a few things. I was a human, which meant I had to have parents, but could not remember who they were. I was in a car with 3 on my way to my home, which I could not at the time picture. I asked 3 many questions in this time without realizing it none of which I remember. The drive lasted only about 45 minuets but due to the mushrooms felt like many, many years
