I had taken psychadelic mushrooms on two seperate occasions before.  Both times, I had experienced very strong trips, however both times I had done close to twice the recommended dosage.  My most recent experience had been somewhat of a scare for me, and I had spent much of that trip experiencing very bad thoughts and hallucinations.  In retrospect I had thought about what that might've been meant to teach me and I felt prepared to approach the mushroom again, this time with more respect and a proper attitude.  My advice: Mushrooms are more than a 'drug', there is something magic about them, but one should respect them and not approach them from a purely hedonistic standpoint.
