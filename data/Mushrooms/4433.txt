At this point everything in my visual field was breathing and objects became much more animated. Colors began to pop and change faintly and I had some strange appreciation with the design, architecture and aesthetics of everything. The vibrations and mood was now at its emotional peak. It was as if all our emotions, happy, sadness, love, anxiety, laughter, and tranquility, were pushed to new unexplored heights. It was at this point I had one of the most intensely deep philosophical moments of my entire life. Somehow, this ancient and powerful knowledge was put into my mind that we are all one. Not all one in the sense that we all come from the same matter, but all one in the sense that we are all one consciousness, the consciousness of the universe, the exact way that what ever direction this existence is headed in wants us to be. This may be something one can think they understand, but it is as if there is a filter on everybody that is keeping the true beauty, mystery, and wonder of this existence from being able to be fully realized. At this moment I thought I had discovered the meaning of life and it hit me hard emotionally. Tears were streaming from my eyes as I was hysterically telling this to Dee and he completely understood and reacted similarly. It was at this point that I began to think that none of this is actually possible, there was no way I could discover the meaning of life, and I must be dreaming.
