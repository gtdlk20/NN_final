Christmas break was arriving and I was to go home for it from college.  I was bringing a whole half of an ounce for me and my friends.  The night that we decided to do it turned out very awry.  My ex girlfriend and her friend came over and my best friend and me and them ate these shrooms at nine o'clock PM.  We ate them with Teddy Grahams, which makes them quite tasty.  They were dried and covered in blue something.  Stripes of blue all up the sides and everything.  In our haste we walked right by my parents and I realized that I forgot to say goodbye, something odd.  I said that I should go back and I went in to talk to my mom.  She tried to engage me in conversation and I noticed that I was having massive problems with communication.  I was already tripping!  That is one thought as to why LSD might have been on it.  We drove up into an area called the Canon behind my house and we decided to walk around.  It was cold, though and we soon came back to the car to sit and wait for the onset of the shrooms.  I was already feeling very, very odd.  I was laughing almost uncontrollably at everything and I realized that I was really tripping when I couldn't stand being in the car anymore.  I was squirming all about and even started crawling all over the seats.  So, we got out of the car to walk.
