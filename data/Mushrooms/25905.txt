I honestly cannot say I would recommend this experience to everyone.  This is not for the faint of heart.  ItÂ’s impossible to have completely prepared myself for the shock of stepping outside the program and glimpsing the intricate and vast circuitry of the cosmic machine.  This was the most difficult experience of my life, but also the most gratifying.  Imagine falling in love, conceiving and being conceived, giving birth and being birthed all on a cosmic scale and all in one evening.  Anyway, read on dear friend, for the grand adventure awaits.
