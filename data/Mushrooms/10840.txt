At about 3:55 all three of us were walking along a bike path near some baseball fields when I started feeling drunk. My friend D was already drunk as fuck from drinking all the beer. My friend J said he was feeling nothing yet. We sat down on the bike path for a moment when I looked to my right at a row of trees in a tree farm. I noticed the tops of the trees seemed to be moving, wiggling almost very quickly. I wasn't sure if it was the wind making them do that so I pushed it out of my head. All three of us decided to continue walking to L's house because we were almost there.
