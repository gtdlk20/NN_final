Suddenly I heard a soft pop and hiss just above my head. I looked up in time to see a tiny patch of light fading away in the sky. Had I been alone, I would have called it a hallucination. But Jimi had seen it, and Wes had nearly fallen off the edge of the fountain. It wasnt a shooting star! he cried, But it may have been a meteor. I definitely saw flames! The hallucinations, even the trails/traces had ended a while ago. Whatever final surprise nature had in store for us that day had apparently made its mark even without direct psychedelic aide. We felt truly connected to the earth and our specific place on it - this rambling, eccentric, wacky ranch.
