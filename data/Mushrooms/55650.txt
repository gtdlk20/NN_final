This was my second experience with mushrooms and boy was it overwhelming.  The first time I ate less than a half and eighth and only had mild effects.  Mostly lighting changes and shifty movements.  Anyway,  prior to the experience (the day before, tripped friday, so this is thursday), My friend and I spent the whole day driving around doing various things, shopping to going to the movies. The movie that we saw, was 'waking life'  this movie is nuts. Basically what it comes down to is the main character cannot tell the difference between his waking life and his dream life. He's stuck in a dream and cannot escape. This movie played a major role during the course of my trip.
