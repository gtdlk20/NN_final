9:30  My best friend, who was chilling at the house, calls me, furious, while Im in the woods and hits me with a load of complete BS about how even though I had bought him an eighth of shrooms the week earlier, I had told him I didnt need the money back (he was mistaken, I am poor) and that I wasnt a real friend and that I had blindsided him by leaving him out of this nights trip. Needless to say, these negative emotions began to make me feel incredibly uneasy, and I was bombarded with intense emotions. He tells me the money he just paid me back with is his, and hes incredibly pissed that he has to leave the house to come get it from me so he can have fun too. I reluctantly decide to cave and give him the money, not wanting the bad vibes to ruin what I had planned on being the most spiritual night of my somewhat hard at that point life.
