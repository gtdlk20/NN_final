The next day after my trip I enjoyed nature in a way that I never had.  I visited a very beautiful place and was so SO happy to be experiencing it sober. An overload of the senses, but afterward I was happy to be able to just SEE everything versus picking out every molecule in what I'm seeing and having each molecule come alive :).
