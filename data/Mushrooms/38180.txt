I'm sorry this was so long, but I don't know anyone who has taken a trip anything like that, so I thought I'd be thorough. I am writing this about six months after it happened. I still feel as though there is something more after this life, though I don't feel in any hurry to leave this world. There is infinite time :). I just wish that everyone could have experienced what I did. I think it would be beneficial.
