The following is a summary of my experience with dragons dynamite magic truffles I had yesterday, from the diary I have written during the trip and what I can remember from it. I was already familiar with psychedelics, having used acid something like seven times, mushrooms three times, and hawaiian baby woodrose once. I had never been able to experience psychedelics alone. I had heard it could be the best way to turn the trip into a deep introspective experience, and because I wanted to answer some questions like 'what is the goal of my life ?', 'what should I change to be happier ?', 'what should I do to be a better person ?', I decided that I had to do it.
