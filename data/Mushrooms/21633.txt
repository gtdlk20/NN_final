It was at that very moment, that I knew it was real life. They came in with shocked facial expressions since by now my face was swollen and ugly. They were frantically trying to talk to me but I just laid there and stared at them in disbelief. I have been in shock before and I know exactly what it is like, and at that moment, I was most definitely in shock. I didnt speak to anyone for hours. Dee eventually came in the room crying because he was in disbelief too and felt bad for what had happened. I finally started talking to my mom on the drive home. I didnt tell her anything that happened. I just said how it was a terrible decision and Im sorry. I was supposed to leave for college in a week but this event made my parents want me to wait a semester to leave for school, an idea that I fought ruthlessly and won.
