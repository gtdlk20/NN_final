I narrated all my thoughts out loud to Muse, and they began to become rather incomprehensible. I kept on repeating phrases such as, am I alive or what, I dont get it. Everything I said ended with I dont get it. Thoughts seemed much too complicated for me to analyze. I believed that what I was meditating on were subjects that normal everyday people never even attempt to grasp. All of life seemed rather meaningless. Everyones struggle to gain material possessions was making me sick, and I became very depressed.
