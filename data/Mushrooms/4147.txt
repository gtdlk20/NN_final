I was startled to realize that Psilocybe is still illegal here, so technically my friends were breaking a law by giving me that medicine. It left me feeling super weird about the government. Now that I trust the medicine, I can't trust the law. I can trust myself and my friends and the universe and the mycelium and so on, but not the law. Phooey.
