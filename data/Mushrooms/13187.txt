The day I finished the book, this friend, Amy, and I dropped some LSD, along with her boyfriend and another lady, whose name I've forgotten. Man, you wanna talk about some mind-bending, mind-reading-type stuff going on. I won't go into it too much, but Amy's boyfriend was definitely tapping into my psyche. See, she and I had kind of messed around, shall we say, and he wasn't aware of any impropriety. However, as he and I sat on the couch watching a movie with Eric Roberts as a time-displaced hippie, my mind would just sort of dance on the thought of his lovely woman, and he wouldn't SAY anything, but his breathing sped up, and his lips would purse together, and he'd start drumming his legs and generally just getting worked up, UNTIL I jettisoned the offending thought and replaced it with something a little less adulterous. Then he'd simply calm down and smile at me. I can't do justice to the feeling, but believe me, it was real. I even experimented with it for a while, but was afraid I'd get him worked into a frenzy and have some Manson-esque carnage to explain to the landlord.
