I've been trying to figure out why this trip went so well for me, after all, I did eat a quarter (many people wouldve bugged out). I think it is because I'm famililar enough with the mushroom experience to keep myself from getting caught in thought loops because I can tell myself its just the drugs and I've been here before. Also, this trip was completely unplanned: we did not have an agenda nor did we have anyone pulling us in one direction. I hate having people trying to tell you that someething is cool or to do one particular thing when your tripping. Its a very personal experience, and although you can share it with good people, it still rests mostly on your own head. I believe one should go with the flow. Whatever one feels like they one want to do, do. One shouldn't let anyone try to pressure one into doing anything one doesn't want to do.
