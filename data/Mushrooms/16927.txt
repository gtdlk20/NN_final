T+30-40...N is gone, though I don't remember him leaving. Me and P decide to wander around my backyard. Luckily, we have a cornfield behind my house. But first, we had to find our way to the path that leads to it. So we start to walk along the edge of the cornfield/backyard boundary, which has about a ten-foot wide strip of tall brush. We were very reluctant to go through that brush, so we decide to move along the edge of the cornfield into my neighboors yard. While we do this, some strange animal begins making noise like a chipmunk. High, squeeking sounds are coming from several directions. P hears them as well. We are somewhat amused by this, but also a little freaked out. Eventually we walk about a hundred feet along the edge of this ongoing brush, and decide we better just jump through it.
