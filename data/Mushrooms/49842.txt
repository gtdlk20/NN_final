As the sun hit the horizon, we started walking back towards the cars.  I talked with some friends as we walked for a while, but eventually put my headphones back on.  This time listening to a live album by a melodic trance group called Hybrid.  With mushrooms I pay attention to details that would otherwise be lost.  I was thinking about my place in the world, my connection, and thinking of the earth as a mother to me.  At that time a song called 'High Life' came on.  Part of it has a woman's voice repeating over and over 'Together...  forever...'.  Usually it fades in and out of the track, however this time I heard it clearly and danced along the trail back to the cars with a huge smile on my face.
