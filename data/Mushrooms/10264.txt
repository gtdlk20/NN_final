After remembering my friends and finally getting sick of the song I was listening to for the past 4 fucking hours, I walked back at least 2 miles and found my friends. They were miserable. I found one bored out of his mind (the one who was stoned, well not anymore), another wrapped in a blanket going insane and just being very very uncomfortable. But the strangest of my friends was just standing there saying, Dude, are you ok dude? repeatedly. It drove us fucking mad. But apparently he was having the worst experience of his life. But I won't get into that.
