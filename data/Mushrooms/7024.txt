At the end of our finals just a few days ago (Fall 2003), my boyfriend and I decided we trusted each other to try mushrooms together. I need to make it clear that SECURITY was NECESSARY to make this a good trip. It was needed that we be either secure with ourselves if we were alone, or to be secure in the company of the other. We needed to trust each other; we trusted each other and agreed to help out the other if one of our trips suddenly became sour.
