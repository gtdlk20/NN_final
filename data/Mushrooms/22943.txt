Speaking of which, my memory is a shame. This was the peak of my trip and the point when my head was chock full of ideas. But it seems I've waited too long and it's all slipped away. Let this be a lesson for next time to begin writing earlier, perhaps even during the comedown. So what did I learn? That psylocibin is powerful and next time I'll ask for both comfort and insight. Because the alternative can be quite painful. My respect for the drug is too strong to risk another bad trip. I've also gained a sense of calm since the trip. It's humbled me and I don't see myself posturing for attention as much anymore. I really do wish I had started writing sooner, because I sat on my bed for hours in the dark just thinking. And those thoughts are lost. Perhaps it's as well. Brooding on the past has brought me too much pain for me to continue doing it. It's time to plant myself firmly in the present. But I can't. A part of me is still anticipating my next psychedelic adventure. I can't wait.
