Damn music sounds great on mushroomsOne of my favourite parts of doing psychedelics by myself is being antisocial AF and curling up into a ball on my bed and listening to beautiful music with some good headphones. EurythmY, Sixis and Wolftech are definitely favourites. The party moved from the bed to my kitchen when I put on a more upbeat track and suddenly felt so into it and so happy that I I danced around in my apartment for a bit legitimately jamming out. I love dancing! By the time I looked at the clock again it was 8:20pm. Felt like longer though. Things were starting to move a bit and I felt like everything was going well. So I was like fuck it I'm eating another chocolate! Im just on my own, shit can get as weird as I want haha! So I munched down another one just another gram. I dont think I was done coming up on the 2g in the first place so another 15 minutes the mushroom trip started to get pretty real when the second chocolate started kicking in. I grabbed some tea and thought of how amazing my coffee cup is and how nice it was to have my tea still warm a couple hours later. Its the little things lol. ;P
