Then, troubles began as neuropathic itching and burning in my feet and legs (and left hand fingers) troubles began as neuropathic itching and burning in my feet and legs (and left hand fingers) became at times excruciating and nausea set in.  And Google played the same music repetitively to horrible effect  I have no idea how many repeats there were, but it felt as though epochs of time passed with the same cycle repeating over and over and in each cycle I was part of the universe performing multitudes of calculations of how our interaction could be improved, to no effect.  We had returned to the position of her resting on my chest with one arm over my chest for most of these cycles.  My wife felt like an entity that I couldnt really understand and I tried to calculate changes that would alter our interaction but none of the calculations and changes in any of the cycles made an improvement and I concluded there were none that could.  The music starting to repeat would bring about a lucid kind of moment where I felt a need to check how my wife was doing and communicate that the pattern, or cycle, was about to repeat and ask if she wanted it to  and I dont remember her responses being any more than it was ok.  I would rub my hand over her arm, rub or tap her back, move the position of her arm a little, try to wave my hand in time with the music, and hum the start of the music pattern (she says I sounded like I was doing whale song and it made her laugh) and the cycle would begin anew.
