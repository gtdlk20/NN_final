I had been working with psychoactive mushrooms (psilocybin) for two years and had amazing results with age regression in the last few sessions. Without the mushroom I had memories only as far back as five and a half years old and before then it was all a haze.  I discovered I could use the effects of the mushrooms to push that back a few years.
