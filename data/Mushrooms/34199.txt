I started getting the feathery feeling. Like my whole body was in a pool of soft down feathers, and they were crawling on my skin, very very pleasing and then this shape, this very mysterious shape appeared on my friends blue wall. Imagine the aquarious/jesus/fish symbol with the 'tail' on each side, with an 'S' down the middle Then these white, ghostly faces started raining down the wall, they weren't mean or scary or anything, just faces. This was just preparing my mind for the trip I was about to have. It was a beautiful moment.
