The visual peak of my trip happened soon after we ate the mushrooms on empty stomachs and followed their ingestion with famous Dutch frites. We walked through a square in the city on our way to Vondel Park and came across a gathering of pigeons. They all flapped their wings and took off from the ground at the same time and their energy made me see them as spectacular, 3-dimensional glints of light. The geometry of their movement overtook me and I greatly enjoyed this unexpected insight into a familiar scene.
