We hung around the creek for a while skipping rocks. Friend #1 found a rock that was in the shape of a mushroom and gave it to me as a symbol for my first Trip. After this, Friend #2 suggested we keep moving along the paths. We continued our hike. We hiked for 10-15 minutes uphill, dodging worn out patches of ground from constant hoof traffic as well as piles of horse dung.
