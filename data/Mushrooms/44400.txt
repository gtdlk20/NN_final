During all this I start getting mad at him because he's not believing anything I am saying. And I tell him I am about ready to fight him, because he's calling me a liar. Then he gets offended, and says I need to calm down. I am under some strange authority kick from the trip, and I can't calm down. I am like getting pissed because I am telling the god honest truth.
