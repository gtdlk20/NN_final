27- Another death today. This one was a much slimier looking green mold. It took hold at the vermiculite/substrate interface [the bottom of the cake]. It was jar #1, so I'm not surprised. Anyway, I cut it out and put it in with #6 for a few days of intensive care. [John Doe] sampled a few grams (wet) of primordia and he said that he had what amounted to a prolonged 3-beer buzz [canadian beer]. He wanted more, but we didn't want to decimate the cakes. The precise quantity is unknown [we didn't get access to our scale in time], but we have a rough idea. I'd like to double the dose and try again, but that will have to wait until the cakes produce some more shrooms.
