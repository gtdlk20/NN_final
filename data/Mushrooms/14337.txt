20 minutes in, I started feeling the familiar effects of shrooms. After 40 minutes, we went into her bedroom and laid down on her comfy king sized bed and started listening to a playlist I had been putting together. I started seeing ripples and pretty effects on the walls and ceiling. I began to realize that this was going to be a really strong trip. 50 minutes in, the music started to be a little overwhelming, and I switched to something calmer. About an hour in the room started getting pretty wonky. The blanket I was under was rippling, the walls were swaying. Occasionally IÂ’d converse with my sister just to make sure she was okay. I was worried about her since it was her first time, and I was worried that I was starting to have a bad trip, and she would have to take care of me. I tried to stay in reality, but it was getting really emotionally intense, and the room was barely looking like a room.
