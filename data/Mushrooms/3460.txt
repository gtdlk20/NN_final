The opening band wrapped up after 30 minutes.  Upon finishing, recorded music began to play from the speakers while the stage underwent its transformation for the next band.  My comfort level began to slide the moment the members of the opening band set down their instruments.  I felt as if the foothold upon which I was leaning my weight had splintered and I was suddenly losing my mental balance.  While I was still in complete control of my faculties (both mental and physical), I could sense that the trajectory of my trip had shifted.  I felt as if I had been caught by the outer currents of a whirlpool, and while the pace of my movement wasn't yet alarming, I knew that I was heading someplace I didnÂ’t want to be.
