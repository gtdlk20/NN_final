11:50 p.m. We made it back to the house safe and sound. I asked Trevor if he saw what those cars looked like and he said no. I knew that I was on a level higher than his and was on my own. The house was a furnace when we got back in. We didnt know if it was the shrooms or if the air conditioning was broken (turned out to be the AC). Bottom line, it was hot as hell, almost intolerable. Since we just moved in, we had no cable and now no cool air. We then went to our own universes.
