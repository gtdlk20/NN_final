I took my time that morning so I arrived just in time to hang in the hallway and tell one of my friends about my breakfast, then making her jealous of my time to come.  The bell rang to end first period and start the DITPL, I ran into my best friend, and he had a massive grin, knowing what I had done.  We went and met up with our other friends and they kept heckling me; Anything yet? Ohhhh man this is gonna be awesome! Drugs!  etc.  I told them I will tell them when.  After hanging around for a while we walked to a friends house close by so he could grab some weed and Gin mixed drink.
