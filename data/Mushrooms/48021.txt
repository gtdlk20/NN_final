As I stood up something happened which I do not entirely remember. I seem to recall experiencing a headrush, however as the head rush came on so did a feeling of dread. I thought I was going to die and my entire vision turned red. I started to black out and started to struggle, my limbs flailing and hitting the walls before I collapsed to the floor with a pronounced thud. I regained consciousness with my face on the floor. J and L had come to check if I was alright. I told them I was alright and that I just needed water. I left the bathroom and ran downstairs to get a drink of water. Once I had the water the same feeling of morbid dread came over me and I blacked out again.
