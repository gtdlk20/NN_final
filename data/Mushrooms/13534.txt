I exit the bathroom, my vision is completely askew at this point, trails, sparkles, and lights are everywhere, my field of vision is drawn with a set of crayons.  I look at T and say, 'I think I'm having trouble.'  He looks a bit concerned and says, 'Do you need anything?  Water?  Music?'  I just reply that bed would be the best option at this point.
