I am Adam-thinking.  I have parts of me that are Adam-understanding, which is led to through Adam-thinking, and I have Adam-expressing which is how I show that I am Adam-thinking, and there is, of course, an Adam-feeling, although he is distant.  All in all I found who I was for the first time while tripping.  No, things didn't swirl and melt.  Well, sometimes they did, but that was not my trip.  There were the inevitable and playful reality changes through my eyes, but those were no big deal.  I was focused that I am Adam-thinking.  Above and beyond that I was Adam-understanding too much about what Adam-thinking should do with Adam-expressing.  I would be the perfect expresser, but Adam-understanding would hate that People-understanding would not be understanding what Adam-thinkig really was.  Like Jack Kerouac I would end up drinking myself to death if I were a writer.  Well, I recommend it very much.  Very, very much.
