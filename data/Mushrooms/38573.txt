On top of eating about sixty dollars worth of shrooms, I ate them on a completely empty stomach, washing them down with water.  At first it was all fun and games. We threw waterproof fire crackers in a pond, amazed at the way the murky waters suddenly flashed. My first hallucination was a white fire ball that emerged from the water and soared in to the sky. Thundering speckles of fireworks tricked me momentarily to believe I was on the battle field of some forgotten war. A window of reality exposed the thoughts of my parents, who might be home soon. They would surely go haywire if they caught me in my condition, so I decided we needed to get away from my house. We hopped in my car and we luckily made it to my friendÂ’s apartment in one piece. It was definitely a good thing the trip had not fully kicked in while I was driving. Hallucinogens and automobiles have to be the worst possible combination you can contrive.
