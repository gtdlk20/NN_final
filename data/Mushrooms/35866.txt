Without knowing R's dad came out to the car around 1:00 and asked us what we were doing. For some reason I felt completely sober while talking to him and told him that we were listening to music in my car because R didn't want us around him. For some reason the dad believed us and said 'Ok just don't drive around because your mom doesn't want you to drive after midnight.' M was scared because he didn't know what to say but I assured him that he didn't think we were on anything because he said don't drive after midnight. I felt a since of accomplishment for pulling that task off. We were good for the night but I wasn't too sure about R.
