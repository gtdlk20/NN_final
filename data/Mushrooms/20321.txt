I consumed the dried and powdered mushrooms at approximately 11:00PM on a Saturday night.  My two friends, Dan and Allison, had also consumed some powerful psychotropics, Psilocybin and MDMA, respectively.  The first hour and a half of the trip consisted of a visit to the casino.  Bright lights and soft comforting sounds filled my brain with psychedelic mind candy.  Pink lemonade and cigarettes were my new love affairs as I wandered through the rows of brightly colored machines.  Eventually we departed the casino and headed home.  I was starting to feel the peak come on and I began to prophesize the possible dangers of operating an automobile.  With this in mind I took a fat resin hit from my pipe (which had been coated by seven bowls of nugs the night before).
