I love basketball and couldn't wait to play when I got there. Even with everything spinning I felt like I could just have fun and play well. As I looked around my familiar neighborhood took on a new light. It was as though I was seeing all of it for the first time, even after living there my whole life. We started playing basketball, and I challenged G to a game. After about 1 point I changed my mind and didn't want the competitive spirit anymore. So we shot around and had a few conversations. We talked about society, the complexities of time and space (which G helped with by bringing a good dose of reality into the conversation), painting, basketball, and life decisions. Z, who was a first time tripper, and slightly apprehensive at first said he was loving it and saw a whole new way of living. I felt like mushrooms were always a part of me and so natural and I was connecting with that part of myself. This especially made sense after we were talking about parallel universes.
