I had been planning on taking the rest of the tea home and freezing it for future use, but two nights later K wanted me to drink more of it, so I decided I'd drink the rest. After just two days I didnt expect the tea to do much for me. My past experience indicates it takes me about 4 days to return to normal mushroom tolerance. But I decided to drink the rest and see what it did for me.
