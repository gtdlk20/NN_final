Just before leaving, I looked at this fake fig tree by the door, and it promptly turned into a leafy creature with six arms and a long, pointy snout.  The snout was opening and closing, mouthing words at me.  I was so confused that I thought 'I bet if I wasn't on mushrooms I could figure out what that guy was saying to me.'  By this point my time sense was greatly distorted.  A sober person counted off the seconds; 1... 2... and I was greatly surprised, because they seemed to be separated by a great length of time.  I was giddy and kept laughing as we walked down the side walk.
