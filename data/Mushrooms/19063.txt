Physically I have been a bit run down recently, having a kind of chronic cold that kept coming back every time I ran myself down by smoking too much pot, drinking too much yerba mate with kratom in it, or eating too many subway sandwiches. Although I helped with the setup for the full moon party, after that I had gone back to the mansion to just rest. As previously mentioned, I had been abstaining from kratom or smoking marijuana, and strictly limiting my caffeine consumption during the last couple days. I was a little congested and had a slight cough going into this experience.
