I was having difficulty finding my way back to any landmarks I recognized. As I said earlier, it was easy to get lost sober in this area and I was as far from sobriety as I'd ventured in years. I nearly ended up in someone backyard at one point, but somehow I managed to orient myself towards the park's streetlights and start walking in their general direction. I remember considering if I wanted to stay out the entire night, just to prove if I could. But the fact that I'd already done that once discouraged me from that idea. If I hadn't remembered my past experience I probably would have spent the night out in the cold just to prove that I could. And I probably would have frozen to death. It was far colder than I'm used to and I was not at all dressed appropriately.
