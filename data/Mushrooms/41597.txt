I began the trip in a good state of mind.  The effects came on very quickly and started in intense visuals (colors, shapes). These colors began to overtake my vision even with my eyes open.  I found it almost easier to control with my eyes closed because at least my thoughts were focusing into something.  It started to become difficult for me to keep on one track of thinking or feeling.  This is when the shrooms started talking to me, which they would do for the rest of the trip.  I realized how strong this trip was going to be, turned to my friend who I was tripping with and said 'I'm insane right now'. ..... He had no idea what I was talking about :) but it was the best I could communicate at that moment.
