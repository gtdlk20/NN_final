So outside was one of the more beautiful things IÂ’ve ever seen. When I would look across the campus, it was snowing, and aside from being able to individually see every snowflake, the clouds/sky behind the trees in the Quad was glowing a dull greenish/bluish. When I would look up into the sky and to the moon, the clouds took on a morphed green shape, and when I would focus on the moon, the clouds would slowly circle back and forth around it. Every time I would look at a tree, they would morph and move and almost dance. Perfectly fluid motion, no stops or jitters, just like it was alive and meant to do it.
