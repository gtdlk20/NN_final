8pm Â– first noticeable affects start coming in. I remember being in the passenger seat of my sitter, and looking at the street ahead of me. The street lights took my interest, the way they were all aligned in one straight line along the road, somehow made me happy. The reflections from the lights on the dashboard started making eight swirls in front of my eyes. Closed eyes, made a cartoon appear in front of me. Think town from Mickey Mouse, with hills and flowers everywhere around me, going down the street with colorful houses jumping up and down.
