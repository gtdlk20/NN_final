At 11:45 the bell rang, and I ran out of the room. I went to where my reassuring friend had been, and proceeded to be slightly freaked out, until I found him again, standing in an adjacent hall. I looked up at him, and then I was in a loop. I thought that it was that morning, and that he had just reassured me of my existance as a human being on Earth. Because of his authority, and obvious power over my emotions, I started to believe he was my boss. When he wasn't around me, I would ask for him, saying that I had to ask him what the 'article' had to be about, because the deadline was the next day. I made myself believe that I worked for a 'college newspaper'. And that he was my boss.
