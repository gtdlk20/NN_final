There were five of us taking the sacrament, all consuming 1gr of dry cubensis. We prepared by doing our regular morning practices though it was evening; meditated, did some fear inventory regarding the ceremony and set our intentions before slowly eating the mushroom. They were quite tasty and nutty in flavour and it felt good to talk to them, sing and connect.
