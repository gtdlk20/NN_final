After a little longer we decided to take G up on the mustang ride. We hopped in, and I thought I should get shot gun, even though it wasn't my car. Material objects meant absolutely nothing and had no owner at this point. K brought along a great unreleased Jimi Hendrix CD. This was AMAZING. I had never, and I don't think either K or Z had ever felt Stone Free the way I felt it that day. Driving in the mustang, smoking cigarettes and hearing him yell out his life to us was incredible.
