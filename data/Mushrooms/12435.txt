I feel that the purpose of existence may soon be realized.  The evolution of the universe, earth, and life has been speeding up exponentially.  Roughly, it took billions of years for the earth to form, hundreds of millions of years for the first life form, several million years for humans to evolve, and tens of thousands of years for human civilization to develop.  Now, humanity is evolving at an amazing pace.  News and scientific discoveries are quickly spread across the internet in the blink of an eye.
