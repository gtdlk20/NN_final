I genuinely thought I was going crazy, and for good.  I kept thinking about how I wouldn't be able to go to school in the fall because I would have to be committed, and how my friends would or wouldn't wonder what had happened to me.  I looked over at k, I had no idea what k was thinking or what k was experiencing.  I tried my best to communicate what I was feeling, starting slowly and fumbling over my words.  I think I said something along the lines of, 'I'm so depressed, I'm so fucked up' and I kept asking k to tell me stories about people who had been in similar situations as me (bad trips) and came out of it just fine.  It helped.
