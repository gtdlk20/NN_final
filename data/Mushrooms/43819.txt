I was starting to have a physical trip again, so I went inside to grab some blankets to writhe around in. I opened the linen closet and had an idea, I would shut myself in the closet and pull all of the blankets around me. It didnt occur to me at the time, but that was something that I had done a couple of times as a small child.  Once I was in, It was pitch black. Being in the closet with blankets all around me triggered a flashback to one of the times I was in the closet as a child. I in fact was in my child body, and I was back in the time that it was when I was a child, but still retained my older brain. I was overwhelmed with love and compassion for my child self. I started to cry and sob because the emotions were so strong. I started to cry and sob because the emotions were so strong. It was also one of those There is so much I wish I could tell you, but I cant moments, but I realized that there really wasnt much that I would change about my life, which made me even more happy.
