This lasted 36 hours but Ive given you a long play by play as it is. Suffice to say, everything was seen as if I was coming across it for the first time, any frills or gimmicks were so easily cut through that I actually didnt enjoy my episode of House. The following day as I returned to school, as things progressed I kept saying to myself. So this is how things are done here? In the second day, I had returned quite to normal with my full memory, and started to write this.
