The time was now about 8:30, we rolled up to my house and I thanked 3 for watching out for me and we said out goodbyes. Looking at my house I remembered everything and was very worried that I may flip out upon entering the house and get myself in some trouble with my parents. By this time the hallucinations had ended along with the twisting of my mind. I went in the front door and up the stairs to my room. I sat down at the computer and was greeted by 2 on AIM. It was now about 9:30, all open eye visuals were long gone and the twisting of the mind had ended but I still had closed eye visuals and pupils the size of quarters.
