I didn't get paranoid at all, I was fine going up and talking to people. Colors were multiplied just as I had read about. I was worried about having a bad trip, but I was prepared about what to do. I knew you weren't supposed to be around people, but it wasn't bad. I actually enjoyed talking to people.
