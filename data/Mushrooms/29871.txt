I thought the church must know about this or did it completely fall by the wayside while the church became a political business. Early Christian art clearly depicts the relationship to the mushroom. Is this the true soul of the church? Did the church loose its soul? No, the church must have hug stockpiles of mycelium and theyÂ’re all a bunch of stoners. Anything else would be insane! What if Christianity grew out of this experience and then they lost touch with this experience?
