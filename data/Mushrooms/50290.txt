I was able to eat the mushrooms (1/16 oz...nothing major) with the aid of a granola bar, and we headed down to a friend's room that was right next to the party.  The whole way down the jitters wouldn't leave me and so I got more nervous.  Finally after spending a couple minutes in the room I felt like I was gonna pop.  The nervousness had turned into nausea, and I ran to the bathroom.  I began to puke up what little I had eaten at lunch as well as various stems and parts of the granola bar.  At this point I wasn't feeling the effects of the mushrooms, just sick.  I kept thinking that this would just pass and once I puked it up I would be fine to go about my fun.
