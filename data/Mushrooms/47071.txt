I finally made my way to a full standing position. I looked around at everybody, and it was so clear, they were all hooked! Hypnotized! I read everybodies aura and they were all completely entranced by the drum circle. Everybody at this particular circle were the best of souls. Alot of them were regulars, who had been coming for years, I could tell. So many happy faces, such an infinite plane of mental states, such a large group of fryheads just living it up. I was weightless! I moved my arms and head and legs, stretching them out, effortlessly. I literally felt like merely a part of my vision, a part of the air, a part of imagination, weighing nothing.
