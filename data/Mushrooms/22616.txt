12:30 Went downstairs and ate a Yogurt. Talked to my brother a bit and told him I had shroomed and was feeling it. He laughed and asked me how they were working. I was very euphoric and giggly. Stomach ache is felt slightly, and this is the first time it has ever happened, but diminishes not 10 minutes later. I watched my newspapers on the table as I ate start to defy gravity and the newspapers started flapping gently, like a breeze was allowed through a close window. I decided that the trip was becoming more intense and that I should reside to my room.
