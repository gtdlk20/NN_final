I decided I wanted out of the house so I went downstairs to find mine and KTs stuff. I had to stop for a while to have a nose bleed. That was seriously weird. I felt a rush of heat in my nose and looked down at my hands. When the first drop of blood hit my hand I jumped at the sensation of extreme heat. That was the only time I was conscious of heat other than an occasion when I felt cold, although I cant remember when exactly that was in the trip for the life of me. I leant over the toilet and rested my chin on the seat, feeling the blood run down my lips and chin and watching it hit the water. My sense of time that night was so screwed. It felt like an entire day had gone by when I was only in the house until about half 1 so it was six hours at the most. Everything was so slow. I was totally wrapped up in the time it took the drops of blood to leave my chin and hit the water. Blood in water looks pretty damn cool anyway but it was fantastic to watch. I couldnt connect the blood I was feeling and seeing to me having a nosebleed. Didnt make sense.
