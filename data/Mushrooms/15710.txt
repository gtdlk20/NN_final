Now lying in the sun, although I felt at peace, I knew that in order to get out of this yin/yang, karma, samsara conundrum, I would have to willingly forget everything I had just learned. I would have to make a deal with the devil, so to speak, and sell away my newfound knowledge in order to return to ordinary reality. The phrase pick your poison came to mind. Until I did this, I thought, I would be stuck watching this cycle turn forever. I had to make the decision to become a separate entity again. Who should I choose to be now? I thought. What part in the story should I play next? Well, the one I was playing wasnt so bad. What should my name be? W, of course. Slowly I regained my normal sense of self, and my ego started re-integrating. It was about 3:00 PM. I walked into my house, still a little dazed, and greeted my cat after what had seemed a lifetime. Going outside again and sitting under the elm tree, I felt refreshed, born anew. I was so thankful to be back. Life is so beautiful! I exclaimed. Thank you, sacred mushroom! Thank you so much!
