We drank the tea very quickly in maybe 5 minutes. I can remember them hitting hard. Within 10 minutes things were getting real colorful and I felt very woozy.  I looked at Kate and Ann and the way they looked back at me I knew they were feeling it to. I immediately went outside to talk to Adam who was smoking a cig waiting for his to kick in, and told him this was going to be a crazy trip for Ann, Kate and me. At this point, Adam's shrooms were really not affecting him at all, and I was hoping he or Jen could babysit us. I suggested that we move to the living room from the kitchen to sit on the couch, but immediately things started to go bad for Kate, she sat down in the dining room (an empty room) and I couldnÂ’t get her to move on to the couch. Ann did get to the couch but said she was feeling really bad from the initial kick in on the shrooms. I have to say that I never had these things come on so quickly, in the past it was a 45 to 60 minute wait for these things to kick in, but at 15 minutes I had a full kaleidoscope if spinning glowing pinwheels throughout my scope of vision.
