From this point forward, the trip began to recede.  What I mean by that is, I was peaking or just past peaking, and I basically dismissed it. I had all the intoxicating and hallucinatory effects, but I was so frightened and unsure about that voice that I couldn't proceed with the deeper trip. I really feel like something intentionally interrupted me from experiencing what I was being shown.
