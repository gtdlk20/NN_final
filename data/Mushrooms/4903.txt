I was shell-shocked for the next week. I could think of nothing but the trip. The week after that, I entered a fierce inner debate about whether I would try drugs again. I reminded myself that this was not all for fun; I had a mission, and no unpleasant experience was going to stop me. But at the same time, my brush with insanity left me shaken. I remained convinced that if I continued, I would eventually end up in a real mental ward. The experience had felt so WRONG that I believed it had not been a trip, but merely my brain going haywire because it couldnÂ’t handle powerful substances.
