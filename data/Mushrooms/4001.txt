Unfortunately I looked at Ann at this time across from me who was covered under a blanket and peering out with a terrified look on her face. Her tics had stopped and she said she thought she had to go to the bathroom but wasnt sure as she didnt know where her body was. Eventually she got up to go to the bathroom and walked out of the room. I was just hanging out when I heard the water running in the bathroom and for some reason a foreboding feeling came over me that Ann was very depressed and might do something to herself. It then struck me that Ann had gone to the bathroom to kill herself because she was having such a bad trip. I completely panicked. I was absolutely sure that she was trying to kill herself at that moment and I bolted to the bathroom and started knocking on the door telling her to come out.  She was obviously confused and was asking what I wanted. I really thought she was trying to delay me while she killed herself and I tried to knock the door down! Fortunately Adam showed up and distracted me just as Ann opened the door and popped out. Adam was telling me to chill and brought me back to reality. I realized that she was obviously not actually trying to kill herself and everything sprung back to normal for a few seconds. I apologized and said I really felt responsible for her bad trip and was worried about her. As we stood talking Ann watched us and then walked over to Adam and poked him a few times and asked him if he was real. Adam laughed, told her to stop poking him and said he was pretty sure he was real. She was actually smiling now and I was really relieved as he started joking with her.
