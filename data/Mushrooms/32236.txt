We all then proceeded to sit and talk some more and I thought that life was so perfect...expect for this one thing...and then I started to think about my father and my parents and my family...and immediately my mood switched. From being at 100% happy, I was scared, frightened and depressed. And then I started toying with the idea of suicide, and I was very tempted to jump into the sea. I thought about it, and I thought that it didn't matter even if I did commit suicide. But then, I started to remind myself about reality and immediately said to K, 'Make me happy, make me happy!' And she just held my hand and smiled, and then I looked at A and at everyone else and got caught up with their conversation and I started going up again. And then it was just up, up, up and I started losing my grip on reality. I forgot how my mind behaved without shrooms, and how normal perception works. But all the while I just kept repeating to myself, 'OK. A has done this before and he became normal.' And after some time in which everything was pure happiness, I felt the effects of the drug wear off.
