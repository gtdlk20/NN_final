Before my second mushroom experience I had been into all sorts of drugs to get 'fucked up'(weed, alcohol, cocaine, dxm, ktamine, nutmeg, mdma, and nitrous) and now I dont have the desire to do any of that. I want to do mushrooms once a month, not to get fucked up, but to become aware of who I am and what my purpose is. Ive been trying to get my hands on some acid because Ive heard that its like mushrooms but different. Im not sure what that means but Id like to find out.
