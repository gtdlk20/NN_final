My poor friends tried to corral me once I got naked but I didnÂ’t understand why. To me it was the most important night in the history of time, because god was coming awake and shaking off this dream of reality and going to fix all of the misery for everyone, forever. My clothes bothered me so I ripped them off, it was that simple.
