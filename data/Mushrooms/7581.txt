I started feeling the effects at about 8:15. I felt I was being pulled into trance, so I got as comfortable as possible in the closet and closed the door. I was having some crazy auditory hallucinations, buzzing and bubbling sounds that produced accompanying visuals. Then I heard The Noise. The Noise was a high-pitched electrical 'zzzzzzzap!', and when I heard it, I felt as if my brain had been lashed with an electrical whip. It was painful and scary. I tried to find its source, but in my condition it was impossible. I couldn't even tell if it was coming from me or somewhere else. I tried to contact the mushroom entities to ask them about it, but they pushed me away. Confused, I pulled myself out of the trance to try to figure out what was going on. When I got out, The Noise stopped. I thought maybe turning off the lights would help, and I decided to try being in another room. I went into my bedroom, put the computer on its grooviest screensaver, got comfortable and went back into trance.
