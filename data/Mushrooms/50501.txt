I descended deeper and deeper into the forest and came upon a river, where I sat on a rock and observed my now vivid visuals.  The earth now was breathing heavily, and the fall leaves that covered the ground would shift around, form patterns, spin, etc.  The water was not as impressive as I expected it to be, but the sunlight through the trees was magnificent.  I was so glad I shroomed in the fall because the leaves on every tree were like spots of paint:red, green, yellow, orange, all glowing through the light of the sun.  If I stared long enough, these colors also shifted and changed beautifully. At this point, if I blinked, I could restore my regular vision, but the moment I stared too long at something, I would be thrown back into trip-mode.  A patch of grass looked normal at first, but after fading into trip-mode, a certain pattern emerged as the blades shifted in unison.  At first it was a compass, then it twirled and became a sun.
