Since I felt heavy I moved over to the couch, and laid down. My body felt excellent, very fluid and soft actually, with that pleasant God-energy flowing through me at the same time. I watched the ceiling for a little while and it morphed a bit and the colors were excellent. Then I closed my eyes and watched transparent waves and blobs of color shift around as if carried by a cosmic breeze. My closed-eye visuals never got photorealistically intense during this trip, but that's just eye candy anyway.
