On my travels through the 'caverns' I found many people - some were happy to be in my vision, others were not. That is the way things go. You won't connect with everyone, and not everyone will like you, want to bond with you. The best thing to do is not to let it bother you, and in that way you can avoid being upset or freaked-out in many situations. I just ignored, or left those who gave me bad vibes, even when it was difficult not to ask myself why they didn't want to be with me. With so many people in one place, it is impossible to find harmony in everyone. This can be used in the world as a whole. Bond with people you feel you have a connection with, have something to say with, and ignore or tolerate people with whom you don't. It's working for me. I think that each person can learn so much from a trip, if you go into it the right way, and travel through it in the right frame of mind. I have found that you must not take shrooms, or acid, or any psychedelics to escape, but to learn, to discover to explore. Forget how fucked you are, forget the pains and strains of reality, and glide through whatever it is that happens to you. What I found helpful was that whenever I got too worked up, or freaked-out, a joint really calmed me down. Rolling up gives you a focus, and smoking the joint allows you to sink back into yourself, to relax and find what you lost again. I always found a quiet place with some friends, and sat down for a joint. I'm sure many others do this, and would agree with me on this matter.
