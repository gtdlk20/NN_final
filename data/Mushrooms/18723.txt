Depression - at least so far I do see a reduction in my depression. This is even considering that I am taking 1/3 the dosage of Lexapro I was taking prior to the therapy. I have more hope in general and less existential angst. I am willing to go back up on Lexapro if my mood takes a turn for the worse. I have heard a number of reports that these results may not last, either due to the afterglow wearing off, or our brains just resorting to their old wiring, etc. But so far so good.
