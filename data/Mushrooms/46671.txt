Edit: I forgot about this little bit when I typed the main report, but as I was coming down and feeling somewhat better, but still tripping, I really though I was a German nazi stormtrooper in the hell of the trenches of WWII, I found out the day after I came to, and read this txt file that I had typed out while I was tripping, of all my opinions, as this brownshirt trooper, in the form of a letter home to relatives (I am not of German ancestry or culture, nor have I been to Germany), all my/his feelings on the war, the trenches, shells pounding and killing, quite disturbing when I came back sane and read this.
