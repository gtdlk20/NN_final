After 45min I was in full trip.  But it wasnt normal.  I would begin to trip out on textures then out of nowhere I would remember my ex GF.  This continued for 2hours then my friends took me over to a party.  At this point I was having a really hard time dealing with my trip.  IT felt like I was in a bad dream just waiting for something bad to happen.  Everything and everyone, even though I new all of them seemed like strangers to me.  The whole world seemed odd.  I began to notice little things that you would normally overlook.  The only thing I could think of at this point was my ex.  This was 3, 5 hours into the trip.  I stood up and told my friends I had to leave now.  Even my best friends where begining to piss me off. They were acting like they always did but for some reason I was getting agravated with them.  They asked me where I wanted to go but I had no idea. I started to get panicy because I felt bad, everything was strange and I had the urge to leave but didnt know where too.  So I got in my car and told my friend to just drive.  He took me back to my friends house where I started the night off at.  I was now 4 hours into it.
