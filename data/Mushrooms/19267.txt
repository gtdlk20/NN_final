I started having thoughts about the spirit of my mother, father and brother, not their physical selves and sensed great love for them. I realized that a mother is who I need her to be. I thought how these spirits devoted much of their energy towards nurturing me and I felt great love towards them for that. I also felt great shame at a society that would look down on someone for doing something like shrooms.
