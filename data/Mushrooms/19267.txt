I was convinced I was having The Experience. The ultimate psychedelic trip, the trip to end all trips. I thought that when I came down, I would be able to write this trip down in such a way, that anyone who read it would literally be able to get inside my head, to relive this experience exactly and in its entirety. I thought that they would not only be able to experience it from my point of view, but simultaneously from the points of view of everyone who had ingested the mushrooms tonight. WOW. The Experience. I never thought Id have The Experience.
