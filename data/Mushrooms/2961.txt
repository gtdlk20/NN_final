It was interesting that when deep in therapy I periodically realized that my guide was in the room and I was almost embarrassed.  Perhaps because he was not 'with me' in therapy it felt a bit strange. And I am very glad I had him there, in case of emergencies. But perhaps if I ever do therapy again, I would have him in another room.
