A new view of life dawned on me. I've always been afraid that if I commit to one thing, I'll miss something else. Yet I realized I'll miss the truly important things if I don't surrender and commit to the paths my heart desires to follow. It's no longer so sad that I can only see and experience one version of my life, and that it feels so brief; it's eternal in the moments of true connection. I can only be the fragment of God/Universe that I am, no one else. Through commitment and caring, the deepest joys and sorrows and the truest aliveness can be accessed.
