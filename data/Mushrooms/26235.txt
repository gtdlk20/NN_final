I looked around my room, and it seemed completely alien, unfamiliar, and discomforting. My guitar had become a sickening creature, and my Black Sabbath poster stared malevolently at me from its position on my wall.

I thought I was going to suffer a fate worse than death, and at some points I wanted to kill myself.
