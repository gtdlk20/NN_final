My sister and I sort of debriefed about our trips. She said that her trip only lasted about an hour, and all she really experienced was the room feeling warped at the edges of her vision, and her trip went away because she went into the other room and interacted with the real world, and when she came back, she lost the trippiness. I was still coming down from the trip, and felt absolutely elated. Everything I said or she said or that I thought felt right, and important, and seemed to relate to everything else. I felt like I had been enlightened.
