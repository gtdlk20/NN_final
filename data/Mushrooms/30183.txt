I take off down the highway for my about 20-30 minute trip to the bowling alley. When I get closer to the alley I notice and extreme increase in the amount of lights that are usually around that area of town. I'm driving and thinking that I feel really good, but there is a slow realization that this is just the beginning of something huge.
