One of the cleches when it comes to drugs is 'Whoa, the colors!' Whoever said that must have been on mushrooms, because its very true. Rainbows dance across my field of vision, seemingly on everything. On peoples faces, on the walls, on pictures, even in the toilet! Everything is warped. The words 'Warped' and 'Wild' seemed to come to my mind over and over as a way to describe the trip, but in all honesty there is nothing in the human language capable of describing the feeling of being on hallucinogenic mushrooms. Its as if IÂ’m in a constant sexual explosion, always building towards orgasm. Which brings me to another topic. Sexual conduct during a mushroom trip is both good and bad. It feels totally amazing to touch another human while tripping. Actual intercourse seems to be somewhat impossible, simply because it would be hard to get my body to move in the way it would have to. Everything feels slowed down, and I move very slowly.
