It now seemed like maybe I was not god, since I didnÂ’t seem to have any physical powers. Maybe I was still myself but the shrooms had unlocked a door in my brain to allow me to see what the universe really looked like? Or maybe I had gone completely insane? The scariest part, aside from feeling like I had set in motion the end of the world, was wondering if I had just made myself insane and would never come back from it. I thought I saw other souls trapped in this nonsensical nether world with me who had also made this mistake and taken too much.
