I became aware of the presence of many around me. I had clutched my hands a mug of the rest of my tea, for I wanted to experiment with drinking half of it to begin with, and the other half after the first initial peak. But as the build up of things became greater, I could 'feel' the voice of these many entities speak to me, telling me that I had to drink all of the tea now, I had to, otherwise they would leave without me and it would all have been for naught. And so I listened, obeyed and drank, gulping the rest of my tea down quickly, yet I kept hold of the mug for it acted as an important grounding for me.
