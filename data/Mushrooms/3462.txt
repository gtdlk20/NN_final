I was sliding into the fast-moving currents of the whirlpool of confusion.  I desperately tried to grab a mental hold of something familiar - a book that I had read, a motivation for my future, or a relationship with a friend.  Each time I caught hold of something familiar, the entity was immediately ripped from my grasp, and I continued to speed around, and around, and around.  My mind was resetting itself to the beat of a slow metronome, and the period between resets was shrinking with every passing moment.  My mental faculties resembled those of a goldfish, as their memories only maintain for seconds at a time.  As soon as I would recognize where I was, my memory would reset, and I would have to teach myself the basics all over again.  To make matters worse, the ever-shortening periods between resets continually shrunk the knowledge that I could remember.  In the early stages of my confusion I would look around and remember that I was at a concert with friends, that I was living on the East Coast, was engaged in a job search, and that I was originally from Colorado, before my mind would reset and I would have to start over.  Near the epicenter of my confusion I would be questioning why I was surrounded by people when my mind would reset, thus preventing me from making any progress whatsoever.
