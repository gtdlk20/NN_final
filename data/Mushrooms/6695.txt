We take off and go to find some pot of our own (my own really, this was at my house after all), another successful score out of the way we proceed back to my place.  We chill up in my room, Z and I bust out on guitar, and A rolls a joint.  At some point we order a pizza (probably around 6 or 7 pm), none of us had really eaten at all that day and we wanted something so the shrooms wouldn't eat away our gut; A thinks it's hilarious to eat a few caps on his pizza with my mom around the corner doing laundry and my dad on the couch in plain view watching TV.  At about 9 pm back in my room I declare dose time; we pull these fat bags and start crunching away ignoring the tea idea, Mistake the first.  A and Z go through about half their bags and stop, I probably ate 3/4 of mine. The reasons for these beginning doses are as follows: Z had never tried anything beyond pot, alcohol, and cigs before, A had taken about two caps at one point in his life and hit the visual state so we thought he had a low tolerance (later finding out that the caps actually just had acid on them), and I had tripped twice in the past two years resulting in pleasant and colorful experiences.
