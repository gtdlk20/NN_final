Soon though the peak started to pass, the trip plateaued nicely into a bearable yet intensely colourful and hallucinogenic trip. I thought the worst was past us. For a while there was a feeling of fun and playfulness between us, the mood was almost light even though we were all tripping so hard we could hardly see. But soon the mood began to change, the atmosphere took on a menacing feel and it seemed to get very, very hot. I was still very excited, too excited, and was dancing around singing the words to a song that was on the TV. The heat started to overcome me, it was getting to much to bear so I was ripping off my clothes until I was only wearing my tracksuit pants. the guys I was with were almost horrified, I was still dancing about and they thought I was going to go all the way. I wasn't but the atmosphere that day was excruciatingly confusing.
