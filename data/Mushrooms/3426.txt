We started eating one after another with the jam. No taste at all only some anxiety, but very controlled. I ate 4 of them, more or less 3/4 cm in diameter. My girlfriend took 3. For the first 15 minutes we tried to focus on little changes in perception, so we were nervous. Then I laid down on my back and the first thing I said was: do you see how colourful is the sky? Then it was so fast and full of meaning that it's so difficult to report, as anyone tried. In front of me there was a tree and its cortex was full of cracks. And it was alive. It moved with tiny localised movements, like if every part of it was animated. Totally amazing. The pine needles became a surface full of filaments sliding one on another, with wave movements. I felt like I needed to feed myself with as many images as I could, so I started looking around and the first things I found were my hands. They were transparent, milky, with blue veins inside, full of tiny particles that were moving. I'm so upset that I decide to change. The ground is like a mass of moving worms, black and shining. I don't like them, so I change again. I think I closed my eyes and fell into a fantasy world, something like The Lord of The Rings. But I was taken back by a violent scream.
