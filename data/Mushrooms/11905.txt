We then decided to add visual substance to all of our deep thinking.  We visited a website on W's computer showing a type of art known as spacescapes (digitally-rendered art of the cosmos).  The images were incredibly appealing and even more interesting.  After observing the images for a few minutes we would lay back in our chairs and close our eyes.  After that, all I had to do is tell myself I was travelling through space and that was all my mind needed.  I was transported to galaxies thousands of light-years away, I visited alien cultures that thought in mindsets so different from that of humanity as to seem impossible, I saw supernovae, black holes, and a myriad of stars and planets.
