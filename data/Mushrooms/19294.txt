As we sat there listening to music, feeling uncomfortable, we decided to go outside for some fresh air. Since theres a park just outside my friends place, we decided to go there. It was about 17 deg C outside, quite comfortable, although a bit nippy. The shrooms really kicked in when we got to the park. It was now I started loosing reality. It was like; as soon as I started thinking, I experienced reality loss. It was kinda scary because it reminded me of my last LSD trip. As soon as I began talking to my friends, I kind of knew where I was, but when I started thinking to myself, reality disappeared. Spooky.
