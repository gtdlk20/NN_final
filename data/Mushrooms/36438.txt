T+1hr10mins my friends notice that I'm in my shroom-iverse, and seem pretty happy about it. We all continue to talk, and have a good time, talking especially about 'old times' and also about the concert we recently attended. I'm very fascinated with my friend playing guitar, and it strikes me as something painfully difficult to do. I begin to think about how each individual string works. It all feels very new to me at this point. So far at this point, nothing negative has occured, which is good, since I often have bad luck on shrooms, getting stuck in a negative mind-fuck state.
