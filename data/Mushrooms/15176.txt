As it would turn out, amongst our small group of friends that night, everyone would end up confiding in and enjoying each others company. Peter and I were found we were able to hide the fact we were mind-bent on these alien chemicals when interacting with Emil. We were each still lost deeply in worlds of our own, and I really couldnt contend with the others. I remember looking towards Peter at one point and saying something like, We need girlsthen, everybody. My friend replied very excitedly right away, but I kept my gaze fixated on the ground, still spaced-out in a time and place entirely of my own, and my friend was able to quickly recognize this. Peter calmed down and didnt pursue the subject any further. The words echoed inside my brain as I considered the seriousness of them.
