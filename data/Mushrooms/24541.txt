I stared at the moving cars, and roads ahead of me, and the streetlights looked like as if they were moving away. I got kicked out of the place because I was noticeable. Night was coming soon... and I was heading back 2 the bus depot and the orange lights which turn on when it got dark, started becoming very very bright. I did not know how 2 take the bus home so a friends relative drove me home.
