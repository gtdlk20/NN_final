The idea for this combination and these amounts came from previous positive experiences on maximized amounts (for Ayahuasca: as much as the guts will take  about two big mugs worth and for truffles and mushrooms: going up and up from 10 fresh grams to 10 dried grams).  Admittedly, it was Kilindi Iyi who put the idea of 20 dried grams and beyond into my mind, as consuming such absurd quantities never crossed my mind as an option before then.
