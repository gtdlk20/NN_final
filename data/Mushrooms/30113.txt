We teetered along the tilted plain on an oblique path to the upward slope, traveling a few hundred meters, when I suddenly remembered to put on my sunscreen for protection.  I asked Logos if he could extract it from my backpack, but he could not figure out which of the many pockets it was tucked into.  I took off the pack, felt so instantly RELIEVED of its water weight for a moment, took off my hat and fanned myself, felt stronger, fished out the SPF-50 lotion and -- Wait, how had it already spilled on the ground, had I opened it already!?  Never mind -- somehow that focused me to practicalities, and I slathered my arms, face, neck, stowed the sunblock, and put my pack and hat back on, feeling stronger for being practical and prepared.  Logos pointed out an Oasis of shade just ahead, which we would reach by continuing to skirt the mountain for a while, and I was glad to discover the oasis was a part of the planned path forward to the Top.
