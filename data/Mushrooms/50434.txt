While drinking my mushroom tea, I became worried but yet intrigued... I tried to ask as many questions as possible, I felt I needed to know what was going to happen to me (the other two new travellers were also worried, and this in a way calmed me)/ I was first to finish the tea, that strangely didnt taste like anything, the only thing that made me feel a bit queasy was the fact that I had drank mushrooms ( I dont like mushrooms).....
