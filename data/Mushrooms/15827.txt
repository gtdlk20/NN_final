My friend collapses and hits his head on the counter. I grab him and hold him and direct his body as he flails around. He stands up for a second, then begins to fall to the ground again, I grab him and hold him. He keeps asking for water, I hand him a glass and tell him to drink, but he just wont drink it, hes oblivious to it. I then take the jug of water and pour it on his lips and on his forehead. He takes a big gulp of air, and realizes the water. I pour more on his head. He starts to drink, I shout, 'drink more drink more!'. He drinks enough and says, 'I'm okay, I'm okay.' I sit there in shock, scared my friend is going to die, my anger subsides and I feel thankful he is alive. He looks me in the eye and says thank you for saving my life. All is good for a minute, then the bad vibes return. We exchange a few words, but tension is still high. We retreat to separate corners for a little.
