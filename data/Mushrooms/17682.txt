Now VERY pissed, I took off my glasses and closed my eyes. Sure enough, I started to make out morphing patterns behind my eyes. YES! It wasn't a waste of a perfectly good 1/8 after all! Faint, but recognizable patterns started to align my eyelids. Kaleidoscopic images and odd female-faced spider people started to come into my vision. However, these soon passed and I re-opened my eyes. This is where I realized how much my thought process was altered.
