I have learned that the best time to experience the mushrooms magic is when I feel strong, when I have no overhanging obligations, and when I can be out in nature surrounded by life. Sunshine and clear days are best for me. Also, if you have a close friend who is intelligent, a good friend who knows the alternate view, and truly values these experiences, you are lucky. I am not so fortunate.
