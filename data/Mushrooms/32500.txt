My mind has been so repulsed by what I have experienced and indeed what I have become that I make a decision. Absolutely and for certain beyond any trace of a doubt I will throw out all my remaining shrooms. I shall discard all my cultivation set up and all the info that I have on my computer. I shall never ever again hunt for shrooms. I see this decision in a vision and then I see the cost of it. I highest sacrifice that I will pay will be to never ever have a day like new years day again and I have remorse for the future lost times with my wife. I see perceptual visions (in knowledge) of the much greater and more powerful person that I will become if I follow through and clean up my life. I see other visions of all the relationship damage that I have caused by ever taking drugs and what I would have been like and where my life would have been had I never touched any substance. It will be a costly decision but I have made it and I am resolute, I will follow through.
