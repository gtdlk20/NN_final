I was sort of hoping, waiting for a dramatic moment of ego-death, and there was nothing so clear cut. Just this thinning and thinning as the cosmic winds blew through the center of where I had been until there was nothing. I could see that I am nothing, not so much that I am everything though. I felt like I'd been spun so gently up through the clouds into the ether of nothingness that there wasn't a moment of change from something to nothing - there is definitely a farther frontier of nothingness to experience. But it was very nice. I liked the stillness.
