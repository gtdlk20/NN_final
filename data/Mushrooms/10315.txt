seemed, trees, leaves, flowers, all began to pulsate and breathe, and take on a role more like a human than a simple example of plant life. So as I became one with nature, I felt their pain when I saw the cut/fallen trees. The conversation I had with my girlfriend seemed to last for hours. I had felt like I found a rip in time. Before moving onward, she picked up two leaves that had a beautiful light-white spindly pattern on them that was probably left by a couple of silkworms. All of a sudden, something amazing happened, she acted suprised and told me that the leaf she was holding was touching her. Then, after she told me, I begn to notice the plantlife feel like it was touching me back, or breathing, or dying because we had pulled them from the ground.
