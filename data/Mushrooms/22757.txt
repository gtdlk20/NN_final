7:20-This is where it began to go downhill. We had to go back to that girl's house!! In front of her mom and dad! I was sitting on her couch and they were going through their candy. Her mom asked me why I didnt have any candy. (I had thrown it all over the place earlier) I COULD NOT answer her. It was like I didnt have a mouth. I just continued to stare hopelessly at the ground. Words cannot describe the way my body felt at the moment. She asked if we were drunk and my friend just laughed it off. She went to the door to greet some trick or treaters that had just rang the doorbell and I managed to stand and walk to my friends and tell them 'we have to get out of here right now. I CANNOT do this. We have to leave!' they thought up an excuse and we got out of there and went back to my house.
