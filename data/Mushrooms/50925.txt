In our possession was what I had described as, 'a good fucking deal'. Three quarters of an ounce for some seventy dollars (Canadian). It had been divided into six equal piles, none of which amounted to more than one of us should be allowed to handle. I took most of mine and brewed it into tea, my first experience of the kind. This was in the hopes that I would avoid any intestinal trouble. We were running around an hour late, and everyone was in a rush to dose, and I wasn't able to make all the 'ground rules' as clear as I liked.
