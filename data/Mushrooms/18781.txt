So here are the set and the setting. I was some kind of tired after a week of stressing work. I was hesitating all day about taking the truffles this night. At 7pm, I took a decision. This would be the night. I prepared a music playlist on my computer: some Ravi Shankar, some Pink Floyd, some Air (french eletronic music band), Pat Metheny, Jimi Hendrix and Grateful Dead songs. I did some pranayama yoga exercies to relax before the journey, lighted some incense, and ate the truffles raw with some water to swallow more easily.
