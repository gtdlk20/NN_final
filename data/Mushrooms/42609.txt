I felt detached from reality; I was convinced that the events taking place in my mind was in fact reality, and that me in my room tripping on mushrooms was all in my head because I died. Every once in a while I would pick my head up and look at the clock and it seemed to me that the same minute was ticking over and over like it was set on a loop. The clock was never gonna pass through to the next minute. I was trapped inside the moment of my death and I would be stuck in this night forever.
