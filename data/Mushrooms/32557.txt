4:30- we got back on the trail and I was noticing that everything was a little different. By the time we got back to the cabin, I was having quite a difficult time walking, but it was all good. I just stood in the field for a bit, and my friend looked at me strangely (as it had not hit him yet). Our friend got there and I was feeling quite groovy, we headed back to the trail.
