We put on a movie and waited for the trip to begin, we ate them at about 9:15, and the magic started to begin around 10:00. I was staring at my light and it started beaming off rainbow lines, I looked over to my friend and started laughing so hard, and I couldnt stop. Everything around me was so funny, even my friends face, her pupils were enlarged to the max, and I wanted to take a picture of it so bad, but couldn't focus on anything but laughing.
