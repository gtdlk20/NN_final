A week passed and a friend came to stay with me in Maine from Wisconsin. She is a talented card reader and a friend from Skype/Facebook. She had brought the remaining amount of cubensis for us to consume. I talked to her more or less about my overall experience. She had simultaneously done her own 5 grams the same night I did. Her experience differed wildly. She had a long and fascinating conversation with an insectoid being, and had many revelations but then got sick violently. Her experience was more or less negative due to her getting ill. Five dried grams may have been too much for a hundred pound woman. She had told me prior, through her abilities, that I had a powerful female energy protecting me, so my experience with Mom did not surprise her much.
