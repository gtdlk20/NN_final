I was absolutley frying and having full hallucinations for a good 4-5 hours, before I finally fell asleep. I'm sure I could have milked it for a few more hours and then a come down, but I settled for sleep. I was coming up on 24 hours without sleep, and I'd worked 12 of them outside doing labor. I was tired when I dosed, but the mushrooms pepped me up and kept me going for the ride. I didn't even really feel the need to sleep, it just felt so nice and warm on the couch and I could see all I needed to with my eyes closed, I eventually just drifted off.
