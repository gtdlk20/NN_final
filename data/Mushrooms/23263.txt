Twenty minutes or so go by and my mind is still racing. This got me very paranoid in my head. I thought that my brain was never going to stop thinking like it was and the constant ideas about reality would be stuck with me forever. I smoked some weed to calm me and see if it would help. It brought me back up a little and I had few more visuals and it tempted me to eat some more mushrooms, so 3 of us split a half eighth. That was just what I needed to bring my visuals back and then back down with my mind at the same time.
