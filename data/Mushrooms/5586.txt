We came down slowly over a few hours.  Just before the sun began to rise and we were sane enough to communicate with non-shroomers, W's dad walked in the door.  He had spent most of the night out and went to bed for a half hour to attempt to sleep off his drunkenness before leaving for work.  He had no idea what had taken place in his absence, much to our relief.  W stayed at his house and slept the day away, and my brother and I walked home after W's dad left for work.  It was now about 7:00am (T+08:00), the sun was shining beautifully in the mountains, and the birds sang to us while we slowly enjoyed the walk home.
