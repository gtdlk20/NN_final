Annoyed that I couldn't maintain a sober state, I tried to lie down on my bed and center myself.  Lying on my back, I look up at my ceiling which is covered in asbestos and it began to move in waves, forming all sorts of patterns.  I tried to reach for my notebook again but as I tried to write, I kept losing focus and little movements from the corner of my eye distracted me too much to get anything else down on paper.  At about this time, the body load hit me full on and I began to feel heavy and weighted whenever I tried to stay upright.  I lied face down in my bead, tired of the moving ceiling, and buried my head in my pillow.  I noticed that I was incredibly disconnected from my body when I was relaxed.  The only parts of my body I was aware of were those that were flexed.  I tried to keep my body flexed for a bit, trying to hold onto my physical form but it was too awkward, as I could not flex my body all at once and it felt as if I were just a collection of disconnected parts.
