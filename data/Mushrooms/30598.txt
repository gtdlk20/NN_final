It was close to 4:30 am at this point, and I went back to my bedroom and relaxed for a while. By 5am I was quite sober again, although slight visual distortions were still present. Just after 5:20am I decided to go to sleep after a light snack of avocado on toast, and fell asleep extremely quickly.
