That being said, setting was optimal. I also ensured that my mindset be open and welcoming to whatever experience I may encounter by meditating under the light of the rising sun before my does, which alone was spiritually uplifting enough to justify the early ride out here. As I meditated, I held the ground shrooms in my lap and to my heart in order to link us spiritually before I ate them. I know many of my fellow psychonauts don't hold as strong of an affinity towards the occult and mystical as I do, but I sincerely believe that this personal blessing prepared both my mind and the product for what was to come.
