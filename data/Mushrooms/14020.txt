We realized that when we restrict ourselves, our energy is lower, thought capacity is lower, and our willingness to exit the negativity is lower. It is difficult to acknowledge our thoughts in that negative state, but the body is an indicator of our feelings. By observing our own body language and other actions, we are able to observe how we feel and get real with ourselves. If we realize this, we can emulate happy actions to help us get back to the happy place. It increases our energy to acknowledge the reason we had restricted ourself in the first place, and to stay in the positive vibe. Its not a denial of negative feelings, but a way to get to a higher vibe place and address our feelings accurately.
