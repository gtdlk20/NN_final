These varied thoughts occured to me over the span of four hours which I spent tossing and turning in my bed, hallucinating wildly and at times sobbing silently. The binding concept which tied all of these topics of contemplation and intrigue together was that mushrooms had lifted a veil on my psyche. In my stable, sober mind I am removed from these issues and drives - but I felt their immortality and constant presence under the influence of such a psychedelic. One of the telling signs of this was that throughout the trip I would think clearly 'I know this feeling - I know I've always felt this way. Certainly everyone must recognize these facts.'
