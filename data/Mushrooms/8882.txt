M found herself on the grass proclaiming she felt love, that everything loved her, and I was walking around in circles, jumping up and down, it felt like I was slowly floating. I lay down next to M, and we look up to the clouds, then an airplane flew right above us. I noticed when the plane hit the clouds, it left a trail. I yelled out loud, and suddenly it looked as if the entire sky was waving intensely, and I lost control of what I was seeing. I was at the mercy of my environment, I look wildly around, amazed at how reality was completely stripped away, the chain link fence was at an impossible angle, the distant playground and field seemed to constrict as if made of putty. I realized I had been transported to Shroomland, where nothing is as it seems. Planes were flying overhead, they looked like huge airbound locomotives. The stars (for it was nighttime now) flickered on and off, and the sky almost seemed to blend with the ground. I also started to feel sensations when I touched things, my phone, ipod. That scared me a little bit, because there seemed to be a numbing feeling in my hands, but it still felt tingly. Looking down at my hands, I was sure if I stared long enough I would be able to see my skeleton.
