The reason I gel capped them was to give the sandwich time to settle, and also because I can't stand the taste of mushrooms, and I am disgusted by the little bits that get stuck between your teeth and then expand upon being introduced to the moisture in my mouth. Since I didn't bother stuffing the gel caps very tight, 1.8 grams ended up filling 8 or 9 gel caps. I munched down the first 5 caps, watched half of Malcolm in the Middle, and then ate the other three.
