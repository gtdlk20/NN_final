9:15 P.M.  Two hours into the trip, I called my boyfriend and we talked. It was earlier this week that his reaction to someones rudeness made me believe that he was not very sane. In fact, I started to think he was a schizophrenic. When we spoke now, I understood what he was saying, perfectly, and in fact followed up with his inane ramblings for the first time, which freaked him out a bit. It was at that moment that a revelation came to me that he is in fact not present in this world. I later found out that he was taking Zoloft, clearly misdiagnosed as suffering from major depression. The Zoloft seemed to actually exacerbate his obsessive compulsive disorder. This conversation made me realize that it is not for me, this life, his life is not my life and I cant suffer because of his madness. (To the reader this may sound cruel, but in the next two weeks, before we broke up, he deconstructed our relationship in the most horrible ways, and made me feel like I am not a human being - in a negative sense and in a positive sense.) So this conversation, which occurred as I watched the tendrils flow, was important. When I hung up, I went out to the patio for another cigarette and sat down on a bench.
