Sorry dude, Im going to have to electrocute your snout, my friend John greeted at the door.  What What? I replied frantically  Dude, I said, Die pet tricks! Mo clesh razim dolphin elfin zippers, sorry man.  I was totally confused. Could not understand him.  Ethan, my fucking electricity is out, Im sorry dude, He slowly repeated.  Finally I understood. John knew it was going to be a long night.  His apartment was illuminated only by a few candles. There was no TV, no music, no form of entertainment. I horrible queeze was disclosing through my stomach, causing me to tremble. An overwhelming feeling of fear and uncertainty took hold of me.  At first my two friends who had also taken a small amount of the shrooms, Duddey and Fat Chad where chattering back and forth with John. I couldnt understand them. Then there was silence. We all sat at opposite sides of the room, giving each other the strangest looks. I had the assumption that I could read their minds.
