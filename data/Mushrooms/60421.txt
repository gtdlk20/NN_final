After bolting, I sat on a corner bench for a very long time, but I couldn't focus enough to read the bus schedule, so I just sat there forever. Finally, I got up and started to walk south. Everything I was seeing was shaky. Every time I tried to relax, things became more distorted, pixelated. When I strained to concentrate, I could only focus for a moment.
