I could see my wife from where I was lying on the floor and she took on this sparkling halo around her whole body form.  She shimmered like a mirage. She was still upset and looked more so to me under the influence of the shrooms. She was my sad sparkling angel and I would get extremely melancholy thinking that I was responsible for her mood. But if I looked away and talked to Jen who was splayed out on the couch and taking things as they came, my mood would immediately skyrocket to the ecstatic euphoria. Then I would feel guilty that once again Ann and Kate were not enjoying themselves. I was shocked at the effect that others' emotions were having on mine. I was shocked at the effect that others' emotions were having on mine. Normally I am a pretty empathetic person and it seemed to have gone to the extreme for me. Obviously this is great if youÂ’re hanging with some up people, but not if you are with people having a bad trip.
