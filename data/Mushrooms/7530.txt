On the way back home we walked through campus and it hit me.  I was walking in thought, almost spacing, and the person that was still with it but was also tripping asked me if I was alright.  That sent my trip to its purpose.  I had been merely walking with my head down in thought.  That is Adam.  I had to explain to them that since they were not the normal people that I trip with that I had to dub myself something, so I said, 'That is just Adam-thinking.'  That is me.  The people I normally trip with are close friends and they know me and they know that walking with my head down in thought is who I am.  These people needed a title so that they understood that I am Adam-thinking.
