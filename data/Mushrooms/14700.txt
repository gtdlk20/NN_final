When the realization of the universe being a loop that IÂ’ve lived an infinite amount of times, its like life suddenly disappeared, I transcended. I was above and beyond time and space and felt connected with the universal meta-consciousness. I started to wonder if I broke my brain, I was convinced that no matter what I did next I would be okay because I am going to exist forever in this never-ending loop. I was terrified and omniscient at the same time, time completely disappeared.
