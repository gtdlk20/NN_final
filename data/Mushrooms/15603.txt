I dont recall noticing the fractals gradually increasing in power or anything but suddenly whenever I shut my eyes there would be endless pairs of eyes and faces staring back at me whilst constantly moving whenever I shut my eyes there would be endless pairs of eyes and faces staring back at me whilst constantly moving. I would see these side-on images of what Ive decided to call alien-goddess type entities some of which had an almost Ancient Egyptian look to them, I saw plenty of the type of fractal like faces that I see in Alex Grey art that seem to proceed infinitely into the background. As I looked at them and they looked back at me I said out loud I can talk to you...Can you talk to me? Should I talk to you? I would see mechanical type fractals as well, the type that people do sometimes report seeing. I walked into the bathroom again briefly (as I would do many times this night) and I cant recall if my eyes were shut but I saw what appeared to be a male being of light and when I looked into at his head there was nothing there except the light just seemed to recede back infinitely making me gasp and mutter Oh my god...
