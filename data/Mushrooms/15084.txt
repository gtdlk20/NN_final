Most users agree that they dont find themselves very hungry during the psychedelic experience, as they are too caught up in the trip. However, I recommend stocking up on at least some light snacks ahead of time, and bottled water. The textures of food can be extraordinary while stoned on psychedelics, and in my experience fresh fruits tend to be the best snacks available. As for apparel, its best to wear something comfortable and loose-fitting which can be slipped on and off effortlessly. Remember, theres probably a likely chance youll fall asleep in what youre wearing.
