H went inside and I walked upstairs to my girlfriend's room.  I walked in and immediately noticed the beautiful color arrangement of her bed.  Her comforter was a glowing purple and her pillow was a bright green.  Her desk lamp cast down light over an assortment of trash on her desk and I thought it would look great as a painting.  I didn't tell her this since she was mad hungover from the night before and doesn't endorse my drug habit.  The highlights in her hair were so bright and pleasing and I crawled into bed beside her.  She and her roommate L were watching TV.  I tried to watch but couldn't focus on it so I turned my attention to her room.  I began feeling confined again so I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to go get some food.  She said 'No, but maybe later.'  After hearing this some panic arose in me.  I thought about leaving but I didn't have an excuse.  She's never tripped so she couldn't understand how I was feeling.
