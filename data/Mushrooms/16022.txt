2:30 - Ego battle.  Im convinced Im the Buddha and try to grab my computer to write down or record my insights.  This proves to be almost beyond comprehension.  The computer seems foreign and confusing.  I have to try to pull myself out of the ecstatic state to even turn it on.  I eventually manage to turn it on and open notepad.  I have no idea how long this took but it seemed like forever.  This focus on tactile experience seems to have pulled me largely out of the insight state - although I am still completely stoned and the computer screen and whole room is twisting and contorting like mad.   I decide to embark on a quest to locate my other joint and lighter.  That took a while
