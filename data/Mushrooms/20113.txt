As I write this, a month later, I dont really remember what happened for awhile after that; I should have written this all down the next day.  Im not sure how long I stayed on that plateau, but I remember that the experience was more of the same.  I just further explored all the thoughts that had been pouring through my skull, and looked at everything with a sense of wide-eyed wonder.
