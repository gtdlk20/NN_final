I understood and respected that this drug was much riskier when used alone, and if a bad trip were to result thered be no telling what would happen, especially with no one else there to talk me back to reality. A bad trip could quickly spiral out of control, especially for a newcomer. I knew that if I did choose to trip alone, I would be taking a foolish gamble with my own sanity, but felt like Id be able to handle it in the end. I had grown accustomed to feeling isolated over the course of my entire life, and I had almost completely convinced myself that I enjoyed it. I suppose that, deep down, I knew myself well enough to know this wasnt honestly the case. I still had nothing but love for my friends, and it wouldnt be right to keep such a gift from them. Hell, I still hadnt even fully decided if I was going to do the drug yet.
