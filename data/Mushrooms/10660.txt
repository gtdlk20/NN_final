For some time I was saving most of the mushrooms until I could meet up with my friends and share it with them, but it was summer now and school was over, so I had no way of meeting up with them. So the other night I was watching Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and I guess I just decided to do the large dose of shrooms I was planning on doing. Maybe it was watching Hunter Thompson trip on acid, or maybe I was just plain sick of waiting. My friend J recommended that I just start off with like 1 gram, but the people I know who are heavy drug users implied that more was needed to get a good trip going.
