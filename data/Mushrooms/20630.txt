I started growing Cubensis  4 years ago, used shrooms for one and a half years then stopped for around the same time period. I had a couple of 6 gram trips during that period and they were intense, two were fantastic, the last I went to hell. That was not fun at all, since then been a bit nervous in using high doses.
