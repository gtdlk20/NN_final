Through the walk to the peak (of the mountain) I overhear some things my partners were saying and the mushroom was answering all their questions in my own head like it was so obvious such as What is time. In response to this visions of huge slideshows of earth spinning and the land I was currently walking The time is now! It cried over again. Walking through the forested area the surroundings would separate and overlap themselves as if I were seeing two images on top of one another.
