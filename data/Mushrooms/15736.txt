I layed back down and looked around my room and began to see that everything was made up of miniscule patterns all conjoined to make up a barely conceivable grand design.   I was also able to 'see' my room in perfect clarity and color with my eyes closed. This continued and some other visuals that I don't completely remember continued until about 2am at which point I have no recollection of what happened afterward. At about 4am I remember looking at my watch, not knowing where I was and not remembering what had happened during the past 2 hours. After I realized my surroundings and gathered myself, I fell into the worst and most unexplainable depression that I have ever experienced (depression is very uncommon for me, I am usually a very happy or in a good mood). The depression fortunately lasted only about 15 or 20 minutes after which it faded away. Even though I was no longer hallucinating I was unable to sleep all night.
