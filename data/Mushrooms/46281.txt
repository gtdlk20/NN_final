We headed back up and went to look at Stingray Cove while the feeder was there. The Stingrays were very very weird, especially when they put their head up and you could see their mouth while they ate. We didnt stay long though because Tim, Cathi and K wanted some food. Esther and Dylan wanted to have a cigarette first though so I waited outside with them while they smoked. Although we told the others wed meet them inside instead we sat there for 20 minutes talking about drugs and how every parents passing buy gave us evils. They obviously believed we were there to sell heroin to there children.
