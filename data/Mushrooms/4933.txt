12:45AM Major effects are felt right now. Now I am currently typing on the computer for this shroom trip. The PC screen is a kaleidoscope of colors. Its so beautiful. It is like an unusual anomaly, Im actually seeing a beehive of intricate networks in my screen, like a series of stars of color on a blank pallet. The keyboard also feels very different, its harder to type and my muscle memory is more difficult to perform. I feel that I should only act as a spectator to this event that is unfolding.
