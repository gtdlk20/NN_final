I cleaned up my room (in my parents' house) as I usually did before tripping and prepared a little failsafe in the form of a glass of water with a big vitamin C tablet next to it in case anything went wrong. I waited till about 9:30 AM for my mom to go to sleep. My dad was watching tv downstairs and I was sitting at my desk in my attic room ready to eat the sacrament.
