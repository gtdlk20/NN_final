4:53 I came to terms that I wasnt making progress in silent darkness, so I was cheerfully ready to go play outside like a child in the beautiful daylight. I opened the door and peeked my head out into the bright, colorful daylight to make sure nobody was around. I walked up the stone stairs and cautiously checked my corners. The coast was clear all around so I started meandering the property talking to myself, making funny noises and touching things. (I tried to untwist a vibrant rusty metal nut attached to a bolt in the wall, and the metal felt squishy) Everything was so fun! Occasionally I stopped to scan my surroundings and make sure nobody was around and that I wasnt doing anything risky. I did realize once in a while that I was being quite loud, and I hoped nobody saw me acting weird.
