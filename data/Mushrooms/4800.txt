Through my cyclical thoughts I came to that stunning realization over and over, again until it transformed into a sort of buzzing acceptance. I felt uplifted having surrendered my irrational need for control. I felt as though I had been raised up by something beyond myself, I felt comforted as I floated on and through waves of cosmic consciousness, and being grazed ever so lightly by that which is. I felt a profound feeling of acceptance that I had never experienced before despite the bizarre sights I was witnessing. It was the Fourth of July, and there were fabulous explosions overhead. I had at this point no concept of language so the human-like figures buzzing around me appeared to be speaking alien tongues. I marveled at this situation as I lay in the middle of a small clearing. After the sky finished its dance, the traffic swarmed. I could not grasp why everyone was so agitated and hurried. The honking and yelling was roaring, yet I felt as though I was in my own globe of peace. I wished that other people could put away their preoccupations with the future and come take a rest with me and relish in the beautiful night.
