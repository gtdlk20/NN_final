We finally got to the rocks, (+0:40) which were catching so much sun now.  We laid our towels down on one of them.  I laid out a quilt that my grandmother had made me before I went to college, it was hundreds of squares of a full spectrum of colors, and I was hoping it would be interesting to have while tripping.  I had no idea.  I immediately ran for the ledges that overlooked the river; I had been here many times before and I wanted to get one jump into the river before the drugs hit too hard.  I went up to the ledges, where a half-dozen teenagers were daring each other to jump.  I stepped off naturally, felt the cold sting of the water -- all quite natural sensations.  Getting out of the water, I went up to the ledge with Syph and Sugar, with Dummer (the sitter).  We sat at the top in the sun, looking into the water.
