Nick handed me two bags of mushrooms.  One bag appeared to be slightly more filled than the other.  He explained to me that they were basically equal amounts and that the bag which was less full contained slightly more psilocybin than the other.  I handed Margo the fuller bag and stared at the contents in my own bag.  They looked moldy and old.  Nick brought us orange juice.  James had already swallowed his Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds.  Hawaiian Baby Woodrose is supposed to produce a longer trip than mushrooms, so in order for us all to peak at relatively the same time, he had eaten his about an hour earlier.
