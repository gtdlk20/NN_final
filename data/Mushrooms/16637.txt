It took along time for me to get over that trip. For awhile after words just thinking about taking mushies would send me into a full blown anxiety attack, trembling, cold sweats, heart palpitations etc.. Eventually I was able to intergrate that experience and after years of introspection and reflection I can say that that trip definitely changed for the better.
