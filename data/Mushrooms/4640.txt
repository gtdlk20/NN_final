It was a bit after noon on August 8th when I decided to go for it. It had been quite a while since I had flown shroom airlines and the last flight had too much turbulence for my taste.  My wife Suzy and I had decided to stay around the cabin all day- a chillout day on our week vacation in Vermont.  Our trip had started on an amazing note. A year ago I put together a memorial video for a woman who's husband was dying of Lou Gherig's disease. He died in September. When we arrived at the cabins we noticed a small wooden plaque by a tree a few feet from our door. It was a tribute to the man I had made the video for. WOW. The Universe is stranger than I can possibly imagine. This filled me with a wonderful sense of wellness. Of balance. I felt the set and setting were perfect for a psychedelic trip.
