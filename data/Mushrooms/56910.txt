Since it's pretty hard to take mushrooms wrong, and I have defintly felt effects off of one gram before, I only conclude that it was the age that effected them. I hadn't had a lot to eat, at no point did I vomit or anything, there shouldn't be any reason they didn't work. But did not. My friend, the next day, also reported never having felt any effects.
