Our refridgerator is an industrial sized one that is made of a shiny metal material, I want to say chrome but I'm not quite sure. Regardless of that, I stared at the fridge, fascinated by the way the light reflected off of it. It seemed to take on a whole new level of depth an intrigue. I guess I stared at this for a long time (I want to say about 15 minutes), and by this point people knew I was fucked up on something: who else other than the man tripping balls on hallucinogenics would stare at a refridgerator? People would open the fridge to grab their drinks and what not, but I would yell at them for 'interrupting the continuity of the fantastic appliance'. One of my friends asked me what I was tripping on (I have a reputation as the resident druggie), and that's when I realized the mushrooms had hit me full on.
