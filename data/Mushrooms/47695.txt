It had been about 2 hours I guess but it felt like we had been tripping all day. I could see Indian tribal faces in the walls like the ones on the front cover of Axis:Bold as Love. These faces were trying to tell me something in my mind that I could not understand. I felt on was on the verge of something that I had no knowledge about.
