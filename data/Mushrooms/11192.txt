Then another person that was there (all people who came to my rescue were trippin too) pointed out that my shirt read 'From out of the depths'. How true. Looking back at that trip, it was by far the most amazing experience I've ever had. Even though the paranoia was incredibly frightening, all in all, it was amazing. I looked at everything differently. The trees and cars and birds. But especially, myself. I am a much happier person now. I also realized what in my life was holding me back and what I had to cut out of my life. I totally have plans to do shrooms again in the future. Just not near as many and never again alone.
