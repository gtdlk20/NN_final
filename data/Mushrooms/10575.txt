Josh and I were kind of hungry, but were worried that eating something heavy would ruin the trip, so we decided to make some microwave popcorn. Opening the door and leaving the room was like entering another world. Although Josh's house is very familiar to me, it seemed like it was a whole new place. We walked into the kitchen, avoiding eye contact with his mom, who was in the living room. As the popcorn popped, his mom entered the kitchen. I opened the refrigerator, acting as though I was looking for a drink. She talked to us for a minute, and we managed to avoid looking at her. As the microwave stopped, the screen said 'Enjoy'. I mouthed a 'Thank you' at the microwave, believing the 'Enjoy' was a sincere send-off, and not just something the microwave was programmed to do. People say eating while tripping isn't anything special, but I disagree. Josh and I took our first mouthful, and the taste and texture were so good that we starting laughing because of it, half-chewed popcorn spilling out of our mouths at the same time. We finished and began drinking some root beer when the peak of the experience began.
