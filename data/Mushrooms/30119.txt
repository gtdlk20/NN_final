I heard thunderous slow cracking noises as shards were kicked or set free.  There were many such shards, and it occured to me they were all in motion down the mountain, just too slowly to see outside of mountain time.  In many places the ramping slope had been broken by erosion and by cleavage into occasional steps to hop and climb, and I could see exactly how the mountain was melting in its own time frame, and the rivers of its downward flow were as easy to see, as the breathing iridescent island of trees above.  We walked upward against that same flowing river of gravity.
