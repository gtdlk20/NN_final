My previous experiences with mushrooms were from very low-potent ones so I would consider this report a 'first-timer's' report. The only effects that I had in my two earlier mushrooms sessions were feeling a bit giggly and restless, and that could've easily been a placebo effect, which is absolutely nothing compared to this one.
