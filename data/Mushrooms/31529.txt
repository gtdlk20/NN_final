(6-7hrs) The walk back was much quieter than the walk there. I think we were both just taking in the experience. We saw so many people out walking and we commented on how it was like people were migrating out from hibernation. We saw a squirrel sitting by a pile of nuts, unaware for a moment of our presence. As we talked excited about the squirrel, he ran out in traffic just as two cars were coming in both directions. We both started cheering the squirrel to the other side. The squirrel dodged the cars and sat on the other side of the road in a tree. I felt so connected to that squirrel and I was really thankful he wasnÂ’t hit. Stepping onto the gravel path near his house, he suggested that we stay silent down the path. We walked in silence to the end of the drive. When we got to the house we found a freshly dug fire pit outside his house with chairs and cement blocks around it. His roommate had dug the pit during the day and left it for us to find when we got back. He went inside to find his roommate. I stayed outside. Seeing one of the chairs by the fire, I sat and watched the beautiful sunset unfold. The sky was pink and I watched the birds fly back and forth across sky. The sound of the birds singing was so beautiful and peaceful.
