This is also were my memory goes fuzzy.  I remember watching my room for ages, while my self-awareness was constantly shrinking.  The last thing I recall is lying back down on the bed, with almost no difference between open and closed eyes.  My brain was just not working anymore, associations not made.  I resurfaced about 20 minutes later.  That was the weirdest part:  I just opened my eyes and everything was back to normal.  Obviously there were still minor visuals, like beautiful patterns everywhere and extra digits with the watch, but I was able to comprehend myself and my surroundings again.  This went away quick too, and after an hour I was left with nothing but a that deep feeling of suggestability.  It was as if anything that wanted could enter my deepest subconscience through my wide-open eyes.  My pupils were as big as I'd ever seen them.  This part lasted longer than from ingestion.  I was going to meet for the first time with my ex girlfriend since we broke up, and being open helped a lot.  She had not accepted the breakup, but my condition somehow allowed me to see all the reasons clearly and convey them to her.  In the end we parted again as friends, but this time both of us meant it.  The next day I awoke refreshed and ready for the world.
