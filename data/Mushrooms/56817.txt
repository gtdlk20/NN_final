That night I learned alot about myself and my friends and how reflective things in your life are of oneself. After that night I started thinking about life alot more and realizing the beauty that we dont realize in our everyday fast life. I found out that everything has a soul, noone is alike, and shrooms, if used right, can be the key to solving some problems one has in life and finding oneself.
