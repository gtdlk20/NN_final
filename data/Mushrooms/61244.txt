Then high school came around. We had moved back to a town we lived in a few years ago so my dad could work at a school in a nearby town. My dad wanted me to join Speech and Debate, and I agreed as long as I could still smoke. But there was a catch. Because of well-meaning but ignorant anti-drug initiative on the school's part, they had to drug test us for every student activity, meaning I couldn't smoke pot. This devastated me.
