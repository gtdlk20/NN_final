Let me begin by saying I am an experienced drug user.  The only things I haven't done at least 10 times are maybe Meth, Heroin, Mescaline, or some weird South American herbs.  I am also a very logical, skeptical person.  Every time I hear someone doing acid or shrooms and 'seeing men appear and start talking to them' I feel like punching them.  Sure, walls start breathing, euphoria, etc.  My friend even passed out and entered a detailed dream before, but usually I disregard most stories since they seem exaggerated.  I'm only telling you this so that you can trust I'm giving an honest story of what exactly happened to me.
