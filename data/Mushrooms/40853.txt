After we got home we had a beer and chatted in the den for a couple hours when at 2:00am it suddenly hit Andy. He was tripping. A '4/10' as he described it. He had difficulty telling detailed stories and experienced some low intensity but enjoyable visuals like breathing walls, brightening of colors and a static quality to his vision when it was out of focus. About 2:30am we decided to go upstairs so I could lie down and he was happy to do so since the den was given him a 'bad, ominous feeling'. By 4:00am we were tucked in and ready for bed.
