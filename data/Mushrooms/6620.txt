Whilst outside I also became aware of my breathing, and it felt like I couldnt breath properly, because it felt like I was breathing more deeply than normal, and it almost felt as though I needed to breath more often. I think this was in my mind though, because I cant see any reason why I would have needed to breath more deeply and rapidly because I was tripping. I also lost and gained awareness of my breathing problems at different times, probably because I simply forgot about the problem and it ceased to be one because it was all in my mind. This didnt help my trip at all though; it was another uncomfortable thing that helped drag me down.
