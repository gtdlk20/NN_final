The people driving by seemed so inferior to me.  What I focused on was the road.  It started to kind of wave around slowly like an ocean.  I laughed to myself again because no one else noticed the street was melting.  We started to walk back into the theater and as I walked by people, they seemed so small and inferior.  Like they were just scenery set up there for the sole purpose of confusing me.  I'd see people with weird faces, parents yelling at their kids.  I walked up the front of the theater with lights all above the walkway.  To my surprise I felt as if I was towering over everyone.  My legs felt very long and jelly-like.
