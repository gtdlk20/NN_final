Eventually I fell asleep, and had to deal with the consequences of being sober and exhausted the entire next day. To make it worse, whenever someone would say something to me, it just made me confused and all I wanted to do was sit - or lie - down and rest. For a truly inspiring self-awareness trip, taking them while alone was not all that scary or horrible, but I won't do it again - I'd much rather be around friends, and have someone to talk to - because that's all I wanted to do for a good portion of my trip, and I learned that sometimes weird phone calls are not appreciated! Furthermore, the stems that I had stuffed into my pocket seemed to disintegrate - or I just lost them at some point - but there was only a bit of shake at the bottom of my pocket the next day. I still have that in my jacket pocket as a reminder of my psychedelic experience. :)
