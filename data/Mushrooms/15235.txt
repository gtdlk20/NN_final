Ok so like I said J got the Mush, S provided the car for the J could get the Mush, M gave his usual denial from our gang trips, and I like always provided the room (in the basement of my house), the food and the research to make sure we didn't get any shit. I was suspicious seeing as the guy wanted to get 'rid' of it. I later learned that since it was in July, the fresh batch would get in for September and October 'peak times'. Still it was fully dried, no mold, no fungus (other than the shroom itself of course) and was P. cubensis that I am sure. We chose the ones we wanted from the ounce before Rocko and I sold, myself I chose a monster weighting 3.2 and cut 2 g. from it exactly.
