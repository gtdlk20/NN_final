At this point I felt the overwhelming urge to lie down.  I did so on the couch in my living room.  The couch cushions seemed to move under me.  I would breath out and the couch would rise under me.  If I inhaled the couch felt like it was sinking.  It seemed to me that the couch was breathing in time with me, with it's inhalation matching my exhaling.  It was a comforting feeling. I glanced up at one point to look around the room.  The love seat that matches the couch was in my line of vision and the dots that are part of the design on the upholstery seemed to move.  It was as if hundreds of lady bugs were crawling over the surface of the couch.  The couch seemed as if it possessed the ability to feel.  It seemed very sad.
