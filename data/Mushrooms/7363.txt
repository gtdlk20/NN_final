With nothing other than the motivation to have an extremely fun time prompting us, 10 of my friends and myself made plans to travel to a nearby cabin owned by a friend's uncle in the mountains. Of course, for a trip of this sort- excuse the horrible pun- we would need plenty of supplies.  Eight of us planned to shroom; two of our friends brought acid;  our relatively sober friend (the only person not on psychedelics) brought with him plenty of pot and beer as well.
