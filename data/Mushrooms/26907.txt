It wasnÂ’t long, about 10 more minutes and my floating through 'local,' by local I mean earthly, hyperspace stopped.  Wherever I was, was dwarfed by something so huge I would question whether or not it could dwarf the entire universe.  This 'thing' I cannot describe, you would have to see for yourself.  I can only call it 'God' or 'Lord' to describe the 'ultimate ness' and 'intensity' of this 'thing.'
