On Friday I had an incredible mushrooms experience. I'd only done them once before, in a dark tent, and it was a horrible experience and I was wary of doing them again.  So I ate them anyways. When they hit I was in the car on the way to the dealers house.  We got more and went back to a friends house.  There were six people in total but my friend and I were the most fucked and no one else could understand our jibberish.  We could understand each other though. Most of the time we were just laughing because everything, even me passing her a glass and saying 'drink this' was hysterically funny.  I noticed a vase of flowers. We each grabbed one and spent the next 3 hrs dunking it in water and splashing it on ourfaces.The drops of cold water felt so amazing running down my face.  Then we sat on the floor and peeled and ate tangerines.  The smell and taste of them was the best thing I d ever eaten.  I took one and squeezed it and the juices ran down my hand and I licked them and it was awesome.
