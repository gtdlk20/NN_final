I find myself having a slightly higher tolerance to psilocybin then most, or rather because I've done them numerous times and the effects feel more familar now as a result,so the first coming up effects aren't normally felt until about 1-2 hours, for myself depending on dosage. My friends began to feel the effects rise before I did, about 30-45 minutes as I expected.  At around an hour I got extreme nausea, which I've experienced in the past, but because of the dosage the nausea was much stronger. I would say that, for me, the coming up time prior to the peak becomes more uncomfortable as the dose rises.  Everyone sat around listening to music as we felt such strange feelings. A few of us had smoked some weed, and the mushrooms effects were intensified.  I began to feel as if everything around me was somewhat leaning toward me, kinda like the walls seemingly closing in on oneself.  The effects seemed to rise fairly quick and I would notice more and more visualizations.  Waving like patterns flowing around most objects.  Wall paper patterns seeming to creep around on the wall moving from spot to spot.
