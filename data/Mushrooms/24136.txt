Around 2:00 we were becoming our own selves again, but we were agitated. I don't know why TK was but I was because I missed feeling like a child, and being care free. Also we both got terrible stomache cramps. Overrall though, the trip was amazing, and I will deffinatly do it again, and I am happy to know that somewhere inside my mind, there is still that care free happiness of a child.
