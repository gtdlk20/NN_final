This had to be one of the most profound life changing events to ever happen to me.  I truly lost who I was and entered a new state of being.  It was scary at times but it also had moments of beauty and oneness.  I saw things I have never seen before and felt things I never knew I would feel.  I'm glad I put myself through this. And I'm glad I had my brother to be there with me, he is the best friend I have.  I love all those with me and I love all those in my life that could not be with me that day as well.  This made me realize how much I really do love this reality I live in, even if it can be questioned, these other people with me are real, they are a part of the one true strange and amazing trip everyone takes...
