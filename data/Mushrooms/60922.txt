I turn away and head for the kitchen...I opened the pantry door and saw all the bags and cans...all seemed alien...I grab the bag of cheetos and start walking to my room.. I was so damn sure I was going to spill these cheetos (the bag was sealed with a paper clip) that I walked at speeds of three back to my lair...
