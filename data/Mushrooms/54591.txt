To wrap this experience up, this trip made me feel like mushrooms grow on this earth to send some sort of message. There is no way that these chemicals are present in an edible form for no particular reason. This sounds like shamanic spiritual bullshit, but I believe psychedelic mushrooms contain a message that deals with the appreciation of nature; to rip apart the membrane that separates our consciousness from nature's true form. I greatly appreciated eating mushrooms in a natural environment, rather than watching trippy movies and playing video games... The message may grow in cow dung, but it has profound meaning.
