The next day I experienced quite a bit of depression throughout the day, and I was tired and quite restless, but nothing too bad or out of the ordinary. I think that because of the intensity and extraordinary nature of tripping reality seems too slow and dull for it to be an enjoyable state of consciousness for me, although this never lasts more than a day or so. I certainly feel no need to experiment with ﾂ全tones or ﾂ全hrooms for a while, and Iﾂ知 glad that I have learned some hard lessons from the ﾂ全tones, rather than from some less forgiving drug.
