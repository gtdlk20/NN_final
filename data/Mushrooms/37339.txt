We asked him how the shroom-hunting was today.  In response, he took a ziplock full of about a pound of fresh shrooms out of his bag.  D and I stared in surprise and barely restrained glee.  The kid directed us to where he had been hunting, and D and I took off toward it at a run.  After another fence-vault we spotted more hunters picking through a field.   I was struck by the sight.  Whether they were dealers or just kids out for kicks, they seemed to strike a chord in my mind that could best be described, perhaps, as romantic.  Outlaw farmers, utilizing the part of the ranchers trade that would have gone unused.  They were taking the by-product of an agricultural industry to get to a mental state forbidden by law.  It was beautifully rebellious.
