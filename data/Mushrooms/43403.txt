Then after about 45 minutes from injestion there came amazing visuals.  I remember specifically listening to the Chemical Brothers in the car.  There was a series of billboards that lined themelves up in the distance and they began to sprout tops to them that created a giant spectrum analyzer across the horizon.  The visuals had kicked in a little before hand when I noticed that my eyes began to lose focus in rhythm to the music.  It made an illusion that the lights were glowing to the beats.  They became more and more intense until I knew it peaked, about 2 hours after injestion.  I was sitting in the back of the car driving late at night, when I hallucenated myself in the middle of a green field.  There was a a forrest in the distance, and tall green grass all around me.  As I turned my head I did not see the car or the road.  I saw this pasture I had teleported to.  Then I snapped out of it.  I didn't know what had just happened.  I felt I had gone to another world, even if just for an instant.  It was great.  Upon arrival we watched 'Waking Life,' an excellent movie to watch coming down I must say.
