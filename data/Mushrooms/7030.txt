Then I said I wanted to go outside and see the world. He wanted to, also. I opened my window and A looked outside at the trees. They were so defined, and the rain was falling steadily. It sounded like a rainstick being upturned. Then the tree immediately outside my window went from a yellow hue to a red, then to an orange, and to a green. We never found out if it was from carlights down the street, but it was so gradual, like one of those fiberglasss toys you give a kid. It tastes like... pink, said A when he ate a Mento candy. We got dressed, each took another half-gram of mushrooms, and walked outside. On the way out, we passed my roommate. Howre you guys doing? she asked us. We smiled big, Hey. Hey, we both said. I started laughing. I could hear my roomie laughing as she got to the room, sort of chuckling. As long as you guysre okay...
