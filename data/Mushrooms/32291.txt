T+ 01:00. By this time me and B were alone together with out a sitter. I remember sitting at the park on a bench just looking around. My visuals were quite intense: melting, twirling, cartoonish color schemes. Objects tended to shrink, and get bigger, and breath, and appear alive. Sitting on the bench felt like we were on a huge mass of wood about 500 feet tall, and we were looking out at the scenery like we were looking over the Grand Canyon.
