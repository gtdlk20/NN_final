Accompanied by a multiplicity of rending noises I take off into inner space. Into the giddying free flight of iridescent light. Light in the newborn realm. Light of the revelation, of the great expanse wending through the frames of all that is and will be. Flashing towards the universal agnostic event horizon. We dance on the knife edge of time. I am me and we and them all floating in the swirling pools of opaline lights. I, god and the expanse. This is the start of the framework of existence. Splash the tongue of white flame in the super intoxicating giant. The moonlight into fast light all along the line of bright lights. It the joining and rejoining of infinite spires of light.
