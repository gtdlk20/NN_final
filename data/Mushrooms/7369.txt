It is hard to express in words where the mushrooms took me that afternoon.  Prevalent among all the scattered thoughts and realizations that I dealt with was the overwhelming knowing that this was it, this was existing.  My life force was in use;  my existence was attuned to nature and the beautiful Earth all around me.

I later found out that it was odd-looking ice, but at that moment it seemed to be some sort of by-product of the Earth.  This realization sent my mind down a million different paths.  I realized that the Earth was simply that;  a beautiful planet.  We as humans, simply sharing the Earth with the rest of the animals,  had no right to claim it.
