By the time I was 18, which I am now, I found myself growing mushrooms off of rice cakes in an aquarium. The set up is cheap but maitnence is half the work. Me and my boyfriend (we'll call him Guido) learned the techniques off the internet and after researching spores, I decided on a particular strain from a patricular company (I'm not sure if I can list either of thier names so I'm not going to) and began to grow.
