We start playing football with some friends(BAD IDEA). Then the shrooms started hitting us so we walked back to my house.  We both lied on the grass in my backyard and staired at the stars.  I felt a more extreme body high then ever before but my mind kept telling me I wasnt on anything.  The stars were moving but I convinced myself there were just a lot of shooting stars that night or something.  I looked over at sean and he was rubbing his face on my stucko wall proclaiming how great it felt.  My dad came home with mc donalds so I grabbed a bag of food and left.  We went to walk seans dog.
