At around 3 or 4 pm we decided to take a long walk through the woods and across a frozen lake to the ruins of a burned out hotel. The whole trip took about 2 hours. It was pretty cold but not bad. We were all bundled up with big jackets and stuff. There was a good 3 feet of snow on the ground. We brought the bag of mushrooms with us and I decided to eat a lot of them when we got to the ruins. For some reason all my buddies chickened out there and so I took them alone. I'm not sure exactly how much I took but at least 4 grams.
