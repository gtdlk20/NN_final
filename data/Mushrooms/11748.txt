I didn't do too well at frisbee because I was feeling very detached from my body but yet a part of everything else.  I've never felt so close and connected to nature.  I felt so at ease when the breeze blew over me.  I wasn't halucinating yet but the colors were definetely brighter than ever and very very interesting.  I reacted emotionally to everything that happened.  Whenever we were in a good rythm with the frisbee and weren't dropping it I was so happy and warm but when we dropped it and lost that rythm I felt scared somehow like my trip was going to take me over.  I remember looking at all the trees to see if I could see anything.  I wasn't halucinating but the patterns on the bark of the tree held my interest for a good time.  H told me 'Dude, throw it back!'
