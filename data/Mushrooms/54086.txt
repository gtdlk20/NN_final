Then I decide I gota go wonder around my house because Im wide awake like Mcmurphy who is surprisingly in control of herself for this being her first trip and just witnessing two total break downs from partialy expierenced shroomers. But as I try to leave to go smoke a bong of headys Akmed says that hes sorry and he doesnt want me to go because he feels good that Im there with him so I decide that I have to be there for him and stay. Then Lucifer says that he has to puke it up so he goes in my bathroom. A few minutes later Akmed says that he senses that Lucifer needs help so I go and check it out. I walk in and see Lucifer in his boxers next to my toilet full of half digested fungus. He looks at me and says he is burning up and he needs to get in the shower and I just look at him and say no way cause my parents room is right down the hall and its really fuckin weird to take a shower at 3 AM at my house. But he is begging me and telling me that he knows its not too cool of him but he has to have water on him. So I give in and turn the water on for him and he gets in and lays down. I chill with him for about ten minutes then tell him I gota get sum air and il check back on him in five minutes. I go back to my room and try my hardest to cheer up Akmed and then check back on Lucifer then go back to my room and tell Akmed that it would be for the best if he went to go talk to Lucifer cause they are best friends and after a litle persuading he agrees to get up and talk to him. Then I get a towel for Lucifer and we get him out of my shower and back to my room to pass out.
