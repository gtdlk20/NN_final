With my mind now free from the clenches of anxiety, nerves, and intense focus relating to the IV dosage, I realize a tidal wave of MDMA is roaring through my body.  I am feeling a rapid release of cares and worries, something that typically accompanies MDMA ingestion for me.  Most notable however is the physical sedation.  I can barely lift my arms from my side.  Not that I would ever want to Â– I feel perfect.  Beyond perfect.  I blasted past perfection what seems like ages ago.
