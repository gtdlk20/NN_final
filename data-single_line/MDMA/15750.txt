I took MDMA for the first time with a shamanic guide who had facilitated other such journeys many times, a person who I felt close to and trusted.  She had pure MDMA, not tainted with anything, and she gave me a capsule of it with a 'minimal' dose, as she said.  She usually required journeyers to lay down and wear blindfolds to encourage them to 'go within', but she had started a fire in the fireplace and I was mesmerized by it, which made it easier for me to relax and close my eyes when the time came.  I was laying down the entire time.
