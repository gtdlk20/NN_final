2 weeks later i went to a rave, had 2 pills 1.5 hours between, nothing, except a little bit happier.  I had a break of 1 week, went to a concert, had 1 pill and some G, the G was awesome, but barely felt my pill. had another 1 week break.  Then last weekend, had a trip the night before the doof, then went to the doof, 2 pills, 1 point, same thing again, felt a little happier, but nowhere near the experiences that i have had before.
