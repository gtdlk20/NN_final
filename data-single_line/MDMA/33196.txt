I remember making my way out into the front garden of the house and seeing a police car pull up outside.  This brought on a sudden, intense wave of paranoia in me and being the first person he saw, the police officer strolled up to me and started asking questions about noise levels, shouting, things like that.  I blabbered my way through this interrogation with some ease and the officer went inside.  At this point the paranoia really started to creep in.  I had a feeling that everyone was looking for me, for punishing me for every bad thing I had ever done in my life.  Although this might sound like a bad trip to you, I was actually enjoying it as I felt like a James Bond character Â– everybody looking to kill him, but always staying one step ahead.  The adrenalin rush was like no other I had ever experienced.
