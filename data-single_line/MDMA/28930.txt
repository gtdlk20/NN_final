I wouldn't really say that you can get 'high' on molly because in my opinion, being high is like being fucked up. Not like drunk out of your mind or anything, just a little more crazy or out of control. If you think that molly is going to get you fucked, you're wrong. Molly simply just puts you in a better mood. And I'm not saying that it is boring. Because it is actually the complete opposite.
