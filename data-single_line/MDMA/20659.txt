While we were standing in line at the club, it was chilly out, so I began to bounce around a little bit. All the guys were asking me, 'do you feel it?' Feel what I thought to myself. I felt a tingle staart in my toes and go to my hair on my head. The one street light became extremely bright, and a simple rub on the shoulder felt amazing. The stranger in front of me turns and smiles. I felt like I knew him forever. I am normally a shy person, but when I stepped in the club, after trying to converse with the bouncer, I was a free soul. M grabbed me and gave me a blowpop. It was too sweet to keep in my mouth. The music pulsed through me and the hugs were wonderful. Girls I didnt know commented on how friendly I was. M made me promise that I would only roll with her. At the time, I didnt know why. Later, when she went to the washroom, I knew why. I found myself talking to girls that I wouldnt even think of normally. I took another pill when my peak started to die off, it was still early, and I didnt want this night to end. V pulled me to sit on a speaker, and gave me water and red bull. When the second pill hit, I began to see the visual effects. People wrote on me with highlighters and sprayed neon green in my hair. Vicks was introduced to me, which I hated when I was a kid. Glowsticks and lights became like lights from heaven. After my third pill hit, I didnt want to move. Seven of us sat on the floor and massaged each other. It was amazing.
