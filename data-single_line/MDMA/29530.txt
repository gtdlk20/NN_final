At one point a new friend asked me to read his thoughts and not only could I describe the surroundings of his first house in detail but I reminded him that the patio was where he had first learnt to play chess, he was using black and facing the garden, the checking piece was a white bishop (I didnt even know he played chess before MDMA).   This sounds impressive but my skills were limited only to the past, when trying to see into the future I predicted to my embarrassment that the large Iraqi anti-war march was going to be bombed by pro-war terrorists.  My flat mate didnt go because of me.  For days after the experience I could clearly see other peoples auras - it was particularly easy to read a womens  I had difficulty interpreting the colours meaning and even if I thought I was sure of my judgement I couldnt confirm the results easily.
