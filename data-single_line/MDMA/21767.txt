I think the important concept to remember is you don't have to get 'fucked up' to take advantage of it - take nights to just sit and reminisce with friends, it is one of the best experiences I have ever had. Be responsible, don't let the drug take advantage of you, you take advantage of it. Everything you do, do with spirit.
