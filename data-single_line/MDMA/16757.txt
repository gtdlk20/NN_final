The  third day my depression was gone but I can say that so far it seems this Molly trip has intensified my love for my boyfriend.  At least it has opened my mind and my heart to being more serious and committed in a way I couldn't be before doing the Molly.  It's wonderful... I am not sure if this will ware off, but it honestly feels like a permanent change.  I truly feel like I want to marry him and spend the rest of my life with him at this point.  It's not that Molly changed who either of us were, but it just opened my heart, made me more receptive to receiving what he has to give, and more accepting of myself.  I feel I have a bigger heart for the world as well, and just genuinely happier since we did it.
