I took a tab from L as did everyone else, and everyone kept on with what they were doing. I told L that I'm going to take a quick nap and to wake me up in about 30 minutes if he didn't mind. He said fine so I went to the room and crashed hard the second I hit the bed. The next thing I know I'm having the most vivid and incredible dreams I've had to date. Apparently L forgot about me asking him to wake me up and I ended up sleeping and woke up as I was starting to peak. I woke feeling like the sexiest man in the world, and amazingly I woke up with a rock hard erection. I laid back in the bed and stretched like anyone does when they first wake up, but I felt as though my arms and legs would shoot through the walls. I felt like my penis was going to explode.
