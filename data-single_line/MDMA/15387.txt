I also was visited by past and future family members who seemed to be negotiating with me.  I can't really explain this part but I felt that I was in heaven and reviewing my life plan with some people and figuring out what course I should take.  I do know that I answered some questions I had for a long time, and felt like I would know just what to do when I got back to my regular life.  Finally in exhaustion I laid down at around 9 a.m., about 12 hours after my initial dose.  But I could not sleep.  I was still being visited by spirits from near and far.  Everyone had a message for me or to pass on to someone I knew.
