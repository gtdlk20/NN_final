I get to the party, it was a Real party at a gay bar called U4IA (pronounced euphoria).  Weekdays it was home to all of Clevelands homosexuals, but on the weekends it housed some sweet parties with kickass headliners.  We get there at 10:00 with my even more hopeless friend I will call Tom.  Tom was an intellectual introvert who was worse off than me.  We were supposed to meet a friend of his from work, that I will just appropriately call 'The God of Rave'.
