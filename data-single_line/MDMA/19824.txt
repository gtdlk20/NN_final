I stood there buzzing while my mates massed in one group.  I was impatient and eager for a piece of the action.  I felt I could talk to anyone and be everyones superior.  My eyes started to spasm from left to right as I hit the peak of the drug.  This was a strange but enjoyable experience,  it added to the effect that I was not quite in reality and that I could do anything I pleased.  We decided to go for a trek to check out the action and find our other mates.  I talked to a lot of people on the way, including chicks.  Half the time I didnt even realize I was speaking to someone until seconds later, I couldnt keep up with myself.
