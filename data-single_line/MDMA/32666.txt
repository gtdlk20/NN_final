Around 6:00 PM I got off the train, this time I was walking VERY slow. I was not energetic but extremely sluggish. I walk to the store in the subway and got a straw and started chewing it right away. I was walking down 31st street at an incredibly slow pace, staring straight ahead seeing doubles while listening to comfortably numb. I had traffic piling up behind me. It took me 25 minutes to walk 2 city blocks. I was chewing this straw like an animal. People were staring at me as they went around me due to my abnormally slow pace. By around 7 I was coming down. I wasn't tripping, but I wasn't sober. The next day I felt great, happy, no soreness, no nausea, no headaches.
