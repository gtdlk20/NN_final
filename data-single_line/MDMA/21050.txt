The next day at approximately 1:00 pm when I awoke, I could still somewhat feel it in my arms and legs.  I was in such a terrific mood for the next three or four days.  The entire experience has turned me on to the the drug and off from many others.  It provided the feeling that I wanted; something that the other drugs I have tried paled in comparison to.  The prescription drug, Celexa, apparently has no ill effects on the drug, which I am on for depression.
