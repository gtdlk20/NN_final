Setting: a warm night, at home in my house I shared with my partner. Preparation: I had the ecstasy tablet for a couple of weeks, waiting to it felt right to take it. My intention was to have some kind of luminous spiritual experience, but other than that, the only mental preparation was spending some quiet, simple contemplative time with myself, relaxing and trying to clear my thoughts, before taking the ecstasy at sundown.
