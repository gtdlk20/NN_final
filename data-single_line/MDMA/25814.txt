It was a Friday night and I was drinking heavily in a dorm room with some friends. My ex-boyfriend (we had been together three years and had only recently broken up) walked in the room and we had a huge fight, ending in him leaving in a huff. I began to bawl, the alcohol only adding to the sadness, when one of my friends took me out of the room and to a party down the street to 'make me feel better.' He bought some pills and handed me a small green pill. I wouldn't have taken if I was sober, but I was very intoxicated and just popped it.
