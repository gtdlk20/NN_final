Well I've tried X several times before and they've all been pretty good. But last Friday I took a pill called a Jawbreaker. I swallowed it b/c I hate to chew them up, and it took hold at about T+1hr. We were driving around and I had to get gas so we stopped at a station. While we were there we saw a group of teen runaways, or homeless people, and I wanted to go talk to them. It was really cool to hear what they had to say for a while, and I felt good about actually listening to them instead of just turning the other way when homeless people try to talk to me.
