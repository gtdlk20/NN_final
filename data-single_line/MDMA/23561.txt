I'm going to attempt to put to words the absolutly amazing experience that this drug facilitated for me.  To describe this I feel that its important that the reader know my mental state prior to taking MDMA and the setting I was in.  This is because, at least from my experiences, the effect of ecstasy is _greatly_ influenced by your mood and environment durring the trip.
