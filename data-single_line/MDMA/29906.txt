Its amazing, when I'm on E, people seem to come up to me.. every single person that approached me, i felt was my friend.. The cheesy love that expected was not, but filled with a deeper sense of kindred,  more of this feeling of unity.. how we're all in this together.. Most of them were drunk.. I listened to this one guys drunken story about shrooms for 10 mins., and i was amazed at how well i listened and connected with him.
