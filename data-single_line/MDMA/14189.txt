The come-up came at 45 minutes. I felt a huge wave of nausea and panic followed by the feeling of being struck by lightning. For about 3 seconds, I experienced a mild seizure. It felt like the breath had been knocked out of me, my head went back and my body went limp. I collapsed and my sitter had to catch me to keep me from hitting the floor. It felt like I had just been knocked out with an invisible hammer. The nausea intensified and I vomited a small amount. With the sitter holding me up, I sat on the cold tile bathroom floor for about 10 minutes until I had enough strength to move.
