The world, and the way I am interacting with it, is stupendous.  I feel very at home and comfortable in this oddly familiar, yet foreign version of existence.

The gradient, or transition, from black to white is so perfect that I almost cannot comprehend the polarity of the two colors given how well they blend together.
