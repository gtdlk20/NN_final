I'll give you a bit of background info before talking about my experience in case any of it helps explain the result. I'm 21, female, 5'8'. I haven't weighed myself in a long time, but I'd guess ~160 lbs. I've been smoking weed semi-frequently for a few years now and I've tripped on LSD plenty of times; I had a bad experience once or twice, but I'm really well adjusted to it now and have become excellent at maintaining a good mental state during the trip. I've dealt with anxiety and depression in waves my whole life. I used to take cymbalta from 2015-mid 2017, then wasn't on anything until spring this year when I started taking wellbutrin. However, at the time that I took MDMA I hadn't been on my meds for about a month (took a while to get a refill, what can you do).
