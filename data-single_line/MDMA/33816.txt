I asked a guy to put me up to crowd surf, and let me say this, it was the greatest feeling of my whole life. Hands feeling me everywhere, holding me up, and just being thrown around gently everywhere. The only negative was that by the time the headlining band came on around 10, I was well over the peak of the trip and coming down, which made the rest of the show not that great. Next time I know I'll bring at least two pills, but I highly recomend the punk/rock concert atmosphere, as crowd surfing is AMAZING on E.
