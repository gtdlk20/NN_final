I leave for the holidays. I come back. She came down and hung out with me and my friends while we did e and lsd. I had wanted to try e again... I knew the crowns were good and I had really mellow and calm thoughts when I did them before and I was in a good environment so I figured the e would balance the intense feeling I got when I did lsd. And so it did.
