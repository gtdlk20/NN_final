I was looking into her eyes and every feature on her body was so beautiful, her eyes were the most beautiful thing i've ever seen, i couldn;t stop staring at them and her face, she slowly started to touch me and i swear i never felt so good as i did then. I started beathing very heavily and making noises, just from kissing and being touched very lightly around my groin area. It was like i was having an orgasm, but actually wasn't. She couldn;t believe how i was starting to get off from so little effort. Her hair was so beautiful looking and her lips, everything was so clear and magnified. I was so hot for her. Then we went into the bedroom and she stripped me and took off her clothes. She looked absolutely amazing, her breasts, everything was so beautiful and wonderful. I started to touch her and kiss her all over her body and i can't even explain how great it felt. She started to stroke my penis and i've never felt so good, it was like complete heaven. it was like any other sexual encounter magnified by 1000 times over and over. I won't go into details, but once we started to have sex, i was in complete ecstasy, now i know why they call it that. The best sex of my life, it lasted for about 2 hrs. and once i was on the verge of orgasm, i freaked out, i started screaming in complete pleasure, yelling and moaning like an animal, grabbing the pillow with one hand as hard as i could, and the other hand was holding onto a piece of wooded rack, i was squeezing so hard i broke the wood in half, biting my lip very hard, i couldn't believe how great it felt. and the orgasm felt like it lasted much much longer than any other. My girlfriend had to put a pillow over my mouth becasue her parents were upstairs sleeping and i was out of control with the noises i was making. I was almost in tears from it, that's how great it felt, it was so amazing, just looking up at this beautiful, sexy girl, giving me the time of my life as i came. Nothing could compare to it.
