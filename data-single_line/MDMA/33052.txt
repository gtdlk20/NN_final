5:00 We stroll up to joe's truck and are spotted. We give him a few minutes to get his clothes back on and hop in the truck. I'm riding shotgun and my two friends are in the back. I decide to turn around and introduce myself to this girl after Joe says we are going to drop her off at her place on the way home. Now the first thing I usually notice about a girl are her eyes. In this case, it was her ADAM'S APPLE!!. Completly shocked and appalled I somehow manage to utter out the words 'How you doing?' In a deep shy voice he/she reply's 'Good'
