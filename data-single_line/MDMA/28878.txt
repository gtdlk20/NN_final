We parked the car and we all popped one of the orange maseratis each, I had one tablet left for a boost for M and I.  We got to the club and the line was around the corner, we waited in line for approximately 10min until someone told us we didnt have to wait as we had already purchased out tickets online.  M and I had general admission tickets and J and L had VIP tickets, so being stoked we decided to go in through the VIP entrance right behind J and L.  The doorman had his eyes all over J and L and M and I slid right past him and into the VIP area, we were super stoked as we had just saved about $30 since we had just regular tickets.
