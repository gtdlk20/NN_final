And being around friends- it was really moving.  After talking, about things that would never normally come up, I suddenly realized what true friends I had.  Things like, 'You know, I dont thing I ever told you but I...[miss you, thought of you, was worried about you, would have felt so bad if, etc].  After that night, I knew exactly who my true friends were - it was a startling discovery.  I always thought of them as friends, but never as the people who would take a bullet for me.  And it took that night for me to completely realize this.  And I was so excited and energetic after realizing this- that alone would have made my day.  But it was soo much better becuase of how I felt from the roll.
