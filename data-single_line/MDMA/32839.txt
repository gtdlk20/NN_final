Dosage was a bit higher than last attempts (previous ingestion dated 2 weeks back 0,1g ). Because I was not satisfied with length of magic during that session. The flow of trip disappointed me with less spiritual fx. It is so sad :..(( Just a rollercoaster excitement and common excuse for audacious actions.  But that was just like camouflage. In fact I didn't feel extra cute (as I used to on MDMA) thoughts were distorted, speech damaged enough. And the worst thing is that I almost don't have point to doubt if it was not MDMA indeed. I'm really concerned to recover magical abilities
