My sister finally makes it back and we finally walk up the steps into the arena where the main dj was spinning the whole night. My sister, who wasnt on anything at this point, let out a fuck yeah! once we got to the top of the steps. The lights and lasers and music was almost overwhelming  it was all so beautiful. Tons of people are up and dancing in the stands, some just sitting, looking dazed, probably coming down. People are getting light shows. People are giving light shows. People are massaging each other. People are hugging, smiling, just having the best time of their lives. I felt so at home with these thousands of strangers. The vibe was such a positive one and thats what I loved so much and wish I could feel in everyday life. My sister and I find a good seat where we can see everything, and I give her the pink gun pill and she pops it. Out of the blue these two girls sitting behind us put one of those electric hand massagers on my head and shoulders, and at this point, the colored lights lights, the music, the positive vibes and people...this is ecstasy. This is where the name came from. This is the experience people are looking for. Youre happy, everyone around you is happy. Not a worry in the world. What could possibly be better?
