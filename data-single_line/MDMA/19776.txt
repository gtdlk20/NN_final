This lasts for another for hours. My boyfriend and I walk home by 12am. We try and wind down but end up talking for two and half more hours. As soon as I feel myself come down, I am a little sad. I wish it could last a little longer. The insomnia and restlessness has set in. I'm a little disoriented and frankly, bored. I still see visuals in my peripherals but hardly.
