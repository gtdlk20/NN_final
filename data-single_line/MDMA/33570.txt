I took several breaks to walk around the club and rehydrate.  Just the simple act of bumping into people touching them as I walked by was incredible.  At one point while returning to the dance floor, someone grabbed my arm.  I turned around and it was a cute, buff shirtless guy and he said hi.  We started talking and my normally shy nature was nowhere to be found.  The conversation flowed so smoothly.  We went out and danced and kissed.  Kissing must be my favorite thing to do while on E.  The feel of his tongue on my lips was incredible.  I asked if he was on anything and he said he wasn't.  I was a little bummed, because I wanted to him to be on the same level as me.
