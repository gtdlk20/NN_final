Well, I was on Pill Reports reading about a certain pill that plenty of people seemed to think were awesome on Thursday March 25th.  On Friday, I was in Wallmart and I ran into my friend J who said he rolled for the first time last night.  I wasnt too excited, but I asked him how he liked it.  He said he loved it, but I still wasnt interested because of my prior experience with entactogens.  I asked what was on the pill, and he described the exact pill I was reading about on Pill Reports that was around the area where I live.  My girlfriend was with me, and so we decided to give it a try.  I couldnt remember whether the pill was said to contain MDMA or MDA, but everyone said they felt very clean and very strong.  Many said they would never take more than two of the pills.  I proceeded to purchase two of them, and me, my girlfriend A, J, and another friend P went to his house where I was going to make them some Poppy seed tea, as they wanted to try it after I reported a few successful experiences to them.  Ps cousin came down as well.
