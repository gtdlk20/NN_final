At 12:15 am I was at my peak, where I stayed for almost four hours.  It was so wonderful, I had not expected it to be that great.  Everyone I had ever spoken to on the topic said that it was the greatest thing, but I had no idea it would be that good. Everyone I had ever spoken to on the topic said that it was the greatest thing, but I had no idea it would be that good.  I was so aware of everything that was going on.  The techno music sent me into a frenzy, everything was perfect.  I feel lucky that the first time I used ecstasy was with others that were on the drug, it was like everyone was contributing to the good of the group. We were doing things like blowing each other up, giving roller coaster rides (my favorite) and passing each other out after a huge shotgun from the Vick's inhaler. Being touched sent waves of pleasure through my body. I was so in tune with my surroundings and everyone else there.  I did not have a bad thought the entire night.
