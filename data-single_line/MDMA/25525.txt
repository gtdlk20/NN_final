They took me into a room that was carpeted, and the one guy began to 'blow me up.' He He moved his hands all around on my face, chest, shoulders, and back. It felt very good. He then said to fall back when he told me, and I did. It felt like I was falling back into a pillow. Another friend picked me up by my legs, and they began to swing me back and forth in the air. I felt like I was flying. They then began to slowly let me down to the ground, and when I was on the ground, my friend blew me up again. When he did this the second time, I had no knowledge of my body. All I could feel were the spots on my face where my riend was touching me. It was like I only existed where I was being touched. After he finished, I just lay there for a minute, and when I opened my eyes, they were all these people looking down a tme. I just looked up and smiled, thinking to myself, 'If you only knew.'
