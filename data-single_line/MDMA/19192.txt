Before my trip I had only had experience with alcohol and pot, and I wasnÂ´t a heavy consumer of either of them.  My days in Spain started to change that, I started to smoke pot everyday and got more open minded about other drugs. There was a nightclub in town which opened at 6 a.m. and only played techno music, everybody told me that was amazing and I kept asking myself how can a place that opens at 6 a.m. be amazing?  What do you guys do there that's so amazing?  The answer I got was:  We roll on E.
