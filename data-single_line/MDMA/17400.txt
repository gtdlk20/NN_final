Which is nothing compared to the love I felt towards people. In a room full of seven or eight rolling individuals, there was no negativity or selfishness at all. I felt the most selfless and compassionate I have ever felt while I was rolling; annoying tasks like cleaning up someones puke and buying cigarettes for my underage friends were performed virtually without a second thought. One moment (actually comprised of about a 20-minute period) occurred where everyone in the room just stopped talking and looked from one person to the next, slowly smiling in admiration of how awesome everyone was. People who annoyed me before were now the coolest people in the world, and the friend I came with (one of my best friends) felt unbelievably important to me; I hoped so strongly and sincerely for him to be happy that Im not even sure I can properly describe the sensation.
