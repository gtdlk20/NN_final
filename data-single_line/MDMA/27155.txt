While in the height of (hypothetically) taking four mdma pills, I found myself having a number of frequent visuals.  One visual felt fully interactive.  I found myself in a small cave about with a ceiling of about 7 feet high.  The cave was dark and foggy and had pillars that looked to be stalagtites connected to stalacmites.  The walls and floor throughout the cave was covered in what appeared to be white, wooly, soft, spiderwebs.  I found that I was looking out from one of the pillars where the webbing had covered my body entirely.
