My friend and I decided to buy ecstasy one night. We bought two yellow UFO pills. Since it was her first time, she only did half, and I did mine and her other half. At first, we thought they were kife(fakes) because they took so long to kick in. About an hour later, I started to rise, it was like my life was just vivid, and bright. My friend and I were giving each other hand massages, talking about life, philosophy. I felt like she was my best friend, my only friend. But someone else came into the room, someone who was not on E, and I felt the worst vibes from him. It almost scared me. I felt dread in my stomach, and I just asked him to leave. But the bad vibe clung to me.
