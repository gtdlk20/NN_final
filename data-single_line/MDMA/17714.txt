When I was at home again I slept and afterwards had a long talk with my mother, saying sorry for the times I had hurt her and expressing how much I love her. We both cried and hugged and held one another for a long time. When my father came in we did the same. I felt so very clean afterwards, reborn almost. Like a great burden I was carrying around has been lifted.
