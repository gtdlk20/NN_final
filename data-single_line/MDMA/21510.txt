T+ 1:35: Finally feeling the MDMA rush, body tingles like none other.  Go to lay in the grass because it seems like a good idea.  Not really, wearing a backless shirt I decide that the itching is more overwhelming than the soft feel of the fresh cut grass.  I sit down and feel ENTIRELY overwhelmed.  I guess this is blowing up (I never really did blow up the first time I took E).  I am sweating, shaking, things are going white.  My heart is racing and I pour water over my face and go lay down.
