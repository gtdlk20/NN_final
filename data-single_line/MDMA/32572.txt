I then leave the squat say goodbye to my friends and head off to get the bus back to my small university room in canterbury. The sun shinning is astonishingly bright, and all the colors look magic, however no luck, the bus fare is 11 pounds and I only have 6 pounds, so I have to beg in the bus station for 5 pounds to get my ride home... Luckily a couple of students help me out and I can get home. I put my mp3 player on my Drum n Bass playlist and dig the music for 2 hours on the ride home.
