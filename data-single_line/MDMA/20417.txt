When I woke up the next day, Tuesday, I felt absolutely terrible. I was incredibly dizzy and light headed. When I went to sit up from bed or stand up, my vision would black out, like from low blood pressure. My ears were ringing really loudly (I think this could also have been partly related to hearing damage from the bass, although I did wear earplugs close to the speakers). I also felt very nauseous, and threw up a few times: whenever I tried to get out of bed to stand up, I would feel off balance and stumble and get a wave of intense nausea, a lot like having vertigo. My head felt super thick and like I couldnt think straight, and I felt completely drained and exhausted. All I wanted to do was go back to sleep, but the intense ringing in my ears and dizzy/buzzing sensation in my brain made me feel so ill I couldnt sleep. I did manage to get up to shower and eat some food, but didnt really have any appetite at all. I also found myself uncontrollably crying at a few points on this day.
