We went into the party and chilled for a while. I was feeling fine until about thirty minutes later, when suddenly I became extremely dizzy and my vision started changing, as if I was looking through the wrong side of prescription glasses. I grabbed my friend and told him this, and he just sat me down and got me some water. Just as I sat down, something snapped in my system and the world turned into fast motion. I lost all control over my body and started to run through the house and down the street, screaming at the top of my lungs. I honestly thought I was going to die -- my vision was blurry; I couldn't understand anything anyone was saying to me; the world was spinning and I couldn't stop running or screaming. Everyone from the party was grabbing onto to me, trying to get me to stop, but I couldn't. I felt as if I had the 'flight or fight' syndrome and I began to get very violent, punching people right and left, hitting myself, falling on the hard cement, bruising and cutting myself. My friend was trying to restrain me and in the back of my mind, I heard his voice telling me I wasn't going to die, that I would be okay. But I couldn't stop. At one point, I ran from everyone and collapsed in the bathroom. I began to convulse and had some sort of minor seizure and ripped everything down from the bathroom wall. Finally, my friend managed to hold onto me (I am a small girl -- 5'4, not even a 100 pounds, but my strength that night was enormous) and take me to another friend's apartment, away from the chaos.
