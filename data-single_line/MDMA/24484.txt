Later that night a small group of us broke off from the larger group(who had indulged in some Soma as their effects were wearing off, and were content laying in their tent with each other)and took a short walk back to the river.  There, we sat mostly in silence, closing our eyes to listen to everything around us and drinking it in.  It was nice during this time to just be silent with people you care about and hold their hand, just enjoying the sound, and the feeling of the wind.  I have never felt so comfortable or at ease in my life.  I have always had self esteem issues, and for that night, with my friends, they all were inconsequential.  I opened up and was ok with the silence around me, something I would normally be paranoid about.
