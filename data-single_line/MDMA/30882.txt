I drove over to his house around 3 in the afternoon. He snorted one and ate one initially. I ate both of mine. We headed out on the road with me driving soon after to pick up some beer. The package store is only about 15 mins away and J was already feeling it by then. He was laughing and had a huge shit-eating grin on his face and couldnt stop talking about how awsome he felt. I hadnt started to feel it yet. We continued on driving down to a local plaza where J got out and promptly threw up. The MDMA was just starting to hit me then. I had the typical comming on signs of clenching of the jaw, and hot and cold flashes. We sat in the parking lot for a while and I started to get paranoid that people were looking at us. J said they weren't, but we left anyway. We got stuck in traffic on the way out and we were cranking the music just twitching and dancing about in the car. Music is one of the most wonderful things in life on MDMA.
