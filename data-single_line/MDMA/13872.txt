Although time is a foreign concept to me, I estimate I am colorless for a total of 3-5 minutes.  Slowly, color begins to return to my vision.  It looks like someone is gradually increasing a saturation filter on my visual field.  About halfway through the transition from black and white to normal color vision, a process that takes several minutes, I distinctly notice the first instance of motion in quite some time.  A small bird glides silently through the air in front of me.  Witnessing this silent path of flight marks a progression from one stage of the experience to the next.
