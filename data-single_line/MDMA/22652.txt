We made a long trip on two buses out to an unfamiliar area in our city and found our way to the tattoo parlor where they were holding the Rave.  When I first walked in the place I was visually blown away, black lights everywhere with huge florecent hearts dangling from the ceiling the music made my rib cage shake and there were people dancing in beautiful outfits that were colorful and unique.  There were glow sticks everywhere swirling and spinning.  There was another room packed with couches and pillows.
