At 1:08am I was 'feeling so good. Cold feet on the floor.  Wet, making out.  Not feeling out of control, just pleasant.'  Feeling fun and free, enjoying the music, his touch.  I noted I could probably do more but I wouldn't mention it to him.  By 1:49am, I was feeling wonderful.  My notes state 'feels good just making out and listening to music - sweating and kissing with the music.  Hot, hot, hot.' So by this point, I was heating up and very aware of my temperature.  I have long hair, so the more we cuddled, the hotter I felt.   So, up until this point, I'm feeling good.
