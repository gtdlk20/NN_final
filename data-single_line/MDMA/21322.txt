Within fifteen minutes I was getting first alerts -- colors brightening, a general shift in perception.   My trip buddies reported nothing.   I made a visit to the bathroom (a good sign things were progressing) and on the walk back knew I was going to roll.   About ten minutes after joining the group, I was definitely feeling it--as was my wife--although we both reported the come-up to be more gradual than we had experienced before (perhaps because we took it in pill rather than our usual capsule form?).
