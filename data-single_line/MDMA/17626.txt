Alas, also; flip-book vision (for those who don't know, the rapidly flickering, short duration distortions of general vision) is much more intensified. This is my favorite visual from MDMA, even though it's tended to give me distinctly different, yet similar color patterns to an LSD trip. (One of the several seperate reasons why I ENTIRELY, WITHOUT QUESTION consider MDMA a beautiful and completely unique and mystic psychedelic.)
