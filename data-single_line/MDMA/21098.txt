I'm expecting this anxiety naturally, so I just hold onto my boyfriend and feel my body spin with general confusion and disarray. My boyfriend asks my friend for food. They must go upstairs to the kitchen but I am not allowed to come because my friend's little brother who is about 14 is up there and if he notices I'm talking a lot and my pupils are insane, he will tell his parents. They leave me in the dark bedroom, music still turned up. I'm just thinking, relaxing, listening.
