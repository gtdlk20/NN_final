We had all done it before.  However, this night was different.  I had never dropped with any of them.  I live far away from them, and the times I had done E was all spent with a couple of friends in my area, friends I knew but wasn't very close to, but never them.  At first, i was a little bit hesitant; we were out in the desert and I was concerned about becoming dehydrated or possibly awaking all of the other campers around us.  I was also concerned that, incase something happened that required a hospital, there were none around for about 75 miles.  So I dismissed the idea, and so did everyone else.
