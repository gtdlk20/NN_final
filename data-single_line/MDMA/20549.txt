The best part about it was the next morning.  Driving around, and looking at the people in their cars as I drove past them, gave me such a sense of peace and happiness.  The world was a happy place that morning, at least for me.  The drug, I assumed had wore off, but the peaceful feeling came back to me every time I thought about what happened the night before.
