It was like a sudden wave of feeling perfect.  I was sitting on these leather couches and all of a sudden I just felt completely open to everyone.  I got talkative, energetic, and suddenly interested in being touched.  I saw this girl with a little vibrating white bunny.  Completely unlike myself, I just go sit down with her and her friends, start taking to them, and talking her into massaging me and rubbing her bunny on my head and face.  Nothing could match the way I physically felt.  I was clear headed, but every sense was x10.  I could feel the bass, I was in a trance to the music, any completely touchy-feely.  I would have been completely content touching everyone and everything around me.  Normally, I am not a smooth person and have some difficulty interacting with complete strangers - that completely changed.  Suddenly, people who I didnt know, I could just feel at home with.
