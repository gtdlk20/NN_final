After an hour and a half I was fully into the wig. It is damn near impossible to describe the utter joy and acceptance I felt for everyone around me. I listened to every word that everyone said as though it were their last. All of my deepest emotions were reeled to the surface, and I felt a bit like Freud: giving myself a thorough analysis and seeming to understand everything....life, dreams, love, companionship, loyalty, betrayal, all of the things that come along in life I felt like I could handle with ease. Confidence was one of the most profound qualities of the tab, as is with most tabs, along with empathy for your fellow man (or woman) and an urge to reach out for understanding.
