Can I talk to you for a second Miranda? Lizzy asked. Miranda and my friend stepped aside. I carried on a fairly normal conversation with Mirandas friend. I wondered why Mirandas friend seemed to be able to converse with me without making me feel so uncomfortable but Miranda, someone I had know for years, couldnt. I was later told by my friend that Miranda was appalled that my friend had pulled her aside, and that she didnt understand what shed done wrong. She stormed off the boat after their conversation, and we didnt see them for the rest of the night.
