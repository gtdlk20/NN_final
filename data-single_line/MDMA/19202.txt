The feeling was definitely back, the rush, the sweating, the sensitive aspect, etc.  But just wasn't the same, I don't know, maybe it was my high expectations, maybe it was the pill, maybe it was the surroundings (only 10% of the people were on E, in Spain would be 90%), maybe was the antidepressants I'm on (I stopped taking them one week before the experience).
