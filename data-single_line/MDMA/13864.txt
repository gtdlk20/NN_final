I am pleased to see the static bits becoming more granular; the world is re-emerging from behind the veil.  As soon as I let out a sigh of relief, I must once again suspend my breathing.  Everything in my visual field is draining of color.  The saturation is slowly disappearing.  After about 30 seconds I am viewing the world in monochrome.  Only blacks, whites, and greys remain visible.  I pull myself back into the room and find my black and white room concerning.  This doesnt feel like any visual Ive ever experience before.  It is so real and authentic.  There is no breathing, patterning or other effect: just a complete lack of color.  The only other minor difference is that my vision is soft; the edges of objects are not as defined and sharp as normal.  A brief worry flashes through my mind: did I really fuck up?  Am I overdosing right now?  Im a strange mix of excited, scared, and confused.  My concerns are legitimate; I know that Ive ingested a potentially dangerous amount of MDMA and currently my eyes can no longer perceive color.  That is not normal and seems like a bad sign.  Even these serious concerns dont overpower my positive attitude.  I know I should be concerned, but Im having trouble not being intrigued by what I am experiencing.  I am oddly at ease with the extremity of the effects; this lack of worry is clearly an effect of its own.  There is a moment where I debate with myself whether I should contact my remote sitter to provide an update and get a sober opinion.  My gut tells me I would know if this was a serious health concern and I elect to put off the phone call and see how things develop.
