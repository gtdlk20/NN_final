Now, things turn and I am feeling GREAT. My note from 2:28am just says 'yea' and then I mentioned at 2:59am that I was 'HOTTTTT. So hot'.  At this point I'm rolling hard and really enjoying him physically, emotionally, and our chemistry together is really good.  The more interesting logs begin at 3:21am reading 'hotttttt wanna fuck.  Feel so good.  Hot and sexy and good like wine and roses and sex. I feel like the room temp is in the mid 80s.  Wish I had a thermometer to check my temperature.  Feeling so good.  D kisses me the way I would teach someone to kiss me, it's so strange he knows how. The music is great and so is the company.  I'm so wet.  Loooooooove the music so much. Wish we could do this for 24 straight hours I'd be so happy and content.  I don't think his cats are so bad at all.'  3:28am 'Goddddd I wanna fuck so bad.  I feel soooooo good fuck.'
