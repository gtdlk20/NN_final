I have been experimenting with the substance MDMA for about 5 years now.   This particular experience begins when a good friend came to New Orleans to visit.  I love when my old friends visit because since Hurricane Katrina things are so different.  We did not prep for our MDMA adventure, we were out at a couple of bars, I had already had two beers and we just happened to get a phone call.  When I saw our prize I was so excited, it has been years since I saw pills that looked like this.  It was double stacked red fish with what appeared to be chunks of shiny crystal embedded into the pill.  To make sure someone didnt just roll the pill in glitter I cut it in half and noticed the inside was the same.  My friend who is a true veteran with MDMA was the firs to take them, he ingested 1 ½.  Before I knew it his pupils were huge and it had been years since I saw feeling so little so intensely.
