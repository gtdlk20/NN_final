I hadnt put too much attention on it but suddenly I had the clear impression that the MC was commenting all my actions I had the clear impression that the MC was commenting all my actions, I was drinking and I heard him saying  your body need water and so on. I thought ok, maybe he is just commenting on everything he see around him not a big deal and I went into the other room. After a while I came back and started to talk with some people at the entrance of the room smoking a joint and heard him saying now is back, but I does not enter, enter, enter. I did not know exactly what to do, I was not high at that point, the peak was gone by a couple of hour and I went again to the other room. There was a different DJ without MC but I heard something like maybe you gone away but we might keep your buddy, I didnt want to tell him anything as he was so happy, why ruin a good sensation?? My friend told me  I'm going to the other room and I decide to stay there, and I heard from the DJ  say hes gone, now you will follow him to the next room and there I said to myself if they comment on something I am doing its ok but if they tell me what to do FUCKING NO WAY and I left the club.
