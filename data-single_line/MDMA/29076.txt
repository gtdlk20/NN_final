I ask her to massage my neck, and the harder she massaged the further the eyes would roll to the back of my headthats how good it felt. I closed my eyes while she was doing it and I felt like I was in a completely different world, it was like nothing Ive ever experienced. It felt amazing. I told her, I feel like Im a little kid again. And this Hispanic guy right next to us wearing a bandana over his mouth and those creepy looking contacts (the cat ones) looks at me and just nods his head, knowing exactly what Im talking about. I feel great and probably peaking at this point, but its killed because we still havent even gotten into the rave yet!
