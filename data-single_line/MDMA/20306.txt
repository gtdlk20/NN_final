Last weekend I had my first 'real' experience with ecstasy, and it totally changed my life, in a good way.  I had experimented with ecstasy 2 times prior to this time, but both times were in small doses and I never really found the desired effects (you know... Feeling connected to others, music sounding spectacular, etc..).  In terms of drug experience, I've done marijuana, alcohol, tobacco, salvia, and coke.  But now onto the experience...
