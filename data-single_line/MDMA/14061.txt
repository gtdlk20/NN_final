We continued in this manner for the rest of the night, experiencing different rooms and sensations which were infinitely wonderful in this vision of MDMA bliss. We rode a ferris wheel twice, which was simply amazing and I felt as excited as I had when I had ridden as a child. The whole experience was perfect and I had never before felt so good. One exception was for a moment, in which I became intensely paranoid and felt as though all these new relationships that I had developed under the influence of this drug were fake and everything I was experiencing was a lie. This lasted for less than a minute and then everything returned to bliss again. I danced the night away and at 5 am we decided to leave. I hugged and kissed C goodbye and H and I left to find my car. I was coming down but was still feeling it mildly. I got into my car confident that I could drive but definitely feeling a difference in perception. On the highway, I felt as though I had become ONE with my car, and though I was unable to read the odometer or street signs, I instinctively felt where and how fast to go.
