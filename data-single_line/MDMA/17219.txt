B drives us around town for a while, ending with us picking up G and heading back to DÂ’s house.  G and D leave again, leaving me with D and our other friend L.  D and L are playing video games, and I join in.  It is hard to keep track of whats going on in the game and I keep getting distracted by how fascinating my surroundings are.  The right angles and corners of the walls seem particularly interesting, and the patterns on the wood are strikingly perfect.
