Molly still hadn't shown her face yet at 4:40 PM and we decided to pay my friend Cherek a visit at Panera. I copped a cup for a drink to hydrate myself. It was 4:50 PM at this point, and man, she came on fast. I'd told Cherek I was on molly and I was starting to feel it, no, definitely feeling it. I couldn't keep a smile off my face, I was so euphoric. The body high was tingly, warm, and pleasant. Similar to if I had drank a cup of coffee and taken 10mg hydrocodone. After spending thirty minutes at Panera, and decided to go to my friend Rice's house.
