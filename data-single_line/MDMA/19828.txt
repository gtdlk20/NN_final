My eyes started to slow a little and the disappointment hit me, I was coming down.  I quickly directed my gaze at the clock, eleven thirty.  I wasnÂ’t fully off the drug yet but coming down before the pass of Newyears was disappointing.  It was almost like I was sober again, everything looked clear and normal, I was still racing at least.  The come down for me was overwhelmingly depressing.  I could still mingle and have fun, but it was nothing compared to the pure joy of the peak of ecstasy.
