We arrived back home for our New Years party, where we met with all the rest of our friends.  We were way past the peak, and on our down, but still were feeling pretty good.  Later in the night the three of us actually started to feel the effects AGAIN (although no where near as strong as the peak, of course), and we managed to somehow bring all the other people at the party up to our level of 'love', meaning we were able to get everyone to lay under blankets with each other, hold hands with each other, and give backrubs.
