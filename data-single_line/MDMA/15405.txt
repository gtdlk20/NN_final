This morning it is 12 days after my trip, and I feel like my old self again.  I feel healthy and motivated, and overall pretty happy.  This trip, which I would describe as my best ever, aftermath aside, will be my last.  Although it was amazing and helped me achieve a long-time goal of re-awakening my psychic abilities, I feel that my body and mind are no longer capable of dealing with the subsequent emotions in a healthy way.  If I was suicidal this time, who knows what would come to pass next time.  As for the psychic visions that I had and the answers to all of my questions, as soon as I got home I realized that it was not that simple, and that having the answers isn't everything, I still had reality to deal with.  In the end, it didn't make anything easier or clear up any situations at all.  The only thing it taught me is that there is no accounting for human behavior and seeing the future is totally useless since it is still contingent on so many decisions and the universal law of free will.
