   When I found her we sat down on a mattress and started talking, and talking, and talking...  By nearly 4 AM we started feeling a worthwhile X high, but it felt like we skipped the peak and went to the plataeu.  I was also INCREDIBLY fidgety...  I have never felt such a need to play with something.  Not on anything.
