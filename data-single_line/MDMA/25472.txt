The only other thing I really have to say about my first time raving that really shows how inept I was about parties.  GOR went off to find me a Menthol, and came back with a raver named Deena, who hooked me up with my first back rub and a sea breeze (someone using a vicks inhaler to blow in your mouth, eyes and nose).  After she finished giving me my backrub I turned and asked her if I had to pay her or something, and she just laughed at me and shook her head no.
