Oooh teeth grinding, feeling alive  talking with lots of people, time goes by fast What does that mean to an outsider? It means nothing. If you really wanted to learn the effects of a drug, you could do that on any website that simply lists drug effects. But if you really want to know how it feels and what goes on, you NEED to know WHAT exactly is going on with the person at the time and the SPECIFIC realizations that they are finding about their lives. Otherwise, it is just covering the surface. Yes I do realize, people look back on experiences two years in the past and cant really do that, but I am going to change it. I really really hope this makes it, I want to spread this to the world! I want to encourage people to do the same thing I am. I want them to analyze myself. Not with logic, but with the whole feeling too. I think you need a drug to bring the feeling to an understandable level in order to analyze it.
