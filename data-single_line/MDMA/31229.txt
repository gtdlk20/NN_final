1) there was a photo frame set up for people to stand in and it had the stage in the back ground, there was two girls dressed up, I would call them fairy girls,  I asked them to take my picture, one girl replied  'do you have a phone' I didn't really know what I was thinking I just wanted my picture taken and had this thought about me being in a picture in a picture. Lol. I salute the fairy's and sit back with my friends.
