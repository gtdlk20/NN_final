We rolled up to the usual dealin spot and no one was there...so we were leavin and we saw this pretty shady lookin man standin outside of 7-11 so we pulled in there and asked him for some bud...long story in the end we lost $40 and ended up with no bud then I was completely blown.  We went to pick up another friend and as I got out of the car it just began to hit me.  I was smilin dancin talkin all pasionetly and I cant even describe the feeling of hapiness I had inside me. I'm usually an incredibly happy guy cuz I just dont enjoy being sad but I have never been so boosted as I was then. This friend that we had just picked up happened to be a girl and happened to have expierience with X.  I was completely in love. Just everything about her seemed so cool! We went to ANOTHER friends house and picked up some marajauna, then my brother told the story of how we were hustled and the man hooked us up with even MORE bud.  We smoked some marajauna and I was smilin and bobbin my head to the music and/or talkin about everything that seemed important to me. We dropped the friend off we had just picked up and had a total of four people in the car.  We went to pick up another friend and I went into his house...
