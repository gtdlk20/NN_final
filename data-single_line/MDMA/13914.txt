I put on some music and find it pleasant, as long as the tempos are slow and the genre is relaxing.  The actual sounds and tones of the music (mostly low-tempo electronic) seem more exact and pure than when I am sober.  Typically on MDMA my mood adapts to enjoy whatever music is on.  I am struck by the fact that only this specific niche of music is enhanced and attractive to me at this point in time.
