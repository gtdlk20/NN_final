So then we just hung out and I started to feel very chill, explaining that I really wanted our relationship to work, I had been driving him apart from me for the past few months, I needed to trust that he loved me and wouldn't cheat on me, then obviously I cried a little bit and he said that he hated to see me cry. We were mushy gushy for a few minutes, but in a serious manner. Then we listened to John Legend and laid on the bed.
