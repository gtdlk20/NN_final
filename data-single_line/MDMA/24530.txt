11:34 pm speedy as hell- rising and falling- sedate but speedy- my attention span is so short that i'm tired of this notebook- fridge buzz- time references- too much light this time- taking words from conversation  time, space, money..- having trouble focusing. hope i'll come back to this later... don't feel sick anymore. cue for cigarette.
