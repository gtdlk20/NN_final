I haven't rolled in about three or four years. I haven't rolled in about three or four years. This time I chose to do so with my fiance and best friend. On that note; I urge you to think twice about who you roll with. If you're an easily embarrassed person, do it with someone you trust. You're more than likely going to at least say something you probably wouldn't normally. Inappropriate displays of affection happen many, many times on Molly. This can be awkward later.
