An hour after swallowing a half each, nothing was happening. Me and Lyle were beginning to get pissed thinking we threw away $17 on a placebo. So naturally we all chewed up the other half except Rob, who took another fourth and gave his extra fourth to Daniel. Almost instantly Marcus gets up and walks off in an obvious state of euphoria, soon followed by Stan, Mike and Lyle. Daniel, Rob and myself are left on the couch playing video games beginning to get a little impatient, when suddenly I feel this intense surge of pleasure working its way up from my legs through my chest and then my face. I tell Daniel and Rob that I'm gonna go find everyone else because I think I'm starting to roll. I find everyone outside, some sitting in their cars listening to techno (Marcus) and some wandering down the street (Mike and Stan). When I catch up with Mike and Stan I suddenly feel very connected to them, and when I look at them I know they are thinking the same thing.
