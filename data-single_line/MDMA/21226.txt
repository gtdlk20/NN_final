Coming up was boring. This 'smooth' feeling, like I was moving weightlessly underwater, lasted for another half an hour. We only sat for 5 minutes, and I wish we had for longer. As we walked, I began to get a slight pain in my chest, but I put all thoughts aside and focused on coming up in peace. We walked into a trailer where kids were playing video games. P began to play one, and as B and I stared in to the LCD screen, everything seemed to go crystal  clear in an overwhelming suddenness. Colors popped out, bright and  intense. My sight was crisp, my senses alert. I grabbed B's hand, the warmth of it tingling all the way up my arm.
