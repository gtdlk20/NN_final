Then the collateral effects started, I couldnÂ’t sleep and was feeling strange, with difficulty breathing and accelerated heart rate. Very different from the first time and I stayed preoccupied a little bit. I could only sleep at 11 pm (I took the pill at 3 am, and the common time to sleep was 7 am, after the party is over) and woke up at 8 am, not much sleeping considering that I was awake for all that time. The hangover and strange feeling finished at 11 am I guess. The day after I was a little bit depressed because of regrets in a couple things I did and the thought of my best friend and the girl I like was not so nice anymore. But nothing serious, just a little down.
