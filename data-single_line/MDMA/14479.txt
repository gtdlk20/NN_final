One of our friends, Alice*, who had not been rolling, but was entirely wasted from menthol vodka shots began performing a drunken stand-up routine on the side of the road. She began speaking really slowly into an imaginary microphone. I found it entertaining and comical, but didnÂ’t like that she was being unpredictable in her drunken state. Jan really hated it and told me she needed to get away from Alice.
