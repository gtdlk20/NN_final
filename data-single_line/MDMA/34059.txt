I felt strangely physically attracted to my best friend of ten years. I asked her if I could suck on her nipples because I had the urge to. All of this seemed very confusing yet enlightening to me. I was sexually attracted to my best friend and I had never been before and probably never will again. My boyfriend and I were sharing with each other how much we loved each other and even considered getting married! *something that we would never have done sober*
