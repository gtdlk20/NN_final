This wasn't the most profound roll of my life, but it was a very good vibe and we all felt comfortable at my house which is in a rural location with lots of trees and open fields to roam about in. I find a natural setting is the best place to be when rolling, the sense of being part of humanity is so much greater than being at a rave. As the onset came, I felt the usual tingling sensation on my skin, which gradually led to a warm and comforting euphoria and openness I can't normally achieve sober. All my fears and anxieties were stripped away, I felt connected with everything around me, and found a serenity and peace I've come to know with each roll.
