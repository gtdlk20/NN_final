After drinking two large glasses of water I return upstairs and begin chatting with Jean-Ralphio and another friend who has stopped by.  Conversation is not as addicting as I often find it when on MDMA.  I excuse myself and sprawl out on my bed. I reflect on the experience thus far.  Im shocked by how s l o w it has been in almost every regard.  Time seems expansive; the sober morning feels like ages ago.  My thoughts and general state of being are pleasantly lackadaisical.  I slip smoothly from active thinking to a mental state where Im empty headed.  I drown out Jean-Ralphio and our friend Jerry without effort.  A medium-pitched tinnitus buzzing noise assists me in my efforts to not hear the conversation in the room.  I dont meditate often and dont know if Ive ever achieved a completely meditative or Zen state.  I imagine it is similar to what I exist in now.  Time seems to disappear in chunks that I cannot define the size of.  A second passes but it feels like several minutes.  Next I find fifteen minutes has melted by in the blink of an eye.  Im aware of the continuing glow of euphoria within my body but Im not focusing on it.  Im physically still, not fidgeting as I sometimes do on stimulants.  Im essentially in a trance  letting the MDMA soothe my mind and body.
