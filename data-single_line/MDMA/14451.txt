The ocean breeze, though lovely, became too cold for me quickly. I was shaking and I wasnt sure if it was from the drugs or the cold, but it was probably both. Lizzy and I migrated downstairs, where a few people were listening to a different, smaller artist. There were no crowds and the space was basically empty. We sat on a bench far from other people, where I wouldnt worry about people judging me or questioning me.
