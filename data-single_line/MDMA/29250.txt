The reason I am writing to you is that everything I have read says that ecstacy and epilepsy do not mix and it is not something that I should try. Being young and inquisitive I decided to find out for myself, and in a very safe environment I have tried a couple of Es. From my experience the short term outcome was that I had no seizures on any of these occasions and for several days afterwards. This is from someone who rarely goes a day without a seizure. (I have temporal lobal epilepsy, involving complex partial seizures)
