More terrible music followed and I tried repeatedly to entice my friend away to a more exciting club, even offering to pay for her entrance.  My friend agreed that the music was bad, but said she wasn't planning to stay out late anyway.  Relations between her and sister 1 were bad and she was tired.  This was quite a blow to my plans of dancing all night in a rave-like fashion.  I decided I would just go home when she left.  She then told her sisters she wanted to go home, sister 1 also wanted to go home.  Sister 2 was very annoyed because she wanted to stay but would not stay on her own.  Sister 2 and I never got on and I suspect she blamed me for persuading my friend to go home early - which was not what I had wanted at all!
