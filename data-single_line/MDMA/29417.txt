For ingesting all my pills by 9PM, Im comfortable saying this is the longest roll Ive ever experienced.  To anyone interested in experimenting with MDMA for the first time, be smart.  Know who youre getting it from, very well.  Research the exact pills (color, size, shape, and logo) to get an idea of how much to safely ingest.  Read others experiences with the same pills, if possible.  Dont be too active, and if you do, make sure to take a break periodically as your heart rate is generally increased to begin with.  Drink plenty of water over time (but dont over hydrate).  For better effects, drink some orange juice, but not too much as this can cause vomiting.  Experience it with your friends, never alone.  Essentially, be smart, be safe, and have fun.  Trying to outdo yourself, prove yourself to friends, or just plain being an idiot can and more than likely WILL reap serious consequences.  In the end (or technically not the end since Im still feeling effects), Ive had a great time.  I hope this is helpful to anybody who reads this.  Dont get the wrong impression about this article either.  This is not to entertain; it is for informational purposes and is intended to help/answer questions some may have.
