Grinding teeth, jittery eyes every once in awhile, want to move body in slow motions, I CANNOT picture anyone going to raves and dancing on this thing. I would really want to be able to have a laptop and  write. What people should do is get a big group of people together, and not worry about dancing or anything. Have a room for people to type on their laptops, a room for people to talk, a room of music and dancing, but not something where you feel forced to do one event. You can talk to strangers. I think those can be the best people to talk to because you havent picked them out to make them your friend, that can lead to quite cookie cutter, or expected results, at the same time, they dont know background information about you, you dont have to worry about what you say to them, how they think of you.
