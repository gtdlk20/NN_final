This brings me to something important about ecstasy.  Ecstasy DOES effect my judgment.  I feel fantastic, lovey-dovey and like everyone near me is one of my best friends in the entire world.  But of course they are not.  So I might make some decisions that I normally wouldn't make with a relative stranger, because of how empathetic and just loved up I feel.

I decided to anyway, and I handed him 1 of the small pink star shaped goodies.  He had also been drinking VERY heavily throughtout the whole night, but assured me he could handle himself.  I said ok, fine, whatever, and we just started talking about random stuff as he absorbed his pill.  He was a logger and I was a lot more interested in this than I normally would have been, and I noticed my thought process was sped up when I was asking him rapid-fire questions about working as a logger.  I had done adderalls, vyvanse, and ritalins before this and the speedy conversation and mental clarity was similar, but with much more noticeable euphoria and bodily sensations.  Another 15 minutes or so pass, A and R are looking at eachother and seem to be talking intimately, while I just roam around the property starting up fantastic conversations about basically anything and everything with all the random people I had just met.  I was smiling very big the whole time and very empathetic and involved in people's stories.  This is probably t+45-50
