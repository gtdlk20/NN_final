Two of my friends and I attended ETD POP 2008 in san francisco, which is basically a big rave with top world DJs (I.e. Tiesto was there).  When we arrived my friend and I took a Molly (pure MDMA powder in a capsule), and then we went and stood in line to get in.  There were fifteen thousand ppl, so it took a while to get into the venue, about 45 minutes.  We made small talk with the two people in front of us, an indian guy and short blond chick.  They seemed like nice people, but I was more concerned with how I was feeling, so I didn't make much of the two stangers... But they come back later.
