But over the years I had come to understand the life that shaped him, and he had almost completely changed. And somehow, that was almost worse: If he had been the same asshole I could have stomped him into the ground, spit, and never come home again. But I knew that the person who had hurt me so terribly really was gone--it was pointless to blame the person he had become. But...that's a lot of history to overcome. At family get-togethers we were always friendly, but cautious. No hostility, but no connection, no sense of being anything more than casual aquaintances. It's amazing what sort of nasty tangled crap we manage to force under the surface and go on with out lives as though it didn't really matter to us. But....MDMA doesn't really allow for that sort of emotional denial, so it all came bubbling up. But, thanks to the MDMA, it was completely safe and painless--the ability to accept the pain and move past it without fear. It was clear to me that the anger I had held onto for so long was only harming myself--it didn't serve a single damn useful purpose on earth and I was only holding onto it because letting go would seem like the past hadn't really been important, that I was just being silly and should just ignore it like a good little trooper.
