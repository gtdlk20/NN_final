The sensation is a little hard to describe; a paragraph of text usually canÂ’t do justice to the feeling of rolling. The most basic part of rolling is a mild sense of general euphoria; I felt very content with the state of things and practically nothing bad fazed me. There was mild loss of motor coordination, but nothing as severe as the kind associated with alcohol. I was also in a very stimulated and aroused state, despite having been awake for the last 12 hours without so much as a nap.
