The next day, I no longer felt any noticeable physical effects (maybe just barely more physically relaxed than usual), but my heart chakra still felt wide open.  I felt so so so so deeply in love with my boyfriend, so happy and content with the world, and so fondly of the human race.  The day after that, I suffered some depression but not in the way I am used to (I am bipolar so am familiar with severe and even suicidal depression).  It was more of an intense emotional and physical longing for my boyfriend.  When he had to go to work I cried because I couldn't bear to be apart from him.  I felt so utterly alone when he wasn't there, even though I knew I would see him in a few hours.  I couldn't focus or motivate myself to do anything.  I laid in bed most of the day, sad and missing him and feeling down on myself.
