I watch my boyfriend next to me lay back as my best friend turns of the bright room light. It hits me less than a second before he feels it and starts saying 'wow', bringing his hands to his face. I touch mine and it feels great. But I have the overwhelming desire to relearn what his skin feels like. I want to feel his fingers against my face.
