Been seeing a new guy and really connecting well together.  We decided to have some molly on a Friday evening after a high protein meal (chicken breast, carrot, broccoli).  Had an unusually nice, easy day so felt very relaxed going into the evening.  We had spent the previous night together and it was very enjoyable.
