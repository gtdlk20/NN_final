We then reached a long track that divided to fields.  To picture it, imagine a soccer or football field, the halfway line being the track, each half being a field.  We proceeded to stand around 10 feet away from the track and stared at each other in the light of the lit moon to hallucinate.  The visuals came instantaneously for both of us as the figure of Daves body raced backwards and forwards, as if he were being catapulted toward me but not hitting me then immediately reverting to his original position.  Like next frame kind of.
