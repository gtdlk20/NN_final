By 9:30, we pee'd again, and checked out another tent. We saw a girl who was having a seizure right next to us, her eyes rolled to the back of her head as her soaking body jerked and twitched. I looked away, and grabbed P's hand, frightened. I was diggin' the vibe here anyways, the music wasn't as good. We decided to polish off the water and got a new one. After returning to our favorite tent, I peaked.
