The intensity comes in waves, some rolling, some crashing. This also depends on what we are doing. I found that listening to music helps to intensify the roll while taking a walk down the street calmed us down quite a bit,  almost allowing only a body buzz and slight giggles. I'm finding everything interesting or aesthetic at this point. I'm also feeling a sexual attraction to my partner that is hard not to give into then and there. Almost as though I've never seen or felt these things before. .. the part of the brain that tells me what I know about something almost seems to be disconnected,  leaving only a strong desire to simply experience. Anything and everything and anything that catches attention.
