GOR asked KB and I how we were doing, after he laughed at me for me poking my hand.  He goes down to Tom, puts his hand on his shoulder and asked him the same, but he responded with an 'I'm Ok'.  As GOR starts to walk away Tom remembers something he wanted to say and stands up to tell him.  Now, before I tell you the rest you need to understand how deeply rooted Tom's analytical and introverted life is.  It sucked.  Always over analysing a situation, always the kid who everyone asks why he doesnt say much.  For that one second I had the joy of looking at the kid.  For that one second when all the blood rushed from his head to the other parts of his body.  I watched as he stopped after he stood up, and put his head down low in the light, and just was absorbed in the E rush.  First time roller, stands up, blood rushes to his head and he knows he is rolling.  He was trying to analyse and negotiate with what was coming, and what he was feeling in the previous 40 minutes.  He was trying to rationally understand what the drug was doing to his body, like how an intellectual deals with taking acid.  He actually thought that E was going to be like tripping.  And in that moment, not only did he lose the report on what he was feeling but at that almost magical moment he realised that what he was feeling couldn't be described by words.  It was a spiritual experience that only gave made him laugh in sheer joy.  He stood up with his thoughts and ideas and sat right back down, unable to cope with the feelings of unity and happiness with the music.
