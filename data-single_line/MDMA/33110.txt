The 4 hour and something minute ride felt like 2 seconds. The time lapse, which was 3 hours behind, had me confused as to where I was and why I was there. I had deboarded and ran through the airport trying to find my ride. An hour past when I finally found my ride and I hugged the limo driver, I was happy he was alive. The mountains in arizona were beautiful, flowing colors and the skyline was amazing. Later on to watch the sun set and bask in its glory I ate another pill and let the sun set. I realized that there was more to life then I have ever before. Everything was so clear in my life. It was the happiest hours of my life.
