This next part gives me Goosebumps.  When I looked straight ahead there were these giant men there were like 15 of them walking in the street in between my house and my neighbors house across the street.  They kept walking over my wall and my neighbors wall.  Then all of a sudden there was a giant pallet and they were working on my neighbors house and got like halfway through the pallet when it finally started wearing off.  Apparently my friend and I were rolling balls for 6 hours in the hot tub.  If we werent tripping so hard music would have definitely helped our trip.  Then I finally got out and made him go inside first to make sure there was no one in there.
