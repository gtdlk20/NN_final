We decided to walk up the street to royal farms and buy some cigarettes and gum.  The walk was amazing, I felt extremely euphoric.  I was feeling extremely happy and just started looking around everywhere.  This was mid January and there was wind warning that night.  It was extremely cold but I remember not being cold at all outside.  We got to Royal Farms and I decided I would walk in and get the cigarettes because I convinced Stoner and myself that I could 'act sober'.  Immediately as I walked into  the store a wave of heat hit me and it felt wonderful, I also noticed the lighting in the store to be extremely bright, glowing almost.  I stood in the middle of the store and just said 'wooooooow'.
