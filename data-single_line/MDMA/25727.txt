If the first experience was a rush this was a freight train. My best likening is like that of having every cell of my body engage in a constant orgasm for about twenty minutes. The experience was so strong that I had to sit for the first few minutes and although I knew I was fine I also felt my heart mumbling about the new workload. After a few minutes I got up ... began to dance, and couldn't believe it was possible to feel this good. I took a fourth in halves when I started to come down a little because oh god I wanted nothing more for this high to continue but didn't feel anything. Anything more I should say I was still rolling incredibly hard. I was dancing in ecstasy while watching this gorgeous creature of a girl do the same in front of me. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. She was a blonde haired goddess swaying to the trance around us.
