The week prior I had been scouring over the internet to ascertain as much information I could concerning the effects and mal-effects of the drug and so was in a highly anticipative mood.  On the day of the trip Dave and I had wandered over to a friends house to sell him some of the contraband.  To our delight we arrived to see him rolling and megalomaniacal.  As Dave pulled out his sack of 50 pills the friend snatched at them and proceed to rob him and punch him in the face, acquiring around 30 pills.  The door was then slammed in our faces and we were never to see the pills again  revenge was sought but its irrelevant.
