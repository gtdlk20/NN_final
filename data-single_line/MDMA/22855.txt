Round 6h I think it was, although I must say by this time I'd lost track of time, we left for a friends house. By this time almost all of the effects of the drug had worn off (as far as I could tell at the time). Some people were sitting/lying/tripping inside, some people enjoying the first sun (and a sandbox) outside. Everyone took some drinks (to make it easier, I'll just mention here that throughout everything described below I also drank about 4-5glasses of wine and smoked about 6-7 joints, although all of these where split with about 4 people).
