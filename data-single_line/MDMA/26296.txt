At this point I pretty much lost track of time. I was peaking from the first pill and the 2nd half is beginning to hit me. I am sweating but I feel great. The only  thing I dont really like about these pills is that they make me shake, a lot. I tried to pack a bowl and I had to make D do it because I was shaking too hard. I tried to pack a bowl and I had to make D do it because I was shaking too hard. We were listening to all kinds of music and we were having lovely conversations about us. I realized that I am in love with D and I am so ridiculously happy to be with him. I realized that he not only cared about me but he is there for me no matter what and a bunch of other really deep stuff. Eventually we were sitting around, me without my shirt or bra on, playing with my kitten (Delilah) and D in just his boxers continuously shoving gum in his mouth (he kept telling me the flavor was like an orgasm in his mouth) and I kept basically chain smoking cigarettes (which is not very cost effective, they're 10 dollars per pack in NYS). We did have some mind blowing sex. It felt like my whole body was orgasming the whole time. When he came he came for like 20 minutes. It was amazing. And afterwards we just kept kissing and touching and cuddling. We talked about why kids are scary and why I dont want any for at least 10 years. We talked about our futures and our pasts and we talked about our friends. I felt like I was in a very loving place, with a wonderful person.
