I looked in the mirror and my pupils were incredibly dilated.  Like my entire eye was black but I was cheesin so hard.  I wandered around my friends house and saw a picture of his lil sister who is a year older than I am and I fell completely in love(again).  We left(I didnt get a chance to meet his sister unfortunetly) and went to the bowling alley.  We got in and did our thing and started to bowl when I realized that there were sooooo many people in the bowling alley.  I told this to my brother and he pointed out there were only about 100.  I did some math in my head and figured that there are 50 million times that amount of people on this earth.  I wanted to talk to all of them!! I wanted to talk to all of them and change all of their lives.
