Finally.  This is a very potent drug.  I think, like all drugs, it should be treated with the utmost respect.  If one allows it, it can take one to new heights and connect one with humanity and nature in a most beneficial way.  They say that one dose of MDMA is worth three good months of psychotherapy. And I am inclined to agree with that statement.  Since my trip, I have been a happier and more good-natured person.  MDMA showed me a lot about myself.
