I've had a couple of previous experiences with MDMA and quite a few more with oral sex, but had never combined the two.  I am not on any other medications or supplements and did not take any other drug along with the MDMA.  On the evening in  question, about two hours into an Ecstasy trip, I was performing oral  sex on my companion when I became aware that the gag reflex that  normally would kick in at a certain point was simply gone.  My partner's  entire and substantial penis was comfortably all the way down my throat,  and I had no uncomfortable or unpleasant physical sensations whatsoever  -- to the contrary, I felt perfectly comfortable.  No special effort was  required to keep this up, and I comfortably continued on for about 10  minutes (and could have continued longer, given the opportunity, but  other activities beckoned).
