The total experience lasted until 8:00am.  I then slept for 3 hours.  Upon waking, I felt very week, and very thirsty.  Kind of fuzzy in the head, like a long night of drinking.  I attended holiday functions that afternoon, and upon returning home I took another tab about 8:00pm.  I again felt the sickness in my stomach, and never reached the peak I had experienced earlier that day.  About 11:00pm I took another tab, this time without the sick feeling, but a very strong peak.  Again with strong effects of touch and sound.
