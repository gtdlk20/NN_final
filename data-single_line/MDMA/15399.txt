Eventually my friend came in, all apologies and filled with sorrow.  She didn't understand her anger either, and just wanted to put it behind us.  She was crying and pleading for my forgiveness.  I was exhausted and didn't want to argue anymore, so I accepted her apology, and was relieved that the shit storm was over.  The next day we went for a walk and took it easy.  We had each had about five drinks the night before, over the course of about five hours, and didn't feel hungover as much as exhausted.  We made dinner and turned in early.  I flew out the following morning.
