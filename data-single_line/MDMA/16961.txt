T+2:30 - I have gotten my hookah assembled and burning. The tobacco seems to calm my thoughts but I am definitely rolling HARD. My thoughts feel very focused and clear. I swear that this is the best E that I have ever had, EVER! My god, I don't feel like I am out of control like I used to. I swear this is the happiest I have ever felt.
