Ecstasy is a very powerful and wonderful drug.  It makes me quite literally as happy as I can possibly be.  My body is carressed in waves of joy.  All of the taboos society places on us for no real apparent reason disappear.  Jen and James were both nude for alot of the experience and Sarah was topless, none of us cared or anything it was just the natural way to be for them at that moment.  I was left with what I truely believe and know and why I am the way I am.  I have been long aware of my personality traits, but E has taught me alot about WHY I am the way I am.
