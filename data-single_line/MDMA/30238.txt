So were at the bowling alley so I was bowling and I was INCREDIBLY rollling and I was INCREDIBLY high and my first few bowls were awful...I actually tossed a ball in the air it sucked so bad but I was still happy cuz I was rollin like no other. After bowling we dropped one friend off and then my brother off at home so he could pick up his car and take me home the next morning(we were sleeping over at his girlfriends house).  When we got to my brothers girlfriends house I found out that my parents were so pissed off at me becuse they didnt know I was sleeping out that nite and they wanted me home rite away.  I was rolling so hard and it would have bummed me so bad to go home. I convinced my brother to let me call my parents and he said 'ok I dont know if it will help I argued with them for 30 minutes and they didnt budge an inch.' so I call my parents at 1 in the morning and...I ended the conversation in control with the outcome I wanted.  My brother was goin nuts cuz he thought we were in deep shit and I was gonna get caught.  We watched batman, drove a friend home at 3 AM and I went to bed
