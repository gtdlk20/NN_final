And suddenly I could see again, and I could stand again.  Convinced my boyfriend had saved my life and thrilled that I hadn't died, I was suddenly filled with joy again.  The panic was gone and I felt completely wonderful as I had a few minutes ago.  I decided that movement like walking was simply too great a pleasure for me to tolerate, and said I wanted to just lay down in the tent.  (The next day, my boyfriend told me that he had watched me hyperventilate myself from the excitement of how good walking felt, to the point of almost passing out.  The reason I suddenly felt perfectly fine again a few minutes after collapsing, was because he coaxed me into breathing normally again.)
