At my school they call it thizz... Thanks to Mac Dre. But I'm going to call it X. So about a month ago me and my friend decided we would try ecstacy and so we ventured to our nearest supplier and bought 2 red safeway pills for 30$. We thought it was a good deal and being that we were so exited to try it we bought it right away. With  the internet I had done research needed to know what exactly I was getting into and what I should do to prepare. So with a bottle in hand and a pack of chewing gum in pocket, I was ready to roll. Litterally. But once I had the water and was going to drop, I wondered about the authenticity of the pill and not knowing the dosage scared me a bit. And so I held on to the pill instead of taking it, for I was not as ready as I thought I was. My friend however did take the pill and had an awsome time. He explained it as the most perfect feeling of life in the world. So after watching him and seeing what it was like from a 2nd person's perspective, I was then ready to drop.
