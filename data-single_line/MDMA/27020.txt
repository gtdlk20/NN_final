But recently I did experience ego death when I popped a Molly, and it was nothing like I expected or could have ever anticipated. It was very pure stuff and my best friends roommate hooked me up. I went out to a club to celebrate a friends birthday and just felt bad vibes all around. I decided to go back to my friends house and chill. I started thinking about my family and started having overwhelming fear  a normal experience for me whenever I think about them, well at least before now. I thought about them and I was flooded with lots of different fear based emotions like worry and resentment.
