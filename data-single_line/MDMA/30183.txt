 Definately helped us relax and for me personally, I came to a lot of conclusions about needing to grow up and trust my boyfriend, he's 26 and I'm 21 so I really need to stop acting like a little hs biddie and believe he loves me. Furthermore, with e the next next (ie sunday) day was a bummer, I was sorta depressed and thought 'Oh my god, he will never love me as much as he did last night ever again!!' but with the molly I'm  just back to my normal self.
