5) Have a great time. I find myself often thinking back to the great feeling of X, and honestly, I can't wait until I do it again. BUT, I'm keeping this in check, and I know that the longer I wait, the better it will be, because my serotonin will be back at 'normal' levels, and the MDMA will be ready to work. WAIT. I know, it's great. But just give yourself some breathing room and do it occasionally, and everything should be fine.
