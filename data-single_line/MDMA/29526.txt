It might be important to note that we had been smoking almost pure purple haze joints with added Shivas resin for an hour before the hallucinations started coming on.  I was strangely depressed just before the effects began, this is why I took an extra dab of powder and the effects took hold soon after. When I started going under I was immediately aware of its power, the start was like the beginning of DMT except that I was compelled to quest for something.  The quest lasted a short amount of time but was very difficult.  When I reached the top of a pillar of rock I found a tiny box on a pedestal, after sighing for it like some bizarre library, I unlocked the box and took out a ring consisting of two concentric gold pieces when I put this on the third finger of my right hand it split and locked on.  The two parts crossed at the sides of the lower knuckle and opened in a way that allowed me to flex my finger.  The flesh in-between the rings was now transparent to me in both the real world and the dream world.  I could use it to read auras and peoples thoughts in the real world.
