At this point we were very much hoping that the X would bring us the positive mental push and happy warm feelings we had known before.    And I'm pleased to report that some of the magic was back!   I was completely ready to tell my friends and my wife how great they were--to have easy conversation and enjoy the sights and sounds.   We spent a long time in the lounge, chatting and enjoying each other's company.   After a couple of hours, we re-upped, and the booster really jacked the roll up to positive land.   It wasn't quite the positive vibes and overwhelming euphoria I had in my earliest rolls, but then again the setting wasn't 100% comfortable...there were people around, a waitress to contend with, and one friend had some trouble with anxiety before the second dose.   Still, I felt really relaxed and positive, if not euphoric.   I would also report that I had fewer side effects (jaw-clenching and eye-twitters are usually big for me) until I took the second dose.
