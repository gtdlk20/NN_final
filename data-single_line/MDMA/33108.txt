Right before take off I had put on some trance like music and slowly closed my eyes and when it happened I felt like I was moving up 2 god, kissing the sky and riding on the clouds. The water was clear and I saw everything below it in perfect shape, the clouds slowly moved and started to perpetuate colors. I had closed my eyes once again because the high was so intense with the alittude change and I heard my name being called from all around I tried to call back out but no words were spoken.
