It was 4AM when I got back to As house where I was staying, and I was still rolling a little, and I was definitely still tripping.  I had a swift crash, but I didnt get any negative thoughts or anything.  I just felt physically drained.  I believe I didnt experience a harsh come-down because of the life changing experience I had.  Though I felt very drained the following day, I was filled with new ideas and beliefs about things for a week after.  I have had plenty of life changing experiences on traditional psychedelics, but this was my first for entactogens.  I still favor natural psychedelics, and I always will, but Ive now seen the power that entactogens can offer.  I will say this though, I definitely favor MDA over MDMA.  One of my friends told me of someone that tried MDA back in the day, and said they called it Cub Scouts of America, or Coke, Smack, and Acid because it gave you the strong euphoria and stimulation of Cocaine, but it gave you the intense euphoric body feelings of Heroin, and it made you trip.  Though this is a stretch, I can understand where he got that from.  MDA has a special place in my heart, and I now understand the unique psychedelic effect that entactogens offer.
