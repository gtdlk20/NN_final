By 6:30 we were coming down, my brother had gone to sleep and the girl on mushrooms was getting quite annoyed and tired. So around 7am we smoked a joint out my window in hopes of falling asleep faster, as well as avoiding a harsh esctasy crash.  That was the only bad part of the night for me.  After smoking, we quickly cleaned up the bedroom and got in bed. I began hallucinating wildly: beautiful colours filled my room. The hallucinations didn't bother me. It was the feeling I had inside that ruined the night.  By mixing the comedown of ecstasy with weed had caused me to think too much about understanding things and life itself as organisms.  I began to feel like my best friends were intruders in my home. I felt as though my personal space was being invaded.  It took me a very long time to fall asleep, due to this feeling.  Although by 9am I believe I was asleep.
