I notice an unsettling silence developing.  Its not as though my hearing is muted like when underwater or using earplugs.  There is literally not a sound existing in the world.  Maybe time has frozen and thus no sound can occur?  Im reeling underneath an ocean of sedative pleasure as I try to put together a coherent analysis of my condition.
