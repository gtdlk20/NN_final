When I was certain that I had all the drugs out of my system I returned to jujitsu as usual.  Before I started the warm up I noticed that I could get my wrists to touch my toes when before MDMA I was straining to get my fingers there.

At the end the Sempi in charge of the warm up sat on my shoulders to try to wear me out Â– my strength and fitness had grown considerably.  After the session I realised that I had not eaten all day because of the twelve hours I had spent in the library.
