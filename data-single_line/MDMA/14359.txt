My friend just called me, he was checking in on how I am doing. He told me to call him in 10 minutes. He really cares about me and its so sad how I cant give the same thing back to him. Why why why. He is a beautiful person.  Dont care what other people would think of me if I went out with him. That is what I am worried about. Also living long distance. Those are the pathetic relationships. I need someone right there with me. Not on the phone. Not thinking of when we can travel to see each other, not phone sex. But I dont think I could fully give myself to one person. I cant connect with just person. I cant find someone perfect enough to fit myself into. I guess I could, but I find myself so multifaceted, that there is always something about that person that bothers me.
