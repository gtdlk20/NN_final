Unfortunately, we did not 'set the scene' as well as we had in the past.   The night began with friends unsure of where to partake.   Some wanted clubs and dancing, others a pleasant suite at the hotel.   The party eventually split up, and my wife and I went with another couple to the Wynn hotel to explore their lounges.  We dropped at their 'Parasol' lounge, with a lovely view of the waterfall in back of the hotel.   I was feeling very positive, and although the setting wasn't perfect, there was plenty to see, most of it beautiful.
