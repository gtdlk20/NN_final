Up until the end of October of last year I was what I would describe as an average, if long term ecstasy user. I would take 3 - 5 pills one night  a month usually at home, with the same circle of friends. I had been doing this since (with the exception of a six month period in 1997 after the break up of my marriage when I was taking 5  10 pills three nights a week) 1993 and had not experienced any of the Loss of Magic that I had heard reported. During this time I had not taken vitamins, Anti-oxidants or anti depressants. The only thing that I did was to make sure the next day I engaged with the world by going out to eat and didnt just crash out.
