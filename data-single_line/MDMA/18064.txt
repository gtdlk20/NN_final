Years ago when I had first started my journey in to drugs I never imagined I would be enveloped in the crazy world that I ended up in. I did know that I would try anything that came my way as long as I knew everything I possibly could about it though. I went through various drugs starting in my early teens, but my drug of choice ended up being Ecstacy. After 6 months or so of delving in to the world of raves, parties, and ecstacy I had become quite experienced but also careless. The more I partied the more drugs I began to consume at a now understood, alarming rate.
