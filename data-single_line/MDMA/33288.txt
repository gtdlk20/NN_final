Around 11:30 it was hitting us pretty hard.  Just enjoying the great feeling, and having great conversation with my friends.  Everything is PERFECT, there isn't a thing in the world I would change at this moment.  I feel very energized and ready to do anything.  Just enjoying life and everything about it.
