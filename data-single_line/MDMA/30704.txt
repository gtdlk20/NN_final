Then I tried going back to calm settings by myself which worked for a few months a couple of times up to this past month, where I rolled once every two weeks, the last being St Patricks day at my second and definitely final rave. I went to usher in a friend to the world of MDMA but obviously I wanted to roll a bit myself. I took 3 pills at 8pm, as opposed to my usual 2 pills followed by two more later on. The pills didn't have any magic, no euphoria, no empathy, no energy, no happiness. It was pure intense dizziness and vertigo mixed with irritation. I ended up sitting in my car for 4 hours smoking weed to make myself feel better before going home and having the worst hangover of my life from anything.
