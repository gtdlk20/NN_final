My girlfriend, M____, and I dropped before 1 AM and went out onto the floor.  She bit her tablet in half while I took all of mine.  After over an hour neither of us were affected so she finished hers off.  By 2:30 AM a friend of mine, G____, found me and asked how my high was.  Nothing typical of a X high was happening.  I had plenty of energy, dancing was rad, but nothing had hit me with the usual 'ton-o-bricks.'  There was no tactile effects, and little euphoria.  He bought the same and was unimpressed with the results.  He wandered off to start digging around to see if anyone had tested it, or knew anything about 'yellow C.K.' while I went to the Chill room to find M____.
