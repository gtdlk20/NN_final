Ever since that time, I've viewed parties and rolling in a completly different light. Raving is about more than ditching worries and finding thrills; it's more about love. I've had so much more fun at parties now that I focus on the PEOPLE and not the drugs. E is amazing and I think everyone shoud do it some time in their lives. But I also think people should try partying sober. Be friendly and kind without any chemical aids. I admit it's not as fun, but the vibes you send will be out of the goodness of your heart and not cuz mdma made you do it.
