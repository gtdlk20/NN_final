I emerge from my introspective focus to once again join the conversation that is taking place in the room.  Im startled by the fact that I had not been physically hearing the words being spoken for the past 30 minutes or so.  This went beyond a normal ability to tune out things.  When I tuned out and drifted into my personal zone the sound in the room actually disappeared: it went to zero and I was transported to my own little bubble of pleasure and happiness.  I find this slightly unsettling, but mostly intriguing and enjoyable.
