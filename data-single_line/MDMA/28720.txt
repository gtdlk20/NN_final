I was extremely hot so I went outside in the 24 degree weather (remember, it is December) wearing my tank top and boy-shorts, I felt fantastic! My friend on the other hand was having the opposite effects, she had a hoodie, long pants, and a blanket on while we were outside, and I just didn't get it. Me and my friend went home and once the effects had worn off we decided we wanted more, so we had it dropped off and we did another line. We were both disappointed because we didn't go back into that full peaking mode, but we still felt it somewhat all the rest of the night. We didn't get any sleep until around 6:00 A.M. which was okay with us, because we never wanted the experience to end. I felt fine the next day, and that night was something I won't soon forget.
