Oh I feel so incredibly wonderful. I wish I could share this feeling with everyone, this harmony with the cosmos, this ambrosial beatitude, this transcendent love radiating from me throughout the entire universe. This love that mingles among the trees and waters of the earth, and the songs of birds, beasts, and men. I was meditating for about twenty minutes before I remembered that I was writing report, lol. It was so awesome. I dont mean awesome as it is so frequently abused now-a-days. I mean awe inspiring. I mean so grand and great it tears me down to my knees in awe! Perfectly dreadful! Also, my jaw is clenching, which is quite unpleasant. My vision is slightly blurred, when I move my head a lot it is quite dizzying. Music is wonderful. Cigarettes taste wonderful, nice and spicy. I was rolling my cigarette, and got a bit of tobacco stuck in the back of my throat. For some reason I got the urge to stick my finger down my throat and get it out. I stuck my finger DOWN there. But I did not gag. This is an effect I have not previously heard of. Also I was rough-housing with my dog, and as I was rolling around on the ground, getting him to chase me, I scratched my shoulder on a nail sticking out of my chair. The cut is extremely deep. Blood is still oozing out, but it does not hurt. These two effects lead me to believe that MDMA has a certain analgesic affect. Im going to get some peroxide
