I wanted to go in but was afraid I would disappear, so I went part-way in and stopped.  Whenever I would stick my hand further in, the bright light would engulf it, and it was as if my body became part of the light.  I saw the recently-deceased mother of a close friend, and she spoke with me for a bit.  I saw my grandparents who had passed away several years ago, they looked like balls of light but I still recognized them.  I was given information about how souls travel back and forth from earth after they pass on from their physical forms.
