I started taking exstacy with my husband because one of our friends tried it and recommended we try it.  The first time we took it, we were at home with the kids tucked tightly in bed.  We retreated to our family room, turned on some R & B, snuggled on the couch and within 40 minutes, we felt a rush of warmth all over our bodies. We sat up all night long just talking!  We literally didn't walk up the stairs until 7:30 the next morning. Scientifically, when you take X, it releases seratonin in your brain and when it is released for the first time, there is no better feeling in the world!  The first time we took it, we took 1 1/2 pills each.  That was more than enough for our first time.  The next few times we took it, which was within 6 weeks, we took 2 each.
