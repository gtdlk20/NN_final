My parents were taking me on a vacation to go see my grandparents in South Carolina, for a week, so I decided I wanted to do something the night before, kind of a going away thing with some friends. Well two friends and I asked a friend of my parents to take us to a concert at a club in RI (the show was all ages so my friends and I who are 14 and 15 got in no problem). I was already in a good mood, getting away from school for a week, and just had a lot of energy and a free feeling. I hadn't done E in about a month, so I was looking forward to it.
