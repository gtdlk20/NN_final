After taking a 'bomb' (a quantity of substance wrapped within a cigarette paper) due to the length of time that had passed after taking the drug and no noticeable effect I then snorted a second quantity.  This hit almost immediately however I suspect that this probably took effect at the same time as what had been swallowed.  Effects were very pleasurable - general feeling of 'gliding', defiantly talking about things I have never discussed in the past and would not talk about under general circumstance.  People and objects looked much more pleasing however this was not necessarily a good thing as it led to an incident that almost caused irreversible relationship damage.
