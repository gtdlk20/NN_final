I remember thinking that I couldn't believe we deliberately do this to ourselves. Being high and coming down felt like the most unnatural thing in the world, which I guess it is. I couldn't understand why anyone would put a foreign substance into their bodies. All of these thoughts came from the fear of having seen my face in the mirror, how distorted it looked. I think my brain was a little fried at that point, after having ingested 4 pills, and I was experiencing a slight freak-out.
