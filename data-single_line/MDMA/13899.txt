I am grounded enough to check the time: a habit I traditionally try to keep when taking notes during an experience.  I scribble a few comments down about the past hour.  My handwriting is messy and my spelling questionable.  There is no frantic rush to get down every minute detail (I often try to do this on a wide variety of substances).  My written comments focus on the big picture; broad and clear thoughts such as Be happier more often  just choose to be.  The simplicity and absolute correctness of these thoughts are existence-shaking in a very positive way.  I couldnt be in a better mental place than this.
