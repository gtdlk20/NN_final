I was having a good time, but my emotions of depression, being away from home for so long and the prospect of further confinement in this land far away. Idly walking around, I enquired in the women's toilets for some menthol rub. I was coming down and needed a boost. Obtaining some, I rubbed it on my lips and under my eyes; the headrush was minor, but pleasing flashes of color wavered before my eyes briefly. Disappointed, I told of my need for something more. I was told there was an expert on putting people 'thru the floor.' Interested, I was led to the person, Alex; he was candyflipping, that is, he was bugging on acid and E at the same time.
