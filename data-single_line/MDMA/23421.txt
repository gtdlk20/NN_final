In the summer, about 10 of my friends and I decided to go spend a weekend together for the sole purpose of relaxation and to renew friendships.  Of course, there were the use of drugs but our trip didn't orbit around the use of it.  We smoked weed once we set up our tents and were stoned for most of the day (which was a friday).  On the Saturday of our camping trip, we all decided to chillout because we wanted to drop in the evening.  We ended up eating some dinner, and we all took our first pill at 10pm.  We were sitting around a rather puny campfire but we were all huddled together so we weren't that cold.
