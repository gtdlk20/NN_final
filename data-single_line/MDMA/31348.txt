But there are times when about a day after I take the ecstasy I get symptoms of sickness, which is actually horrible withdrawl. My bones ache and I feel almost as if I were like 70 years old and trust me I've got about 52 years until then. My throat starts to hurt and I get horrible headaches that enable me do virtually anything. These 'crashes' do not always happen however and it may just be certain kinds of ecstacy that cause this. I usually 'chill roll' when this occurs and the MDMA gives me symtoms of some sort of pain killer.....
