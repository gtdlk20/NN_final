5:00 p.m. (approximately) We moved inside to listen to music. I put on the tape of the Grieg Lyric Pieces, which we listened to in its entirety (90 minutes). We were extremely at piece, the music was outstandingly beautiful, and seemed to aid us all in going much deeper within ourselves. We felt the experience to be particularly profound. Tatiana left during the music to visit a neighbor, and came back later. We ate lightly, soup and bread, and yet it seemed completely adequate and satisfying. Then we listened to Tatiana sing as she played the guitar, and it seemed also very appropriate and maintained the group bond.
