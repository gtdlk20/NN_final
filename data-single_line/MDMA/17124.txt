01:45 - I have reached the plateau. Everything is more gentle now. I am no longer excitedly sprinting around my apartment flooding myself with stimulation because I feel like I can control it more. The music is wonderful, setting is awesome. Spent some time watching MDMA/Trance visual videos on YouTube. Back to listening to music now, upbeat still. I started thinking to myself about how I will be ready for the comedown, and that knowing this will end is good and healthy to think about. Does not diminish my experience at all, still having a blast. I personally enjoyed the come up, I loved the overpowering and frantic excitement, wanting to touch and feel everything I saw.
