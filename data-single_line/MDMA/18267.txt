Well, I definitely passed the peak of this experience. As I first begin to come down, I feel sad. I want to take another, who wouldnt want to experience sublime perfection continuously? To attempt to alleviate my sudden depression and disappointment, I repeated the words. I do not feel the need to repeat that experience at this time, over and over again. This helped a lot. I dont really know what to say now. Before, I was so inspired to communicate my feelings in this report. But now, I dont feel the need to communicate with you ordinary experience, wake up tomorrow and go to work, and then youll get plenty of that for yourself.
