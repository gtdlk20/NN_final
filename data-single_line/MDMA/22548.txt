This was my first time trying E.  I had had a very long and hard week with work.  I had been waking up around 6:00 am every morning to drive to D.C. to haul monitors around until about 2:00 pm.  The weekend came and I was looking forward to relaxing a bit, which usually meant getting drunk somewhere.  That particular night there was nothing going on, so I ended up going to bed early.  The next day (Saturday) I woke up around 10:00am and hung out with my friend until about 5:00pm when he had to leave to go to a work related party.  So I went home and sat around waiting for something to do.  My friend, Stoner is what we called him, talked to me over the net and said he was getting some E pills that night and it slightly sparked my interest, but I wasn't 100% on taking it.  I figured I'd wait to see if there was anything else happening then I'd decide.  Well 10:00pm rolled around and nothing was happening so I let Stoner know that I would enjoy rolling with him.  He told me to pick him up  around 11:00pm so we could go pick the pills up.
