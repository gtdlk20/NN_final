We walk into my house around 12:30, my parents were asleep upstairs so T and I go to the basement, which is sound proof, thank god. I was expecting to come up shortly but nothing came, 1 o'clock came around and still nothing, I was very dissappointed so T rolled a couple of j's and I smoked that, thats when it started. Around 1:15 I felt a strong surge of energy rush through my partially tired body.  Withen 5 mintutes I was rushing.....VERY HARD. I was so blown away by how I felt and I was in the most comforting state, even tho 2 floors above us my parents were sleeping.  I immidetly plugged in my boom box and the jams started.
