Jan 9th: Only 10 milligrams of Adderall gave me a short, mild panic attack while in the shower. I had to get out and lie on the bed for 5 minutes. The only reason Ive continued to take the Adderall is due the extreme lethargy Ive been feeling since the experience Jan 2. Another day at home on the sofa. After doing some research, I believe Im further exhausting my adrenal system by taking Adderall. I will not take it for the next week so my body can recover. Mentally, I felt cloudy most of the day.
