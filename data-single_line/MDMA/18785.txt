After hitting my peak, I definitely still felt high, but I didn't feel as out of my mind as before. The feeling had gotten a little overwhelming and even a tad scary beforehand, but now I felt it was more under control. G and I held hands throughout the rest of the movie, and when we walked out, we exclaimed for about 20 minutes how much fun we had in the theater. We hadn't spoken much to each other the entire time, apart from 'Wow, look at that!' and other such things, but we both felt as though we'd just connected on such a different level, like we had had a long, serious discussion about ourselves and our friendship.
