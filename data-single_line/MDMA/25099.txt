WHAT I LEARNED: Most important thing: X is priceless, wonderful, everyone should try it. We need to have less stress and craziness in our lives and world, and take time to enjoy music, and be more accepting of others. That feeling was tenfold while rolling, I expect it'll go away by T+4 days. I also expect to retain feeling of peace and gentleness, and slight acceptance of others, wish for nicer world, slightly more enjoyment of music. I feel really super friendly with people who have rolled or want to, I share a great bond with them automatically. Still kindof thinking about objects like they have hidden personality. I like that, it makes everything easier, hope it stays. Sad. Need company. It was totally worth everything.
