The beauty of the nature outside the window is blowing my mind.   I am overwhelmed by the raw energy and emotion circulating through the air, exchanging between myself and landscape outside.  I am not seeing any physical manifestation of the connections being formed, only feeling them in my emotional core.  The ideology that humankind is one with nature is making more sense than ever before.  I cant even say that I am amalgamating with the trees, bushes, dirt, and air because the sensation I am experiencing is more a realization that I have never been different or separate from these things.  I dont literally think, I am the same thing as a squirrel or tree.  Rather, I am simply more aware of our similarities in existence than our differences.  The feelings of oneness and interconnectivity bring me happiness and a comforting sense that I am never alone in this universe.
