While in my first year at college I discovered thanks to several of my friends the joy that is ecstasy.  So, one weekend I decided to come home, as I live only a reletively short drive from school, and roll with my two closest friends, Sarah and James.  Sarah is my age and has been my best friend since Junior Year in high school.  About a year before this experience I had realized that I was deeply in love with her.  About three months before the experience I told her, and she said that she already knew and that she didn't think of me that way.  After this event our relationship, while still fun, was a tad strained.  James is her little brother who is two years younger than we are.  He over the course of the last year had become my second best friend and we confided in each other about everything.  This is primarily because he and I remind each other of ourselves to an extremely large degree.
