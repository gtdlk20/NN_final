I found this trip neither good or bad, but a waste of $40. Perhaps I had a weak strain of shrooms (which is not likely from my hippy) so I accredit this wasted trip to my MDMA use the night before. Moral of the story, I'll stick to the green sticky icky if I plan on taking a trip into my sub-conscious anytime soon.
