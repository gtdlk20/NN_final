I blow my nose and retrieve a fresh straw.  Committed to the cause; I sniff confidently.  I have a bit of a leather nostril from my current habits so the sting is not terribly unpleasant.  I pause about a third of the way through the line to take a deep breath.  I am already off baseline.  My mood is synthetically lifting; IÂ’m smiling without cause or reason.  I can feel warmth starting to develop within my body.
