Me and A swallowed the pills at exactly 11PM, right before we got back to Ps.  I started making the tea for them, and I explained to them the process of making it in case I started rolling really hard and couldnt pay attention to what I was doing.  After about 20 minutes, I felt a little strangeness, but no euphoria yet.  I walked outside after making two cups of tea, and now Ps cousin wanted to try the tea.  I walked outside off of the porch where A and Ps cousin were sitting, and it was then that I noticed the euphoria coming on.  It was mild, but every wave was getting more intense.  I walked back inside, and P was finishing up his tea, and he commented on how dilated my pupils were, and he said I looked like I was rolling.  As soon as he mentioned the word rolling, that set it off.  A wave of euphoria shot up through me, and my heart started beating faster.  I felt a stimulation that led me outside.  I didnt want to be in a closed in space.  I asked A if she was feeling it yet, and she said she was unsure.  I told her to get up and walk with me into the yard, as I know sitting down can keep you from experiencing some of the effects.
