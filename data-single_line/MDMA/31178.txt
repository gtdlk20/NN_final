It was a panicky experience coming up, then sublime for hours.  I woke up the next morning and felt relatively cheerful, if a little fuzzy.  Only the fuzziness lasted until right before spring break (~6 days later).  When I finally got home (TN) from college (in AR), significant depression had creeped in.  I felt a lot of dread and some of that same panic (though without the same intensity) of coming up on the MDMA.  Nightfall upset my condition considerably, and the feelings hearkened back to my childhood fears, ones that were believed to have been overcome.  I've been given various times that it takes to overcome these weird feelings (most of them being around 2 weeks), but I have talked to my parents and am seriously considering going to see a psychiatrist.
