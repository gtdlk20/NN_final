It was New Year eve and I had come home from college.  While I was gone, alot of friends got into the club scene and knew a club owner who was keeping the club open afterhours for people he knew.  After taking one at about 11:00, chewed the pill per a friends insturctions to get it going harder/faster - and it tastes like shit.  Imagine chewing asprin - just worse, and it was a hard taste to get rid of.  It took an hour to kick in, it was about midnight.
