The second time I did it, it was off a whim and again because of my girlfriend. I knew my girlfriend didn't approve so in an effort to establish a more autonomous relationship, I told her I wanted to do it again. I requested that she only disapprove after giving me a reason beyond the negative experiences that she's seen. Well, she didn't and she bid me good luck for the night. That night, I went to a  'rave' at a frat. Although the DJ played undancable music, I had a very positive experience. Growing up, I was very repressed. I was a nihilist until about 8th grade and then I was a depressing deconstructionist. When I was on E, I felt completely empathetic. It is very difficult for me to relate to others. This is my defense against a society where people are so repressed and conflicted. On ecstasy, I was indulged. Others understood that I was on drugs and I was allowed to compliment people without worrying what they would think of me. I was given a pass to ignore the social norms. I was in an environment with other intelligent individuals. I could feel their passions and their interests, but I also shared their disappointment.
