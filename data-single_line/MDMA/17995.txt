My Dad was still slightly worried about finding a good seat, but I felt very relaxed about it and felt strongly that we would have a good time no matter what.  Such optimism and lack of anxiety is strange to me.  Lots of busses passed us, but they weren't even stopping any more as they were crammed full of people and no more could get on.  I was glad to be walking instead of trapped there with so many people.  We suddenly arrived at the venue.  We could tell nothing much was happening yet as loads of people were just milling around outside.  We hurried in, and were patted down by security.  They took my bottle of water away, which I thought a little mean but not suprising.  I bounded towards the entrance to the main hall, forgetting that the seated area was upstairs.  The ticket checker turned me away towards the stairs.
