I have always wanted to try E, and the first time i did , i made the mistake of drinking about 3-4 beers and the mistake of doing it around alot of strangers and the mistake of doing it just by myself, and i must say it wasn;t quite the experience i was hoping for. I was very quiet and in a shitty mood. So you would think i would learn from my experience, about 4-6 weeks later i took another pill at home on a nice sunny day, and i started to feel the effects of this amazing drug, but once again, for some reason, i felt the need to have a few beers, and then my e feelings were gone, another waste. My experience is that alcohol kills the effects of xtc.
