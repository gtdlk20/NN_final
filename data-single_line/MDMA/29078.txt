Finally I get checked by a security guard wearing a yellow jacket, he says to go on through. Next thing I know I see two other people standing in front of me wearing yellow jackets, one this short, stubby black female. I thought they were more security guards so I was extremely confused, and peaking, and tripping out. Im just standing there rolling balls, not having a clue what to do. Ummm, your ticket? says the short black lady, followed by a loud burst of laughter only black women are capable of. I smile and think to myself Oh god, Im pretty fucked up right now. I give her the ticket, and catch up with my sister and we walk down this passage between to chain-linked fences. We were finally here.
