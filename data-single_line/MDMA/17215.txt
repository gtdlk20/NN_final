I know that I am visibly intoxicated, and everyone in line seems aware to some degree of my buoyant mood and unconventional behavior.  I just do not care, which is a big deal for me, since I am usually obsessed with how others perceive me- even strangers.  I feel freer than I ever have at this moment.  I even flirt with the cute cashier who rings us up which, again, is a major change for me.
