I will definitely do MDMA again in the future, but I know enough to wait a considerable amount of time to allow my serotonin levels to balance out again. Its something I think could be done maybe 5 times out of a year. I can definitely see how people could abuse it, and do it each week. I would love to drop a pill tomorrow if I could, but I know that is not wise. I will wait, and have few and far between experiences, but their power will surely make the wait worth it. Responsible use of MDMA can be well just unbelievable. It is the perfect drug.
