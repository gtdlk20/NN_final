We vowed to do no other drug but mdma and always snort it because it was so good.  As we gradually came down I became aware of my jaw really hurting from gurning.  I found it hard to sleep that night.  The next day I felt like a new person, my outlook on life had changed.  Over the course of the next year we took mdma almost every weekend.  My tolerance was sky high and the buzz was getting shitter.  I have now not touched any drugs (because of my job who test regularly) for nearly a year, but I know when I leave this job someday I am going to relive that day I snorted mdma for the first time.
