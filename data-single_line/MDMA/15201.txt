If you want a blissful, transcendent experience, I would just take 1.5-2 grams of mushrooms instead of MDMA. I've done this at raves, small house parties, concerts, etc, and it's always a blast.  I used mushrooms from age 18-21 and, from my own point of view, didn't suffer any mental problems until I started taking MDMA.
