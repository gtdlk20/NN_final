The next day I always awake to life back to normal.  This time I stayed up all night, and felt that it took a full three days for the drug to fully exit my body.  Who knows what caused these differences.  Perhaps it's just part of my body getting older.  Perhaps it was doing so much MDMA in one night, after not doing it for three years.  Perhaps it was the strange energy in the location that gave me such a strong response and maybe it was the lingering cold and exhaustion caused by the argument and the travel that left me with such a horrible come-down.  All I know is that I didn't associate the argument or the frustration over the stolen belongings and the subsequent torrent of tears or the depression and feelings of suicide with the ecstasy until I finally woke up and felt like my old self.  Only then was I able to look back and realize that it was the after-effects.  That's the problem with depression is that it's impossible to be rational.  And therein lies the danger.
