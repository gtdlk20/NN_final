And now for the best part of the night.... So I'm peaking.  Everything in my life is PERFECT.  Not a worry.  Just feeling very loving and happy, a feeling I haven't felt in a long while. But this feeling is like that multiplied by 1000.  Imagine being the happiest you could ever feel, and multiplying that by 100. I feel like we are all 'one,' like deep inside us we all have some unifying element.  I'm telling my friends that I'm having such a great time, and that I love them.  So I'm just 'feeling' the music and having a good time, and I turn around, and who do I see?  Out of 15,000 ppl here, I see the two people that were standing in front of us in line.  And let me tell you, I have never in my life felt so connected to two indivuals in my entire life.  And these are people I met about 2 hours ago, in line, and no virtually nothing about.  But I was so excited and happy to see them, it was unexplainable.  It was like seeing your best friend that you haven't seen in 10 years, but even stronger than that.  I felt so connected to two strangers.  I remember saying that I was so happy to see them, and that I love them, and that this is was my first rave and that I was having a great time.  They both gave me hugs back and said that they were happy two see me, with big smiles on their faces.  They were both said they were happy to see me, and that this was their first rave two (however, I know it wasn't... And know that they knew this was my first time rolling, but  honestly, I felt that they were just such genuine, loving people.)  Never in my life have I ever felt so connected (on such a deep level) to two people, let alone strangers, in my entire life.  It was incredible and taught me that we are all the same on the inside.  All human beings share something inside that unifies us.
