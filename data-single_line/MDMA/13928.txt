My arm is cramping from writing notes about the experience into my notebook.  I pause to rest my muscles and take a sip of water.  The last hour has passed in a normal perception speed: not seeming fast or slow.  I am feeling continually closer to baseline.  Much like a full-fledged DMT blast off experience (or any other high intensity psychedelic experience), the effects after the peak are strong compared to sober, but pale in comparison to the height of the experience.
