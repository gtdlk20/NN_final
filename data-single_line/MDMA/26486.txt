I had taken the pill at about 10pm and by 12am I wasn't really feeling anything which wasn't normal I had taken the pill at about 10pm and by 12am I wasn't really feeling anything which wasn't normal, so I thought it was a shitty pill and just gave up wondering if I was high or not. My sister said she didn't feel anything either, but she didn't care either way. A short while later I started getting dramatically tired. The party was in full swing and it wasn't near over, but I asked my friend if he would drive me home. All I wanted to do was get in my own bed and go to sleep. He drove me home and as soon as I got in my house I felt very comfortable and couldn't wait to go to bed.
