but before she got to deep into her thoughts, she asked me to turn the lights back on.  She had to say it about 4 times for it to register in my mind, finally i ripped myself apart from my thoughts, got up walked over to the lights... my feelings changed just then, I felt better, I still felt guilty like i'd done something terrible. I turned the lights on and sat down.  I was still disoriented, still rolling, but out of my bad memories. I got an intense headache and felt scared the rest of the night.  What had happened to me?  A bad trip?  but for only aboout 15 minutes I was lost.
