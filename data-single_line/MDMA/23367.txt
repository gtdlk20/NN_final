The side effects were the worst part. After we all left the park we decided to go home and TRY to get some sleep. P stayed at my place and J went home. Both me and P went home to my house and smoked a couple bowls before going inside and trying to go to sleep. I setup a bed in my room for P to sleep in and then immediately jumped into my bed and closed my eyes. After about 2 hours of trying to sleep I knew something was wrong, P couldnÂ’t sleep either. So we basically tried to sleep as much as we could before morning came. When morning came nothing was different, we were still coming down from the drug and had no sleep whatsoever. At about 11am I went to go have a shower, I looked in the mirror at my eyes, my pupils were still as big as pennies. This I thought was not right at all. When I got out of the shower I looked at P's eyes, still dilated. Something was wrong. So we called J at noon and asked him how he was doing. Same story, no sleep at all. So I told him to go and take a quick look in the mirror, same story, dilated pupils still.
