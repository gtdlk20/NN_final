Crashing really sucks. I started seeing hallucinations when I shut my eyes. I play this computer game called Starcraft a lot. And I had played it earlier the day before. When I shut my eyes. The game was playing, and I could see it. I really really did not want to see what I was seeing, and I was really irritated by it. It wasn't until later I was able to finally close my eyes and not see this game playing in my head, and passed out for about 30 minutes. I get up 30 minutes later to pee, and I still have this rush. I'm tired, yet my heart is still beatin rapidly and I'm breathing heavy still. I just wanted it to end. On top of that, my stomach was really quesy. Around 9AM, I just got up and paced back and forth for an hour, bitching about how bad I felt. I felt horrible.
