I have rolled many times since. It has made me a more open and happy person. I have forged relationships that are life long. Without trying E, I was headed on a downward spiral. I was full of anger and issues from my childhood. E has allowed me to talk about it and find love from people outside my family. I wouldnt trade my experiences for the world.
