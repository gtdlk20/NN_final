We discussed our relationships, past and present. Our parents, and their unfortunately narrow reality tunnels were a prevalent topic. I told him how lucky I thought he was to have such a wonderful family (his wife is the coolest woman in the world, and he has a new baby). I even told him some things I had never been able to talk about (including one little piece of information I had not previously admitted even to myself, though as soon as I said it , I knew it to be true). Our discussion ranged over a number of topics, including my exwife, his trouble with coping with full on psychedelic experience, and my ambitions to write. It was an incredible, irreplaceable conversation, and I have mdma to thank for it.
