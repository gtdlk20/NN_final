         On the other end of the trip, after I was down (about six hours from ingestion) I went to bed (in the very dark) and noticed I was able to produce a very delicate visual of stars sliding through my visual field, a little like falling snow.   This was almost certainly inspired by the gorgeous stars overhead during the trip, and goes to show that, yes, there is just a tiny sliver of a hallucinogenic quality to MDMA.   Very nice--a little post-high bonus.   I was tired the next day, but not too badly.  The second day I was positively filled with energy, contrasted with the last time I used MDMA (I didn't take any 5HTP then) and was seriously wiped out for two days.  One data point does not a connection make, but I'd suggest giving 5HTP a try if you find yourself tired the day(s) after a trip.
