A few songs in, my lack of physical health caught up with me. I was exhausted, overheating, but I just had to talk. By this point, visuals had gone, and I was much more in control. I messaged my friend (the one who supplied me), who not only provided great conversation but also convinced me to remove some clothes and have a drink. A great idea. The rest of the day was spent chatting and listening to music and generally feeling really good, but my body temperature kept fluctuating.
