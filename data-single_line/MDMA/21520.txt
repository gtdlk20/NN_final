T+ 6:00: I start dazing out and feeling very nauseous.  I try throwing up several times and only manage to get a very small amount up, I feel no better.  I close my eyes and experience some intense visuals (I suspect my second pill was MDA, the test never quite turned purple like the other pill did - Simon's Reagent)  I have never had any draw into psychedelics and therefore do not enjoy the experience.  I sit on the couch for the next two hours.  My boyfriend is still feeling nice and I feel like I am killing his roll.. this sucks.  I am feeling my eyes roll into the back of my head, experiencing increased visuals (only with eyes closed thus far).  Finally I decide I am done trying to feel good, and I attempt to sleep.
