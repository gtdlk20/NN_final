I took a long walk on the way to home thinking if they were really teasing me or if everything was only in my mind. I am not a type of person that gets offended easily, especially on MDMA, one really has to work hard to make me upset plus, at the start it was also fun I have to say but when it become too much I quit Probably the MC and the DJ were just playing their music and my brain created this sort of illusion, who knows  but I can tell you that if I would have been taking more MDMA or drank a lot of alcohol along with or mixed it with something else it could have led me to a proper bad trip.
