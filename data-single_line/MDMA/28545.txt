1.30am: I am sitting on my windowsill, smoking a joint. Still coming down. He tells me he's made it home fine, and I look up at the stars and observe the remainders of the visuals. I think back on the trip with a new outlook. I feel exhausted mentally, but I feel refreshed, like coming out of a pool on a clear summer day. A memorable day.
