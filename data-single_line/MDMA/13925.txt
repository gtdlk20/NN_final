Im well past the peak of the experience now for certain.  The intensity of the effects is hard to judge.  Im not really rolling and I feel more relaxed than I do stimulated.  In that sense, especially in comparison with the first hour or so of todays venture, Im somewhere near a +.  In comparison to my true baseline self however, Id certainly place myself at a minimum of a ++ and likely at a +++.  The intensity is smoother and calmer than I ever anticipated.  I liken it to moving water.  I was expecting to get tossed by the frothing white crashing of waves, like the rapids of a rivers surface.  Instead I find myself in the grips of an oceans depths: slower paced, yet tremendously more powerful.
