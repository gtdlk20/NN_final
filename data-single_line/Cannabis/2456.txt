The car turns into Michael's driveway, and when he gets out, he decides that they would have to wait another day to get the four nugs he offered to Benny and John--there was no way he could get in and out of the house undetected. The door closes, Benny turns the car around and after a minute he notices that he needs gas. This scares the bejesus out of me, because we were already cutting it close enough as it is.
