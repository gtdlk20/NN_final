Suddenly I can feel this red light (red light is the color of raw energy in the human aura, I later discovered, maybe a connection) all around my head, filling up the room, and he gives me the power of confidence. He gives it to me by beaming energy right into my subconcious and I'm filled with confidence. When he leaves me, he tells me it will be OK. He also shows me some valuable insights, clearing up the situation.
