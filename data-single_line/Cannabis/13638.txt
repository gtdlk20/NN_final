there was a pink color ball of fire in the base of my spine, and blue sparks entering the inside from the sides of my body (below ribs) when the energy got so intense and bright, it all exploded and I felt like expanding to the limits of the universe, merging with everything... Deep Expansion. When I calmed down, I heard a song from a radio nearby, it was a rock song, but as I listened to it I saw it change... to a christmas song ( deck the halls with bowls of jolly, palalalala etc...) =) and I became confused but the music soon turned again to the rock music I had been listening. It all quieted down after few more minutes. I went home to lunch, still feeling extremely relaxed, and on the afternoon I went to sleep at 15:00 pm... awakening the next day at 17:00 pm! I slept for 27 hours. I was perplexed.
