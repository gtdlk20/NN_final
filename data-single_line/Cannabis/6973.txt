I was shaking but I felt calm enough to go back to the house and get the things I'd left there, when we got back to the house my other friend was just about ready to leave, and I felt this tremendous mixture of embarrassment at the way I behaved, and certainty that I had lost my mind. I still had to get home which involved a couple of train journeys and a 2.5 mile walk. One of my friends also had to catch a train, and I remember praying that my train would come first as I really didn't want to be left alone, unfortunately for me his train arrived just as we got to the station so I was left on a packed platform still in the grip of the paranoia. I felt as if the other passengers were eyeing me warily as they passed by, in fact I'm not sure if they were or not, Was this another delusion or were they really giving me funny looks? After all I was probably acting a little strangely, so this uncertainty just fuelled my sense of paranoia.
