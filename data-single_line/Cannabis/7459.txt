Just the other day I was walking by an old friend's house.  I hadn't seem him in years.  As I was walking by they called my in and I went into his room to see him.  My friend (let's call him K) is paralyzed in various parts of his body.  I hadn't seen him since before the accident so I was a bit overwhelmed at the sight of him.  This once active guy is now bedridden.
