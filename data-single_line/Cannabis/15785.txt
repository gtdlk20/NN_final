I was joined by a friend, who upon sitting down next to me sparked up a meaning less conversation, in which I involved myself for a while, but seeing that in my current state of mind I would benefit more if I just turned and looked out the window. I told him in a very polite way that I am incredibly sorry but I must turn and look out the window now. (He thought I was joking but after seeing that I did not turn back to him he found another victim to bore with pointless chatter.)
