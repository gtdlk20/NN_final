They listened to some music and I sat and thought. The 1st dimension is side to side the 2nd is up and down and the 3rd is forward and back. The fourth dimension is time, which for the moment we'll say time is a line of time, we can go forward in time and perhaps back in time. So the fifth dimension would be side to side on this plane of 'time' and the 6th would be up and down. The thought of this made me feel as if I had just figured something amazing out. Then I thought to myself that this must be the answer to time travel. The rest of the night was spent eating bread, white chocolate chips, mustard and hot sauce. As me Ryan and des walked home, we ran into malcom's older brother in his van. He offered us some sniffing tobacco. We all tried it. It felt kinda minty. I don't remember what happened after that but I remember listening to stairway to heaven by led zeppelin and I could hear the wood of the drum sticks hitting the drums. The next thing I remember I was in english class the next morning. But that must have been the best weed I've ever had. I'm planning to get some more.
