CLICK!  -  Music.  I immediately jumped up from my chair, typed out hastily to my friend that i would be back in a bit and rushed over to the guitar.  I stopped for reasons i couldn't understand, looked around the room, and became extreamly scared in the blink of an eye.  Sudennly i had absolutely no interest in music, but wanted to get back with my friend because i was feeling unsafe mentally.  I started telling my friend that i was getting freaked out.  He asked questions in a calm manner to me such as 'tell me what youre feeling right now'... I lashed out at him for no reason saying things like.. 'Fuck you dude... i'm scared shitless.. i feel like i'm gonna die or something!'.  He was calm through the whole ordeal, but i felt like i was going insane.  I started asking myself questions in my head very VERY quickly with answers to none.  'What if i do die'?, 'What if the police find this chatbox after i die'!? Then i thought to myself... wholy shit... i'm so goddamn paranoid i THINK i'm going to die.  That settled my mind and i was very releaved when i come to the thought that i was just really stoned.  Duh AL... your not gonna die, your safe.
