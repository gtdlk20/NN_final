Trying to remember what happened was hard but the best description was that I felt nothing but the intense tingles I felt earlier. That was my everything, and a bright ball of millions of colours I couldnt understand or comprehend or even remember now. I felt nothing but the intense tingles I felt earlier. That was my everything, and a bright ball of millions of colours I couldnt understand or comprehend or even remember now. I forgot who I was what everything was all I was, was the colours and the feeling. It felt like forever in this form when suddenly the edges of the vision I had went yellow and I suddenly felt my body again gagging twice stopping myself somehow before throwing up. I sunk back into my nothingness but I started to understand things again. I had deep thought of what I was and eventually I started to wonder when I would return to life. Suddenly the person in the cubicle next to me flushed and my eyes opened I dropped my bag. I was still intensely high but not unconscious.
