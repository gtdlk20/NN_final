I tried telling myself i was coming down but the fact was I was in another world. I convinced myself the marijuana was laced with Acid or PCP, and i started to get visuals. This was the first and only time I have ever experienced visuals with marijuana use, and they were powerful. The stoplights were bouncing to the music and whenever something miraculous like this happened I would experience a 'Mindgasm' the only way I can begin to describe it would be if you were traveling at 2000 mph, flipping through space. Your world collapses and everything around you becomes unreal. It is a relieving feeling but if it occurs too many times, it could induce vomiting. We arrived at Wendys and i purchased a 5 piece chicken and a Biggie Fry. This was a very smart move. The food started to give me a grip on what was going on. Which was good. The documentary voice was telling me that I should play the roll of the 'shy guy' in order to play off the mind games that were destroying my sanity. So I watched out the window, experiencing several more mindgasms before we reached my car.
