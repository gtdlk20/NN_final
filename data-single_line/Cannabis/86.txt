The next day, I felt a lot better.  I even felt vaguely normal.  But it would be a good couple of weeks before I completely recovered.  Reality kept sitting just out of reach.  I decided to call home, to hear my mums voice.  Had I been completely compos mentis I would probably left it a few days before calling her, or at least not blurted out the entire nights events to her, sounding like a hopeless heroin junkie.  It was clear to both Taya and I for the two weeks after the event, that I still wasnt making decisions properly.
