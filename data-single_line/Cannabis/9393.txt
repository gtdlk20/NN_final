I sat on the edge of the bed for a while watching tv trying to take my mind off the way I was feeling like before it subsided. And I felt ok so I decide to get back in the shower as I had cut it short beforehand. I got out the shower and once again It kicked in again. I knew by now that it was coming on in waves and that I had to ride it out no matter what but things got worse and worse. As time went on my left leg started feeling weak and numb as well as my left arm. I then thought I was having a stroke so I got my shit together and went downstairs to where my partner and her mum were sitting and told them what I had done and that I thought something had seriously gone wrong. But even by telling them I still felt distant and anxious and that I was going to die so I was told to sit with them while it wore off but it didnÂ’t. The effect got stronger I felt that I was being pulled through the sofa and that I had no legs as I could not feel them touching the floor. My left arm started again as with my heart.
