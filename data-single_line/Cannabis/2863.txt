I wonder if it is psychological or if it is actually an effect of Huxley's idea (not his originally, actually, can't remember the first name... but he popularized it) that the mind is a reducing valve and that while under the influence of psychedelics (a term coined in a letter addressed to him... it means 'showing the mind'), this valve is opened by various degrees to allow more information than is functionally useful during daily life to pass into the brain. I think that freaking out is what happens when one is in an extremely perceptive mood and is suddenly aware of very detailed streams of information usually not available to perception due to the opening of perceptual doors by drugs. The mind's purpose is to mold sensation into perception and the ego functions to form perception into meaning. The mind and ego are not equipped to process all of the information that the brain is capable of sensing and so when they step in to try to process increased ammounts they can malfunction and create delusions. The ego, in particular, can get very insignificant information such as the inner working of the body all mixed up with personal problems and issues. This is when the freakout occurs.
