Let me explain: in a given 'session', I've found smoking one or two bowls far more effective than three or four. Others may have a different level of sensitivity, but in my experience, once I feel 'really high', smoking more will ONLY make me more tired and out of it. It's not like alchohol where ten drinks get's me ripped and two drinks gets me a little buzzed. Actually the most important factor in how high I get is the initial delivery system (one bong hit will get me higher than two pipe hits), the potency of the weed, and the setting/mindset before smoking and what I do when I'm high.
