In retrospect I could have just used the power button and turned the computer off in a matter of seconds.  But by this point I was starting to get very interested in the way the light from the monitor was highlighting the tops of my fingers and my knuckles  as well as hundreds of folds and wrinkles in my shirt.  It was then that my vision started playing tricks on me.  If you can picture the normal frame rate at which you view life and then imagine having that frame rate cut to two frames per second youll get an idea of what I was seeing.  I was still in the process of shutting down the game and the computer  but that task was somehow relegated to my subconscious as much more interesting things began to happen.  Suddenly I wasnt really in my room.  The surroundings were the same but the scenario in my mind had changed.  I got the sense that I was in a very early 80s music video with very stark lighting and what I could only describe as . . . trippy visuals.  My next thought was that I had been transplanted into the animated movie Heavy Metal, a very . . . trippy . . . movie.  I could see my arms and hands in front of me, but they were not really my own.  Somehow my vision had moved back behind my eyes and I was viewing the scene from inside my head.  After sitting in this state for several moments it finally dawned on me.  I WAS tripping.
