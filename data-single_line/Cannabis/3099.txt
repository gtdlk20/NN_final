After several days of despair and depression, I began researching ways to beat a drug test. I had been provided with a Chain of Custody form, which told me that I was getting a 5-drug urinalysis panel (for cannabis, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and PCP -- the 'NIDA 5', the most common urinalyses). The Web site for the lab where I was to be tested bragged about their adulterant detection skills (I highly recommend researching the tests and the lab prior to any screening!), so I knew that route was out. They even test for glutaraldehyde.
