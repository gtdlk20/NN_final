However, when a friend of mine gave me some weed as a gift, I had the opportunity to get high in the comfort of my own home. I smoked 5 hits in a period of 5-10 minutes, and a few minutes later I was stoned as hell. The reason I become antisocial is because I feel like a completely different person while high, and the way I process thoughts becomes so vastly different, I am unsure how I'm supposed to behave around other people, even if they're high as well. I had never been this high before, and instead of simply exploring different ideas and thoughts, my imagination ran wild. I had minor visuals around the corner of my eyes, which seemed to be different colored shapes, geometric but not in any real pattern.
