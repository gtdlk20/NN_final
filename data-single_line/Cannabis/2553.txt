I was dead again. I felt like my soul had been ripped from my body, and I was no longer alive. The room blackend, and suddenly I was all alone, alone in a chair, nothing at all around me. I could hear music and voices in the distance but I felt as if maybe I really was dead, even though in the back of my mind I knew it was only the drug's effects on me. I then lit a cigarette and took a long hit. The world was back, I was now in my friend's bed room, sitting in a wooden chair, AMAZING! how did I get from the living room to here. Everyone was tapping their fingers on me and asking me alot of questions, to which all, my best friend replied 'He's fucked up, just leave him alone, he's alright'.
