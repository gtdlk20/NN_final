I think I stayed in this neighborhood for a rather long period of time.  When I got there it was just dusk, and by the time I had gotten back to the road it was full on night, but I have no idea what happened in-between those events.  I have flashes of walking past houses and trying to look in and realizing how fucked up that was and moving on.  I know that I walked behind some houses trying to get to a river (no idea why I was doing this, it was a terrible idea).  I think in the end I walked in circles for a long time and then managed to leave the way I came in...  I have tried to FIND this location several times since and have never managed to, so I don't actually know where I went for that time.
