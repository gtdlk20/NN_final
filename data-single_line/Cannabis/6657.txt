This is when I became very frightened and started to shake while trying to return to my body. I had to grab onto something and maintain reality, so began to hug the arm of the couch while moving into the fetal position. It felt as though my legs were moving rapidly and my arms and hands couldn't feel my face when I made the attempt to touch it. Nothing felt like it was actually a part of my body, even, almost like I was just a being without a shell, reaching back and touching my discarded and empty self.
