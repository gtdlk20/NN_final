I finally concluded that the only way to prove that I wasn't an alcoholic would be to drink again and not have trouble.  Well that worked really well for one evening.  The next night as I was celebrating my new found non-alcoholism, I realized that perhaps I was in trouble.  However, I felt the need for further experimentation and didn't return to AA until the following spring.  One unfortunate side effect of AA indoctrination was that I could no longer party innocently unaware of the knowledge that I was a hopeless alcoholic. In other words AA had ruined my drinking.  So I sobered up again and adopted an AA way of life for the next five years.  I met my husband in AA and married him after three years of sobriety.  After 5 years or so I was very bored with  AA. I had accepted that I could not drink in safety but I was really tired of talking about it.  So I gradually started withdrawing from AA.  Around this time my husband had a material awakening and we both underwent a complete AA detox.  It was a lot like deprogramming ourselves after being in a cult.  Neither of us drank.  Years went by. We had a baby. We had been moving around the country a few times due to school and jobs and landed in California, eventually settling in the foothills east of Sacramento when my daughter was three years old.  Been here ever since.
