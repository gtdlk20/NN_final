I had just gotten out of work on a Saturday night and I pulled my usual routine of calling around to see whats happening in my small suburban town. A friend told me to meet him at a park where a few of our mutual friends had gathered to drink and smoke, a girl, lets call her cindy, was sniffing vodka through her nose, several other girls were drinking beers, and I and a few other male friends were playing 20 questions.
