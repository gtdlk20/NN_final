A lot of things happened that I don't remember, it all feels like a dream. I just remember saying like 'When I come to this place, I like to take a little piece of earth with me'. I think I meant that I was so completely far away from reality but sometimes I like to remind myself that I'm still just sitting on a bed. It wasn't like, bad, it was just very overpowering and tiring. I really had no control over my body and I really have no idea what I was saying the whole night. I also felt like my boyfriend was on the same wavelength as me, like we were traveling in a car together. Every time I thought I had hit the peak of the high, it just kept getting more intense. My boyfriend also was convinced he peed himself (he didn't), which was hilarious. I think we tried to watch a show or something but I don't know what it was. We went to bed around like 11:30 I think.
