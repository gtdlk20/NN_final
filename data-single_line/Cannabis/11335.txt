Every once in a while, I get an itch to take something. But the itch is really the most interesting aspect of the thoughts in which it swims. I parse through the thoughts. I attack the itch, and then I embrace it. This is kind of awkward, being in a dark room filled with bodies and attitudes and everybody dancing. There is a lot of raw sexuality, attractive men behaving like boys and rubbing against one another, sensuous women carrying themselves with an air of erotic unattainability, a lot of people on cocaine or ketamine, their stern faces looking at me with a lot of judgment in their eyes. I am dressed in lighter colors, have a smile plastered on my face - always, drugs are not at all necessary - and my hair is wild and fuzzy and free. They have an idea of what dancing to techno should be, and I am sure I do not fit in.
