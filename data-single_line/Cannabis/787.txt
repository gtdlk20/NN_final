12:45. I go back outside with J. Leaves of deciduous trees lit by spotlights seem to flow into the kinetic algorithm. They swirl around me. I can just barely force OEVs from the stimuli if I concentrate hard enough. J's getting tired, so it's time for me to go home. I'm not sure if I'm capable of finding my way back (it's a long way and it's past midnight) but I'm going to try and make the expedition. She sends me off with a bottle of water for my ridiculously dry mouth and some more cookies to take home. I ended up spilling much of the water on the book I was going to return to her which I'd totally forgotten about. (Water and me don't mix well when I'm stoned. I always end up spilling it.)
