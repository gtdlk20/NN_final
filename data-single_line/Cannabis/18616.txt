Well, I was sitting around my house thinking about what to do because my parents were gone for the week.  I decided to call up a few guys and toke a bowl or 4.  Friend A and B came over and we toked in the backyard.  It was some really good weed, but thats typical for oregon.  It was one of those 'one nug' eigths.  Once we we're extremely high, friend B started playing super mario 64.  Me and friend A decided we'd go out to the drum room in the garage to play some music.  I got on the drumset and Friend A got on the guitar, even though he didn't play!
