10 minutes after it hit I was totally baked, barely could walk, and only could only say around 3 words, I think its important to say that I dont smoke regularly and I have a really low tolerance to THC, however this never happened to me, at the moment I was feeling extremely paranoid and my thoughts were very slow. I had to stop to rest a little bit on every block, it was imposible to walk in a straight line. My friends were helping me to walk, we had to walk around 25 blocks to reach my home.
