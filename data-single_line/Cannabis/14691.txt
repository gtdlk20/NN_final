Several weeks ago on a Thursday afternoon before sport at school, my good friend and I decided that we should alter our state of mind ever so slightly through a complex ritual we like to call ?getting shitfaced.? I was not particularly in the mood to get stoned, as I tend to become very uneasy when I am the only one stoned in a large group, and my friend and I both do different sports, so I decided to only have one lungfull of mildly potent grass, spun with some crushed rose petals (they do nothing to change the experience in any way, my friend is just a bit strange).
