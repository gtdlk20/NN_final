5:49 PM: Yes, I'm looking at my watch and writing the times and everything that's gone on. I feel really messed up, and I start to explain how I feel to Cousin H. She looks at S and says 'oh dear god what have we done!' with a huge laugh at the end. I get on the trampoline and jump as high as I possibly can and I jump way above the netting. I feel as if I close my eyes, I'd be teleported away into outer space I'd be up so high. No, I'd be so high that God himself would put his hand to his forehead and gaze up into the sky and watch me fly up, up and away! Nobody and nothing could bring me down now, absolutely nothing. My skull is unscrewed like a bottle cap and my soul is wisping out and away with the wind from the center of my head. I feel completely dissasociated from my body and I touch things to see if they are real. All of my emotions, feelings, memories, hopes, and dreams are being poured out of my skull, and I feel as if everyone else can sense them as well. I feel very united, I feel perfect. I jump higher and higher, not even God with a telescope could possibly see me. I jump higher, and I hit my head on the ceiling of space and flutter back down, laughing. I feel a full body orgasm and every cell in my body is screaming with the most amazing pleasure it's ever felt. It's good to be human and I love life and everything in it. Well, everything but sadness, but that doesn't exist now. No, not now it doesn't.
