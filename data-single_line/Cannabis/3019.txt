If I am watching TV and it shows someone dying or something, and they have the sound of a heartbeat slowing down in the background, I get completely terrified.  I was so traumatized by this 'Trip', that I can't even see/hear anything like that without turning into a scared cowering fool.  It's like when a vietnam vet hears a helicopter or something!
