16.45 I was laying on my bed watching tv and all of a sudden I felt a euphoric feeling in the pit of my stomach normally I would welcome this feeling if I were smoking THC rich bud but I felt slightly alarmed at the fact this stuff was actually legal in the uk and it was CBD so I shouldnt be feeling this what so eve.r I shot of the bed to look in the mirror to see if my eyes were red or pupils dilated but they werent. With my hands on the wall I felt my hands and feet tingle with a mild burning sensation and my palms dripping with sweat my heart started racing and I got a strange pins and needle effect through out my body with a burning sensation across my face. I started pacing around the room as I was afraid and not sure what was happening. My thoughts turned to nothing I felt detached from the world around me and my whole body was shaking uncontrollably. I felt detached from the world around me and my whole body was shaking uncontrollably. I thought something was seriously wrong which is when the panic set in. It went as quick as I came on so feeling relitivly normaI decided to take a shower. As I was shower the wave of euphoria kicked in again this time with a vengence. My left arm suddenly felt tingly and felt as is it was vibrating then started to go numb I tried clenching my left fist and bending my arm and there was a weakness there. My heart started racing  and I started to get very light headed and dizzy panic set in again as I thought I was having a heart attack. I shot out the shower soaking wet and started pacing around the room worried and afraid of what I had done to myself and that I was going to die.
