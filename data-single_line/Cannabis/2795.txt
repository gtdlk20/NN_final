First thing I did was lay on my back and look at the stars.  I was immediately hit with the most intense feeling of déjà vu Ive ever had.  Even now, I am certain that the patterns of the stars and the words my friends were speaking were something I had dreamt about several months prior.  I tried to leave my body unsuccessfully.  My friends were worried that I was having a panic attack because I was shaking as I attempted to astral project, but I assured them I was okay.
