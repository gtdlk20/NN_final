Marijuana is a substance of fleeting effect. It has been used for centuries by millions for numerous reasons, and has been a topic of developed discussion on many levels; including medical, philosophical, and spiritual levels. Still, after its massively widespread use, marijuanaÂ’s specific effects and use remain a mystery even to its most serious supporters. It is well established that after taking a dose of marijuana, one feels enthused with his/her existence, relaxed, and euphoric at times, but the specifics of these effects have been hard to focus in upon. It is through my effort here that I wish to provide scientific documentation on the psychological effects a dose of cannabis has upon my body, and the varying sensations that my body is stricken with throughout the progress of my session.
