The other day, though, I bought some shit from a buddy of mine.  It was a fat eighth, so naturally, I assumed the volume was to make up for the fact it was shitty regs.  Fuck it, I rolled a couple joints, went out, smoked a joint, got a surprising high, but straightened myself out with some music and TV, and fell out early.
