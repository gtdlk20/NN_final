I looked around. I asked how long it had been since we smoked. One minute, maybe. It happened again. It was like I felt that I had just left the scene. I wasnÂ’t tripping, nothing really looked different. Everything felt the same. I was expecting to see a pink elephant walk around or feel my hands melt, like the people from schools tell you.
