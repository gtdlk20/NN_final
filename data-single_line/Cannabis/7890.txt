This expierence began when my friend was recently in the closest major city (about 90 miles away) and purchased a bag of very high grade hydroponically grown marijuana.  You could really tell the difference, just by looking at it, than our locally grown weed.  It was bright, almost neon green, with what looked like white crystals all over it (I assure you there was not any other substance mixed in).  At 7:00 PM, my friend and I smoked a bowl out of a pipe, then we also smoked another bowl right after that, in a bong with ice water in it.  The ice water makes the smoke almost flavorless and is highly recommened, especially if you do not smoke often or are worried about lung disease and the such.  After smoking we grabbed some snacks and walked to his guest house and sat down.  After about 2 minutes of silence, my friend asked 'Are you high?'  I could barely respond 'Yes' because it hit me so hard.  After smoking weed for two plus years I had never felt so 'high.'  I was somewhat worried about things that had happened earlier that day with another friend of mine, and these feelings completely vanished.  I was in a completely euphoric state of mind.
