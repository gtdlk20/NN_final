I made my way into the store, cycling in a loop of fear, paranoia, and absolute happiness.  Unfortunatley these cycled so quickly that I thought that they were all happening at the same time, so I felt almost like the past and future was the present, and the present was the past and the future.  My mind was completely distorted. 'Wow' is all I could think.  I grab a soda at a fridge, and open it.  I began taking laps around the store, while drinking the unpaid soda.  'Hmmm. Now what was it that he wanted, gatorade, right.'  I walk towards the gatorade, or at least I though it was gatorade.  When I got close, I realized it was powerade.  My mind twisted in horror.  I couldn't believe the way my eyes had played tricks on me.  'Okay, calm down, why are you so scared, you've been through this before, you've never gotten scared like this' I thought to myself.  At that moment, fear and paranoia went away. All that was left was happiness, and no control of my body whatsoever.
