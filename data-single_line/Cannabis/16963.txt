After an hour the effects started to occur, now I've eaten this brownie a nice 10 times by now and I say this with experience, I trip can get really bad if I dont have control over my mind. The music seems louder and intense, vision gets blurry, I hear everything loudly, all my senses are super alert, perfume seems to sting my nose, the cold wind just really hits me hard. Often there are times when I get super paranoid and anxious. I always felt as if my dad is going to find my stash or something bad is going to happen, that shit just makes everything awful but with time I have gained the ability to control my mind, I just gotta tell myself over and over again that everything will be fine. I watched perks of being a wallflower in that state and it was fucking wonderful. I do get hungry, so I make sure to keep snacks.
