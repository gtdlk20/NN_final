Skip forward to the end of that month where I try to get some weed from an Ecstasy dealer my brother used to go to. I got ripped off obviously, but I later found out that he had actually been chased out of the building by someone he had hit over the head with a wrench earlier that day, and also that some of my brother's friends had beaten him up for ripping me off, and so to repay me at lunch on a monday when I was walking back to school, he handed me a baggie with 0.5 grams of bad hash oil in it. This promptly caused the most awkward school day of my life, because I was in grade 8 and trying to figure out where to hide very potent smelling drugs. I put it in my pocket for the rest of the day, and although every single teacher knew exactly what I was doing and what was in my pocket (the smell of bad marijuana filled the room) but I was so far in every teacher's good books by default for reasons unknown (teachers always have and always will adore me for absolutely no reason) that they never said anything and let me go home at the end of the day without so much as a disapproving glance. My brother promptly taught me how to smoke oil, how to make  a pipe from a water bottle and how to make a bong from a water bottle.
