I saw the oval shape of my eye in black.  All of a sudden I could not control ANY thoughts I had or any movement. My mind went into a universe of color and sound I didn't know existed. I tried to look at my arm, but instead of my arm I saw these colors of yellows, greens and reds in little strands take the place of my arm. After that it switched over to me seeing the word 'SOMETHING' and the letters slowly leaving the word and turning into different shapes and bright colors.  It felt as if I was speeding through a new and alternate universe.  I tried to open my eyes, but my visions wouldn't allow me.  I felt as if I had a new destiny and this was what the rest of my life was going to feel like. I WANTED to die.
