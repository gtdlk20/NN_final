When I was 19, I tried Cannabis again, after having endured a massive overdose two years earlier [see First High: Massive Overdose at 17]. Again, I was living in Europe, where Cannabis consumers mainly smoke hash. For some reason, all my friends were heavy Cannabis users. I preferred my Cannabis-using technical college friends to the stodgy university students.
