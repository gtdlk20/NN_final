Then ANOTHER wave hit me.  A feeling of spiraling down into sheer terror.  I felt my heart slow down again... this time after pumping weakly for about 2 seconds it returned to normal again, and so did everything else.  This happened one or two more times. This seemed SO REAL I still have a hard time believing it was probably a hallucination/dreamlike thing. I don't remember falling asleep or passing out, I just woke up about an hour later.
