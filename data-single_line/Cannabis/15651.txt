At the end of the dance I met up with my penguin headed friend and headed to the car.  I couldn't stop thinking about the plane, about how it just kept going.  So I got home about 12:00 and went directly to bed.  It took me 20 minutes to do it but i crawled into bed, turned on some Phish, and looked forward to my next experience.
