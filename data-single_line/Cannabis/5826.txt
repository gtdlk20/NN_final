After the visions and the horniness wore off, I felt extremely hungry. I had the munchies worse than I've ever had them. Right before we got high I had eaten dinner, then when I got the munchies I ate a bag full of rosemary crackers, two fat licorice sticks, a power bar, and a dish of ice cream and I was still starving. I felt okay by the time I had eaten, but I still felt strangely like I couldn't move or talk/function very well, so I mostly just sat quietly and didn't do anything.
