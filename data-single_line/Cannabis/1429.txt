9:27pm: Im terrified by my new revelation about not being able to prove reality really exists. I decide to head home. I believe Im walking the right way and then suddenly realize that Ive walked two blocks in the wrong direction. At this point I felt exhausted so I called a friend from my cell phone and asked her to come and pick me up. I babbled something to her about smoking weed and walking home the wrong way. I asked her to pick me up outside of a store I was near.
