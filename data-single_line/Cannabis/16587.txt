It took us an hour and a half to get to my place from his, that time felt like hours upon hours upon eons. He tried to keep me talking throughout it, he did mention a few times that I was ruining his buzz, which made me feel worse while all this was happening. His talking to me just made it worse as at the time I believe any distraction would cause me to 'lose my mind'. By the time we got to my place about two hours after smoking it, I didn't feel at all high anymore, compared to what I had been though, coming out of a panic attack would feel different in any state I'd imagine.
