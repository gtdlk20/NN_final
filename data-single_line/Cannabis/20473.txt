This really didn't wear off until later that night when I was getting ready to go to sleep.  I must say it was great, but I wouldn't choose weed as a 'choice drug'. I like to know how reality works, I want to be able to dig deep into everything when I'm on a drug.  That's why I now choose to do Amphetamines as opposed to forgetting things and acting dumb.  But that's another story.  Everything is Eventual.
