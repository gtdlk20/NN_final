My friend loaded the bong and, as he did so, gave me a briefing on how to use this particular one. All I could think about was how nice this would all feel, how relaxing it could be. The first hit was nothing, effects didn't settle in like the marijuana I had smoked before and I began to wonder if my friend was even giving me anything at all. The second hit produced some vague feelings of dizziness and so I decided to sit down propped up against a wall, safe from any plunge to the earth below. These were normal sensations for a faint high and I thought nothing of it all. The third hit felt like the second. The fourth was stronger than the others and brought on an odd and different sensation of the muscles I did not know before. I may have taken a fifth or possibly even a sixth hit, but it's hard to truly confirm at this point seeing as my memory began to diminish quickly with specifics.
