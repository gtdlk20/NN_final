I was having premonitions, jumping time, I don't really know how to describe it other than I saw something happen (pillow hitting a can of soda and spilling it onto the floor) before it happened. This wasn't the first vision, I had seen flashes of a man in a white tee-shirt in the woods on Friday night (before this party), that scared the bejesus outta me. Next thing I know, it's morning, and I'm still out of it. But feeling the need, the need for weed. Yes. So one of my friends (who had brought his stash for us to use) packed a bowl and we went back outside to smoke some more. That hit me fast, but not as badly as the night before, and it was a lot more fun. I definitely said a lot more this time. Even later that day I invited some more friends over and we smoked up some more.
