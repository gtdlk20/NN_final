That's when I got the negative idea that I might be way too high. I didn't really understand how it happened, because I'd taken a couple hits off these things several other days in past couple weeks, and got virtually nothing. Yet this time three hits sent me to the moon? I wondered if something was wrong. I took out my phone and did some searches on what it's like to get high. Most everything says MJ can't actually hurt you, but somehow I stumbled upon serotonin syndrome, and spent a little time wondering if it's possible something had triggered in my brain. I wasn't immediately fearful or anxious, just planning. I really didn't like the idea of going to sleep alone if I was going to have a problem, but I didn't want to go wake up my wife, tell her I was super high, and ask her to make sure I lived through the night. I didn't want to go wake up my wife, tell her I was super high, and ask her to make sure I lived through the night. I figured if things got really bad, I could call an uber to take me to the ER without waking my wife.
