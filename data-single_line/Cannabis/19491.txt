Eventually I decided to return to my friends who were sitting at the counter together but both were very intently staring at the counter-top. So I got a granola bar, which was somewhat hard to chew but every time I opened my jaw the stickiness sent waves of euphoria through my body. It felt so good. Then I sat down again and decided I would travel down the rabbit hole. I closed my eyes and could easily visualize a rabbit hole. I pushed down through the hole by chewing, and those waves pushed the dirt aside. The rest of the day pretty much went on like this.
