What I'm about to describe, happened to me earlier this year while smoking very potent Marijuana. Up until that time, I had used Cannabis a handful of times, including eating hash-brownie, which by the way was the first time I ever tried Cannabis. The brownie experience is a story in itself because it was very powerful way to enter a non-ordinary state of consciousness. But the experience I had this time, was beyond my wildest imagination and the brownie-session is like comparing an apple with the earth.
