I walked upstairs into a dark room and turned on a lava lamp. The second my eyes hit the lamp I felt this huge surge of energy shoot through my body. It was very unexpected but felt great none the less. My overwhelmed body collapsed to the floor. My legs and arms began to move every-which way as I lay on my back gigling. I had no control...NONE. Then, as sudenly as they began, my muscle spasms stoped. I was curious as to how much time had past since I walked into the room. I stared at my indeglo watch. Instead of the usual #'s, I saw strange lines moving up and down the face of my watch. For some strange reason this didn't surprise me at all.
