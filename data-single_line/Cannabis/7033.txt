Rob and I handed the bubbler back and forth four or five times, and I was already starting to have the celophane veil of clarity drop over my vision.  I call it my view from inside the aquarium of consciousness...Rob packed another, smaller pinch of the Sinsemilla, and we polished it off in two or three hits apiece, bubbling away with the same deep dragging hits.  In all, I imagine I had smoked about 2-2.5 gms of really nice bud.
