The box of brownie mix (Duncan Hines) called for 2/3 cup of vegetable oil; this is where the weed entered the recipe.  I heated the oil in a plain cooking pot to an easy boil and put the weed in.  Let it stay in for about 10 minutes, during which I periodically pressed it with a spatula just to ensure that the full spectrum of cannabinoids was dissolving well.  This step here made the house REEK of weed.  After this I poured the oil with weed through a strainer back into the measuring glass, letting it sit for a while to make sure every precious drop got through.  Now I had 2/3 cup of oil with a quarter ounce worth of good weed dissolved inside.
