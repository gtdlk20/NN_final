Deciding that this news story was not the best thing to watch, we set out in hopes of finding something far more entertaining. Not until I stumbled upon FOX that we saw what would become the most fucked up episode of Fresh Prince ever. We were in the middle of the episode, having missed the first half, but provided we were deeply invovled in the dialouge, we slightly caught on the what was happening. Apparently Will and Carlton mad a bet where Carlton goes into the hood for a while and tries to survive. To cut a very long, drawn out, insane episode short, Will goes to get Carlton out of the hood fearing for his safety. When he (Will) arrives there, Carlton is dressed up in all sorts of 'fly' gear, with a bandana over his shaved head, and some gold on. He then spouts out some of the usual gang/hip hop terminology, containing, but not limited to 'homey' 'Sup?' 'fronting' and many others I fail to forget now. This had set us both into a primitive state of shock, confusion, and humor all at once. Not sure to laugh or say 'What the fuck?' we simply did both.
