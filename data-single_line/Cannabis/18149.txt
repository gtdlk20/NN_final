When someone walked their dogs past me, I was able to focus enough to keep my visuals down to a blur and some excess colors, and put my head in my lap.  Soon after asserting control over these visions, I began to feel as if I was in purgatory, still on my log bench, but as if focusing one way or the other I could enter different worlds, one progressingly further into images of the pine needles, becoming so complex as to be completely colored clowns' faces, the other the 'real' world, just me, cold, in the woods.
