We headed for the swingset, about the time we got there I felt like the high was wearing off, but the swinging brought it all back. At first I felt constricted like I was being forced to stay close to the ground, but once I broke out of that I closed my eyes and was swinging as high as I could, the feeling was immense, my eyes had a frame around them, the kind of thing you see after you look at something bright, not much of a visual, I think I just noticed it a bit more than usual.
