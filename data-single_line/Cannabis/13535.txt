Why would I be wasting my hash when I could supposedly be 'almost' legally buying it on any street corner within twenty-four hours? Again, there were my 'crazy' college days and it 'seemed' like a good idea at the time. We planned to swallow the hash balls (I think it was A LOT of hash-- maybe the size of the ball used in pinball machines) in the bathroom at the airport right before entering security area where carry on bags are checked. What a weird plan! This was going to be my third trip to Europe from Atlanta and I wanted to make the most of it, I guess.
