I felt like I would never stop coughing but I finally did after about 10 minutes.  I sat on the porch steps and tried to keep it together.  I knew if I did too much I would have started coughing again uncontrollably so I just sat there.  I saw my friend M riding his bike back from cleaning one of the brothers houses.  I could barely talk I just yelled out 'EY!' and he came over.  He knew we were stoned but he had no idea the condition I was in.
