I made it back to my room and tried to sleep.  My bed was like a magic carpet because it felt as if I was flying.  I had to put my feet on the floor to make sure I wasn't going anywhere.  The lights were off and I closed my eyes again.  I really felt like the bed was flying.  I could feel it push up on me as if the air underneath was raising it like in an airplane.  At one point it felt as if the bed was turning sideways but I didn't fall off.  It was in this state that I fell asleep and it was probably only around midnight so I got a solid 9 hours of sleep only to get up and get a 64% on my Communications exam the next morning.
