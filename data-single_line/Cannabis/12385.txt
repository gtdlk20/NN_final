Now, to more specific comments. During the actual high, I have found that while my singing ability may be slightly diminished, due, I suspect, to the damage done to my throat by the harsh smoke. My sense of pitch is augmented, and comments have been made by professional singers (who were unaware of my state) to the effect that my tuning is improved. Second, certain concepts critical to good singing, including relaxed jaw, open throat, and breathing into the diaphragm, seem easier to apply when stoned. The vocal range also seems to expand, so I who normally have a little more than two octaves in my comfort range can easily hit notes when stoned that present difficulty when not. I also find that vibrato in the voice is increased, probably due to the relaxing effect of marijuana on the body.
