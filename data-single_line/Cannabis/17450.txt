After this, I can say that I had open-eye hallucinations induced from only weed (there was no way it was laced, as my friends smoked it and had normal experiences). Overall, when compared to my two experiences with Mushrooms, this cannabis experience was more intense in hallucination, bodily sensation, and most ways. The divine clarity of mushrooms was not at all present, however. Although it is hard to compare substances, this weed experience (although not enjoyable) made me higher than I was on shrooms and is one I look back at in amazement.
