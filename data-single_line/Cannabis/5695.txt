I usually favor trance-based music when I'm high, because it always seems to make the time pass that much more enjoyably.  I put on one specific song to listen to the entire way to class, and turned the volume up.  About 10 feet into my walk, I started having these crazy hallucinations.  It was almost like there was this sphere surrounding me, and it moved with me as I walked.  Images based on the music were projected onto the surface of this sphere, and I could barely see reality past it.  The images weren't even very fluid now that I think about it, but they were at the time.  I was amazed at this, as it was the first time I had ever seen any kind of visuals while high, especially during the day.  The part that really amazes me, is that somehow, even though I know I was walking slower than normal to pay more attention to the halluciantions, and the fact that my schedule that day was slightly different and I was going to a different class than normal, I made it to class with 4 or 5 minutes to spare.
