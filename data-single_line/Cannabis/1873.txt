It seemed to me that people in the cubicles around me had started shouting, the  lighting was bright as hell and straight lines started warping a little. Along with it I started having some really weird muscular sensations (a little like muscle spasms). I sank back into my chair to clear my head, but found it quite hard to maintain a straight posture. My first thought was that the hash was contaminated with some other stuff as I never expected such a reaction from it. I also felt a mild trepidation which I get while first coming up on a psychedelic. However I figured it was just due to the large amount of hash I had eaten (3g - a little less than an eighth). I decided to go with this unexpected trip and make the most of it. I went to the restroom to be alone and sure enough my face bore the unmistakeable sign of someone who has left reality behind. My face seemed demonic (a usual for me when tripping), my eyes were red slits and I had a crazy grin on my face. And then I started laughing... uncontrollably!
