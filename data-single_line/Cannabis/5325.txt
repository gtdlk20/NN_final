I sat back down in my chair and watched as the other two took their hits. I dont remember a whole lot, except that I was pretty happy just sitting there, doing nothing. But I didnt get long to enjoy this, as my two companions decided to head down to the convenience store and buy some snacks (of course). So my roomie ran off to use the restroom, and I stood up to get ready to follow them once he got back. It was then that I noticed the first unusual effects. One thing I noticed, everything in the room was flashing. The closest thing I can come up with is like our light was strobing extremely rapidly. The very next thing I noticed, as I stood up out of my chair, I moved my hand past the armrest, and I thought I saw my hand pass straight through the solid wooden armrest! I couldnt believe my eyes! I found that if I passed my hand back and forth next to the armrest, it looked like I was passing my hand through it, and I amused myself in this fashion for a moment until C asked what I was doing. I explained the situation to him, and he seemed mildly amused.
