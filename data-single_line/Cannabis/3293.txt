I began to worry about my eyelashes again, though a tiny voice was saying, youre stupid, you dont need to check again. I could barely sit up without feeling nauseous, but I eventually found the mirror. I laid back again and held the mirror above me. I couldnt decide whether I was pretty or not. I began assessing my appearance, inspecting my face and body for flaws.
