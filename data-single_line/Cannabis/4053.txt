T+0:18: Lunch was just about over and my friends were finishing eating and talking about things, I could hear everything that was happening as if I had heard it a million times before. I asked friend C what was happening, and if he could see what I was seeing and he just laughed. Then one my friends who didn't smoke with us smiled at me and said 'It's okay man, you're just really high.' I looked at her weird and then remembered that I had smoked, and I kept thinking 'I didn't even smoke that much', or 'This isn't supposed to happen'. My vision was trailed, every time I would focus on a new object or turn my head, the whole frame would shift, like watching a movie in slow motion but it skips certain frames. My body felt like it was vibrating, and my normal state of mind was completely destroyed at that point. I turned to a state of acceptance where it seemed like information about life and death and beyond was being pushed down a funnel into my mind. I remember thinking that it wouldn't matter if I walked out into traffic and got hit by a car, because what I was being shown was that we have no choices, that our lives have already been played out from beginning to end.
