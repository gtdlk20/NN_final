During my freshman year at a notoriously liberal Big 12 campus I began smoking regularly with a guy who lived near me and we would roll a blunt or two and drive through the country to smoke. Usually we just drove but on one of these drives we found a park where there was a overlook point that allowed one to see the entire campus and surrounding area etc. We began frequenting this park and smoking since it was out of the way and generally pretty empty. Somehow the topic of hotboxing came up and he told me he had never done it and we resolved to fix that.
