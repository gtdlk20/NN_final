I usually smoke weed alone. I'm lucky enough to have a lovely setting, sitting comfortably in front of the window, with a nice view (trees, stars, etc.). I consider myself a rather experienced user - normally I smoke pot to relax and lift my mood. Therefore I wasn't completely ready for what happened last night.
