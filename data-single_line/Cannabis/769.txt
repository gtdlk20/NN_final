11:30. I suddenly get the idea that I'm actually an old man in a sanitarium, and I've been hallucinating the twenty years of perception I know as 'my life' in a senility-induced coma which I'm just now waking from. J's house is about to dissolve into some sterile futuristic hospital interior, and I will have to face the sad and horrible truth that I'm an old man with seventy or eighty years of experience that I DON'T REMEMBER. I don't exactly believe this, but I don't quite disbelieve it either (much like my views on the existence of God). It seems a plausibly absurd tragedy. When I get into these unreality states, my superstitions are amplified.
