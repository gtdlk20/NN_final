Then we took a taxi home. And I remember the street we drove down was almost infinitely long. Also pretty strange. My friend got dropped off at his house, and then there was a 5-10 minute drive to my place. Then I started getting a little worried that the driver was going to cheat me, or drive me to some remote location and drop me off. But he didnt an I somehow got home!
