I soon enough was walking around the house, semi-socializing. I felt so good. I was coming down from my intense smoking session. I entered the bedroom once again and found there was a little weed to spare. So me and my best friend smoked another bowl and a half. I was pleasently high again. It was now 4:30am. Everyone was starting to depart to go home. I was spending the night at his place, so I went in the next room, and decided to go to sleep. I fell asleep as If I was a small child, not a care in the world.
