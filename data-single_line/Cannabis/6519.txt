Slowly I began to stare off into space as they talked, and I began to catch snippets of the conversation they were having. Suddenly I realized that I had just said Jessica's name, but had no clue what I was talking about. I felt like I was dreaming, and started laughing uncontrollably. 'Jessica, its like I'm dreaming!' All the boys looked at me and started laughing. 'Dude, you're stoned.' Mark told me. 'After one hit??' I couldn't believe that I had gotten stoned after only one hit, but I could not pay attention long enough to keep wondering about it. I noticed that my tongue felt odd and I kept opening and closing my mouth. I decided finally that I had cottonmouth, and announced loudly one word, 'Cottonmouth!' then went back into my thinking. After what seemed like forever, we started smoking the joint. After it being passed to me twice, I opted to not smoke anymore seeing that I was already too stoned to function.
