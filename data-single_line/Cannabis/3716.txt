The only way to answer this question was to try cannabis once again. This, however, I was unwilling to do until I became a marijuana legalization supporter a few months ago.  Someone challenged me with respect to how comfortably I shun substances based on their legality status. This made me uncomfortable because my own father's life had been destroyed by LEGALLY prescribed pharmaceuticals. Once I began thinking about the issue further, it became apparent that I have very few reasons to not support marijuana legalization---with the exception of my own very horrid experience.
