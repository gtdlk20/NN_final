Once returning inside I found Tracks sleeping on the couch (sleep is something she did often), and the others back in BMF's car with the heater on and Things Fall Apart by NIN pounding the speakers. I joined in, trying not to disturb them too much, spill my water, or drop the cigarette from behing my ear, but the latter wasn't working for me. I pulled out a lighter in hopes of finding it again, but wasn't able. Not until I got out did I find it and place it behind my ear again. I went back inside, then to the trampoline to jump. Somewhere around this time I went back to the computers to search for something to do, although I was inevitably unable to find it. I then went and laid on the floor as I always do when the others came back in. We conversed wondering if anyone was feeling anything, but nothing came about it. We tried everything in our desperate measures to kick in the roll but couldn't find anything sufficient enough.
