I began casually talking to the group, not really paying attention to the person rolling the blunt.  (I am not blaming the person who rolled the blunt, nor am I blaming any of the other people in the group for giving me funny stuff, but I think it would have been better if I was familiar with the dealer this particular herb came from). After a few minutes of waiting one of the guys held up the blunt and grinned, indicating that it was time to smoke up and have fun.  I sighed deeply, feeling the same nervous feeling I always felt whenever I smoked weed.  It was a feeling that pestered me and first but would always go away within minutes of smoking.  I am a small girl, weighing 105 pounds and standing at a whopping height of five feet and two inches, so I figured about five hits would do me good.
