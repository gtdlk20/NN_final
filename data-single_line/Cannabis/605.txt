Soon I was walking on those rugs again, staring at the patterns. But time was going backwards now. I was getting younger and younger. I felt like a 6 year old, wandering around. I kept getting younger and younger, and soon I was a 3 year old. I looked at my friendÂ’s green plaid shirt, which I was still wearing, and thought back to when it had been put on me. I had completely forgotten that he had put it on me. Instead I was seeing my parents putting it on me, and then I was at some day care. I thought I was at the day care I used to go to when I was little. But I kept getting younger and younger as time rewound faster. Soon I was a baby again. It was amazing; I was getting closer and closer to the creation of my existence. I would soon know what happened before I was born. I kept getting younger and younger until I reached the point before I was born. And WOW.
