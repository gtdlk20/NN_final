Background of the Story: This was less than a week after I got a somewhat bad concussion, though the symptoms of it were strange and it was hard to pinpoint the status of my head. My tolerance to weed has always been very low, but because of my recent concussion, this experience was something unrivalled in intensity, and the effects it induced are not at all representative of what one thinks of when they think of a Marijuana experience.
