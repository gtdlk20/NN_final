I call my friend who is inside and he comes out. I say they wont let me in and they explain I am too intoxicated. I dont know what my friend is thinking at this point. Finally the show ends and my friends get a cab and we all get in. We go to their hotel, I think I even kissed my friends friend in the elevator, a woman I hardly know. I lay on their hotel bed and I wanted to make out with the two women, but they get me up and take me home in a cab. I get home and I am like, Oh my god what just happened!?
