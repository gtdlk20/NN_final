Luckily, I didn't get into any sort of trouble for this incident. But, it did teach me that Cannabis can make one extremely tired, to the point of not being able to keep oneself awake unless one's eyes are open. Although random slumber is not necessarily a bad thing, I definitely think I should not have been driving that night, as I very well could have fallen asleep at the wheel. Be forewarned.
