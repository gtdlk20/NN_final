I went into the living room to get out of the smoking scene for awhile and explore my surroundings. When I entered the living room, there was a girl named Nicole sitting on the couch watching TV. I sat in the loveseat nearby, and tried to engage in any form conversation that I could with her, but by this point I couldn't talk. I couldn't move. I was dead. I wasn't tired, but I was slipping in and out of conciousness, all the while trying to comprehend what was going on, on the tv.
