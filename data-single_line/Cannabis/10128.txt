We sat down for dinner at this point  I was very grateful that I had prepared our meal before smoking, because I didnt feel capable enough to do much of anything. Lots of eating  as you might expect, I was quite hungry  and much laughter and silliness, as can be expected with weed. After this, we cleaned up my kitchen and went up to bed.
