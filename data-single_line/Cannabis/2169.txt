I have smoked marijuana many times since, although the effects are becoming far less trippy. I plan on trying Psilocibine mushrooms sometime in the near future (maybe in a few weeks).  I am open to the *use* of most psychoactives; however, I do not advocate the *abuse* of any substance, only the responsible use.  The abuse of drugs, I believe, leads to the condemnation of the drugs themselves, rather than what should be the condemnation of a specific inappropriate person-substance relationship.  I am well aware that I have plenty to explore, and that I have merely opened the door to psychedelic journey, not quite embarked yet.  I am only a sophomore in high school; no doubt I have a large amount of wisdom and humility to gain.  If all goes as planned, I will continue to chronicle my journeys with substances and submit them.  Perhaps I will create a blog.  And with this, I must be off; so end these first scribblings of this infant phsychonaut.
