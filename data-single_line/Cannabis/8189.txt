i made it to church on time and awake if not aware.  i cut down on all human interaction, but there is some minimum.  i basically avoided talking as much as possible and tried to stay out of the way.  Putting on the robe for the mass gave me some trouble, but i got it together ok. The singer and i went upstairs to the main part of the church, and he asked me what i had done the night before.  i mumbled something (presumably) semi-coherent about staying out late playing a session, and he says 'You sure you didn't take acid or something?'
