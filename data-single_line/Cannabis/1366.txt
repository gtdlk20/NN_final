I often feared that I was forgetting to breathe. I would feel a heavy sensation on my face, and realize I had not breathed for some time, so I would take a big breath. Vivid and detailed 3D visuals accompanied my breathing. At one point I envisaged the inside of my lungs as being a large hollow area like the inside of a ship, with my lungs, ribs, etc made out of wood and run by intricate clockwork. I could perceive this whole cavern expanding and contracting in three dimensions.
