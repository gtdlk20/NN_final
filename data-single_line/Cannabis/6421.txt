Then I thought, maybe it's not that I'm just their entertainment, maybe they fade because I have a million walls up and won't let anyone really get to know me. That was a revelation and it hit me super hard because I knew it was closer to the truth. I know that I hide in myself and don't really let people see who I really am all the way. No one would have any reason to hate me, one of the few things I'm proud of is that I treat everyone with respect and pretty much let them be who they are. Except myself I guess.
