Then I started shivering as if it was extremely cold. I had felt this side-effect before, so did not care much and it left quickly. At this point, instead of the movie, we started chatting, talking about how stoned we were. Suddenly I felt so strange. I could not really explain, but it was as if the effects of cannabis were strengthened tenfold. My friend asked if I was well. That was it, I just took off. I had no perception of space (including gravity) or time. I started calling out for help as I was drawn into a vortex of some kind, as everything was spinning around me with incredible force. I panicked and I felt like I was going to pass out. My heartbeat was strong and fast and I was breathing very hard. I could hardly feel my limbs, as they were all going numb and I got really scared at this point. My understanding of reality was also very different than usual; I cannot really define it. However, something was very wrong. I tried to focus. There was no way I could. I laid on the couch, which looked huge, and I was feeling like an insect on it. That was another effect - my size in space was no longer a constant, it was relative to my feelings. My friend offered to make me a coffee as I laid on the bed, I could hear his every move and every little sound. The sugar falling in the cup and the sound of the teaspoon was so annoying. I started feeling better. For just a few seconds. But there it came again, taking me into this vortex of paranoia and insanity.
