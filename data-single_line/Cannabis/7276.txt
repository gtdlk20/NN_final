In front of my face, the universe was vast and clear, each star shining and twinkling was extreme brilliance.  I saw at least 4 shooting stars.  I was aware of the immense size of the universe and I felt as though I was seeing it in 3 dimensions, rather than the typical flat view.  Every planet and star seemed a part of me, and filled me with joy.  I became aware of the sound of night, cicadas, crickets, frogs, glowing firebugs. It was all a part of me.  It was as though the universe was smiling at me and revealing itself to me for the first time.  I cried tears of joy.
