More than an hour of sleep close state. Can't perceive any sense of time. Sometimes waking up to the fact that my breathing had turned to be manual.  This occassion is covered with some kind of dream like vision of people entering the door. Numb hands, heavy heart rate, motorical funcions on.  I can hold the bottle but only with visual feedback. After drinking some water less physical hardness.
