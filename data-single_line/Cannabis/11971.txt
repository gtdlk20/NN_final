I would consider myself an avid smoker. I had been getting high since I was 14 and had never stopped for more than a period of a few months. At the time of the instance in question, I was 19 and I had been smoking quite frequently - almost a gram/day - and had also been drinking as well as experimenting with other substances. I had never really endured a seriously bad trip with any drugs, be it alcohol, hash, speed, etc. and I had definitely never imagined that weed of all things would be the drug to push me over the edge.
