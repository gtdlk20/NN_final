9:25pm: As my friends and I are walking, I zone off into thought which seems to be part of the thought loop cycle I mentioned earlier. I suddenly wonder where social signals come from. Where do thoughts come from? Where do the things that make thoughts come from? What is the base of reality? What was the first prototype of a thought, or an atom, a loaf of bread, or a human being? Why are things in reality the way they are? I determine that I cannot prove my own existence because if one takes reality as a whole, everything it consists of, people, time, places, feelings, objects, etc, and puts it on a silver plate, there is nothing to compare reality and everything it consists of to. For example, we do not know of another reality to compare time to, so if I held up a watch that claims that it is 9:25pm, and beckoned the other reality to confirm that the time on my watch was accurate, and it was indeed 9:25pm, I would get no response. Im worried because I believe that Ive entered another dimension of thought,  and once you cross the line into this dimension there is no denying what youve discovered.
