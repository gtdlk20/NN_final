To help set the stage, I need to tell you that on January 23rd, 2002, approximately one year earlier, I suffered a cardiac arrest. Fortunately I was in the ER at the time. I was there due to heart attack symptoms. I was on a gurney in the cardiac care center talking with an EMT and my wife while waiting for blood work results. All of a sudden, I felt very light headed, became disoriented and died. I was shock paddle zapped, chest pounded and CPRÂ’d back to life. Within three hours I was recuperating in the ICU with a stent in a heart artery.
