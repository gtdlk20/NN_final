It's too confusing to put the rest of the information into intelligible words, but what I 'understood' has changed the way I think about everything. There is no positive or negative, because neither can exist without each other. Everything we perceive, exists within created limits, and the only true life exists outside of all the bondage that we accept as everyday life. There are people and beings that want you to stay enslaved in this physical and spiritual prison they've created. And more than anything I want to know why, I believe if we understand that, then everything else will be revealed. Instead of breaking through the one way mirrors, we can just go to the end and see straight through them all.
