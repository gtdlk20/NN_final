this happened just last night, so it's pretty clear in my head. it was my friend's 16th (i'm 15) and she was holding a big party. me and my girlfriend (we'll call her b.) rolled up expecting a pretty cool party, but it was kinda boring, and we got there a bit late so everyone was kinda wasted already. b. doesn't do any drugs of any kind, and there weren't any spare for my use. we just chilled the whole night, went for a walk, it wasn't really much of a party for us. at about 11pm a whole bunch of people showed up who were way older than us and basically fucked the whole place, trashed the tables, etc., so that sucked. they left around midnight, and so did b. and a few other people. i went and chilled out with some other friends for a bit, but we got bored and went for a walk to get some fresh air.
