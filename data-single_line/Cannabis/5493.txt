The next day I had a hangover of sorts, though I never had experienced one from weed. That day was when we did the canoeing down the river for about 16 miles. After that, we packed up our stuff and left. I was the one driving and it was a three-hour trip. I just felt completely out of it the whole day, but I also was very contemplative and I seemed more in touch with reality and calmer with everything happening around me. I was sort of at peace.
