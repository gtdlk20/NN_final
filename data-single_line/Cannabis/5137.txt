They each came out to me to see how I was doing but I had no interest in speaking. I just told them to leave me alone, don't talk to me, don't touch me, etc. Recieving and processing physical stimulus seemed impossible to do. I couldn't answer questions. I could only say a few phrases. I was huddled outside for maybe 30 minutes before they insisted that I stand up and they help me to my car. I asked to be left alone. I could not even open my eyes. At one point I tried to, and looked at the grass and vomit between my feet. It *hurt* to look at things. It caused physical pain to my eyeballs, and my brain, to have my eyes open to look at things. So I kept them closed.
