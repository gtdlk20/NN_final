We were going to sit on the top row since we were in a small theater, so while walking up the seemingly endless stairs I realize that I won't be able to see if the stairs end and I will probably hit the seats at the top and fall. So I am trying to keep my balance as I take each step. Eventually I reach the top and like I had figured I hit the seats and stumbled, but I did not fall due to me holding the rail. I slide down a couple seats giving my friends room and I just relaxed.
