In this fantastic other world, it seems (and perhaps is) pointless and laughable to try and focus ones attention on the inferior, one-sided everyday shit.  It doesnt feel real enough.  Its like being placed on another planet filled with aliens and wonder, and being expected to focus ones attention on an episode of Star Trek playing on a small portable T.V. screen.  Right now I am fully engrossed in that dull screen we call reality.  But come the weekend, I may buy myself a ticket into the magical, terrifying world that Ive come to love, fear, and revere.
