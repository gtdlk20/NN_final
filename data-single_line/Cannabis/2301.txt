I realized I had lost all conscious control of my limbs, and my eyes had no peripheral vision. I only knew what was happening if I concentrated on it, and this applied to my limbs as well. Natural, repetitive motions such as walking, or in my case showering were possible, but only because theyd been ingrained into my subconscious. Every time I tried to do something slightly abnormal, for example, stand on one foot, Id find it extremely hard.
