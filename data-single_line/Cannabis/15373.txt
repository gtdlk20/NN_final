The setting was a park, alone. I lit up and got high, walking away towards the city, still feeling fine (the last 6 months I always got psychotic on hash, feeling really bad), then all those thoughts came flying, I started working on them in a sort-of-metaprogramming way, but I was so fucked up, slipping into a psychotic reality, a bit disoriented, with nasty, threatening auditory hallucinations (I don't know if they really were hallucinations, but I think so. Wherever I went people were shouting at me, like, 'There he is again!', they were completely real for me at the time. This is what´s characteristic for a psychotic state, not being able to differentiate between a hallucination as 'not really there, I´m the only one seeing it' and a hallucination that you think of as reality). Well, long story short, I managed to get home, having to take three, four different transits to get there instead of taking the bus which takes me direct to my house (doh!). When I got home I managed to unlock the door after staring at the lock for 15 minutes trying to figure out what to do with it (minor LSD flashback, it would have been fun if it was fun, you know what I mean).
