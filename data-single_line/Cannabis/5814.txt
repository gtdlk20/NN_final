I flipped onto my side, nestled my head into the pillow, and gazed up at the black-and-white Beatles poster that hung on the wall. I watched all of the Beatles faces and they all seemed alive. Paul McCartney's eyes looked so huge and awake, it was like he was about to say something to me. And at that moment I realized that the photograph didn't just capture an image, it captured a piece of their souls. It caught their essence and preserved it forever, which is why they looked so alive. Just as I was really starting to enjoy looking at the poster, Aqualung called me from the living room and told me to come out and watch a movie with everyone. I really didn't want to leave the safety of the bedroom, but I went out and lay down on the couch and started to feel really weird again.
