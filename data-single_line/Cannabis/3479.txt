I suddenly woke up and it was morning.  I was still lying on my fouton, staring at the ceiling, but feeling no effects of the herb anymore.  I have no idea what this experience means, if anything, or if my nug was laced.  But all I can say is that I have never again experienced such visions on marijuana, and never plan to again.  I dont know if it was the pot or the mindset, but whatever it was, that experience wildly changed my feelings on life as I know it.
