I have no idea how long I actually sat in the room.  I barely spoke unless spoken too, and that was usually only in non-committal grunts or brief nods of my head.  When some time had passed, everybody in the room was smoked up and a decision was made that we should all go hiking.  I wasn't sure I was ready for it, but I thought what the hell.
