The experience left without any hangover or any other unpleasant symptom. However, I had trouble sleeping. I dont know if it was due to the effects themselves, or due to my excitement about the whole experience. After some time though I slept. Although I remember dreaming, I didnt recall any dream in detail, which I read is a side effect of cannabis use. I am noticing it because I have trained myself to recall dreams quite well, as I am writing dream journals. I tried training to lucid-dream, but it proved quite unsuccessful and I quit. Also worth noting is that although I ate a lot that night, I didnt feel any stomach discomfort.
