What happened is that I bought a quarter, when this stupid kid called looking for a quarter and a dime, so I sold him that quarter which was skimpy at that for thirty-five dollars. I know it is a bastard move but it is some limp-bizkit kid that walks around calling people fags. I got the thirty five bucks and then called up the dude I got the quarter from, said it was a little skimpy, and asked him to sell me a half for 35. Well, he didn't give a fuck as we are friends, and then I took the half to a party at my friend J's house.
