Not long ago, my brother-in law scored a dime or two of good reefer from a guy at work.  I had come to visit, and he mentioned that he's like to try it (being less experianced than myself). Lacking rolling papers, the only smoking apparatus I had was an old 'zeppelin' on the floor of my car. after sharing a few hits each, we were feeling pretty good, starting to get a little buzzed, and the strangest thing happened...time slowed down!  I'm not talking about normal slow stoned, this was serious.  From what my sister reports (she was sober, watching us), a normal 5 minutes seemed like 4-6 hours to us.  Our thought processes seemed extremely fast, but breaks in the conversation were unusually long. Overall, we were probably high for the better part of 5 hours, but I can't begin to describe how long it felt.  I've never experianced this effect from Cannabis.
