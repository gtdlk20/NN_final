There is definitely something about a speeding up of motion, that seems to bypass the problem of getting caught up in my thoughts, and the ambivalence and anxiety that ensues. It is a kind of peace, a playfulness. I also had a sort of image-sensation of kaleidoscopic, enhanced movement, where an amazing, beautiful pattern played in front of me as I went out for a walk, with a new buoyancy to my step.
