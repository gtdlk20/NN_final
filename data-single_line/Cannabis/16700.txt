Throughout this weird trip, I was never scared, or aprehensive, or panicky at all.  I was just amazed at the weirdness of it all.  I had displaced my self-realizing or self-perception a few feet behind me.  Thank god her 100# great dane was still locked up, because I don't think I could have handled the great puppy beast in such a stupified state.
