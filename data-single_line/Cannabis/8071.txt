When I woke up, I felt the floaty effects still with me. When I began typing, I realized my body was numb  pretty much as numb as it had been throughout the peak of the trip. This feeling (or lack thereof) persisted throughout the day, along with a mild sedation. I went to an accursed social function that evening and spoke with the only person I knew there (wondering if I seemed slightly drunk). When this conversation was done, I resumed my status as an awkward, anti-social self-imposed exile and spent the next hour sitting on a chair in the corner of the room, forcefully deadpan, writhing in mental agony and recording my thoughts in a notebook in a pen scratching frenzy. I felt simultaneously sedated and energetic  apathetic and tormented. I saw J. there  she gave me some tic tacs. I ate a few, then started writing about the TIC TAC REGIME  a damn fine surrealist rant if I do say so myself. This triggered a glorious bout of cool ego-mania that I enjoyed and attempted to ride on the strength of. There came a point however when I refused to hang around anymore. I went home.
