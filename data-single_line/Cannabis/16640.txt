The chocolate was made using what I think is Moroccan hash (dark brown and soft). I decarboxylated the hash in a double boiling kettle for two hours.  By the way, if you do this, make sure all the windows are open. The hash smell is pretty strong.  I then divided 1 g of the decarboxylated hash into small pieces and put it in a saucepan with plenty of butter on a low heat. After about 15 minutes the hash was fully dissolved leaving no residue. I then added dark chocolate and stirred to an even mixture. The total weight of the resulting hash chocolate was 60g (probably about half butter and half chocolate plus the 1g of hash). I froze the hash chocolate and then broke it into about twenty pieces.
