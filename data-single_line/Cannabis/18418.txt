All I got was, 'Do you want steak or hamburger?' My reply to him was the news of the LAN with Razgard. He then told me to be careful if we got fireworks. I said we wouldn't get them...and then the doorbell rang. I opened it to find Razgard's smiling face ready to kick off and play some games. We loaded up and left for his house. We got there, set it all up, got a game ready to go, and then decided it was time to smoke some fat bowls. We grabbed the supplies and headed out to the backyard. Mind you it is no somewhere around 4:45 and 5:00 and I had not showered or eaten since the day previous.
