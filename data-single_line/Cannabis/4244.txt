	This is my first experience breaking through on DMT.  At the time of the experience, I was an 18 year old white male.  I am still a white male, to avoid any confusion, just no longer 18.  At the time I had a high school diploma and very little college experience, lived with my parents, had a minimum wage job at a fast food restaurant, no girlfriend (although this never bothered me), enjoyed art, psychology, philosophy, physiology and anatomy, neuroscience, metaprogramming, and psychedelic drugs.  This was not my first experience with DMT, but the first time I was able to 'break through'.  I have had past drug experiences with cannabis, DMT, LSD, psilocybin, DXM, nitrous oxide, nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, cocaine, a few opiates, MDMA, LSA (morning glories), 'Spice' Product, 'Bath Salts', Sertraline (SSRI), and I am sure I am forgetting a few other chemicals.
