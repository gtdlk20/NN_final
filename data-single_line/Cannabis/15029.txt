I can't remember when I put the pipe down, or how long it had been. I instantly forgot every aspect of myself and my past, although I was well aware of my surroundings and somewhat aware of my boyfriend, who sat next to me. For a moment it felt like I was living in the present, and neither the past nor future existed. He seemed deeply focused on me. It looked as if he was asking me if I was okay. I couldn't seem to understand exactly. I told him it had hit me and I needed to lay down. The kitchen cupboards to my left seemed to become somewhat alive and the feeling of them moving consumed me. Next, the couch began to sway and compress and expand, and I felt like I was sinking into it. My whole body (especially lower) felt so amazing, almost even painful. It was so tingly and shaky, it felt a lot like an out of body experience, although I was well aware of the presence of my physical body, but only because of the sensation of energy that surrounded it.
