First thing in the morning I woke up early to watch tv, because I had a big smoke last night and I was feeling dazed. So, after mum and dad left I grabbed my gear, which was:  pipe, weed, lighter, discman, seeds, and I brought some osmocote as well for the plants. I turned on my discman and walked down to the park.
