I have always wondered what being 'high' was like. Ironically, ever since I completed the 7th grade D.A.R.E. program my view on drugs has been positive. I had sworn to myself for years that I would never drink or do drugs because they were 'wrong' and would totally screw up my life as my D.A.R.E. officer had told me in 6th grade. However, after reading the posters in my health classroom and seeing their idea of the negative effects of marijuana, I began to realize what they were telling me was a load of bullshit and I began to question. Instead of reading the D.A.R.E. material they provided me, I decided to turn to the internet. I read many unbiased articles and finally figured out the truth, Marijuana is not what they say it is. I now find it funny that the kids in my D.A.R.E class who aced the class (like me) have now ALL done drugs one time or another. The kids who are still opposed to drug usage all got Cs in the class.
