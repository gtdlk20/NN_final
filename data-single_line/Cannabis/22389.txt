By now i was about 2 hours into the high and my hyperness turned into hapiness.  Instead of typing faster, i started anylizing the text coming from my friend and could understand concepts much better.  I felt much better now, and then i noticed that the whole time i had forgot about my tounge that had been flailing around in my mouth without me knowing it.  I felt deathly sore in the mouth and my tounge hurt badly.  I grabbed hold of a mountain dew next to me and took a swig... WARM! Nasty!!! I thought... shit - i had better get a cold one.  I walked out of my room and headed to the fridge when i saw my roomate's cat sitting the floor. I looked in the fridge and found a dew, closed the fridge and saw something out of the corner of my eye.  It scared the shit out of me - I looked over quickly and saw it was the cat i had just seen.  VERY werid feeling like my extreme short term memory was going out on me.
