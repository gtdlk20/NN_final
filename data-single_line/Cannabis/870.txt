As for personal experiences, well, until now the only psychoactive that has affected me substantially is alcohol, which I rarely drink. I have never become heavily drunk for example, to the point of throwing up. I have reached the point of being dizzy, having incoordination and telling slightly inappropriate things, but not more. Also I rarely drink coffee, so when I drink it has a strong effect to me. Kola drinks also stimulate me easily, and so I cannot drink them in the evening because I will have trouble sleeping. I have never tried tobacco in any form.
