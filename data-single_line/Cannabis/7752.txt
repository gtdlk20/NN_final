I wanted to see how far I could go with these visual hallucinations so I decided to see if I was going to have any CEV's.  There was complete darkness for about ten seconds then suddenly a simple object appeared.  It looks like a very wide, upside-down spike, and had a rectangle coming out of the side and another spike sticking out of the box pointing towards me.  Everything was yellow except for the spike on the box which was brown with a black and white tip.  I could see the dimensions of the object very well and tried to manipulate it, but to no avail. All during this time I was having muscle spasms all over my body, which were about three times stronger than I usually have them.
