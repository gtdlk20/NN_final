I always test a small amount of weed after I buy it from my city connection, as the quality varies wildly and without explanation. This particular dealer has supplied me with everything from cheap, granular schwag that delivered a trashy buzz to authentic Purple Haze that literally glistened with trichomes and left Ramen and I with a stupefying high. The sample I tried gave me a unique high that rendered me a giggling mess for hours, and I couldn't wait to test it on the bong.
