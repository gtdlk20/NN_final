I went into the living room and said, This is new! But it didnt feel new; and it didnt feel real either.  Everything still felt plastic.  I couldnt feel a connection to my environment and I kept fixating on that.  I just wanted to go to sleep, in the hopes that I would wake up and it would all be gone.  In a moment of what I thought to be clarity, I realised that I felt like I was looping the last four things I did/said/saw.  Taya came downstairs after presumably hearing me wailing, and I tried to hug her.  I cant remember what I said to her, or if I just cried but I know it was embarrassingly dramatic.  Things were still looping, and I was becoming increasingly saddened by the fact that I could feel her next to me, but only physically.  It was like the instinctive senses werent working properly.  I couldnt sense her in the room, even though I was making physical contact.  I begged her to talk to me about something new, and after some deliberation she asked me what I wanted to get for our shopping the next day.  I couldnt think about it properly.  I think I said a couple of items - peppers, crisps - but it seemed like such an ordeal to think about the real world.  It seemed much more natural to analyse why I couldnt think straight. It seemed much more natural to analyse why I couldnt think straight.  To sit in my mind-cinema and think about what was happening in the real world rather than actually address it.
