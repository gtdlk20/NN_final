Long story very short, my world was spinning non-stop, I felt very very nauseous (a few dry heaves but no vomiting) and I was capable of sleeping absolutely anywhere (and oh boy, did I sleep). Smoked a few bowls, and I was just thrown over the edge. Band recorded the whole damn song without me, and I didn't even remember what it sounded like in the morning.
