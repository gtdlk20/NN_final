A few nights uneasy sleep - i.e. smoking into unconsciousness rather than 'going to sleep' in the traditional sense - had led to me laying awake at 4am trying to stop the refluent river of my imagination making a deluge of consciousness.  Before me hung a desert, each grain of sand a crystalline formation of my flowing thoughts; a fluid concept made concrete.  In places this shining tide swept low, so deep in fact that from the valley in which it ran, a strange light below would twinkle a sardonic wink where Reason had bitten too hard at its cusp.  Others of these opalescent thoughts appeared to have been so readily accepted as to have taken on their own amorphous consciousness; a mass of answers so arranged, given toe and tongue enough to call themselves alive and scamper toward wonders of their own creation.  Great Towers stood high upon gaunt and quaking dunes, teetering as they pronged the barren blue of the sky, and quivering at the brilliant gleam; those life-heralding wreaths of Cloud that, in needing not a name can only be known as Absolute Truth; self contained and lonely in their beautiful plight.  We treasure them, yet weep when shrouded is our sun.
