I would like to share my first high off of the beautiful plant marijuana.  I had a friend that had been smoking for some time and I asked him to score us some good stuff.  He got us abou 8 grams and we set into making preparations.  I picked a varried list of music I enjoyed to listen to and stocked up on water and chips.  When it was around 12 we snuck outside and packed a full bowl.  He lit it up and I began to inhale the peperry smelling smoke.  I began to caugh I was expecting it to be a little smoother. I didnt know if I was ever going to stop caughing, but after a few loud deep coughs I was under control. After we finished the first bowl, which took about 10 min, I felt disapointed cause I was having no affects what so ever. About this time my shins began to not feel the cold air anymore and things all around me seamed different somehow, how I can still not define but in my febal attempt at words it felt happy like in the good dream I dont want to wake up from.  We smoked 2 more bowls and started to sneak inside.  My head was a mess of questions, how to get inside, why did I do this, when will it be over, how can I get back to normal etc etc.
