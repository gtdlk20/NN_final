Onto the trip, it was a good Wednesday morning, my friend spent the night as we were planning on going to the movies with two of our other more experienced stoner friends. So, we figure out the time and movie that we are going to see. The movie started at 11:40 and we got there around 11:20 or 11:30 giving us time to smoke a blunt in the car. About halfway through the smoking session one of my friends points out that it is already 11:45, so we finished up the blunt rather quickly and started walking to the theater.
