After lying down on my bed, I must have fallen asleep or something because I don't remember falling into it but suddenly my consciousness was being taken beyond the dreaming state into another dimension. I realized so clearly why all human beings enter into dreaming and deep dream-less sleep every night. The realization was that our consciousness merges with the Source and draws vital energy from it to sustain our wakeful state of consciousness. But we don't do this consciously and this is why it is such a mystery to what happens with us during non-dreaming sleep. But as I went passed this insight and into the other dimension, I was so confused at first because I did not have any contact with my body anymore. It felt like I was flowing and becoming one with the energies behind the Universe. In this state, I was fully aware that there was no separation between anything, all is really one. The weird thing though, is that it felt more real than anything I have ever felt in my life. It was beyond life. I remember that my conscious-self realized that I must have died and that I might never return to my body again. A peculiar sense of non-completeness struck me as a sign that I hadn't finished what I came to do in my life.
