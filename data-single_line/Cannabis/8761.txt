That night, I was listening to psychedelic music with a friend and it made me eager to try again. Later in the night, there was an unexpected hostel meeting and room checking of all students because of someone's report of losing a very valuable laptop. That put me off; I thought that there would be no chance for the holy thing to happen- there was too much of a commotion in the hostel, and the usual chilled and relaxed nocturnal vibe was missing.
