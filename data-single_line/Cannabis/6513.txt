The other day, I went to an amusement park with 3 of my friends. When we returned, we decided it would be a good idea to go swimming at night at my friend Lukas's pond. Lukas is big on smoking pot. I had tried it two other times before, once over a year earlier and the other time about 2 weeks prior to that night. The first time I smoked, I took about 11 'hits' from a bowl and while packing another bowl I fell completely into a dream and started panicking, not knowing where I was. The last time I smoked though, I had not gotten high at all and I was dissapointed so I hoped this night would be better.
