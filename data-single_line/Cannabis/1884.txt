Now I have been VERY high of weed before, as well as tripped quite hard. The best way I can explain this is being inbetween the two. Another thing I want to add is that I got a lot of weird sensations in my  arms and legs and coordinated movements looked very clumsy. By around 1am I was no longer in that crazy state and felt okay enough to head home. By then I was exhausted like after a long workout. My muscles felt weak and I passed out immediately on lying down (Going to sleep earlier was quite impossible as every time I lay down and closed my eyes I got some really weird laser like visions and a sensation of accelaration).
