One bright and sunny afternoon, I found myself driving to my friend's house for a casual afternoon smoke.  When I got there, I found that all of my other friends were there also, in the process of opening up a keg of beer, although I drank very little since I generally do not enjoy being drunk nearly as much as being high.
