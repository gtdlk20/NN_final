I was just playing rummy and listening to some music with my brothers. We smoked two good bowls, 1 from each of us. I don't smoke often so I really felt it rip me up tonight. I felt like we were floating over the rummy cards as were if we were the cards being put down also! It was hard to concentrate and keep focus. I played a few wrong moves over the games due to going to space at the moment. Then I would laugh after realizing it and my brother would be unimpressed. We both would laugh at a few things over the games. I felt like I was on clouds. I do not feel like moving. I have a light feeling and getting ready to go to bed to float to some music while I drift off. phew was baked! I still am as I write this short after this experience. I am so relaxed now. Good times.
