I'm a lightweight, and I have a very low tolerance to pretty much everything (for example 2 shots of vodka is enough to get me drunk). We all knew that when ingesting marijuana, you feel it a lot later than when smoking. After about an hour, none of us felt anything, which sucked because my mom was gonna be home soon. So we all went and began listening to music at our computer.
