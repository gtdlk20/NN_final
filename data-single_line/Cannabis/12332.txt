At this time it was new years eve and for once I decided to buy a bag for myself so I called up one of my smoker friends.  For x-mas I recived around $200 and told my friend I don't plan on spending much.  Well there were some good mids going around for $25 and thats just was I was looking for.  I went over to his house and from there we went over to the house of who was hooking me up.  I entered the house and to my suprise there were 4 people in there that I all knew but one.  I previously knew that they were potheads.  The whole room was cheeched out so bad if I would have waved my hand I could have seen smoke being pushed around.  I sat down, looked at the bag and confirmed the purchase.  Then one of them said 'Have you used the zong before?!'  I just replied no with a blank face.  After I said that everyone in the room went crazy.
