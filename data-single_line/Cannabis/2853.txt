Another freak out I had was, again, from a small amount of pot i smoked with my girlfriend in my car. After that we went and sat in the park. Everything was fine and i felt good and stoned since I had been smoking nearly every other day for months and had stopped for about a week beforehand. We were sitting at a picnic table in the dark and being quiet as we usually do when stoned (we both have hyperactive brains that turn introspective while stoned, though we analyze the hell out of it all afterwards). There was a tennis court in front of us and the fence leading away from our line of sight at a very small angle so that when a car came toward it, the lights illuminated it and made patterns of light and shadow on the chain links. When I looked at the pattern I immediately saw a Koala bear (though I said panda) chewing on eucalyptus. The image was repeated exactly on each section of the fence. I laughed and told M and she looked and said that she saw the same thing and corrected me, explaining that it was a Koala, not a Panda. Then the bugs were getting to her so we went back to my car.
