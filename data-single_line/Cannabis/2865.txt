I'll end with quote from an incredible neurologist named Paul Bach-y-Rita who did experiments proving that each sensory organ could perform, to a certain extent, the function of the other sensory organs... eyes can hear, tongues can see, etc. 'You can do so much more with a sensory organ than what mother nature does with it.'
