I took the first hit and was surprised at the sweetness and smoothness of the smoke. Ramen took the next one and coughed like a maniac; wheezing, he passed it to Chips, who drew off a large plume and also started coughing and belching. Even Burger succumbed, coughing like an asthmatic after he took a thick pull. This was particularly surprising; Burger was a guy who regularly smoked joints the size of carrots and carried his pipe more often than his wallet. I took another draw and was floored by the surprisingly scorching vapors. Soon, the room was literally rattling in a cacophony of coughing that drowned out Ramen's favorite electronic music.
