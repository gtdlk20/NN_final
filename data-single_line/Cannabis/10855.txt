It was then in one fluid motion that I saw J and P get up and take towels to wipe off the water from the bong, then change clothes and spray the garage. They were so much more experienced than I was, I thought. This was amazing to me. They had such an organized and efficient method to hiding the evidence from their parents, and I was just sitting there, not contributing.  It was almost like they were robots being controlled by some kind of remote, because their movements were so in tune with what they were doing. I saw very mild trails of their arms and I realized that I probably looked like a freak for staring at their arms for so long, but I didnÂ’t care. It was beautiful.
