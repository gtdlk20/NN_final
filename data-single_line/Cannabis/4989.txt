I had been smoking pot pretty heavily for about three months up until two weeks before these events.  I had quit totally and hadn't had even a second hand buzz.  I found out that I was going to have to take a drug test in about two months so I decided that I would use up the last of my stash.  I measured it out, there were exactly 6 grams there, a little more, but I just left that in the bag.  I got online and found a recipe for peanut butter cookies and gathered all my ingredients.  I ground up the pot in a coffee grinder until it was completely powdered and added it to the batter.  I got six large cookies out of the batch.  I picked peanut butter because it has a lot of oils in it and I baked it at a very low temperature, maybe 200 degrees F.  I didn't use eggs or anything dangerous, just a really basic recipe for baked peanut butter cookies.
