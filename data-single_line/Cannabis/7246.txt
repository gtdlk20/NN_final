This friend, I'll call him B, was always more of a counter culture individual than myself.  I know now that his parents had smoked pot, and he had even found their stash, but at the time I had no idea of this.  We used to get our thrills by stealing cigarette butts from our parents ashtrays and smoking those, or even smoking straw from his backyard.  He told me about his sister in college who smoked pot.  I had no idea that she smoked pot as I had always known her as an extremely 'straight and narrow' individual.  He told me that she loved it, and that all the information passed on to me as fact by my parents and the DARE program was false.
