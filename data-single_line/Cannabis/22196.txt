Wednesday, parents are back, I'm paranoid that the house smells like weed but nobody notices it except for me so I'm playing it cool. I cleaned up the mess from the party (over 30 soda cans, and the remnants of three days of the munchies) before they returned. But the feeling is still lingering with me. I feel fizzly. You know those fireworks that make the fizzling, sssssssssss, frying pan noise? That's what I feel like. If someone touches my arm with one finger, I feel it all through my arm, sort of like pins and needles only not as painful and a lot longer lasting. I scratch my face and then put my arm back down and I'm not sure if I ever really scratched my face. It's cool but at the same time freaky.
