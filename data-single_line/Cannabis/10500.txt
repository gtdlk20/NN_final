In the basement I was having trouble.  As I lay down, not able to move, the lights flashed infront of me, with trails of light coming off of them.  My eyes started to roll uncontrollably into the back of my head, and I heard my friends freak out when I started going into mini seizures.  I couldn't move, and all I could think in my mind, was that I hoped that my friends would be smart and call a hospital.  This wasn't gonna happen though.
