I'd tried weed 3 or 4 times before this one, but when there was an effect it hadn't been much; I'd simply felt completely numb (mentally) except for the time before this one, that is.  I'd baked in a car with my friend and his older brother and suddenly my thoughts had begun to unfold, leading to other thoughts and still others, a phenomenon that's probably ordinary for most people but that I hadn't experienced in years.  The ossified channels of brain pattern had been temporarily broken, the groove my thinking had been trapped in was breached.  This was incredibly cool, so it was mostly what I thought about: I was imagining a colorful neural model of my thought processes, the processes which were, of course, mostly concerned with generating the model.  Some ulta-recursive fun, but pretty narcissistic.
