I noticed the room was cooler than usual.  I stared at the string hanging from my overhead fan that controls the light.  It was totally motionless because the fan was not on, and my room has no draft, however it seemed to be moving very far away, and then coming very close to my face.  I stared at this for a while, then started looking around my room.  Letters on boxes seemed to dance around, gyrating and pulsating on the box.  I closed my eyes because I was getting tired, and I noticed I had CEVs.
