I went down stairs to watch some TV, unlike many of those who submit reports to Erowid, i thoroughly enjoy the boob tube, it tends to be nice to me, regardless of how i treat it.  In the middle of Titus(T+45), i began to get this smile.  Not on my face, but in my gut.  I felt as if i had been lifted.  My body got up and went down the hall to a small bed room where it put on some Bob Marley and lied down on a futon, legs crossed and eyes closed.....simply enjoying the high.  Once lying down my mind could fully wander.  The first thing i saw (!!!) was a tennis player...like the ones on super tennis on super nintendo. He was green orange and yellow....all very intense shades. It was as if i was on the level of the court looking up at him from about 15 feet away.  Then a tennis ball went careening through my feild of vision, covered in the saem blues yellows and greens.
