Right before we left I looked at a large tree lit up by a park light and saw that the leaves were in the shape of a huge turtle facing downward with the head of an old man staring at me. It was a rather disturbing image and I looked away with a worried sort of laugh. Sitting in my car i felt that it was moving and then expanding and I had the same melting feeling in my limbs. There was no perspective flattening but there was some distortion of proportion. I began looking in the side mirror across from me and saw that it was a sort of screen that was playing images from my subconscious. I've read about this phenomenon occuring in schizophrenics... a sort of vision of uncontrollable thoughts being displayed faster than they can be comprehended.
