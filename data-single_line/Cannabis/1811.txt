T+1:40  I had to leave. I decided to walk to Ns house, then back to mine, expecting the trip to come down enough so I could function around parents. 10 steps out the door and I am completely lost. Trees are scary yet interesting at night. My mental map seemed to be spinning, could not tell north from south. I feel an urge to chase cars but I hang onto N and start talking about how each object, living or non-living, deserves to be noticed and respected. I am still getting High level CEVs and OEVs, the world is swaying. Time loses meaning again. At some point N tells me just walk straight on the sidewalk and points me in the right direction (next to very busy street). I say OK and shuffle along. The lights from cars flare in my eyes and I try to hold a straight course walking. It is quite hard. I will glance in a direction and my feet follow 5 steps before I know what Im doing. This makes looking at the road dangerous so I keep my vision fixed forwards. Closing my eyes is fun & I just want to stop and sit on some ones lawn and let myself go. But I dont, and continue walking. I reach my old school and decide to go and sit down in the yard. I am enjoying myself now. I am at peace. My phone starts to buzz and I open it and my mother and best mate S have texted me. I decide to go to Ss house and text my mum to be ready to leave when I get home.
