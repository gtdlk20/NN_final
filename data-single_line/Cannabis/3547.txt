I'm a mid-40s successful computer programmer with very young kids and a wife. The only legal infraction I've ever been given is a speeding ticket. The most illegal thing I've done was pirating computer software when I was a kid, in the 1980s. When I drink alcohol, I generally only have 1-2 drinks, as too much alcohol first makes me tired, then startles me awake in the night. The last time I was drunk was more than a decade ago.
