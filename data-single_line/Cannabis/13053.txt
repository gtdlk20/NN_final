About 20 minutes later I felt pretty normal, just stoned.. But I felt burnt.  I acted dumb for the rest of the night, and wasn't completely sure what had happened.  I had that headrush from sitting up, and taking a deep breath, apparently, I was so stoned for 5 minutes that I passed out! Twice! Crazy, huh? The coolest thing about it was smoking the rest of the joint later.. It was one of the best feelings I've had.. Kinda like that overload opened my mind up to feel the high more. I was able to produce slight colorful closed eye visuals... I don't know if anyone else has ever had that kind of experience.. the passing out or the visuals, but they were both crazy as hell.
