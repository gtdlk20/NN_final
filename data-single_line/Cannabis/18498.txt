I tell them I'm going to stay there, as it's 2:30 already, and they leave. I then look at TV and see the paused game showing they played a total of twenty matches...I was asleep for a long fucking time. I almost started to doze off when Raz walked in, kind of asleep. I relayed the message about them going off, and how it was now 4:30 and we both slept a bit. He had to go meet up with Grunge later to go talk to some guy, and I needed to get home anyway. By the time we finally got around to it and got everything packed up it was 5:30. We then headed back to my house where he dropped me off with all of my stuff and headed out to see Grunge.
