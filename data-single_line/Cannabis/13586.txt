Vacation time!  I was at the end of a large bag of BC Hydro, and I was getting annoyed at how dry it was becoming as in my laziness I didn't take care of the bag too well.  I had the bright idea of mashing the whole thing up into powder and making cookies so as to enjoy my vacation days with the sustained intoxication produced by orally ingesting marijuana.  I baked the cookies, using what ended up being about 1/8th ounce of finely powered bud.  I ended up with about 9 cookies, and figured they would be very potent based on the quality and quantity of plant material I had used.  Well, I ate one my first day, and it barely did squat!  I was shocked and of course disappointed.  I figured I must not have cooked them long enough to really cause the THC to be activated, and in my frustration I mashed 'em up into gravel-y bits, spread them on a cookie sheet and cooked the crap out of them.
