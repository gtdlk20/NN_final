I have never done any hard trips like acid or shrooms and I wondered if the blunt had been laced, which was unlikely since these effects took over an hour to manifest themselves. It could'nt have been from my few days abstinence because I have gone weeks without smoking before and never experienced what I did in the space of those five minutes but hey, it might have just been some good ass weed. Who knows? This was without a doubt the best creeper I had ever had. Normally my heart starts pounding and I get paranoid as hell, thinking I'm going to die and what not when I have creepers. I still believe meditating had enhanced this high.
