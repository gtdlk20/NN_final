We went in and I wondered how bloodshot my eyes were and if people would notice.  I wasn't worried, just curious.  When we got up to the floor we were staying on, I stopped at the mirror and noticed that my eyes were very very red, but doubted people would notice.  We grabbed a movie, 'Rounders' and put it in. I was sitting on the chair in front of the TV.  As I was watching, I noticed that I could only see things at one depth in front of me, like if there was a pop can 4 feet away and a bottle 5 feet, I could only see one at a time.  Once I found this out, I noticed something very strange, when I looked from one thing to another at different lengths away in a line going up I could like 'overload' my head.
