I'd gotten a gram of some good trees from a friend. Lemon Haze, he'd called them. Sure smelt like it. This is an account of the two trips, on consecutive days, that I had while smoking these. The trees themselves came in an almost compressed form, although still as green as they should be. They had the "green with hints of brown" colouring typical of the strain.
