I have been smoking marijuana for about 18 months now, so I'd say I have reasonable experience with it. But something really weird happened a few months ago. Me and some friends were hanging out, and we decided to buy some weed. We bought a gram each of this new crazy hydro stuff that was in town at the time. We sat down, and I I whizzed it up, I felt excited that this would be a new experience. How right I was. We passed the bong around, and afterward I realized I should have only had 1 cone and waited, but had 3 in succession. It kicked in hard. I felt my face go cold, I was laughing hysterically, almost passing out. But did I stop there? NO. I smoked the rest of my gram.
