By the time my dad got home I was almost sober and he didn't notice a thing.  That took a lot of worry of of me, but the paranoia aspect still haunted me until I feel asleep that night.  The next morning was a great wake up... all insecurities of the past night went away and I was vindicated of all burdens.
