We finally got back to her house around 10pm and I was still very high. I was very frightened I wasnt going to be able to handle myself in front of her parents. When we walked in the door they were both sitting in front of the T.V. she talked to them for a quick minute and I didnt say anything. Hey her mom said to me. I had forgotten to greet her parents, something I always do. We went upstairs and listened to music I would never let myself be seen listening to. Oddly I enjoyed it as I closed my eyes and concentrated on the rhythm. I felt incredibly tired and like gravity was pushing down on me extra hard. We decided to watch T.V. I think we were watching Saturday Night Live but I still dont remember. I fell asleep soon after she put it on. When I woke up around 11pm I had finally come down. I didnt feel normal but I definitely didnt feel the same way I had an hour ago.
