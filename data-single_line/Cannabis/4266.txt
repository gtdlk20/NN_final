	T+30 seconds: From this point on in the trip, I am unable to perceive time at all.  The boards bend as far as they can and all begin to snap, sending imaginary wooden shrapnel everywhere in my field of vision, but with a pattern to it.  I realize everything is spinning in circles around me and I am pulled up through the ceiling into the sky and into another dimension.  The whole time this is happening, I am being filled up with an overwhelming feeling of intensity.
