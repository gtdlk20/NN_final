After a little while, my non-smoking friend and I were dropped off back where we had been picked up. We stumbled back to the coffee shop where I asked him to get me a coffee, as I could hardly stand up straight now. We stayed there for a while, I stared off into space, everything was all crazy colors and the ground was moving. The sky ad turned pink and I was very confused. We went and got some pizza and then headed to his house which was quite a walk. On the way I started having some crazy hallucinations, so before long we had to stop at a park by a pond and sit down. The pond was amazing, the whole thing was glowing, even at night and there were all these glowing things shooting up from the surface. I looked away from the pond momentarily where my attention was fixated on three nearby puddles which seemed to form a series of numbers, 098. I thought it was a sign from god because they were all glowing a floating and moving. I tried to point them out to my friend which proved difficult, but after about five minutes he said he saw them. He could have been lying, but its okay.
