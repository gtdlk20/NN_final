Silencing of mind and tongue prevents us from falling asleep, from getting lost into this illusory word. The key is mindfulness - be mindful to the people and situations in your life.. Do not get caught/seduced by the myriad of distractions/temporary pleasures that the world offers you. They are all meant to put you back to a kind of sleep - the sleep of ignorance. Negative attributes are like lullabies that put you to sleep.
