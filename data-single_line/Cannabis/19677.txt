I was in a party, an a friend of mine was smoking a joint. I gave 2-3 puffs from it, I wasnt a frequent smoker, just once in a while if someone offered. This pot was very pure, not the dried one, so it hit pretty hard, really quick. The party was really loud and I sat in a couch as I started to feel overwhelmed by the voices of everyone. I catched isolated words, but every word I heard was reminding me of a memory of a conversation I had with different people at different ocasions long ago, where that word was used. They were all memories from high school, at gave me a frightful feel of meaning and irreality.
