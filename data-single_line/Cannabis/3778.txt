10:40 AM (T+00:00)- I can cook quite well, given that most teenagers can't figure out how to boil Ramen. I decided that my method of eating would be old school: brownies. I pulled out my jar of leaf, by which I mean the actual leaves of the plant. Totally unexperienced in the Way of Cannabis Eating, I simply reached into the jar, grabbing approximately four large pinches of the substance and dropped it into the brownie mix. I baked the brownies, eagerly awaiting the unfamiliar experience. When they were finished, I devoured the entire batch, which probably could have gotten six or seven people twisted.
