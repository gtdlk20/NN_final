I figured he meant he had bought some buds, as we were all pretty much potheads by this point. I finished work (I do construction) and was tired and achy as I pulled into N's driveway. I picked them both up (C was living at N's due to familial problems), and we started driving down toward my neighborhood. We parked the car at the end of a road that went down to the harbor. The spot was relatively secluded so we got out and packed a bowl of weed. N told me he had found the bag in the school parking lot that day.
