Since I enjoy a more 'trippy' expericence, I opted to eat mine in a bun between two slices of cheese (microwaved), as did Nos and Dingo. It'd be about the fourth time for me and Nos eating our pot as such, Dingo had only previously smoked before. We then set about amusing ourselves while waiting for the effects to kick in.
