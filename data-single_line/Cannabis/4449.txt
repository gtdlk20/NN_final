My mom entered once. She told us that the family was leaving (by now it had been an hour and a half since the smoking, but it felt like four hours to us). She said the family would not be home until 9:00ish. By then our high would be gone (since we finished smoking at around 6:00ish). I was very thankful for this random event. After they left we went into my living room. C and N traded off playing Guitar Hero (or multiplayed). I was still so frightened and out of it that I sat down in my recliner waiting for the effects to vanish. C listened to Black Sabbaths Sweet Leaf (how appropriate) and commented on how perfectly it sounded. I listened to the Doors The End but I dont believe I obtained any powerful insight or sensationI was still so out of it and frightened.
