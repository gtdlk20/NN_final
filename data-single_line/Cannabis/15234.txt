One night when I was home alone I decided to smoke. I usually smoke with friends so this was a little different. The weed wasn't laced or anything and the only other drug that I have used is alcohol (twice). As I was smoking I had this odd sensation that I could feel the THC running from my lungs and into my bloodstream and then into my brain. I was caught up in this thought of the THC flowing through my body. When it reached my brain was when I really got fucked.
