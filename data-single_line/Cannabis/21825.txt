I baught a sack of schwag one time when I was a n00bie to marijuana, and I was about to go on a road trip.  I didn't have time to smoke the bag, so I poored the weed in my mouth, chewed and swallowed it.  It was about 3 grams I ate.  In about an hour I started feeling stoned.  During the next 8 hours of the trip I passed out several times.  Music sounded great.  When we got to our destination, I wasn't making sense to many people and didn't get a lot of the things they were saying.  I was VERY stoned.  After 10 hours had gone by since I ate it, I passed out for the night.  I felt kind of slow the next day.
