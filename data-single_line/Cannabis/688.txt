My 4th trip was on the train.  If you have ever been on an electric train you will notice the whirl of the motor's starting up, and the general whirling noises that these types of trains can make.  Now I primarily listen to Psychedelic Trance (which is a type of rapid dance music with very strange trippy noises). These motor noises seemed to kind of, form music in my head... and I started to think up loads of original Psy-trance songs in my head.  It was really weird! It would be fantastic if I had a thought-recorder there and then, it was the best Psy-Trance I had ever listened to - there were just so many rapid sounds noises and melodies and it was coming from me, and i didn't even have to concentrate!  I noticed that the speed and intensity of the music seemed to alter with the speed of the train, and with the different whirling noises of the train motors.
