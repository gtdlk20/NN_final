I started to explain to him the conditions of which i was under, but instead i ended up writing him a novel.  I explained in extremely great detail that i had ingested kine bud instead of smoking it.  He replied to me.. 'Woah dude... i know your a perfectionist, but why in the hell did you just type me 3 fully fledged paragraphs about how you ATE the weed and didn't smoke it' ... I tried to understand what he was relaying back to me.  My mind was thinking hundreds of possibilities of different things that were in the front of my mind at the time.  It was almost like listening to a song and breaking it down one instrument at a time, then splicing them back together but to make something new.  My mind was racing.  I thought to myself.. If i am thinking about all of the different sides/perspectives/shapes and forms of things, then how can i benefit from this experience.
