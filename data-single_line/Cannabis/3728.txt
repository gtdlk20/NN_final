While this peak of the high was pleasant, for two days thereafter I felt incredibly lethargic and thoughtless. Usually being a mentally productive person full of ideas, I felt that my brain was an empty metal bucket. I had nothing to say. I spent those two days around a very mentally active physicist. He kept engaging me in our usual conversations but I felt that I had nothing to offer him and was merely reacting to circumstance. Each time I reached into my brain, I was scrapping the bottom of a metal bucket.  I decided that if I were to keep up smoking pot, then I might very well destroy my relationship with this person.
