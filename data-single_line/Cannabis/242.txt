Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]    In a lot of ways I felt like a kid again and felt just a tad sneaky for not telling my husband about it.  We've been married for twenty two years and we've had our ups and downs but we've been in a real good space for the last 3-4 years and I don't want to rock the boat.   I don't want to mess with the marital dynamic just yet. I'm not sure whether I'm making a permanent shift in life style or just experimenting.  My next plan is to try smoking before exercising to see if it prevents pain.  Anyway, nobody noticed anything different at home.  We have a pretty laid back household so it wasn't difficult at all.
