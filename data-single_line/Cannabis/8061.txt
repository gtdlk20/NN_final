During my time on the couch I closed my eyes and watched for the visuals. It was much like my last time (and only reference for this experience)  visual and kinetic motifs were recapitulated and expanded on, although I believe that in this instance the daylight robbed them of a certain vividness. If I concentrated with eyes open, I could just barely visualize the moving patterns blending with the features of the room (and I mean JUST BARELY, this is not what I would call hallucination  the very low end of the visual spectrum if its on the spectrum at all.) J. was busy dealing with her kids so I didnt get much conversation in. I browsed the net a lot, going to familiar sites, reading Erowid and Plastic, downloading psychedelic screensavers and games.
