So, as you may have guessed from the title dear reader, I had anxiety and depression at the time of this experience. To give you a bit of history, I had finished high school the year before and had no idea what to do, I didn't really want to do anything either. Anyway, one of my friends knew a few people who could get some weed, so naturally I asked. This wouldn't be my first experience nor would it be my last. It was an average Friday; my mother and I had gone out earlier and gotten supplies for the weekend, nothing out of the ordinary about it.
