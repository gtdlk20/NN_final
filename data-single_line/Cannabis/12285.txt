Six months later I enjoyed two hits with my roomate and his girlfriend.  The panic slammed into me again.  I felt as if my heart rate had broken 200 beats per minute.  I felt cold, dislocated, and petrified.  I was afraid to go to sleep thinking my heart or breathing would stop.  Nothing happened of course, and my roommate and his girlfriend were very supportive and kind to me.
