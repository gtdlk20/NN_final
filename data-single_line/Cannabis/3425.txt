We then decided to go and get something to drink because I had extreme cotton mouth. I was afraid I wasnt going to be able to pay for my water and practiced what I was going to say over and over again in my head. When I finally reached the man at the counter I quickly handed him a five dollar bill and said thank you. He looked at me strangely. I had the water in my other hand below the counter where he couldnt see it. Give him the water. My friend reminded me. He rang me up and looked at me strangely as I left.
