Last week I woke up and immediately ate a fairly potent cannabis brownie thinking that it wouldn't hit by the time I got to the airport. Boy was I wrong. One hour later and I'm stoned off my ass attempting to make conversation with my mom on the way to the airport. She had to have known. I had planned on taking a second edible when I got to the airport but decided against it as the first one was already working its magic.
