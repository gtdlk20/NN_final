I smoked the India Kush a few more times after that.  Each time it gave me a killer buzz that beats any other KB I've ever tried, though never again quite like that first time.  I haven't had an opportunity to try it again in many months now though, and am eagerly awaiting the next time my friends get their hands on a little of the Kush.
