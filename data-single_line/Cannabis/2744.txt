That's how I felt. I was suddenly outside of the world that I had thought of as total, and I remembered (for over winter break I had felt this, and forgotten somewhat) what it felt like to truly realize you could get outside of your experience and know what it felt like to sort of remember that you'd been seeing the world through goggles your entire life. Like a much bigger version of getting sucked into a movie so much that you feel like you _are_ the plot, and then something brings you out of it, and you remember you actually have another life you'd completely forgotten about.
