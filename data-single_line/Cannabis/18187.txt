When this experience occured I had already gone through various experiments with weed, and was used to the mind altering effects. The story begins when I was hanging out with a couple of friends, hitting the bowl. We had been passing it back and forth taking deep hits of the bud, which was extremely potent. We had been smoking for a while and I had yet to feel the high set in so I kept smoking. We finished off the herb and started to walk down the street, slowly my mind oozed into a dream like state, which was considerably pleasent.
