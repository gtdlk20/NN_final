I remember during the part where it's sung '1,2,3,4,5,6,7 all good children go to heaven' over and over again at the end of 'You never give me your money' I felt a thousand tiny spiders and bugs descend on me, as if to shoo me away, and I almost ran away from my place... suddenly though when the smooth tones of 'sun-king' came on I was reminded that I have nothing to fear from nature... nothing at all and I basked in that golden glow I felt from being there.
