Another half-hour goes by of steady, steep climbing in height and i begin to get a little nervous.  To sort of snap myself out of the anxiety/worry phase, i make light of it and suggest we get pizza, though i am starting to fear the potentially scary world at this point.  We make it out and back with pizza, i eat some and soon have to go lay down because i'm too high.
