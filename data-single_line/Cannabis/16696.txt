My now fiance, at the time my new girlfriend, had invited me to her dad's for the weekend, because he and his wife (my fiance's stepmom) were on vacation.  We woke at about 11am, and my fiance, I'll call her LA, wanted to take a shower before we started smoking.  By the time she was done in the shower, maybe 15 minutes after we agreed to this little wake and bake session, I was in her living room, stoned to bejesus.  This was the first time that I had ever experienced any psycho-active symptoms from smoking pot.  Everything was of course coated in hillarity, and when she got back from the shower, I was in wide-eyed disbelief about how high I was.  She laughed and took the bong from me, finishing up the last little bit and having her own load.
