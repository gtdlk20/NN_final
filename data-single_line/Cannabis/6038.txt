I'm extremely attracted to the girl in the room, she is beautiful I think of telling her.  I think through all the past missed love opportunities that is my life and know that this one is meant to be missed also.  I fantasize, I feel stirrings in my crotch, but this is all it will be.  Before I know it she is leaving and I haven't even said a word, I don't even know where the time went.  I've been so caught in this loop.
