We started the first bowl at about 10 pm, my friend had told me that this was 'really strong stuff'.  As soon as I took my first hit I knew this stuff was stronger than usual as I was coughing as I had never done before.  We finished the first bowl and I was feeling good, I was really high and in a friendly surrounding.  The effects of the first bowl had not even reached their peak when one of my friends started packing the 2nd bowl.  I wasn't sure if I was ready for it but decided to go for it anyways.
