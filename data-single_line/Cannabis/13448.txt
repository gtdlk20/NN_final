I've always been interested in philosophy's of time+space in the universe.  I started to really think about it..and the most unexplainable feeling came over me.  I want you all to think for a minute of what 'Infinite' actually means.  If theres any word in the english language that's extremely hard to grasp/imagine, it's that one.  Try to imagine an infinite number of universes - and the GIGANTIC size of our own that reaches out billions and billions of light years, and no matter how hard you try to imagine, the concept of 'infinite' is the biggest mindfuck I've ever come across.
