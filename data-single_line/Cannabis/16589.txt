This event made me not want to try cannabis again. That thought only last three weeks however, and I was back for more. It was a good thing, those next few times were my honeymoon period in which I had the best highs I'll probably ever have on cannabis. It was a stepping stone in my personal experience with the substance, and I've learned much from it since.
