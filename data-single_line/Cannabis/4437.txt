I was so fucking paranoid. I contemplated on staying at the park until the high faded (which would slightly worry my parents and the darkness would be unpleasant). This plan was quickly abandoned as a car drove into the park. We were fearful of it being a cop or something, so we bolted. I decided to take a gas-line (a long, narrow strip of treeless grass about 10-20 feet wide). This would provide us a path halfway to my house (to help us from getting lost). The rest of the way we would have to travel in the dark forest until we reached my house.
