At this moment I knew that this was one of the most profound experiences in my life. The highest point of my spiritual existence. It was so overwhelming that I left for the bathroom, took a pee, washed my face with cold water and looked in the mirror for about a minute. All, trying to snap out of it for a few seconds, just to see if reality is still there. But I still was in that universe, even in the bathroom, knowing that the Firstborn was there somewhere and we hold ALL responsibility for the future of the world. It was not the first time I got a psychotic episode on weed but it was the first time I could not stop it. So I relaxed, accepted this world and I didnt regret my decision.
