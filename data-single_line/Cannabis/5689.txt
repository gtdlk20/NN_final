All I could think of as I walked to meet him was getting as high as I could off this little bit, because I was eager to start smoking again.  I met my friend at about 10:30 AM in a cemetary on campus, where we usually met to smoke.  I didn't expect much, having been smoking weed of similar quality as what we smoked that day for months now.  After we smoked, it took a few minutes for the high to set in, while we walked out of the cemetary, each of us lighting a cigarette.  I felt a typical high as we parted and I walked back to get my books for the day.  I was very relaxed, kind of distant from reality.  I made it back to my room fine, and after grabbing my books I walked to one of the dining halls for a quick lunch before class.
