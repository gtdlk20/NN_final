But I was thinking cool thoughts again.  I'd developed a bad habit, normally, of thinking in a sort of shorthand, without going through all the component chains of logic; now it was like the interal structure of every thought was laid bare; I was thinking in assembly code rather than C++, and parts of my brain that had been unused for years seemed to be coming back into play.  I blurted something I'd just figured to a friend of mine 'Eyelids evolved to keep stuff out of the eye!  That's why fish don't have eyelids!' my friend, who hadn't smoked, gave me a strange look.  I'd heard before that being stoned made things seem profound, but never appreciated why: the thought processes leading to conclusions might be equivalent to what they are normally, but on a low, component level, they're different.  I suppose that's not really an explanation, but it points in the right direction, I think.
