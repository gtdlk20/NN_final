PREPARATION: Three weeks of mixing and it's ready to go. Given what I'm working with, this is closer to an infused spirit than a true tincture, so I can drink a little bit more than normal. Based on previous experience, I'm somewhat arbitrarily assuming that this contains something like 150-250mcg/ml, so 20-30ml is a standard midrange dose.
