My friend had this really nice bubbler with a huge bowl that could fit like four regular sized bowls in it. So, we packed it tightly and full to the top with the weed, and then went to the woods behind his house to smoke it. I had never smoked from a bubbler or a bong before, so the fact that the smoke was cooled by the water was a nice change. We both got quite a few hits out of it, including one monster 20 second rip I took. Smoked it until we had completely cashed all of what was in the bowl. The effects were starting to kick in, and we were both really mellow and laughing, so we stumbled up out of the woods back into his house. We climbed the stairs slowly, turned off the lights, put in a cd we had made for the occasion, and just sat and chilled at the computer.
