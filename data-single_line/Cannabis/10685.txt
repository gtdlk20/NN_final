When the song ended, I opened up my eyes, stretched, licked my dry lips, and stood up. I told my friend about what I had just experienced, and with a smile, a nod, and a 'Far out, man.' from my friend, I sat down and just listened to some more music. I think what came on next was The Expendables' 'Bowl for Two.'
