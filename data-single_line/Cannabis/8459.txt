Just a note on eating cannabis. I was in Benares, India, back in 1998. Benares the City of Death (it really is). Anyway. I drank a hearty glass of thick marijuana milk shake with a flamboyant Australian friend sometime in the evening. A little later the effects came on, and I found myself transported from a restaurant, where I should have been calmly eating my dindins to a dark nether world of panic and delusions of apocalypse. The usual effects of increased heart beat and paranoia that one experiences having taken on too much THC were the least of my troubles. The world spun, I could not focus, and I felt sick to my stomach. I could not breath, but not from my usual response to overindulgence (panic), but because my body was sucked so completely of energy that the muscles in my chest were not strong enough to lift my ribs and arms from my chest.
