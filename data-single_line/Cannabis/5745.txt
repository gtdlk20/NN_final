Sess: Organically grown marijuana. Weed that has been grown the way it was meant to be, almost always outdoors, and always with soil and sunlight. In most cases, this kinda weed is considered your normal stuff - obviously far better than shwag, but not comparable to 'dro' in potency, unless the strain which your sess happens to be is naturally very potent already (example: White Widow). In simple words, your basic, organically grown stuff - kinda like garden grown vegetables.
