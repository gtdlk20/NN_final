At 11:28 I turned on the small desk light. I was so fascinated with the bright, white light, that I jump towards it repeatedly and stared at it, so much that it dazzled me and created an afterimage, which I was afraid that would stay forever. I generally like if a place is well-lit at night, but now my reaction was 5x the normal or more. As for company, I was alone, and wished to remain so, as I felt too vulnerable for other people. If there were other friendly users I might feel good with them, but for now the human world was my enemy. I had the company of my animals though. Some of my animals were housed there. Some of them, at least those that could eat leaves, had already eaten fresh weed leaves. Both my rabbit and my bearded dragon have eaten weed leaves. I took out the snake with me. He was the male rosy boa I have, a calm, stout, approx 60 cm snake. I put it on my lap and put my fingertips on it as it was crawling away. The minute impressions of his scales created tingling feelings to the whole of my arms, as when someone caresses you lightly and you like it. It was wonderful. I also gently caressed my clothes and my hair for the same effect. It was very relaxing. The snake was warm from its cage, so when it was on me I felt a warm sensation spreading from it. Then I put it on the desk, under the light, and observed it from below. It seemed huge, and its shining head with its constantly flicking tongue by which it checks the place for smells seemed like those Komodo dragons we see in documentaries. It took a zig zag shape, and reminded me of the roads that climb on mountains, and the curves of it that shined due to the light as the back lights of the cars, and I was wondering what brand the cars where. Then it started moving away, like some type of liquid. A loop of its body started shrinking away and it was quite surreal. Then I put it back in its cage to not stress it further. I was high, but that didnÂ’t mean I stopped caring about the animals.
