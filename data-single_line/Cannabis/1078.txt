I was so excited when I felt it. 'Yes, this is it, this is it! I'm finally there! So this is what it feels like!' The things they said seemed hollow and almost meaningless and I would try so hard to rationalize everything they said. Trying to make sense of the words was like trying to learn a whole new language, or even a new method of communication. In the process, I would come up with all these conclusions to what they might have meant. It made me feel like a philosophical genius making sense of my new world! Other times, I was just simply confused, or didn't give a crap lol.
