I do a lot of walking (while stoned) in the beautiful bush/river tracks around my area. It is a very healthy and enjoyable activity alone or with good company. The Rainbow Falls track runs alongside a beautiful river and is surrounded by native and introduced bush. It is one of three areas I frequent.
