All of this went on in my mind with my eyes closed while everyone else watched a movie, completely oblivious to the fact that I was visiting other universes. I opened my eyes and realized that each surface in Kyle's living room was a different universe as well. I looked at his brown wicker stool and somehow knew that it represented a universe full of dead brown trees that were infested with millions of tiny brown gnomes. I looked at a blue couch and knew that it represented the Sorrow Universe, where everyone weeps and weeps for all eternity. I glanced at the floral carpet and happily realized that it represented a jungle universe, full of lush trees and fruit, where I once lived and ran naked with the natives in a past lifetime.
