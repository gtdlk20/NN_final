We rode four wheelers around a bit more.  I was on a four wheeler with B and C.  B was driving while C sat in front of the handlebars, and I sat on the back.  We went up a hill and C fell off the front.  B actually RAN OVER C with the entire four wheeler.  We all stopped, laughing crazily.  C got up, brushed off his pants and fell over laughing.  He told us he was ok, and we all thought we were gonna suffocate from laughter as we related the tale to each other from our specific points of view on our way back to the cabin.
