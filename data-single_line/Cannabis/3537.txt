If one coughs at all (or alot), it's because one are taking the 'hit' in the throat and bronchial tubes, where it's poorly absorbed and mostly just causes coughing reflex. On can take a smaller hit, and chase it with a deep deep inhale of clean air to take it all the way into the lungs. If one do this, one will not feel *any* urge to cough, and one will get much more absorption. One should be careful, as this makes it much easier to inhale too much.
