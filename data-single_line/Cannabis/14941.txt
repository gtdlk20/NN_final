The moon was already high and the vivid blue of a Northern Arizona sky framed it perfectly. I stopped and looked around, my eyes tracing the red soil out to the horizon. Standing there, the Earth seemed suddenly vast and wondrous. I could feel through my boots how solid and eternal was the skin of our Mother, how truly great She was. Far off, the Tsaile mountains loomed, the air was still and clear, the Moon was silver and awesome. I began to view the world as some hunter of the steppes must have viewed it in the Pleistocene, as it must have appeared to humans before electricity, before cars, guns, 'civilisation.' All the long centuries of Human existence are but a tiny blip in the life of the Earth and the Sky, which shelter us and whose songs we have forgotten in our modern dedication to money, convenience and noise.
