My friend then packed more. Now knowing I was completely getting fucked soon after about number 7, I decided to take 'smaller' hits. Why did I continue? Hell, I wanted to finish those damn two grams. It has been a month at least since I smoked last and I wanted as much as I could get. After the tenth, all I know is I felt like I had to fucking sit down. Smoking anymore just did not happen. He proceeded to finish what was left. Not only was I sitting down however, it appeared to me that I laid between two logs in an oddly uncomfortable position that at the time was like a bed. I looked up into the tree tops from down below, everything had a cartoony outline to it. Almost as if I expected to see fucking Bambi running through the forest. Apparantly I lost all my inhibitions and I was talking and stating the first things that came to my mind leaving my friend laughing his ass off on the ground. 'I've never been this high before!' 'Woo Wee!!!' 'Dude that bee just flew by me!' 'WOO WEE!' 'I'm Great!' Shit like that.
