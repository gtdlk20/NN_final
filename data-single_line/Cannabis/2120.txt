My thoughts were still scary and circular, and I was still tweaking out, but heres where I started to have some fun.  Taking a cue from his red bedroom walls and contemporary music, I realized that I was in a Target commercial.  Everything was sterile and overly bright for a minute, just like in Target stores only amplified (and in another dimension).  I imagined that the objects in his room were random products being creatively stacked up to an upbeat soundtrack like in the advertisements.  Still very frightened, I sat back down on his bed and talked to Rayanne and him.  I think Im in a dream, but then I know I cant be because my memories are more tangible than in dreams, I pondered aloud to them, my thoughts coming out in shaky, fragmented speech.  There was a pause and Rayanne filled it with Are you really smart or something when you arent fucked up?  I couldnt really think of an answer so I just mumbled.  I laughed at myself-- why do I even care what they think if Im in a dream?  Then I realized that I wasnt in a dream.  But how do I know?  When Im dreaming, I am totally convinced of my scenario until I wake up and realize how absurd it was.  So what made me so cocky and sure that this wasnt another of those circumstances?  I mulled over that for a while and closed my eyes.  Unfortunately, I had no closed eye visuals.
