I eventually came down that day but I had a lot of 'brain farts' I guess you call them.  For instance I went into a gas station, one is in my town, and another in the city over and they both look the same inside.  I looked at the soda fountain and all of a sudden I couldnt remember which one I was at or how I got there.  I asked my friend and he just thought I was saying that to make myself look still high, but I really didnt know which one we were at.  Then later on I was dining out, and scooping myself some sprinkles for ice cream and I dipped the sprinkle spoon in the hot chocolate by accident and just left it there and walked away while the people I was with were screaming my name, I knew they were too but I just didnt register  in my mind to turn around.  The rest of the night everything just seemed so cool and the world around me was such a nice place.  I had a wonderful long lasting feeling of euphoria long after it, and I still feel as everything is going to work out great.
