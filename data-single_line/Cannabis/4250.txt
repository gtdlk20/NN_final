	T-1 hour: I am over at D's house with D, B, and T.  By this point, D had already broken through for the first time days ago, but I had not because I like to act very cautiously around chemicals I do not know well, especially when, upon reading about DMT (mostly at erowid.org and DMT: The Spirit Molecule by Rick Strassman), I learned that it is quite an intense trip.  Although none of my trips were 'breakthroughs' by this point, they were still quite powerful in the form of intense euphoria, visual and aural hallucinations, kaleidoscopic CEVs and significant time distortion.
