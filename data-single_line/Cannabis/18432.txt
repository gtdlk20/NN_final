We turned on the TV as I ate what was the most delicios Pop-Tart in my life, complimented perfectly with diet coke, hinting slightly of Lemon. Now, being the stoners we were, we both knew very well of the odd coincedences that happen when we're stoned and watching TV. The most fucked up programming is available to us. Things that would never claim the television cables had you not been stoned. So, flipping through the channels we notice several of them, somewhat distant from each other were showing very similiar images, the kind that accompany 'breaking news' or 'top stories'.
