At this point that's when it finally hit me.  My vision became intensely like a strobe light, on a slow setting.  I can duplicate the same effect by opening my eyes for a brief second and then closing them and doing this over and over.  Images of everything were being captured, and i was trying to talk to my friend about me relating to what he had said to me at school, but he was so fucked up that he was too busy laughing at everyone =).  This didn't really help out my experience at all because i felt like i was alone.
