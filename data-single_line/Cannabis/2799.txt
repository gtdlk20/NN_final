I could hear a dog bark reverberating through the woods.  This time I was certain I had dreamt this encounter when I was about 6 or 7 years old.  It was exciting:  Us in the woods, and this angry dog, our adversary, was trying to keep us from getting back to the cabin.  We eventually happened upon the dog.  I immediately realized that the dog was lost, and was barking because he was scared, not angry.  I felt so bad for the dog I began to cry, and IÂ’m not the type to normally cry.
