The song was sort of fast, so everything in my 'mind-movie' was, like, sped up. Things moved very fast. I  got the feeling that I had entered a new world. I could 'see' the music, and be inside the mind of the artists. I felt like I was taking a leap of faith off a cliff, yet overwhelming peace. Overall, it was a 'it's OK' feeling, like no matter what happens, It's gonna turn out fine.
