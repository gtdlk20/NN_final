I was the highest I had ever been in my life at that point. I couldnt feel my face and my body was doing 10000 things at once. I looked down at my feet and saw them moving but I wasn't doing anything to them. It was like they walked automaticlly, even when I wasn't even though I KNEW that was impossible. I was so confused. And thirsty.
