Right until the drum solo of 'end' the music was no longer some external thing. It was my reality... I no longer felt connected with the real that we experience around us, I was simply swimming in a sea of pictures that my mind made with relation to the songs I was listening to. But the important thing is that it's not just limited to what I saw, it affected what I heard as well (as hard as it is to express) but more than how it affected my senses it affected my knowing... as if it wasn't really sensual stimulation at all... I was just being told by some cosmic force (the music) how things were.
