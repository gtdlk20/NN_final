It's surprising how such a small amount of a thing can effect such a profound change in a person. I just shelled out $30 for an eighth of ganja. I know it's a large price for such a small amount (4 oz is about $300 where I come from), but it was well worth it. It was my first hookup from this person (I will call him 'Steve'), and I had the usual hope/joy/fear feeling that comes from putting your trust in somebody you hardly know. Two days later, it happened, 'Steve' told me to meet him in class early; we would 'make the pass' there. A simple handshake and a smile was all it took. Now, normally, I don't like to do that stuff at school, because I believe that students that don't want to be exposed to 'drugs' at school have the right not to be (that and it's almost asking to get busted), but I made an exception that day. School flew by in a blur as I anticpated my enjoyment of the evening.
