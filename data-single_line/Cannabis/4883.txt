He tickled me a little  I think as a joke  but it felt so much worse. I couldnt stop laughing, even the sheets started to take on an odd sensation as I thrashed around in them.  He tried to touch me sensually but now it felt as though the wires between tickles and pleasure had been completely crossed.  I tried to communicate this to him but he took it to mean that maybe tickles could now be sexualized instead of the opposite way around where sex would now become an unbearable ticklish mess.
