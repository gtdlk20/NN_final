I come from Germany so I guess there will be a lot of mistakes in the whole context - I want to appologize for that first. Okay I have to admit that I smoked weed a lot of times before but because I am not a smoker I really didn't get that high (because I didn't inhale it that deep and that long). I wanted to give it a last try because I really thought Marijuana is just boring and I couldn't imagine why people like that small not very intensive kick so much.
