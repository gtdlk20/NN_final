9:10pm: Im starting to freak out because the feeling of swaying back and forth hasnt stopped. My friends seem completely serious when they insist that Im standing still. It seems that Im thinking way too fast.  My thoughts are out of pace with time. Theyre moving at lightning speed, and Im processing thousands of complex thoughts in just a couple of seconds. This has the effect of making everything around me, that is, everything around my thoughts, seem incredibly slow. Time is dragging, the sound of a car driving by lingers and is still audible even when the car is out of sight.
