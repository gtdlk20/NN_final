I could see bubbles around the room just like I was in a pool or a sea. Things were floating and so was E's hair. Suddenly a blue shark, just like a cartoon passed behind E. I stared at it for a few moments and tried to realise what was happening. The shark made a few curves and faded away and I blinked to see it again but as I opened my eyes, everything was gone. I was in the room again, E was sitting there and staring at me blankly.
