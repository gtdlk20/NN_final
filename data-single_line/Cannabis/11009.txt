L suggest we go for a walk, but I tell him I dont think itd be a good idea. G had to go take care of something for a brief time, but at that point I was stable minded enough that it was ok, and I enjoyed the personal time spent with L. When G returned, he brought friend A, who found my glasses finally. I put them on, look at G, and realize there are 4 different colored Gs floating around the original one. This is a little too much, and I slowly take the glasses off and enjoy my natural vision, which includes light checker patterns floating on the walls, but with warping holes occasionally appearing and flowing across the room. I discover I can create these wormholes by moving my hands over them. I look at L, and find his face to be incredibly exaggerated, to the point where he looked like a caricature of himself. G, after being assured by L and I that were quite set, leaves for the night. L and I settle in.
