The second time I smoked was on Queens Day and I was drunk. A friend had the joint and I took a toke or two. Again, I didnt feel anything. Another friend told me that my eyes were really red and tiny. She even asked: Are you sure you dont feel anything?. Yup. Are you sure you dont feel anything?. Yup.
