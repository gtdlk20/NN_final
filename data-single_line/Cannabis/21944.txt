The only thing I'm dissapointed about is I didn't get to try all the things I wanted, cos I wasn't thinking clearly. For so long I didn't even listen to music - but even then it was VERY fun and interesting. If I could add to the experience, I would have listened to the 'headfuck' directory of my collected Infected mushroom tracks. I know they would have fucked me up. I could try it next time, but I dunno if things will be as intense or the same.
