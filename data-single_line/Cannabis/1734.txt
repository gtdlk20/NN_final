Then as the Ringo Starr drum solo (as I found out later the first and only drum solo of Ringo's affiliation with the Beatles) near the start of 'End' played. It felt as if some mystical figure was actually hitting the sides of my brain to produce to the sound, and not a drum set... and I was being awoken from my trance back to reality... for there was something to be shown me in the real world. The chanting that goes with the guitar 'love you' over and over again in the first half of the song really shook me... there was something that loved me in nature.
