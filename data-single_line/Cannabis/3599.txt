It was cool, but I really was tired. As soon as I closed my eyes, it felt like the world was spinning and I felt like I was going to throw up. Kind of like when really drunk, except all the nausea was from dizziness, none of it from a belly full of poison. So I opened my eyes and immediately felt better. At this point, I was mostly annoyed, because I was feeling super tired, but couldn't very well go to sleep if I was going to throw up by closing my eyes.
