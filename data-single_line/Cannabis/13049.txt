Just the other night I had my most unusual experience with smoking bud.  A friend of mine, Matt, came to hang out with me the other night, and brought a joint of some fairly potent hydro. We went to a small building behind my house to smoke at approximately 6:30 pm.  We smoke about half the joint, and things were going good, I knew I'd be pretty stoned (ok, really stoned..) in about 5 minutes, as we've smoked this weed often and thats about the time it takes for the high to peak.  We finished smoking the joint about 45% into it, and I sat down on a box, while Matt starts to smoke a cig.  Then.. things got weird.  I was zoning out like I do when I'm high, and realized I had been holding my breath for as long as I had been sitting down (approx. 20-30 seconds) and take a deep breath, then stand up, and blood rushed to my head from standing quickly/breathing deeply simultaneously (I think..).
