T+0:00 I took about six large hits of cannabis. This is far more than I have ever smoked (my previous max being 3-4 hits). The hits were likely larger than usual as well, because I was smoking from a tobacco pipe, which has a larger hole and a larger bowl than a weed pipe (I think). An unfortunate incident occurred right after I took my last hit: my roommate/landlord, C, came out on the deck and asked what I was doing. I rent a bedroom from a family, so I share their house with two adults and a toddler. I had not asked if it was OK to smoke weed (this was my first time smoking weed at the house), and only when C saw me smoking did it even occur to me that I might have transgressed a boundary of their household. Although C did not recriminate me and did not get mad, I became inwardly panicked and felt guilty. However, I was quickly becoming so stoned that this was no longer relevant. C went back inside, and as I watched the movie I became aware that I was getting too stoned to move.
