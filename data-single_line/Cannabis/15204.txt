The moment Debra came back in, I entered into this incredible state of ecstasy.  It felt like something was descending into me, allowing me to experience the world from a perspective that was totally different, it was almost indescribable.  I felt as if something very old was either trying to come in from the outside, or was pushing out of me from the inside.  Whatever it was, I felt like I was becoming something else, something far more real than I could possibly imagine.  The feeling of knowing that this was what was happening was so wonderful that tears just poured down my cheeks.
