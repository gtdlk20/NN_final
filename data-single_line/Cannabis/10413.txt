I ate it, sat online and chatted to some friends. 40 minutes later I was washed over with this intense awesome high. It was a standard, relaxing, super grinning experience. Everything was going to plan. My sense of gravity was heightened, so was my sense of touch. Pretty soon the relaxation begun to wave, eventually the waving became really intense.. and turned into an alternating Sober/dream.
