We arrived at Tak's house around nine I believe. Tak came to the door and led us inside her simple home. We were in a complex of housing that Gir had lived in his whole life and Tak and Dib had recently moved into. Tak's house was small but cozy, it had worn out carpets and old broken in couches around a huge TV. The pots and pans were piled up next to each other around the sink. It was a big difference from my comfortable life style but I had seen worse so I embraced it. We sat around for a while and watched the tube until my cousin finally asked me if I wanted to smoke. I eagerly accepted and we went up to Tak's room. Tak's room was empty but for a frame-less bed, an immaculate old mirror and a cork board. The cork board had a piece of paper that Tak pointed to.
