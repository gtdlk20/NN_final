However, without a doubt the strangest part of this whole experience was the way in which I perceived reality and the passage of time. For at least two and a half hours (in real-time...For me it seemed like days), I had a feeling of unreality. At first I thought I was dreaming, but I realized that that didn't quite cover what I was feeling. So I thought some more, and the best explanation that I can come up with is that I felt like I was an image on a movie screen...That I was a physical piece of a movie that someone else was watching. I had a pervasive, at times frightening feeling that nothing I did had any consequences because none of it was real.
