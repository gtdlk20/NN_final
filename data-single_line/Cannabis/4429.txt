Okay, so were sitting there in our three white chairs right in the middle of the forest. I dont believe there is one spot in this forest where you CANT see some sort of house or building (which is reassuring in case of emergency). We each have our own lighter. It takes about 45 minutes to smoke it all. The first thirty minutes of smoking we were laughing hysterically and uncontrollably at random moments. After we were done (45min later) we started walking in the opposite direction from my house for no reason. We decide to call up our friend J to see if we could crash at his house, but he doesnt answer (I later found out he knew we were going to be high so he decided not to answer). I hung up. We continued in the opposite direction from my house. We were heading towards a little park where we could sit down. By now the forest is getting somewhat dark.
