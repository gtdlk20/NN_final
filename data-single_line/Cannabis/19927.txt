Potent BHO infused rock sugar candy.  I had a lot at the 420 rally. Its hits fast with in 20 minuets I felt it.  I wander off walking to a teahouse.  My memories from that point on happen in 20 second increments.  Like every 20 seconds I get to look through my own eyes. Dragged away from my memory I was in that moment. I could recall sobriety but it was fleeting.  Once at the bridge my movements became a bit stiff.  My ankles did not move as they should.  Gravity, it seemed had its thumb on my head and solders but this only slowed me down. No paranoid thoughts and just a bit nervous.
