I paid attention to nothing anyone said. My life had turned into a documentary, like 'This is Your Life' and I had no control over what I was doing. I could hear my voice narrating the events as they happened and i had completely lost touch of reality. Due to the fact that there was a young lady at the park I had the previous intention of hooking up with, it was of upmost importance to keep in touch with reality and not look like a moron. I was shit out of luck, as i stumbled into the car and the music turned on my life became the music. My heartbeat was moving to the beat of the music and my mind was enthralled in the deep bass of the song 'SIOSOS' by the Spooks.
