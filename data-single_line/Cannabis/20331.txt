Next I came out of the blanket turned off my Kid-A cd and return to reality with me myself and my LAVA LAMP omfg the swirls of liquady green encrypt my mind with confusion so instinct pulls the plug out. Last for some reason I turned back on the flashing box from hell and have this very real clear image of my brain in front of me and this cold liquad metal being pushed through the top of it like forced through a small playdough cutter and filling up my black and white brain all while this is happening a very real feeling of what im seeing then(Blank). Morning.
