4:00 - 6:30 AM- I spend this time in a half dream/half awake state.  I continue making up random stories in my head that seem to be comming from an outside source.  I think about how marijuana really is a powerful psychedelic and is sometimes easy to take for granted when you smoke it every day.  The body fry is still extremely intense and my body feels very warm all over, almost like I have a fever.  It is not an unpleasant feeling, however.
