After that we moved on to the stoner park and threw a disc around, I was pretty bad, dispite my normal athletic ability, we climbed some trees, and for the most part had come back to baseline, but the effects were still slightly noticeable. All in all I had a very good first real high with marijuana, and on 4/20 no less.
