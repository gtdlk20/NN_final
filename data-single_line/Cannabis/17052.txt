A few months later my friend, who Ill call mike, started smoking, I saw him and couldnt understand what was going though his mind as he walked around the driveway excited and giggling about nothing. I decided I wanted to see what it was like. I tried it for my 3rd time at my girlfriends house. She was having a couple of our friends sleeping over and we took out a bong. I hit that thing hard, and tried to clear it but forgot to take out the bowl. I exhaled and took out the bowl and cleared it. I held it for a few seconds and exhaled due to a coughing fit. The coughing wouldnt go away so I went to the bathroom and spit to relieve some of the burning. 15 minutes passed and I was starting to feel better, I stood up from my hunched position over the sink and all of a sudden the marijuana hit me like a ton of bricks. I froze, I started feeling the sensation of falling through the ground, it was fun, I liked it, I was on a rollercoaster in my body. My girlfriend who was sitting next to me this whole time asked me if I was alright, all I could do was smile and stutter trying to explain what I was feeling. I skipped back in the room where all my friends were with the biggest smile on my face. The rest of the night was a blur of falling through the bed when I was laying on it, falling though the floor whenever I stopped walking, and eating peanut butter and fruit loops and jack in the box. That night was one of the best nights of my high school life.
