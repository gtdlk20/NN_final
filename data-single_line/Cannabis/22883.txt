Upon arrival in Canada from Scotland, I was soon invited to try some lovely B.C weed going by the name of White Widow. The stuff was covered in sticky, white THC chrystals and was like nothing I had ever seen before. Having only smoked low-stength resin back home, I was well up for it as were my buddies. The smell was very pungent but very nice.
