I called up my friend who I had expected to zone out with and found out he couldn't make it that night.  Instead of waiting until he could join me I decided to just go right ahead and eat all six cookies.  I really like being stoned outside, and it was a wonderful October evening, light breeze, cool air, not exactly day but not really evening yet either.  I headed out on my usual walk, about 45 minutes long.  I figured I'd probably start to feel it by the time I was done with my walk.  I was very wrong.  About fifteen minutes into my trek I started to feel very stoned.  It was not the slow onset I expected from ingesting pot, but a very violent rush--as if I had walked through an invisible portal into stoner land.
