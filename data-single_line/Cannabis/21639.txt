Skip forward a week when my weed supply runs out. My brother decided to get me a 1.5 piece as well as hook me up with an amazing dealer, and another less amazing dealer that just so happens to be the drug kingpin of my town. I was planning on requesting instructions on how to roll a joint, but when I tried I succeeded.  Everyone in my family jokes that I inherited the ability to roll a joint from my mother, but I will never be able to roll the perfect joint like my mother can. (They have less imperfections than fucking factory made cigarettes!) From this point on things get royally fucked up!
