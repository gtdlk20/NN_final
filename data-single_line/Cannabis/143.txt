I now notice that my sense of hearing has changed too. This becomes more noticable when I step outside. Sounds far away are considered by my brain as of same importance as sounds from events close to me. A door slamming far away gives me a shock! The sound of a dog barking makes me look behind me although the dog is at least hundred meters away.
