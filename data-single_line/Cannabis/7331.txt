When I got home M had to study and so did I so we split.  I had the hardest time locking up the bike on the bike rack.  I was shaking and scared because I was in front of like 5 Resident Advisors (RA's/Hall authorities).  I somehow managed to lock it up in about 5 minutes and walked inside.  I imagine my eyes were red as fuck.  When I got upstairs my roomy wasn't there so I sat down on my computer and changed my away message to 'studying' but as I did that I started slow-motion laughing where there was like a 2 second pause between each 'ha'.
