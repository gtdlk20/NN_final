The images changed and I started seeing other things. I can't really describe everything I saw but the best way to explain it is to say it was like walking down a hallway, with psychedelic flashing colors covering the floor and ceiling of the hall. The hall had a bunch of open doors, and each door was a porthole to a different universe. Some universes were full of light and color, and some were dark and scary. Each one was different, and I felt I could view each one as I liked. As I looked at all these universes, I realized that I belonged in all of them and none of them simultaneously. I didn't belong in any one, but a part of me was in each one. It was the coolest feeling when I realized that I could be a part of every universe at once.
