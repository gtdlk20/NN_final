I ended up getting two abx carts, two kurvana carts, a 510 battery, and 2 pax era cartridges. They were out of the pax era devices, so I went to another dispensary and got a Pax Era, 2 more pax carts, and a 0.5g shatter. If that sounds like alot, it's just because I'm not at all financially constrained, and wanted a bunch of different stuff to try without having to make another hour trip to a dispensary. It was under California's 8g of concentrates per day, which honestly seems like an insanely high limit considering how little it eventually took to get me super baked.
