T-1:00 Remember I was intentionally getting slightly messed up this night to put the brakes on some destructive thought patterns. Prior to dosing on the Cannabis I consumed a Red Bull (approx 76 mg of caffeine), smoked a heavy San Cristobal Maduro cigar containing probably 200 mg of nicotine (I absorbed a large portion of this because I was retrohaling), and drank a large snifter of brandy (about 90 mL of alcohol).
