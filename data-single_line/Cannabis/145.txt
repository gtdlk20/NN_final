I go inside and immediately notice that breathing has become more strained. It is not that it hurts, but breathing has become a task I feel I have to do manually instead of an automatic reflex. I keep thinking that I am forgetting to breathe, and then take a couple of deep breaths. The pushing feeling in the chest is more noticable now. I feel like sitting down, relaxing. Another feeling that has changed is the soreness in my muscles from exercising yesterday, especially in the back and neck. Instead of being sore the feeling is more like the feeling I have right before I 'pop' my knuckles or my neck. That pushy feeling that is usually relieved by cracking or popping bones. But I feel very clearly that I shouldn't do that. That it would result in a cramp if I did that. So I try not to pop my knuckles or my neck.
