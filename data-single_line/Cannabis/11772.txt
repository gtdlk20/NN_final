The next morning I woke up and I was normal again thank God. All day however I would just gaze off. This whole experience makes me realize that it is not 'just weed'. Looking back though, I loved it. Even though I was scared shitless at first, I want to do it again right now! I have smoked prior to that but not to get fucked out of my mind. I took enough and stopped when I knew I would be 'high'. I have gained a lot of respect for the psychoactive I have smoked many times but never really given a shit about. I previously felt that there are better things out there that will 'mess you up' more. Not anymore. Marijuana has easily been shifted up to one of my favorites now as it did not use to be before. I think it just takes getting a little too much one time to realize the beauty of something fully, and that is what happened. I feel as though I have never truly been high before, as if there is a new damn meaning to 'weed'.
