I was pretty unenthusiastic about smoking marijuana, for reasons previously described.  But I decided to give it a try for kicks.  Me and my buds (pun) walked outside to a 'safe place' (i.e., no prying neighbors or parents) with our patented 'apple pipe' (we were all new to it, so it's all we had).  I inhaled around 5 hits of medium, over-priced marijuana.  Felt good, but definitely not euphoric.  We decided it was safe to walk back to the house and do the rest in the back yard.  On the way back, one of my friends (I'll call him 'Jake'), for a split second, appeared to be dressed up as a clown.  I decided it was hilarious enough to share it with him, so I sputtered 'Hey... Jake... You need to be a... CLOWN.'  My friends (not as stoned as I) were obviously laughing AT me, instead of with me.  Another note, my face and throat were numb... I'm not sure if this is a normal reaction or not, just thought I'd share.
