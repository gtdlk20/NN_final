After I was done, I got up and went back to my tent. My girlfriend walked out of the tent to go toward the bathroom building, so I followed her. We stopped outside the building and sat on a grassy hill and began talking. The only effects I began to feel at this point were dizziness and relaxation, but things grew heavier. During our conversation, my mind lost everything that was going on in a split-second and I had to go back and retrace the events to get myself back into real-time. That was a very tough thing to do. She started to get confused at things I was saying because they were just a bunch of jumbled words, but they made perfect sense to me. I then started with the hallucinations.
