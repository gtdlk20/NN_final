Cannabis is legal where I live, and I was spending the weekend at an outdoor camping music festival with some friends.  In attendance was a person who gifted me a sample of home made cannabis tincture which I happily consumed.  I believe there may have been a mis-communication about how much I was supposed to consume, or the tincture was much stronger than was realized because it turns out, I took way too much.  And I later found out that this particular batch of tincture had been made 2 years ago, and apparently gets stronger the longer it sits.
