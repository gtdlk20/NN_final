S pulled a stool behind me and told me to sit down.  My vision came back about 30 seconds after it left.  I put one hand on the foot of the bed and the other was resting on my lap.  I was staring at the carpet and the patterns were shifting, expanding, and changing colors.  I looked up and the room looked a lot darker but much more colorful.  I was completely panicked!
