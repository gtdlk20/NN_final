Three hours. The high is starting to mellow into a sleepy feeling, like downing a few glasses of wine. My coordination is shot, and I stumble around, when I do get up and move. My girlfriend laughs at me, and accuses me of being a lightweight. At this point I would describe the feeling as being lost in my own skin, as if I am watching everything and everyone from a safe place where nobody can get to me.
