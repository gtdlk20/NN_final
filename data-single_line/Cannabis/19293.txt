I began to walk up the stairs and then all of a sudden I mind-blanked into the kitchen. I felt like the trip up the stairs never happened. As I was in the kitchen all I could think of was how I got up here. Then as I saw the sink I remembered that I was looking for my glass that I had previously so that I could get some water. After I had found my glass I began to fill it up with water, which is when I had another mind-blank.
