Everything became blurred, geometric patterns had taken over my vision and the swirling patterns became too much for me. I muttered something to d about not being able to see anything and then I fell. D was able to prevent me from hitting my head and he carried me into the living room so I could lay down. He says that I fainted, but I could still feel everything that was happening around me. I could not speak, couldn't hear and couldn't see, but I still knew what was going on. After about ten minutes I was able to move again, and he helped me get to his bed. I lay there for nearly an hour, I guess I was in shock that that had happened to me. I felt miserable inside. I had never had anything even close to that happen to me before. I was embarrassed that D had to witness it, I never wanted to smoke again. Of course, the next day I felt differently.
