I looked up in the sky and saw four airplanes, two heading one way and two the other. I suddenly panicked, and said to my friend 'This is it man, it's World War Three' - The airplanes looked exactly like missiles - nukes on their way to their respective targets. It was really creepy, because it honestly felt like this was it, nuclear war.
