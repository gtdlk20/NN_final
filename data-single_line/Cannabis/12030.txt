The music then changed to the next track which didn't feel so great so I opened my eyes and had one of those moments I often have on mushrooms or sometimes acid where the ceiling seems layered and doesn't make any sense, I then turned off my music and drifted off to sleep. The whole experience seemed to last anywhere between 5 and 15 mins, although I have a huge blank spot.
