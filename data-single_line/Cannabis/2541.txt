Everyone had left the room but myself, they had gone to call some friends up and make this private affair into a little party. I smoked the 2nd bowl all by myself, and I could tell the outside world was different from before. My distance judgement had gone to hell. I stood up, looking to get something to drink, my mouth was dry and didn't feel good. Cottonmouth has always been an issue while I was high. Right when I got to the fridge I forgot what I was there for and didn't remember for some 15 minutes or so. Eventually I got some pop, and walked back into the smoking room.
