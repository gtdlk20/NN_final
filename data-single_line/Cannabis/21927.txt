this wasn't the most freaky part tho. After a while of a ride through 4D, well actually it happened near the start too - displacement. Where I was in relation to everything around me changed. Quite suddenly at first. When I was coming back from the trip, my vision slowly gradually focused. And when it was back in full focus, I freaked! well not really, it was more a puzzled 'Whaaaat the fuuuuck!' (I was laughing while saying it, so there wasn't fear).
