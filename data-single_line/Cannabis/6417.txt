I put on Camel's 'Mirage' album and was blown away by the genius of the music and production, considering that it was especially impressive for (I think) 1974. Then I listened to their Moonmadness album. But while I was listening I started thinking too hard about stuff. It had nothing to do with the music, it just happens sometimes because I tend to overanalyze things occasionally. It's a blessing and a curse. Anyway for some reason, all the negativity I have inside came to the surface and I was surprised how much negativity I had been harboring. I think of myself as a pretty laid back positive person, so I was taken aback by my own bad vibes here. Really I was plain shocked and pretty depressed about it.
