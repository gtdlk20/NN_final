When I woke up I felt like I had done a bunch of hard drugs the night before.  I looked in the mirror and realized that I looked horrible.  I'm still really tired right now as I write this; it's only the day after.  I'm not sure I'd want to eat another weed brownie again if I'm going to be thinking that I'm talking to people and doing stuff that I'm not.  Being scared and thinking that your friend might be hurt and you don't know where she is, can be really frightening.
