After 10 or so minutes into my high I noticed my sister's boyfriend's truck outside.  He came in and immediately noticed I was high and asked for some assistance in giving his dog some medicine.  I held the dog's mouth open so he could submit the pill to his mouth (I think it was for worms - I'm not sure).  The pill opened up and the powder went everywhere.  It was hilarious to me.  As the dog struggled to get away from my grasp, everything seemed to go in slow motion.  He'd twitch and his figure would cast an illusion... as if he was moving in slow motion.  After he had left I was definitely feeling it, and when I sat in my computer chair and leaned back I felt as if I was flipping.  Over and over again I flipped.  It was interesting, and probably the best part of the high.  Then it turned bad.
