This trip was intensely spiritual and cerebral. At one point I felt as if I could take in no more 'knowledge', and that my brain needed some rest. I also understood how knowledge could give a person pure pleasure/bliss and bewilderment. This cerebral pleasure (I call it thus for the want of a better word) was like a mental orgasm.
