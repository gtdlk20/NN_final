I said to a few people I wanted my music, so they got it for me. I put on my favorite song by Laika and began to listen. It sounded really different, I could still recognize it. However, different instruments were amplified. It was bizarre and very disorienting. When I closed my eyes, it felt like everything began to move in erratic directions, and I was getting very rapid visualizations in my head. I would randomly think of something, and I would zoom in on this and it would flow to the next thing with in seconds and just keep going. I was feeling anxious.
