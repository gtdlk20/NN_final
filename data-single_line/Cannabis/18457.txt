So, now it was just Raz, Track, BMF, and myself. Again, another twist comes up. Having a few extra X's left, BMF attempts to coerce Track into rolling with us. Her only real reason for not wanting to was having to work the next day at four and being tired, but BMF still tried. I even threw in a little taste of my own, simply because I like peer pressure. I know, it's twisted. But I laid off, because I only wanted to make one little comment. Soon enough I found myself back with the computers playing some excellent toys I had downloaded. Then, I began to get restless. We had our supple of straws and water, which I carried around with me most of the time because I like water. Of course, I made the mistake of setting them down several times and losing them for extended periods of time. I would walk around the house with a stride of determination, spouting off lines like, 'Where the fuck is my goddamned water!' or Jesus Fucking Heral Christ....I just want my cursed water!' Track told me to get another glass and it would be alright, but I prefer to have what I started out with.
