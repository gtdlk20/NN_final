I set out to try the new technique. First I tried Mouth to Lung. It was complicated. Once I ended up swallowing rather than inhaling. Then I tried direct inhalation. Using the abx 510 battery and OG Kush cartridge, I took a gentle draw for ~3 seconds, then chased it with as much fresh air as I could inhale. I felt a warm gentle sensation in my lungs (the hit), but absolutely zero coughing. There wasn't even an urge to cough to suppress. I was so surprised, I did it again, just proving to myself it wasn't a fluke. (I might have even done it a third time?)
