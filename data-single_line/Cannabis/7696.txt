I stood in this kid's living room with my roller blades strapped on and was talking to him about something I can't remember...when all of a sudden it felt like I had been inflated with helium. I felt like my head was hitting the ceiling and that I had left my friend a long long way down. This floating sensation was brought down by him slapping me. Apparently I had been ignoring him for quite some time. I began laughing histerically for a few minutes, and it made me feel so good. I finished talking to him, and told him that I had to leave before has parents came. He agreed, and I set out onto the street.
