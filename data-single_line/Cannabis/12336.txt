Well I hadn't smoked in almost a month before this.  I was just sitting there and felt a decent buzz.  It started to kickin within 5 min.  I started to feel sick cause it was so smokey inside so I said I'm going outside for some fresh air.  Here is where it hit me...hard.  I leaned against the side of the house breathing in the fresh air and it started to creep on me.  I looked down at my feet and BAM it hit me.  It seemed as if my feet were serouisly ten stories down.  It felt as if my vision was going higher and higher into the sky but my head wasn't moving.  It felt as if I was being lifted out of my body.  When I felt this I didn't want to leave so I snapped out of it and then bam I would be right back in normal vision, completely in my body.  I did this a few times and when snapping back into my body it startled me.  Then my whole legs went numb.  My legs and the trashcan next to me started to flash violently like a strobe light going very fast.  My friend and the other smoker I knew best and was sorta cool with came out.  We started to just chill and talk. My friend asked if he could drop us off downtown.  He didn't mind so off we were.
