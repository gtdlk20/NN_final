It was very cold out so after about five minutes me and my friend decided to go back to his house. On the way back is where it hit me harder.  We were skating back and while I wasn't pushing I would zone out.  I had my hand over my mouth and nose so when I breathed it helped heat up my face.  This made my hand in the bottom of my vision.  It seemed my vision was given another dimension.  Like it was just a well draw 2d picture so it looked 3d, but then my hand became the 3rd dimension of depth.  It started to stretch out towards me.  This happened to me about three times and snapped out of it after about ten seconds.  This happened to me several other times but with objects with a color that stuck out.  Like the white road in between the grass.
