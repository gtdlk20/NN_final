I had seen bits and pieces of it on TV and thought it was fucked up, but I was never ready for the shit they put in front of me. It got very fucked up, then Ox (He had seen it several times before) went to smoke a cigarette while Sicily sadly exclaimed, 'Dammit...right when it gets really fucked up I have to wake up Spin for work!' So, now I was alone, trying to comprehend the shit that was flcikering before my eyes. It ended, and I dug it, although it was so insane. Now, BMF was inside, Sicily and Spin had left, and Raz was sleeping in a room. Ox and I were the only ones left up, me by a miracle, and him by a bump of Meth not too long ago. He surprised me by putting in an unknown cassette that turned out to be old school Tom Green Show when it was still in Canada. Boy did that blow my mind.
