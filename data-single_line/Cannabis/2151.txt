Many opponents of recreational marijuana use are quick to point out that it reduces concentration and coherence.  What those opponents do not acknowledge, however, is *why* marijuana appears to reduce concentration.  It is not because users become stupid, intoxicated, or lazy.  Rather, users are lifted out of ordinary life and transported into a much more meaningful world.  It resembles everyday reality but is much more malleable, frightening, and euphoric.  Everything is amplified and nothing is certain.  In everyday life, time goes by at more or less a constant rate.  Events and speech are linear and you are where you physically are and will not leave until you physically leave.  On marijuana (although IÂ’ve been told that many people need stronger psychedelics to experience such trippy things), seconds can seem to last for hours or milliseconds.  The same moment can happen hundreds of times in a seemingly infinite circuit.  Speech can be circular or spiraled instead of linear.  One can be transported elsewhere while physically in the same spot.
