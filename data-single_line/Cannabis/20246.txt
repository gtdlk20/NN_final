I was feeling pretty nervous as I watched him pack a bowl. Shaunna told me to calm down and that I might not even feel much of anything since this was my first time. (By the way whoever came up with that dumb theory that you don't get high your first time is crazy) I took a couple of hits and I wasn't really feeling anything. Then when Shaunna went to go take her hit she put the bowl in to her mouth and tried to light the other end. I started laughing and I could not stop. I was laughing for at least a couple of minutes. I felt so happy and relaxed like nothing in the world could hurt me.
