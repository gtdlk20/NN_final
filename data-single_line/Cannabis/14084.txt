Eventually (what seemed an eternity, was really only 10 minutes) my friends were done and got up to leave. I was very cold by this time, and my heart felt like it was beating in rhythm with a hardcore techno song. It didn't feel good. So we started walking back to rez, and I ended up walking a few steps behind the other two as they talked. I still couldn't get my mind to work 'in the moment', I just kept remembering everything that was happening. Then I snapped back into time, but my vision went all funny. Everything looked 2D and all the colors were washed out, just like in a cartoon. It looked like I was watching the Simpsons. The walk seemed to take forever, but eventually we got back to our friend's room and sat down to watch TV. The next few hours are a complete blank to me. I apparently went to the other end of rez to visit a friend, but I don't remember that at all. The only thing I can remember is all of a sudden realizing that I was in my friend's room, watching the Simpsons.
