Folks, I don't understand this at all.  I have taken some extremely potent substances in my time and nothing has had the same devastating effect.  I have no theories, ideas, or anything to give a remote hint.  I've thought maybe it's a chemical change that happens when you grow older.  Maybe it's something used in the cultivation of marijuana now.  Maybe it's a potency issue.
