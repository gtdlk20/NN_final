I went to a friend's house, and smoked maybe six large hits from a blunt.  I began getting extremely high, and stopped smoking after that.  I started feeling very anxious, my heart was pounding and I could feel my muscles spasming irregularly, although not violently.  I went home and tried to relax, but I found it impossible.
