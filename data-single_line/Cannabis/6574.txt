In the car to the diner, I kept thinking cool thoughts.  For example, I decided that one the reasons people sometimes don't remember the experiences they have in altered states of consciousness is that the whole encoding system of the brain has been altered; neurons that normally are a part of one firing pattern are the part of another, and those responsible for memory are off doing something else.  I had a whole 4-D model of the situation in my brain, which I shifted 90 degrees so that time became one of the spacial dimensions and one of the spacial dimensions became time. But I found it impossible to have any kind of conversation with my friend, who was driving.  At one point, I was thinking up a reply to something interesting that I thought he'd said and lost my train of thought, and asked him to repeat the question, and it turned out that he'd just asked what I'd said.  Several times he told me he had no idea what I was talking about.
