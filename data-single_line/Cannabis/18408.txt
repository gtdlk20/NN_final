It somewhat started a day before the fourth of July. Raz and I had the idea to hook our computers up over at his house because his parents would be gone. Then we could play Warcraft 3 for all hours of the day. Then, the fourth of July rolled around, and I went to bed around four-thirty. The next morning I awoke around one to the sound of the vacuum. At first I became disoriented, thinking that it was Thursday, we no longer had cleaning ladies, and my mom should have been at work. I let it pass and went back to sleep.
