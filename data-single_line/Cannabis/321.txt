K said, 'If you look at the sky, and hold really still, can you see it move over us?' So we held really still, and sure enough, we saw the sky move over us. It wasn't like something was flying up there, it was like we were being so still, we could witness the cycle of day/night, watching the sky spin on its axis. Then, I would look at one spot in the sky, and I would all of a sudden be looking at an eye, staring right down at me. Then, a spider-web style fractal started spinning towards the eye. I told J and he focused for a second and saw it too. Then S heard us and saw it too.
