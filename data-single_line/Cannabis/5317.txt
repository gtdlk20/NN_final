This is a recollection of one of my earlier experiences with marijuana. It took place the second semester of my freshman year in college, Im now a sophomore, so I guess it wasnt too long ago. I certainly cant claim to have been smoking for very long yet, but I have certainly become much more experienced. I cant remember with any certainty how many times Id smoked prior to this, it wasnt very many, if I had to guess maybe something like 10 occasions, that being in the high range.
