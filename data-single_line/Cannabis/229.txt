I'd always maintained that pot was never my problem but I quit smoking it because it tended to make me forget why I shouldn't drink. I believed that my years of ingesting psychedelics probably forestalled my alcoholism for ten to fifteen years. I also firmly believed that pot should be legalized.  Just because I didn't smoke it didn't mean I wanted to kill anybody else's buzz. Meanwhile time had been seriously  passing. I was well into middle age when my daughter was in middle school. In fact I was usually about ten-fifteen years older than most of the other Moms due to my lost years ( I wasn't really lost, I'd just been traveling a lesser known road) and I was sitting in when they had the guest lecturer on drugs come in to tell the kiddies about the evils of drugs and alcohol.  I used to joke with people that I'd tried every drug that had been invented before I sobered up.  But there were a few I knew nothing about like Ecstasy because it just wasn't well known back then.  Imagine my surprise when I learned that Ecstasy was in fact MDMA which I'd really enjoyed once upon a time.  I was really tickled by that little piece of trivia.  Another interesting surprise was when I heard that Cannabis was supposedly a lot stronger than it used to be.  Now this was intriguing to me.  I was admittedly curious.  But I didn't do anything about it. At least not for another 5 years.
