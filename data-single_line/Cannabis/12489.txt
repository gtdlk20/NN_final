I thought this was cool, but once I started focusing on it, it seemed to fade away.  I let myself go, and the CEV of the video game returned.  I found that if I let myself go, but payed attention to what I saw, I could control the video game character running around.  It jumped, ran, and did all the other stuff at my will.  I opened my eyes and I could still see a faint image of the video game character right in front of my eyes for a couple seconds before it disappeared.  Whenever I opened my eyes and closed them again, the video game character would return, but at what appeared to be a different level in the game.
