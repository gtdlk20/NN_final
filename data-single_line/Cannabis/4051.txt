T+0:10: I was most of the way done with my food when it started coming on fast and hard. It hit me when I was chewing my food, I had forgotten that I was eating, or that I was even alive. For about a minute at least I was a stationary observer in this picturesque landscape of glowing haze and hopping rabbits and general euphoria. I snapped back into where I really was and instantly became very confused, as I thought where I just was, was the 'real world' and that the real world was the imaginary one. Once my brain came into gear enough to realize what was actually happening another wave of completely different 'effects' came crashing down on me. I continued to chew the same mouthful of food that I had taken on a few minutes earlier, only it felt like I was chewing some kind of heavenly dish reserved for the gods.
