Ok back to the story:  About 7pm Saturday evening I was gifted the tincture and took a small sip.  A few minutes later I noticed a pleasant feeling and waited about 20 minutes.  Again I took a sip and felt a buzz.  I asked my friend who made the tincture, how much to take?  I was told that I was given a dose, plus a little extra to share.  The mg dosage was not known (WARNING!) (Because of legalization, I know my oral cannabis dose limit which is about 2 standard-dose dispensary edibles, or 30 mg.  That dose will put me to sleep so I assumed half would be just right.  In hindsight I should not have consumed this unknown dosage. In hindsight I should not have consumed this unknown dosage.) I decided I would take half of it just to be safe.  It tasted like weed, had a strong smell, and a burn of alcohol, kind of like Fernet Branca.  For the next 3 hours, I enjoyed the music, walked around the festival, and chatted with people.  I felt pleasant and was experiencing insights, lots of big picture thoughts and realizations about life.  This is nice!  I'm buzzed and outside and my mind is clear and I'm having a good time.  About 2 hours in I felt a drop like I sunk down into the earth.  It felt good.  Maybe it is kicking in?  It didn't last long.  I took another sip.  I thought- ok, this is mild and I just take a small sip, get a little buzz for about 30 minutes, then I take a sip to keep it going.  I can handle this.  I still have ¾ of my dose left so I think I am safe.
