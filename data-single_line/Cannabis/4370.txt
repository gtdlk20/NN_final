When I awoke, everything was back to normal. The depression was back, the trip from the night before was nothing but a memory. Of course, I smoked more in the following weeks. I developed an obvious psychological dependence, and music became my outlet. I already preferred classic rock from the 60s and 70s, but now I dived into this music. Instead of going on from what had been acknowledged as my favorite bands best songs, I bought albums and discovered the true depths of the music movement. Music is and has always been an absolutely vital component in my life, and now I was convinced I had discovered the greatest music in modern history. The highest point in my depression came in a single song, Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd. Stoned as hell, the lyrics and mood of the song pierced my soul, but the ultimate moment came during the end guitar solo of that song. It captured my existence and gave it form. It was as intense as my first experience with Dark Side of the Moon, but this time it was the yin to the formers yang. It was euphoric, but mostly because I somebody else out there had been in the same, dark, comfortably numb place I had been. They had escaped the crushing ruthlessness of life through use of drugs. This felt like salvation. In the weeks following the first experience, I had not used weed to pursue the truth-seeing that characterized the first. I only used it to get lost in the music and dissociate myself from my life.
