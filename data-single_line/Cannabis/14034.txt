For two months before last night, my girlfriend (we'll call her K) had been out of town and I had only talked briefly with her several times while she was gone. So, naturally, when she came home we felt like celebrating. We did so by calling my most reliable dealer and getting two grams of Northern Lights sativa. After driving around for an hour or so, looking for a good park to toke in, we settled on a nice field about 100 yards off of a local highway and parked the car. I packed the first bowl and turned it over to K. She took a nice big hit and held it in for what seemed like an eternity, when she blew it in my direction I was overwhelmed by the all-too-familiar aroma of really, really good weed. We passed the bowl back and forth for a good twenty minutes when I decided to crash in the back seat and let the music flow through me. After about a half hour of stoned nothingness, I leaned over to K and touched her fingertips to mine, we then, almost instinctually began moving our hands as one. We were moving in very fluid, sensual motions with no apparent leader, this went on for a good fifteen minutes when she turned her head to mine and smiled. At this point, despite my intense drymouth, I kissed her. It was a brilliant kiss, magnified a thousand times by the euphoria of the weed, it was warm and soft and with my eyes closed all I could see was a picture of the ocean, all in shades of pink and red. Then, I fell back into the seat and began to doze off, but, minutes before I fell into the Sandman's grasp, the door opened and K climbed in.
