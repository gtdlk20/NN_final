I kept staring into the air or at the tv while thinking. I would focus on my thinking and forget about things around me. I hadn't eaten anything before smoking, and the slight hunger suddenly became very acute. It was like a sucking, ticklish feeling in the stomach now, but I knew that this was just my normal feeling of being hungry that had 'changed shape' into this new, buzzing, sucking feeling. It was quite annoying. Like if I had eaten some food that had gone bad and I felt I might want to vomit later. My thighs started to buzz too, maybe tickle a little in a way similar to when I have exercised a lot and is relaxing afterwards. I feel like I ought to sweat although it is not hot at all.
