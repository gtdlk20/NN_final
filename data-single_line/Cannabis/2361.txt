I have been smoking marijuana for about one and a half years now, a relatively short amount of time. Ive smoked, good high quality bud, made blunts, joints, and smoked out of bongs, pipes, and about anything else you could name. But for some reason Ive never really thought of eating marijuana as an effective way of getting high, and although I often had weed on me I never want to eat it because I thought it would be a waste so I would smoke it instead.
