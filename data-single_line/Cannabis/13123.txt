For a while I've been trying to quit using pot and have been instead using meditation to 'get high' which for me works pretty well considering my experience on the practice. (I've been practicing meditation longer than I've been smoking as a matter of fact.) Anyway I gave in about a week ago after going a few days without mary jane which isn't too bad considering I used to get stoned 24/7. I had entered the void through meditation earlier that day (Not easily done!) and I think the following state of mind I was in that day actually enhanced the high.
