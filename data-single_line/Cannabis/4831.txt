Overall, I prefer the effects of smoking weed over eating. I found the brownie experience to be a little dull and monotonous, and what normally would be an exciting and visually outstanding movie seemed boring and drawn out because I was more focused on my dry mouth than the storyline, although a whole brownie would have been far too much for me. I think in a different setting I may have had a different attitude, although I'll probably just sell the rest.
