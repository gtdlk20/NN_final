I bent my knees and sat on my heels, closed my eyes, and continued to throw up. This was not 'normal' vomitting, where it's just three or four long streams of puke. This was maybe a dozen coughs where vomit would come out with each cough. My stomach deflated, throat constricted and I spewed vomit, punctuating each deposit of vomit with a wet cough. I threw up maybe 8 or 9 times before it subsided.
