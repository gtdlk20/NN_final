I visited a local meet-up of cannabis friendly and like minded persons and obtained a selection of edible treats baked with cannabutter. I had never experienced edible marijuana products before. I did not take them at the meet up, instead decided to wait for a more appropriate time and venue. Several weeks later my curiosity got the better of me and I prepared one morning to try it out.
