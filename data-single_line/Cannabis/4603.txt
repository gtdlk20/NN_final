Before this experience about 4 years ago I was sort of a rebelious person. I hung with the stoner/rebel croud and often did what they did accept for smoking pot. Its not that I was against it but I guess I was just intimidated by it i guess. I was around people who did it but somehow never convinced myself that it was anything I would benefit from. Again this was 4 years ago and I have settled down alot and am not a rebel but I do still smoke pot to this day frequently. The closest thing to any drug was drinking vodka or other alchohol on occasions. Anyway the mindset I had in my experience was eagerness, and scared because I didnt know what to expect ya know? But I tried to stay calm throught it and it was sometimes pretty hard. The settings I was in were in a shed, outside the house and inside different houses and we just chilled inside after we were blazed.
