-Smoking: I have no clue where to buy papers here, but a local convenient shop sells small cigars so I tried my hand at blunt rolling, succeeding on my second attempt. The smoke from the blunt was harsh and it had very little effect by itself. Smoking a bit with a few beers created an effect that was subjectively different and better than the alcohol alone.
