The hash was prepared as either canna-butter or canna-fudge (you'd've thought creativity would have called forth more imaginative nomenclature).  Occasionally I'd also take between 10-15mg of diazepam.  When outside of my self-imposed 'safety zone' for diazepam, I'd drink whiskey (SAFETY ZONE: ~3hrs/mg - i.e. if I took 15mg of diazepam, I would wait AT LEAST 3x15=45hrs before drinking; this was usually rounded up to the following day as previous experience has led to nasty attacks of depression when the two mix).  Two days previous to the experience I'm focusing on I had also ingested 6g of 'premium powdered' Kratom as a tea, the day before I'd taken 15mg of diazepam.  During all this there were no problems.  What the following describes is my battle with what I truly believed was impending mental collapse.  It is intended to illustrate the potential damage ABUSE can cause, not responsible USE.  I have since made my peace with Cannabis, and her infinite love and wisdom remains willingly offered.  She is not one to hold a grudge.
