Immediately I wished that I hadn't.  The smoke felt much 'denser' then it usually was and the urge to cough became nearly unbearable.  I waited for a nice long count of 10 though before I finally gave in and blew the smoke out of my lungs.  The effects of the hit seemed to set in immediately.  As I slowly tilted my head back with the last tendrils smoke floating towards the ceiling, I felt like the back of my skull was inexplicably being drawn towards the ground.  I could feel my vision expanding, my peripheral vision becoming sharper and wider.  Only one or two minutes after taking the hit, I realized that my cheeks were hurting because I had been smiling ever since the bong hit the floor.  It was definitely a GOOD feeling and I probably should have stopped right there.
