All of a sudden, I felt different. It felt as if I was starting anew; I hadn't just walked down the street, I hadn't just smoked a joint, I hadn't been at home earlier that evening. I felt like I was in a dream, too. It was as if I wasn't actually there. No hallucinations, no heightened senses. I just felt as if I was in a new time. My body was tingly. I heard my heart pounding in my head really loud, and my footsteps were rhythmic, as if I was walking to a beat. Everything looked so unfamiliar, and I had to concentrate really hard to know what I was doing. Time was distorted; the seconds felt like minutes, yet the hours passed by so quickly.
