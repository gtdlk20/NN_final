T-6.5 hrs, Eventually, Dane found me and brought me to his house, where I ate a lot of delicious food, played with his bunnies (fucking rad) and had mad intellectual talks. I left his house at 9:30ish, and realized something. I thought I had come down, but no, I was actually so stoned for so long that I just got used to it... I was still high, but being high just felt normal at this point. Once I got home, I sank  into the couch. And slept for two hours. Upon waking, realized I was still destroyed, I hiked to my room and fell asleep. I awoke sober, but feeling... odd... I went over the events and realized that I should never mix a heavy body high (firecracker) with a heavy heady high (smokin' headband). Though, looking back, it was not a bad experience, because now I know and recognize my boundaries. Another lasting effect of the trip was that my tolerance went WAY down, but in a strange way. I get super high, but sober up within two or three hours. I haven't eaten firecrackers since, but I'm curious. Let this be a warning to those experimenting with heavy edibles. They are no joke! And you will be stoned off your ass! Or in my case, on your ass... on a toilet seat... for three hours.
