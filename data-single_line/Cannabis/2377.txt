This is also when I noticed I had a very intense body stone I could feel everything, the floor under my feet, the soft sheets of my bed, and the cool breeze blowing through my bedroom window, all of it was magical and frightening at the same time. I started to have fun with this body stone, when I moved my toes that sensation would travel throughout my whole body. I returned to my bedroom and decided that I would try to catch some sleep.
