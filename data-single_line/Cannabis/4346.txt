Sure enough, I received a letter a week later, informing me that we were, by all standards, done. This came in the middle of finals week, and I botched my last exam as a result, from which I still havent resolved my grudge. Anyway, I fought her on it, but she couldnt be persuaded. So this was the end for S and me.
