Once I had picked three kids up, it was about 8 pm and we decided to stop at a parking lot to light up.  My friend, Allen, brought his sweet glass pipe with him and I started to pack a bowl.  It was cold out, being december, so we stood in a circle to help stay warm and keep the wind from blowing out the flame.
