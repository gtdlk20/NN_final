To truely experience pleasure, one must also experience pain. I've never been much of a masochist, but I was feeling somewhat philosphical, so I put on a kettle to make some yerba mate tea. (WARNING: The following is a VERY bad idea) When the kettle started to steam, it turned first into a fire breathing dragon, and then into a Dalek from Doctor Who (I didn't actually see them, I was thinking about what the kettle looked like, and as a result I thought I saw them). I picked the kettle up by the sides, the pain was excruciating, and poured four cups of mate before I decided to put the kettle down. About two seconds afterward the pain was replaced by a rush of relief that never went away the rest of the night.
