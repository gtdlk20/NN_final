I've been a pretty heavy cannabis user for the past 6 months, usually smoking either every day or every other day.  At one point or another I had gone 4 nights without smoking and was questioning when I would be smoking again.  That same night my friend calls me for a session at his house.  It was going to be my most usual smoking buddies joining me at one of their houses so I thought it would be a nice fun, not too out of control, evening as usual when I smoke with my friends.
