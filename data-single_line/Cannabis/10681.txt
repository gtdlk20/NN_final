We went on chilling out like this for a while. Then 'High Hopes', by Pink Floyd, came on. As the bells chimed in the beginning, me and my friend exchanged a quick, 'Oh, hell yes,' and then I walked over to the stereo, turned it up, and laid down on the floor. I tuned myself completely to the music, allowing it to draw me in more and more. The buzzing in my body grew stronger, and almost seemed to pulse with the beat of the music. I also think this was when I had my first closed eye visual of this experience. The silhoutte of a dog came into my field of vision, turned into a lion, and walked away. As the song drew to it's beautiful climax, I felt as if I was spinning around, just a vessel of the life in this big universe we live in.
