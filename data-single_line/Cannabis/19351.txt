One night I was at a friends house, and we had just got back from my sisters high school graduation. We all (5 people) went to my friends room, and lit up some great Boone (north carolina) Nug bud. It taste so good I could have died. I could feel it kick in as I took the first hit. We all sat and talked and laughed, but then Thomas took out a rolling paper. Oh, shit I was already in over my head. I didn't think I could handle any more, but it was just the kind of bud I couldn't pass up. Do you know what I mean?
