Time 6:00 - YES!!! Thank god.  I walked out of my house mumbled an incoherent goodbye; to my brother's amusement, and sat on the wall outside of my house.  I pondered how cannabis could be so strong.  I shuddered at the thought of it being legalised - too many people would experience my fate.  My heart was still beating viciously and I was shaking and sweating.  As the Oasis song 'Gas Panic' goes 'sailing on a sea of sweat on a stormy night' the words couldnt have fit how I felt better. I was sailing on my sanity, a sea in the storm of intense paranoia and physical instabilty, battling to stay afloat.
