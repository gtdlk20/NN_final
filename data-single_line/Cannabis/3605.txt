I did a couple searches on 'what to do when you're too high', and read through various suggestions. One of them said to watch porn, which sounded like a good enough idea. I felt like I was wobbling all over as I got headphones from my computer and made my way back to bed. As soon as I got some porn on my phone, I got another window into how crazy high I was. I was getting the tunnel vision, but also something else. It almost felt like I was there. Like the stuff in the porn was happening to me. It was pretty crazy in a fun way. It distracted me for a little while at least.
