My eyes began to feel heavy, somewhat like when I haven't slept for a while, and my eyelids seem to weigh more than they really do. A smile slowly grew on my face, as I began to notice myself far more relaxed than I ever have been. The sunlight seemed a lil more intense, although I didn't seem to mind it at all. But I also felt this odd lightheadedness, a tingly sensation in my brain, with a very light headache that somehow didn't seem to bother me at all. We finished up the spliff, and then the next, and then this is when I decided to get up - the weed had kicked in good by now.
