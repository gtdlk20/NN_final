I stood up, and I suddenly felt dizzy, and I felt like things were slightly movin (both in vision and feelin). If I could best describe the feelin and sight, it was like how I feel and see after I have been spinnin in a circle in the same spot for about 30 seconds. That 'world is turnin around a bit' type of thing. But what I didn't notice is how odd my walkin was. I was apparently wobblin a bit from side to side, not as much as a drunk losin full balance, but more like I have been shook up a bit instead. T and P were laughin at me, and had told me to sit down, afraid that I might fall from bein so damn high. Whether I had fallen or stayed sittin down, I didn't care. I was havin fun. I started laughin at nothin, and my friends look at me as if I was some kinda lunatic and then began laughin with me, or was it at me? Regardless, I was still havin fun.
