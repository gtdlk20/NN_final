The first few puffs had gotten me pretty high and smoking more made my mind soar to new heights.  We were listening to Dark Side of the Moon over and over again.  The music was so enriching and thick I felt like I could have tasted it as the noise flowed from the speakers.  As I laid on the floor it felt as if someone was pulling me backwards through water.  I was suffering from severe cotton mouth, so I walked downstairs to get a drink.  The air was so much cleaner and crisp.  Entering the attic, it was as if I had been engulfed in a rich sweet white haze.  It was like a dream sequence on TV, everything was so clouded yet intense.
