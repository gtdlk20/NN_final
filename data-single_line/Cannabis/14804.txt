We arrived around 8:00PM that night and proceeded to consume the Chinese take-out we had acquired earlier that evening. My girlfriend told me to sit down on the couch in the kitchen and wait. Her friend sat next to me with the guy she was with, whom I'll call T. My girlfriend then entered with the stuff and handed it to her friend. She lit it up, inhaled and held it in. She then passed it to me and I looked at it puzzled. As I put it to my mouth the phrase 'all in the name of science' passed through my brain. It was probably just as an excuse to my conscience. I inhaled and held it in just as I was instructed to do. T. then passed it onto my girlfriend. I finally exhaled when it got back to me. We proceeded in this fashion until it became a roach and then nothing.
