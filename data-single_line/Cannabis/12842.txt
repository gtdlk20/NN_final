We had all skinned up and sparked up. All was well in my mind, I was feeling happy, I was laughing, I was comfortable and I was even more wasted. We must have had nearly 20 spliffs and that was too much for my body to handle. I wasnt actually sure what time it was when I had disgusting waves of nausea sweeping over my body from head to toe. I knew that if I were sick I wouldnt feel as bad so I made my way to the toilet. I used it for what its made for and then hesitated on leaving the bathroom. My head was switching from hot to cold in waves. My hands were shacking more than I have ever seen and my face was as white as fresh virgin snow. I resumed the stance of Doggy so I could vomit and actually hit the water of the toilet. I started heaving; nothing was being ejected from my body. I continued to heave almost to the point of vomiting but absolutely nothing came out. I was frustrated that I had spoiled my own night from over indulging. The ironic thing was that the bathroom is next to PiCs mums room she was watching a programme about pot smokers and the legal status of Cannabis in the UK. I found it funny because I was stoned while listening to a well-spoken man talk about the effects that I was experiencing. I had to laugh at least in my head at that. I was interrupted in my face to face with the toilet bowl by PiCs uncle. I dragged myself into his room and had to lie on the floor. I was expressing my situation to the rest of the guys who were nothing but as sympathetic as one could be when stoned.
