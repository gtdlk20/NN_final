Day 3.  25 mg in one go at 2020 after a light meal. I didnÂ’t bother with sublingual but just sucked them like sweets (which they are). This dose hit the sweet spot. The onset was quicker. Within the hour. By soon after 9pm I felt the scalp and face prickle as before. Again the peak was about two hours but this time stronger - a definite 5/10 on the stoned-ness scale. I was still functional but it was more marginal. I could have maintained a conversation but it would have been a challenge. The most notable feature was significantly stronger visuals including tracers in the half light as I moved my hands, and pronounced faces in all clouds. Delightful. The come down took about three hours though I was still slightly stoned at 1 am (1/10). I then slept soundly and woke up with no hangover of any kind. The only adverse effect I could detect was a dry mouth during the peak of the experience which meant I had to sip water quite frequently. Otherwise I felt entirely well throughout.
