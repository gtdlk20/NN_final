I usually have a 2-minute onset to cannabis, and every time it's the same story. I keep telling myself it won't work this time and that it's not going to affect me, and then it hits me like a sack of bricks and I eat those thoughts at surprise for its potency. 10 minutes later, I was thinking, 'You know, I hate to sound typical, but it really should have kicked in by now.' And as usual, just when I have given up on waiting for it to kick in, it kicked in.
