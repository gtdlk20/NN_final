While this was happening 1 thing that crossed my mind was a crystal relation? and also that Buddha a saw earlier This part sitting down wasnt scary (like the cats) but intense, felt like it was more than something that just the plant set off.  Wow.  As far as the cats go, when arriving home earlier I thought they where trying to tell me of a spirit in the house, but reflecting on it a day or 2 later, I have a feeling spirit inside cat? and not able to look at the cats eyes since without unease dont like cats as much now (feel like they are stealing good energy).
