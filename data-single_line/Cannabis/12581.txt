Apparently I was tripping like that for about 30 minutes, it felt like 5, 10 minutes max. My time perception was totally messed up. I looked over at my friend, he was eating some donuts and taking no particular notice of me, so I just tried to make sense of the situation. I couldnÂ’t think. My thoughts are just one big dopey haze. It felt like I was just floating, like looking at my self from a different body. Until my friend got my attention and suggested we go get some fresh air.
