We walked down the sidewalk together smelling each otherÂ’s hair to see if we smelled like weed. I imagine we looked incredibly strange to oncoming cars. All of a sudden I screamed. Her friend had beeped his horn at us. This scared me immensely as my super-charged heart nearly popped out of my chest. My chest was warm then, I could feel it in my lungs and throughout my face. It was not at all normal and obviously from the weed.
