The day was greatly anticipated: Friday, noon, a school holiday and I'd be in company of good friends, one of which I have known for a very long time, could, and always have, trusted strongly. But I had no idea that it would be one of the most intense, disturbing, entertaining, groovy, frightening and paradox-infested days of my life, man. It welled up like the great ascension of my favourite song projected into a tidal wave that looms over me in silence; a vision that plays somewhere else in the time-space continuum, while on the opposite side a fainted beat to that song shatters the fearsome dream-state into an infinite amount of pieces that veer off into the Universe only to come shouting back at me with full force, becoming my ego itself.
