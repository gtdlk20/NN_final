 When I was growing up I always thought I would be the one person who would never try drugs. In eigth grade I was 'straight edge' The one night my cousin Shaunna was over. She is two years older than me and has tried many difftent drugs. My neighbor Tom used to grow his own weed and told me if I ever wanted to get high then I was welcome to come over.
