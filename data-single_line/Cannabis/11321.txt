I meet Ani at the club. The music, minimalist techno in one room and anthemic electronica in the other, is pumping out of a state of the art sound system. I am bathed in texture. I haven't been out dancing in months, and I've come properly equipped. Many molecules have been burning a hole in my pocket all night, and now, a little past midnight, I am ready to dive in. I find Ani on the dancefloor and we navigate closer to where Donato Dozzy is spinning records, dancing as we watch him.
