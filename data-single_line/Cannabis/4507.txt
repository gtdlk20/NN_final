Oh my gosh, my legs felt like they were decomposing into putty. I felt like I was protected from everything in that jacket. Anyways, we started the stoner cycle again packing more bowls and taking more hits. Eventually, the jacket felt wet. I asked F why his jacket was so wet, he replied with Its not. Dude youre f@#ked up. Am I? M: Yeah dude. As soon as he finished that sentence, I closed my eyes, opened them, and everything was weird; just different. My depth perception was zero and everything looked so very flat. I started feeling pressure in waves down my body, over and over again. It literally felt like someone was pushing the skin against my face. I was literally smacked. It seemed like it hurt but it actually didnt. It was just so different I had no other way to explain it to them. This was the point where I started freaking out in my head. The panic set in. I wanted it to stop so badly. I would have done anything to make that wonderful feeling go away. I didnt understand it. I said nothing. I was nothing. I broke my silence. What have I done? Im never doing this again. M: You say that but. Me: How the hell are you reading my thoughts!? M: You said that out loud. I felt dumb. I was feeling everything and nothing at the same time. M tried to explain to me that this will be the best smoke ill ever have. He was soooo right. I have smoked WAY more than I did that day but nothing will ever compare to it. I whispered, I couldnt give 3 f@#ks about 4 f@#ks. M: Jared, youre a f@#king crack head. In my head, Insane in the membrane, insane in the brain is played on a constant loop. I was having irrational thoughts. Then as soon as I would have them, I would get sidetracked and forget what I was thinking about. At one point I stood up, ran around my friends grandmas car, and laid on the hood. Dude not the car! Me: Whoops. I stood back up, closed my eyes, and opened them back up. Some how I managed to wind up with my face on the lawn chair. This was a safety safe for me, where I laid for what I thought was an hour but was actually 2 minutes according to M as I asked him later. I asked Fernando where the bathroom was even though I had been to his house before, I just couldnt remember. Just go out back. Its f#$king freezing man, isnt there a bathroom I can use in the house? I stumbled out the door before he could even answer. This was one of the crazier parts of the night. I was still having those pain waves and they were becoming more intense as the smoking continued. I whipped my junk out, and peed. Suddenly the waves of pressure surged to my member; it made my pee very interesting. As I went back inside I tripped through the door and almost banged my head against a metal bucket. I laid there. M asks me if Im alright. I reply, Im gonna just chill here for a bit if you guys dont mind.
