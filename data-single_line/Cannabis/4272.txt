	I look at myself, and I am not myself.  I am made up of white and blue light.  I am some sort of orb.  This is when I begin to come down.  I start floating in a downwards direction, eventually reaching the hole in the roof of D's recreation room.  I float through the hole and see my own body, unconscious on the couch, sitting next to B.  I blink.
