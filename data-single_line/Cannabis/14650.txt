After about half an hour of nausea, I laid in the thick grass and dozed off for what felt like hours. I remember seeing weird patterns and a vision that reminded me that I was falling down a tunnel. I came to it 10 minutes later and I was lying 5m away from where I first laid down. I noticed that I had tunnel vision and everything I saw was outlined in black and the sun seemed so bright that I found it uncomfortable to sit in its light, so I moved into the shade.
