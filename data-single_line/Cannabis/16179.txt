The room I was in, very slightly resembled my bedroom from when I was a small child, like 3. Instead of thinking, my brain told me this WAS the room I lived in when I was 3, and I began to think I was 3. Instead of thinking, my brain told me this WAS the room I lived in when I was 3, and I began to think I was 3. I realized around this time I was shaking very very violently. Things were moving, the world was tilting. I start to close my eyes, so I don't get dizzier than I was. When I closed my eyes, it was like a dream I had when I was 3. I kept having all these random memories come to life for me. The guy who wanted to spend time with me, came and brought me water, knowing I more than likely had dry mouth. I couldn't hold up the water cup, because I was shaking so much. The water went EVERYWHERE, and I started laughing hysterically. Things kept changing color for me, it was so pretty and trippy. Then I realized, I smoked way too much and I was tripping. I felt like I was living inside a dream, and time had just slowed down. Minutes turned to hours.
