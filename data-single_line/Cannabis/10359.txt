My cousin said she was hungry.  And for some odd apparent reason I offered to go get her something from the coffee shop.  So here I am, high as a kite, not knowing wat is going on, a little girl walking the streets of chicago in the rain, about a block down the street (where I am out of site of my friends) getting some food.
