8.11- I have returned, with Triscuits, green tea, and a small cactus. I choke upon a dry Triscuit, and I feel waves of discomfort flowing through my body, but it only makes me feel more tired and nature-acclimated. Once again, I fear being apprehended as my small marijuana stash container is still left on the table. My thoughts move fast, but my body feels as though a racing car in one of those bond movies is chasing him, and heÂ’s flying downhill. I also feel an earthy attachment to my car. Anyway, on the physical sign, I now see a psychedelic cloud with earthy video-game tones in it and I feel very close to nature. I am now very warm everywhere, and greatly stimulated to relax..
