I had never heard of anyone 'overdosing' from marijuana before and I kept telling myself that but the 'pain' thing did not subside. Heart rate check, seemed to be normal but I could not keep count as I would forget what the hell number I was on. I got a phone call. My short term memory was so damn bad that I forgot what I was saying or what we were talking about almost every single sentence. The person on the phone knew I was fucked because he asked me if I wanted to buy amphetamines and I told him no, under any other circumstance I would not have said that, but that's another story. My friend and I decided to walk to the park from the wooded area. We both agreed that we were going to get lost in the ten foot by forty foot little blotch of land.
