I stepped outside of the car, naked both physically and emotionally. I looked at the stars, and I looked at the car. I looked at my surroundings, and realized that I had just become eligible for fatherhood at the age of 16. When I went back to the car, K was crying. We sat there and said nothing for an hour or so, sobered up, and finally she cleared her throat. Before she could say anything I reassured her that whatever happened, and whatever she chose to do, that I loved her and that I would be there all the way to the end. Now, I've heard people talk about eye-contact, and I've looked people in the eye before. But this time, when our eyes made contact, so did our souls, and it was beautiful. She dryed her eye and smiled.
