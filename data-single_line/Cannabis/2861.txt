Now for analysis. I have talked to a lot of people and have heard many people talk about a flattening of perspective. They all describe it exactly the same as mine and I've even found other accounts on Erowid. It's happened to me several times, always the same way, always from pot. I have never been able to observe it for long, because it's very maddening and I feel violently compelled to keep my eyes closed till it stops, which is always fairly quickly. I find it interesting that in some accounts of freaking out on pot people describe things like gaining multiple dimensions or existing in multiple demensions simultaneously. This is the opposite of what I describe, I think. It seems like worthy phenomenon to pursue scientifically and philosophically. Another thing that I have found to be a widespread effect of freaking out is the visualization of internal organs. A friend of mine was very skeptical about drugs and when he smoked pot for the second time he had this happen. He felt very sick and crazy. When he told me about the organs I got excited and told him that the same thing had happened to me once. I have since heard others describe this.
