We returned to Room A and I lied down on the bed in the dim light. It strangely felt like I was in control of a camera. Moving in front of nearby objects felt like a cinematic experience. It strangely felt like I was in control of a camera. Moving in front of nearby objects felt like a cinematic experience. I was sure that at that point, I had started feeling the effects. I was the most stoned person in the group. Everything felt like a dreamÂ— slow and wavy. Talking complete, coherent sentences was a challenge and my voice and tone of speaking were all over the place. Whenever I would close my eyes, I would visualize various patterns and motifs (CEVs) and slip into a trance. Opening my eyes felt like waking up from a long sleep session. At times, there was a delay between events, comparable to looking at a slideshow. Movement was taxing and laggy, but certain actions, like rubbing my face with my palms, moving my body a certain way and feeling different objects was pleasurable and I would repeatedly do it at times with vigour. My entire body felt like the ticklish feeling I get when I want to pop my knuckles or stretch my body. I was very talkative, often forgetting what I was saying halfway through a sentence. I had the memory of a goldfish. Whenever I would open my eyes, I would feel like the drug was wearing off, only to be sucked back into the trip.  At times, I felt pain in my chest and I thought that I was forgetting to breathe, and if I were to fall asleep, I would die. The nausea persisted for long (maybe because the weed was cheap and of poor quality). This new experience made me shiver, like I was having a mini panic attack, throughout the trip. Music felt like a distraction at times. I partly was in control of what I wanted to say, but it ended up sounding weird and funny, making those around me crack up. I felt like hugging people around me. I was kind of there in this state, exploring the effects, watching the people in the room do different activities, and verbally interacting with them, until I fell asleep.
