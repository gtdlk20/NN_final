I was trying to control my laughter considering the fact that I was scared out of my mind. Yet I still managed to try to calm him down and myself as well. By now I realized we had to be tripping some sort of way. We had gone back to his brothers room and started watching TV. He had gone to bed because his head was spinning and he couldn't take it. I was overcome with fear of my friend getting this weird idea in his head and coming into the room and murdering me, so I locked the door. Than I heard a voice in the back of my head telling me to go do what I just thought. I was staring at a sharpened pencil laying on the ground than geeked out and threw the covers over my head. I squeezed my eyes shut in hopes to fall asleep.
