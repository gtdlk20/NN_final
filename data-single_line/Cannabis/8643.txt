Three years later, i'm now very experienced with marijuana.  And from this great plant, i uncovered different secrets about music, thinking, art, and other mind entertaining subjects. I wonder to this day what i would be like if my mind had never been exposed to this insight.  I think i would be a lot more of a dull person, and ignore things which meant a great deal to personal exploration.
