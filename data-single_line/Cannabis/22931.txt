We arrived at my friends house and smoked some of our 15 sac. Then found ourselves in his brothers bedroom listening to Ministry. I was wearing my SFX contact lenses which made my eyes red and yellow. I started mouthing the words to the song and air guitaring to it. My friend started cracking up and saying my eyes looked like they were on fire. He said he thought I was Satan and started geeking out a little bit, so  I decided to stop. Than started poking at his eyes but not really touching them. He grabbed his eyes and started moaning like I had really poked him. He said it felt like his pupils were going into the back of his head and down into his throat. I started cracking up but at the same time a sense of fear had come over me. So I tried to take control and decided that we go downstairs and eat something. We walked into the kitchen and he puked into the sink and repeated trying to puke when there was nothing left.
