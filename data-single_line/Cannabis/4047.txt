The next day at school I was expecting to smoke this huge J between me and one other friend (A) (habitual smoker), so during lunch we met up and were going to go get lunch before we smoked so we could eat while we were baked. Just as we were heading out she asked one of her friends (B) who I didn't know very well at the time, if she wanted to smoke. And one of my friends (C) showed up from a different school at the same time, as he was going to join friend A and I at lunch. So after we all got back from getting our food we walked over to this L shaped hallway by the school to smoke The Spliff. I was slightly nervous as the location was fairly visible from the road where the cops drive by regularly.
