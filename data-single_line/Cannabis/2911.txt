A lot of people have talked about the value of having a friend around during a bad trip, but having people around me was the last thing I wanted during this experience.  I was terrified one of my roommates, who are both good friends of mine, would come home and find me freaking out.  I figured they would think I was insane and disassociate themselves from me permanently.  I now realize this fear was very irrational: they are very good friends of mine and no doubt would have tried to help me through the experience.  They probably would have been freaked out, but not overly judgemental.  At the time, however, I felt like I was a big fraud, trying to hide my ugly secret (insanity) from the whole world.
