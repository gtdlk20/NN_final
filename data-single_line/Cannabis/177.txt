Hairs in the back of my neck are sensitive. Eyes drying out a bit makes it harder to read. By this time I have gotten used to the manualness of things and the pressure in my chest. I am getting a bit tired. Washing hands is fun, the temperature is very acute, as if I were reading it on a digital thermometer. I try not to bite my cheek or tongue as I am afraid I might bite through it.  Certain keys on the keyboard are hard to type, and I make many typos.
