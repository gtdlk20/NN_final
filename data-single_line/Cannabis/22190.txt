We smoked so much I think I blacked out on my patio at one point. I remember someone waking me up and we went inside, to watch TV or something. That first time I really felt what it was like being stoned, I didn't say too much. I don't remember much of that particular night. I do remember solving the Rubik's cube. I can solve it sober in about 3 minutes, but I tried it stoned - it was the only thing I could focus on for whatever amount of time it took me to solve it. But it kept me in touch with reality, when everything else was wavy and jumpy and slow all at the same time. The volume of sounds kept changing and the only way I could keep it normal was if people kept talking at a constant rate. Strange.
