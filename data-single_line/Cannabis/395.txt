Instead of jumping to that particular hallucination, my mind ran off on a different but related tangent.  Focusing on the game Baulders Gate 2 and all of the little horrors that I had seen while playing it.  My mind positively flew through every detail of the game and came to a stopping point on the giant spiders I had been fighting the day before.  I sputtered there for a second on the edge of a precipice that I knew I had no power to avoid  wondering just how bad this might get.  Was that movement in the shadows of the closet?  Just at that moment, some bit of insight came shooting out of the back of my mind and completely enveloped my brain.  THIS IS NOT A GOOD LINE OF THOUGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think that was the only time during the experience that I was able to bend its direction consciously.
