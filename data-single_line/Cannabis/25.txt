It started at Toms, while Taya and I were watching The Wonderland Experience with Tom in his bedroom.  At least, I would guess thats when it started.  I dont really have a sense of beginnings with these things, its more of a gradual change.  There are a lot of uncertainties with this kind of experience, but Im pretty sure the frame of mind I was in was a familiar one.  I have been smoking weed for a while now, and I know the risks.  I wont go too far into details, but suffice to say, Ive done my research.  Every experience with the drug is different - I have experienced extreme creativity, elation, philosophy and sadness.  All very different frames of mind, but all common in some way.  There is always a point in the evening when I feel a certain detachment from my universe.  This happens from day to day all the time, but when smoking weed I feel less sensitive to my surroundings, and I can analyse this experience more closely.
