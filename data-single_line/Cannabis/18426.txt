I relay the story of last summer with my brother when the hunger and heat teamed up to deliver a finishing blow to my sight. I also make sure to point out the comedy of the situation, because my brother's friend's father was there and told his so to, 'Stay away from that stuff,' that he, 'better not be doing that stuff.' We both laugh at this as we go to sit down in the living room. My vision is still greatly fucked for lack of a better word. We watched a little TV but I still noticed I was hungry. I was at approximately this moment that Razgard brings up, 'Hey...do you still want that Pop-Tart?' I, having totally forgetting about it in the thirty seconds since we last saw it exclaimed, 'Fuck yea! I forgot.' We both laughed at this for what lingered on to be five, maybe ten minutes. Then, we went to get the Pop-Tart. I asked him if I could have it toasted, as a warm, gooey Simpson Pop-Tart tasted much better to my mental senses than a cold, not cooked Pop-Tart. We put it in, and he heads back to the living room. I, awaiting for my proverbial 'knight in shining armor' lean against the counter staring down the heated death coils of the toaster, fearing for my snack's life.
