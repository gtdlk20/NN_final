December 1, 2009. Before this day, my perception of drugs were quite misinformed and negative. This was my first time doing any illicit drug of any sort. I had drank alcohol prior but at this point I had never gotten drunk or tipsy. Just to clear up a couple things, I do have Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder and am still currently taking 20mg Adderall XR. This event took place after the medicine wore off though. My mindset was very positive and I expected nothing but good to come from this. (By the way, this is pretty long. Just bear with me. ItÂ’s pretty interesting).
