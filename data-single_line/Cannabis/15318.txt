Previously I had smoked some mild weed without much effect and said to my friend, 'I hope this is worth it'. 'Believe me man! Don't smoke this alone!' he warned. So, I headed home and rolled a fat joint (about a gram), which took some time because I don't toke very often. So then I headed out to the garage. On the way (I don't know what compelled me) I asked my sister if she wanted to join me. To my surprise, she did. Little did we know what the next two hours had in store for us!
