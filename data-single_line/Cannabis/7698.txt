The journey home was by far the most mystical and enlightening trips I have ever had. My roller blades made me feel like I was floating even more. I was hallucinating mildly, but it was all pleasant. I could've been at 4 or 40,000 feet, I didn't know the difference. In my magical mystery land, time had slowed down to a near screeching halt. I recall thinking and feeling that the world was a beautiful place and that everyone was so nice and fragile. All I felt like doing, was making it mandatory for people to smoke a bowl of weed every morning to be put into a good mood. While I was high, I tackled difficult topics (ie. racism, war, meaning of life etc..), don't think for a second that I'm a hippy, but when I'm operating on a different level, I have perfectly logical thoughts pop into my head, that would never occur to me when I'm straight.
