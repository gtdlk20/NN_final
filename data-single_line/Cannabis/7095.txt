Time 2:00 - A couple hours had passed where we were all thinking the cannabis wasn't going to do anything for us; when as we were walking down the street talking, I began to question how I felt.  The trip was starting to come on, and it began to hit me in a deja-vu like form.  It seemed I had a 3-second memory span when I spoke, everytime I spoke the words seemed to reverbatrate in my head and I would find my self saying to my friends 'Did I just say that?'.  Those words would then do the same and so on, in a kind of pyscological paranoia cycle.
