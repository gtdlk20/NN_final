The interesting thing I noticed before and especially that time - is when I closed my eyes or imagined something - it was in cartoon form, and the trip always got more intense than with opened eyes! Damn weird! These imaginations happened and moved not by my will - as it should be - but by themselves - as if independent from me. I never really associated weed with visuals and serious stuff. But that time I saw such effects as in one of those graphic-editing programs - whirl-lense (the image whirls, as if through some lense in small circular or thread-like regions) in different parts of my visual field. Also sometimes I felt as if blood were coming up to the top of my head and I could feel the warmth and heaviness there. But all of it wasn't irritating or scary - but rather pleasant (if not VERY). MANY times I would lick my lip (you know, to wet the lips - sometimes when they get dry) and I could live through that 'lick' over and over for a minute - as if playing a stuck record. And more stuff like that.
