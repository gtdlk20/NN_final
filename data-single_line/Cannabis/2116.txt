This state was so different from any I had been in before that I wondered how (or even if) I could return back to everyday living and perception.  I was wholly overwhelmed by my sudden transformation into this other-dimensional being in a heightened, other-dimensional world.  I decided that I was definitely not living in the same world/life that I had been for as long as I could remember.  My foundation had been shaken; everything that had been constant throughout my life was suddenly adrift except for my steady, subtle unconscious.
