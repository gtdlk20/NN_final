Thoughts occur in a different plane/dimension which modern Science has yet to break into. Dreams are actually Â the journeys of our conscious, sub-conscious and supra-conscious selves into their respective dimensions/planes of existence. We awake with distorted memories of these journeys. The enlightened souls come back with un-distorted memories.
