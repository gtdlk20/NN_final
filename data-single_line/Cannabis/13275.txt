Okeverythings ok here, Im finemy head is hollow, where did my brain go? There it is, behind my eyesare my eyes burning? Its because there are so many colors in this roomeverything keeps bending, and movingbetter stand up, I have to get homewait, I cant stand up, I cant movemy limbs are now a part of the surroundings, and I am a part of his bedroom. Wait, oh yeah, I just smoked some bud, Im just high, thats right, just high....
