When I reached the end of the hall, I realized for the first time that I would have to climb stairs to make it to the water fountain.  That was a strange feeling  especially at the point where the stairs reached a landing and doubled back  but I managed to get to the top.  I got my drink of water and decided to go back to my room and go to sleep.  This weed had really knocked me on my ass  or so I thought.  I got back to my room and it was dark except for two computer screens.  My roommate was watching a DVD on his computer and mine had a paused computer game (Baulders Gate 2, for the curious).  I sat down to turn off the computer and thats when things started to get really weird.
