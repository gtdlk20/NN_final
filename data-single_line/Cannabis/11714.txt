We flipped out. My friend's parents were gone and no one was supposed to be there so we just flipped. None of us even attempted to listen to the entire message; we just left the place with pizzas on the way. As we drove around my friend's neighborhood time was so stretched out. Minutes felt like hours and I was shocked to find out how only 5 or so minutes had passed since we left the house. We passed the pizza guy, who was parked in the neighborhood, 3 times! As it turned out they simply couldn't find the house and were calling for some help. I think this is a great example of the paranoia that weed can sometimes cause.
