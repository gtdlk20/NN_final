We found a good place to skate, but I was too tired to get out of the van. so my friends had to drag me out and set me on the grass. They skated for a while, while I just sat there watching them and laughing about the crazy noises I was hearing. Then a security guard came along and shoed us away. I was careful enough to keep it straight, but it was extemely hard. After that we just drove home and wait a bit till I came down, so then I could tell them my whole story and they could tell me what they thought about it.
