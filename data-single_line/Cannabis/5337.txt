The rest of my experience I didnt record in my journal, but I do remember being set back on the couch, and brought a garbage can to puke in, which did for quite a while. Eventually I was well enough to make it back to room, where I managed to fall asleep, but reality was still slightly flashing when I awoke the next morning. This was the most extreme reaction Ive even heard of someone ever having to weed alone, although I do know of others who have puked from smoking large amounts. I have since become much more experienced with psychedelics in general, and have tripped on at least two more occasions after smoking weed, although these experiences were infinitely more enjoyable, since I was able to recognize them and appreciate them.
