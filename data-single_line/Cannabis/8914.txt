My boyfriend and I bought two weed brownies from a friend of ours for $10 each. I have eaten one of their brownies before and had a pretty average experience that one would have under the influence of cannabis. We both smoke weed a lot so this was just a normal night for us. We planned on just chilling in his room and watching a movie. So we went to his room and ate them around 9:00 pm.
