Finally, my 3 friends and I went to bed after we smoked two more joints of the regs. In the morning, I still felt the odd 'touch-effect' strongly. So we all got up and went for a walk. We smoked 2 more joints of the regs and went to the mall. Being in the mall while high is unlike any other experience I can imagine. The regs didn't give me that scared feeling I had experienced with the dro. I felt happy yet mellow. The whole situation was indescribable. I couldn't control my mind, yet it functioned rationally on its own. When store clerks instructed me to pay, my mind understood. And without thinking (upon reflex or instinct), I would take out my wallet and pay the desired amount.
