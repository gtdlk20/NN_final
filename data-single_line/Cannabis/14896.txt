I was in my room by myself trying to get to sleep.  I had some things on my mind that seemed to bother me, although I couldn't figure out what they were.  After a couple of hours of restlessness I decided 'I need to smoke.'  So I set up my homemade gravity bong using a two liter bottle.  I am usually pretty high after 2 or 3 gravity swats, but by the time I had reached my fourth hit, I wasn't as high as I should have been (I was not on any other medication).  So I started packing bowl after bowl until I realized it had almost become involuntary, and that's when I noticed I was blitzed!
