After that my typing became very hyper... all of the sudden i felt like i had a lot to say, and i had to say it fast.  I made so many spelling errors due to speed and being stoned that my friend kept telling me - your not making sense.  It was all pointless anyhow, and i stepped back from my mind to think about why i was typing fast in the first place.  I had no idea.
