I'm going to tell about my experience smoking cannabis last night (July 5th, 2006) because nothing like it has happened to me before that I can remember. Anyway, a little background. For a span of about 5 years I was a pretty dedicated smoker. All my friends were potheads and I was too. Every day I would hook up with at least one friend and if I didn't have a bag, they did, and we'd smoke up through most of the day. Most of the time it was purely recreational. I didn't think there was anything wrong with smoking every day and still don't as I'm pretty much a kind of 'do whatever you feel like' person. But in the past couple years I've barely smoked at all except very occasionally. I don't know if I just grew disinterested or what but it's rare anymore.
