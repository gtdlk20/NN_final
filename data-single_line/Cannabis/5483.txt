It was night-time and our campsite was right next to the river. We all had lawn chairs set up in a circle around a propane lantern. I started up some weed and was passing it around to a couple other people. During the time that we smoked, we were talking and cracking jokes and just having fun. Everyone else was finished smoking so I finished off two more bowls by myself. Elapsed time: about thirty minutes.
