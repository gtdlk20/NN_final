I looked in the mirror and my face was terrible. My skin was so dry and the whites of my eyes were red and sore. My pupils were almost non-existant. My head felt so heavy and although the rest of me felt weightless. I eventually managed to sleep and in the morning I felt much better although up until mid-day I was feeling lethargic and a bit 'not with it'.
