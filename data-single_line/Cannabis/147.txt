30 minutes have passed now, and the effect is quite strong. Locking the door with the key is a bit complicated, mostly because of my sudden impatience with things. Typing on the keyboard is easy. When I stand up and bend backwards it is like my body will not automatically bend forward again. I have to manually 'step in' and do it or else, I feel, I would get stuck in that position. It is like a lot of the things I normally do unconsciously, have now become manual tasks I have to remember to do. Especially the breathing is annoying.
