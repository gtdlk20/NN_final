Now that delta-9-thc is legal up to 1000mgs in California I decided to try the edible capsule that was filled with precisely 30mg of the plant, including some crystals from the bud.  I have prior experience with 4-Methylethcathinone when it was legal as well as experience with Kratom and alcohol.  I drank a bottle of delta-9-thc infused blanc wine, but that was only 20mgs and the effects were barely noticable... I am 6'3' and 300lbs so that may have contributed to my not feeling much of anything.
