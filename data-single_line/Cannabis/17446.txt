Some incredible effects immediately began to become present. I remember after I smoked it, I was trying to play a video game I enjoyed on the computer, but I noticed I was becoming too sensually agitated and went to sit down in the bathroom. I remember covering my hand, and was starting to shake. The weed had hit me too hard, it was starting to become a very unpleasant experience. I placed my hands on my face, I remember being incredibly high, telling my friend that I had to go to bed, and then went upstairs and lay down.
