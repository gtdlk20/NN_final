The story begins when my brother got back from college for his winter break and had brought back a film canister full of nugs.  His drug of choice had always been alcohol, so he wasn't that reluctant to hand the canister on to me for a small fee.  I gave him a 20, grabbed the canister, and left to pick up a few friends.
