Some time later, while I was being driven home with Jessica and our driver Jen, I started watching the road and feeling like I was on a roller coaster. Every hill we went on, I shot up my arms, yelling 'Wee! It's just like the coasters we went on today!' I am not sure whether or not we were actually going fast, but I am still shocked at my reaction because usually I do not feel as 'tossed around' in normal driving settings as I did then. When I was finally dropped off home, I discovered that I had the munchies and devoured chocolate chips, trail mix, and grapefruit, then went to bed still stoned. My dreams were fitful and different than usual, and I woke up wondering whether I was still stoned or not.
