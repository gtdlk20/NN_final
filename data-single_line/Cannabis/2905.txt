The worst experience I have had occured one normal Friday night.  My roommate and I were sitting around bored and consequently decided to smoke a couple bowls. Shortly afterward , she had to leave to go to work, so I was left by myself.  I have been stoned by myself quite a bit before and have always enjoyed it, perhaps even more than when stoned with other people.  Generally I have a great time listening to music, watching TV, and just thinking.  This time, however, was much different.  Soon after my friend left (probably only ten minutes after we finished smoking) my mind began to race with paranoid thoughts.  I was thinking about how worthless I was and how everyone in the whole world is just some sort of selfish animal.  I was pretty sure I had figured out human nature, but I didn't like the conclusion I came to at all.
