My first dose was on my 13th birthday at 3AM. I was the only one who wasn't drunk, but every time I had gotten drunk at that point I made an ass out of myself, so I wanted to steer clear of alcohol that night. Some of my older brother's friends had the idea to split a joint with me, and I heartily accepted. After 3 hits I was extremely baked. I later found out that my mother was a stoner while pregnant with me as well, so THC had already been introduced into my system years beforehand. I spent the time playing a Prince of Persia game I had received that year, when my ex-druggie brother walked in and asked me how I was feeling. What I was thinking was, 'Pretty good, but my mouth's a bit dry.' whereas what I said was, 'Get the penis outta your bum and start being Jeffrey Dahmer.' I was legendarily baked, and that was clear to my older brother at that point in time.
