The fractal changed constantly, from spider webs, to video-game style 3D cubes, to puzzle pieces, to eyes. When it changed to eyes, that's when it really hit me, like 'cannabis has never had this psychedelic of an effect on me before.' The 'eye in the sky' (as Alan Parsons would say) took on a whole tunnel that led up to the heavens. It was exactly like the DMT art I've seen (ex. Alex Gray).
