The trip to the bathroom was surprisingly normal from what I remember.  Luckily its only two doors down from my room.  I stumbled through the hallway with a slight sense of a rainbow effect from the lights.  I made it to one of the stalls and realized that, along with the nausea, I had what felt like a full bladder.  I might have ignored it except for a vague fear that I might lose all control of bodily functions during another hallucination.  So I stood over the toilet trying my very best to pee.  I dont know how long I stood there, nauseous, trying to piss.  But when I finally did it was in slow motion . . . and musical.  My urine was creating a song as it hit the water in the toilet bowl as if by playing little bells.  Yes, even at the time it seemed weird.  Well I flushed the toilet and switched stalls.  Who wants to stick his head in the bowl of a toilet that hes just pissed in?  I felt as if I would puke any second, but as I knelt, my head in the bowl, breathing hard, I started to notice the way the light was playing off the ripples that my breathing was causing in the water.  My eyes were drawn into the prism, or at least the perceived prism, that was created by the water and the white porcelain beneath it.  Vision seemed to be drawn downward into what, for lack of a better description, I will call a tunnel of light.  If youve ever seen the end of 2001: A space Odyssey, you know what Im talking about.  The only differences were that the apparent speed was much faster and the scene was much brighter.
