As soon as I got in the security line I felt a surge of paranoia. With the recent terrorist attack in Brussels I couldn't help but feel anxious at a major city airport. I could tell that the people around me were nervous as well. Nobody was looking each other in the eye and there was an air of uneasiness. I noticed the keen attention the TSA was giving to people of color. One elderly lady in a hijab was asked to pass through the metal detector three times before she was allowed to proceed. I felt guilty for being afraid. For giving in to the reaction of hate fueled ideologies.
