An intense craving for food hit me and I got so excited. I was thinking 'Oh my God! This is it! This is the munchies!' I could feel my mouth salivating on its own as I imagined drool dripping the ground despite feeling very dry-mouthed, and it felt like I was slobbering all over the place! I tried wiping my mouth with my hand only to realize it's dry. I drank some water and I was so excited because water had never tasted so good!
