I was sitting at the computer chatting with someone right after i had taken it and thought to myself.. it will be 30 minutes or so before this stuff kicks in... so i'll chat for a bit.  Well, 30 minutes rolled around and i didn't feel a damn thing.  I thought.. well shit, its gotta be coming pretty soon!  5 mintues or so after that my friend said something that made me chukle a little. I stretched out breifly & cracked my back and then out of nowhere a feeling came over me.  I started to laugh again at what my friend had said and after what seemed like 2-3 minutes i relized that i was laughing my fucking ass off!  I was laughing so hard i could barely catch my breath.  That time period made me ponder... I thought to myself... Jesus!..  I had laughed for like 3 minutes straight at a comment that wasn't even that funny.  It clicked as though i had forgotten i had eaten the weed 40 minutes ago... ahh i'm stoned now.  I wondered to myself.. I have never had week that hit me so suddenly like that... out of the blue.
