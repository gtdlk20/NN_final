The second 'trip' was much, much nicer, although a little distressing at first.  After the first trip I calmed down a little although I still had this concentrated 'heatedness' in a small area on my left temple, just to the left of the affected eye.  My friend said if was all right and I replied 'I don't know'.  My friend had offered me the pipe after the first trip and I refused, as I wanted to get focused.  However after a few minutes I took the pipe.  This was a mega hit, my friend piled it quite high and he said if it was too much, I thought it was fine, and he gave me the lighter.  Just a few microseconds after I exhaled the smoke, I gently lay myself in the grass, closed my eyes... and just smiled.  After a minute or so of this euphoria I sat upright again, the pain was still there but slightly dulled... it was softer.  My friend was now really stoned, and he was sitting down, the top half of his bodies swaying around in circles under the sun, saying how beautiful the sunrays were.
