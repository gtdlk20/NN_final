Im a good student, make good grades, have never had any trouble with law enforcement (Theyre on my mind a lot now) and am just overall chilling through life. I got into weed late November of senior year and I loved it. I had seen colors and heard music in ways I never thought I could. So here I was, in June, a kid trying to smoke, but I needed friends to do it with. I overheard my friend J (well refer to people as initials) talking about how he can smoke every morning in his garage since his parents dont get home until the late afternoon. The chance to smoke with him, every day, and doing crazy stuff attracted me, so I asked him if I could.
