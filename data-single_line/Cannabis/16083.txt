After about an hour I thought it was time for another bowl. So I smoked one more and layed down on the bed. I felt magnetized to my mattress, like I was becoming one with the bed. I adjusted and then felt like I was in a rubber tube, my muscles contracting and moving to fit through. All the while I hear the warpy echoing music. This went on for about an hour until I decided to go outside. Once outside I felt truly enlightened and amazing. The weather was perfect, and the feel of the breeze against my skin was magnified. I heard a car horn, and the sound repeated itself for a few seconds then faded away. My head was buzzing, along with the vibration of my body. I felt just right.
