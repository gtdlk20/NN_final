Finally it hit me. I didn't really come up, I actually hit the plateau immideately. I first noticed that I was in fact high (at the time I couldn't remember how that  felt and I couldn't actually feel anything, I just knew I was high) I started to remember what pot was usually like, and noticed that I did  not get cottonmouth like I do with the pot I usually smoke, and I had certainly never felt this clear headed after smoking so much (these were huge bowls, I had way more than one or two hits) I decided to stand up, and I noticed a slight swell in my limbs that spread to my whole body. Like I was being filled up with blood. I felt very heavy, I noticed that when I jumped, I only got about three inches off the ground When my jumping was usually about a foot normally and two feet when I am high and it feels like I am flying (It was probly a foot every time, my perception just changed) I eventually at down and let it fade.
