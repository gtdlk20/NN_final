First I was dizzy, then I became nauseous and my friend laughed as she changed the song because I was groaning that the music was making me sick.  Who would have thought you could see music and feel its effects?  Ever since this experience I have better recognized the beauty of music when you are high, though never again have I actually seen the sounds.  Marijuana enhances all the senses though, and on other occasions I have felt lights.  Driving down the highway at night, the streetlamps seemed to stroke my body and the feeling was intense.  In conclusion, marijuana is a wonderful substance that can open your body and mind to otherworldly experiences.
