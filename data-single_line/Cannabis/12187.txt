I decided to turn on some music, so I got online and asked a friend to recommend me a song to download. He's a major fan of techno, so he sent me Ferry Corsten - Rock Your Body, Rock. Listening to this song later while sober, I still like the song quite a bit, but not nearly as much as when I listened to it the first time while high. Most people I talked with who have heard it hate the song.
