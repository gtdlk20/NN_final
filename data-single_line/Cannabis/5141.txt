They told me how close I was to my car, 'it's only a few more steps' but I honestly felt as though I was dying. I could not open my eyes, I could not move, I felt like I was trapped within a withering body and I simply had no energy to do anything but curl up into a ball and puke. I told them 'guys, I can'd do this, please call 911' but they insisted that such a measure was unnecessary. I felt like I was in an anti-drug ad, where all your 'stoner pals' aren't really friends at all, and just want to be high and not get caught. It seemed too real.
