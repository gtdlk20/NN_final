The dark is nice and everyone hisses and rags on whoever turned on the car light, but we all quiet when the pipe comes out, a little blown-glass thing with green stripes. Again, Nick started, the light went out, and we all went back to breathing in the hotboxed fumes. My eyes were glued to John, studying the way he used the pipe--I'd never used one before. But, like before, he was patient and lit it for me and walked me through it.
