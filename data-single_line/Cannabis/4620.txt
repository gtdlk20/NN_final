I knew I wasnt high anymore when I awoke that day but something was still different. It was hard to pay attention and I would often space out in conversation or get lost in thoughts of the events that happend the previous night. It was also kind of a slow day but an excitment/achievement feeling was burning inside me and all I could think about that day was the night before.Little did I know that I, would become a frequent pot smoker. I soon realized how easy it was to get ahold of the magical substance and would smoke much more by myself, with the same friends, and new ones in throught all the years ahead of me to this very day. A great loss was when J and N moved away... but I still kept blazing.
