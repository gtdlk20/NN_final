Its here that my trips stopped, immediately when I got out of the forest the visuals stopped, I had none since.  I was stoned for much of that day, I think I arrived back at home around 3.30 p.m., with the Exam finished at around 11.00 am.  I think the fact that I have had a better experience using a more natural drug to get these trips, rather than a manufactured drug says a lot to me: nature is better than manufactured.  I'm now far more opened up to look at nature in more detail and how it relates to us, and how we relate to it.  I congratulate you on reading all of this :)
