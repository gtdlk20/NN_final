We went back to the yard and smoked the rest.  As I pulled out a bud, my friend examined it and exclaimed 'Dude... This is the beginning of a chronic bud!'  (Wether it was or not, I'm not sure.)  Anyway, I proceeded to take two more hits.  Afterword my mind felt like it was at the peak of a roller coaster, ready to fall down the first hill.  It was a very intense euphoria.  Soon I began to see colors... All I could see was yellow with red specks.  It took me a second or two to regain my vision.  I could hardly mumble '...the colors...', but I managed to.  Jake's eyes appeared to bulge; I said he had buggy eyes.  We passed the pipe around two more times, each time it was harder to actually inhale.  After my ninth inhale, no matter how hard I tried, I could not find the hole in the 'pipe', so my friends determined that I was too fucked up for any more weed.  We then walked in the house and sat down.
