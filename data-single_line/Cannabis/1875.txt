Gathering whatever wits I had left about me, I stumbled into my cublicle grabbing my stuff and hobbled out (normal physical movement was impossible at this point). I met up with my friend outside and immediately he knew something was up (although I was trying my hardest to appear normal on the streets). I got into his car and blurted out something about tripping. He did not believe me at first as he had been doing the hash with me for the last month or so and like me thought it incapable of producing such an effect. He took me to a coffeehouse where I felt I could relax for a while. However, that was a bad idea! All I remember was a huge chandelier and mirrors and this feeling that I was in a movie set. And then I stared at his face and started that manic laughter. It was then he knew that I was not lying. It was the job of a few minutes to convince him to join me (!) and we soon left that place.
