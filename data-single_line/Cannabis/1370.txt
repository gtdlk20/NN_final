T+2:30 I saw my friend A had texted me, so I texted him back and he came and picked me up. I was still very high and as I got dressed and walked out to his car, I was still experiencing the tunnel vision and slow frame-rate I had experienced earlier in the evening. I still experienced occasional vivid minds-eye visuals and had some stereotypical high experiences, such as eating a fuck-ton of donuts and being overwhelmed by the number of batteries on a grocery stores display rack.
