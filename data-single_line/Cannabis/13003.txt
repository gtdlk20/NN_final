I decided to take a walk, as we were walking I notice the sidewalk seems to be melting away with every step, as if it's avoiding my feet, now faces seem to be appearing in the grooves of the sidewalk...I'm fucked!  I look straight ahead and reassure myself that if I act in control, I will be...We get to the store on the corner and everything around me is insignificant, I can't feel I think I said to myself.  We take a shortcut to my house and the trees and train tracks left an erie feeling in the air.
