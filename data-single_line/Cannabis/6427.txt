Both good and bad came out of this experience. It was almost like a real bad trip in some ways because my ego has never been so shattered. I wasn't just humbled, I was humiliated to even be who I am. That was a terrible feeling, but the good thing is that I did end up considering some legitimate issues that I need to work on in order to be more at ease with myself and with the idea of other people knowing me better. My mind is already working out solutions to the problems I was forced to consider last night. It was definitely a learning experience.
