Because Scott and Chris were drunk to boot, we figured it best to get the hell off of that pier.  I remember walking through the woods back to the cabin and seeing a faint chain-link fence between us and the trees, and having to ask my friends if there was a fence, even though I knew there really wasnt.  My first true hallucination off of weed!  I was pretty excited.  By now my head was being bombarded with a constant flux of images and accompanying sounds.  I believe these were images I used to picture when I was very young laying in bed, that I had long forgotten, I cant say why I think this way, but some other part of me was telling me that, and it came across as very convincing.
