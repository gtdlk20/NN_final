That's the chemicals dealt with, now for the character of the individual.  I'd consider myself a little emotionally unstable.  I have, in the past, had a few armchair-psychiatrists - all of which both were and remain my closest friends, and so know as much of the externally perceived 'me' as anyone is ever likely to - offer their diagnoses.  By these I've been suspected of Autism, Schizophrenia, Paranoia, Depression, and Manic-Depression (Bi-polar disorder if you want to be polite; they didn't, which is precisely what I'd wish of my friends).  I should stress that NONE of these have been confirmed by anyone with any official qualifications.  I am also an asocial (NOT antisocial) introvert most of the time, and during my 4-5 week stint I saw only two people (excluding members of my immediate family).
