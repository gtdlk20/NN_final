I finally made it back to the strange castle that the house had become. Upon stepping inside, my world disintegrated into disarray. I found the floor soaking wet, my friend in his jeans crying in the shower. He puked up his mushrooms, although I was convinced it was only pineapples. I tried to help his girlfriend clean up the water but I didnt know what to make of the paper towels I found in the closet. This is when I felt telepathically connected to my friend. He came out of the shower and said 'Can I...' and I got him a towel, then he said 'I need...' and I left him to get dressed while I put his wet clothes on a pile on the floor. I found him lying on his bed, face down, in the dark, silent. I said to him 'Hey buddy...you should think about things, Im gonna be outside' and he didnt answer but I felt him start to concentrate on his problems. I went outside, on the way grabbing a wool blanket, a flashlight just in case, and my wonderful juice. As I was going out the door I explained to my friend's girlfriend that I knew he was going to be ok, he needed to think, and that the light in the ceiling should be turned down a few notches to reset the mood.
