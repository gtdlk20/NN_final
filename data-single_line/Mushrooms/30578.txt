I began to cry intensely. Not just cry, but an intense wailing that came from the very core of my being. I cried for two and half hours straight until almost 3:30am. I cried as if I had absorbed all the pain in the world like a sponge and that I was finally letting it all go. I cried for myself, for the overwhelming sense of achievement I felt in the things that I have done and all of the beautiful memories that I have from the past few years. I wept thinking of the long and hard days I had endured as a plumbing apprentice, a job I hated and yet pushed through for a year and a half, and how that job formed within me a mental toughness that I am grateful for. I cried and wailed thinking of all the people I have been intimately involved with, the people that I am lucky enough to call my friends and experience life with, and how much all those experiences mean to me. I cried for my grandmothers in their old age, knowing that there was not much more time for me to spend with them, and that I need to start making a legitimate effort to see them before its too late.
