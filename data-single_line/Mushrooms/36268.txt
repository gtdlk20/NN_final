When we got back I don't remember what time it was but I ran upstairs and grabbed H to come play frisbee with me.  Now it got interesting.  Becuase the sun was going down and the field was lit by several bright lights from the dorms.  The lights were so bright with long trails coming off of them.  I was feeling better and was excited to be playing outside in the dark.  Since all the daylight was gone I started to see things.  I saw rings of color around the clouds and when I dropped the frisbee I saw 'I LOVE YOU' on the ground in beems of light.  I said 'Hey cool!' to H and stopped the game for a minute to try to explain how I was feeling.  I couldn't find the words to express myself and I managed something like this 'There's just so much going on inside my head man, I can't explain.'
