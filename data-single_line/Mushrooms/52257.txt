When we got inside, Carl decided to go and have a shower.  I sat down and talked to Dave and Norris.  Something strange was happening to me and I started to feel very intense. I started to feel very intense.  I started to railroad the conversation and for about twenty minutes neither Dave nor Norris said a word.  They just sat on the edge of their seats and listened, interested in everything I was saying.  I cant remember for the life of me what I was talking about but it was surprising cause Dave isnt the kind of guy who will sit quietly for twenty minutes listening to anyone.  At that point Carl came out of the shower, which knocked me out of it.  I realised how long I had been ranting, so I shut up.  At this point, though, I was realising how powerful the mushrooms might be.
