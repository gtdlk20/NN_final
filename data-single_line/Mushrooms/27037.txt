The weird song carried me off to a place that I have trouble putting into words. I remember it was dark but I didnt feel like I was expecting to have light. It felt as if I was ignorant of light's existence. I was in a place and I was not mentally present my mind was adrift with those residual negative feelings leading the way. I remember feeling incredibly overwhelmed by what was going on. I had loads impressions thrown at me that I cant even fathom. They werent emotions or thoughts, or actual physical sensation or something you could hear or look at but they were all those things at the same time and they were none of those things at the same time.
