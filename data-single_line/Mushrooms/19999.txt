It was a Friday just like any other, and after a relatively uneventful day at school that entailed a moderate level of pot smoking, I began preparing for my second mushroom trip. Several days prior, I had given my room a thorough and decidedly tasteful cleaning, so as to create a comfortable, clean environment in which to voyage the psychedelic skies. The rest of the evening, then, was for the most part spent idling in my room, watching the hours slowly crawl by. Around 7:00PM, I ventured out to the local bookstore with the intention of reading segments of books describing and glorifying the psychedelic experience (mostly works by Leary, but some others as well). When I came home, I first became aware of a growing and seemingly uncontrollable sense of apprehension and anxiety. My previous, and insofar only, mushroom trip had, for all its mystical wonder and and sense of discovery, been somewhat of a five hour long nightmare that had been anything but enjoyable. Nonetheless, I was determined to overcome my anxieties and master the psychedelic experience, but what I had in resolve I lacked in confidence. Deep inside, I felt as though a catastrophic nightmare of a trip was awaiting me, and felt a sense of helpnessess in the back of my mind. Still, I knew there was no turning back, and was determined as ever to face my demons.
