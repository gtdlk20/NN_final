A fucking interdimensional cicada baby or something latched onto me and took over my head. A fucking interdimensional cicada baby or something latched onto me and took over my head. I felt it all... The antennae, the little hair things that wiggle where your nose would be. Then they started to COMMUNICATE through me. The language was like this: Different pressures of air going in and out of each nostril at different times and frequencies, the "antennae" areas would literally wiggle in my head, sucking in air through my nose like its trying to clear mucus sounding like click because it wasnt just in it would do something similar outward like trying to push out mucus, then that same yawning pressure would be used consistently.
