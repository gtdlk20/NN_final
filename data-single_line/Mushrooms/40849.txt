Anticipating a long come-up (as by this time we had tried this batch several times) Andy and I ate our goodies at 8:15pm and hoped to start peaking near the beginning of the movie at 10:00. Since to us licking an old shoe is more appealing than chewing up shrooms I decided to pulverize them to a dust and fill empty gel capsules so we could just swallow them like pills. (A lengthy process but well worth as I hate the taste.) I took 12 capsules equaling about 2.5 grams then tossed back a beer with another 2.5 grams of powder before we headed out. Andy took 12 capsules.
