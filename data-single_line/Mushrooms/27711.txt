At some point I noticed that my head seemed to be lolling to the left without my conscious control. Perplexed, I found that I could not keep my head centered without effort.  Eventually I let my head turn, and in doing so my eyes immediately came to rest on a large cactus I had placed on the coffee table beside the sofa.  An amusing thought came to me that it was trying to get my attention, so I slid down to the end of the sofa - and out of the direct sun - to see what the cactus wanted.  I felt like I had just noticed for the first time someone who'd always been there.  I cooed to her a bit, then mentally asked what she wanted.  Just then I noticed, almost to an exaggerated degree, how cold and dark it was at that spot.  This seemed to me like an explicit request...the cactus wanted to be moved closer to the window and bask in the direct sun!  Without hesitation I lugged her (all 50 pounds) into the light and sat down with my arms around the pot.  For what seemed like hours I sat with her, fascinated by her thorns and sturdy limbs, carefully brushing off dust and even singing to her (which it seemed she also requested).  I sensed that she was very ancient, and she reminded me that I too was ancient.
