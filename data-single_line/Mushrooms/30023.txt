After a few minutes I stepped on something sharp and picked my foot up to see if I was bleeding.  Staring at my foot in the moonlight, colorful patterns emerged across my skin and tried to hypnotize me, but I couldn't see any injury.  Speaking aloud to myself I said 'My foot, while awesome, is fine.' and this immediately seemed so funny that I collapsed in laughter.  I laughed at what I'd said, then laughed at how hard I was laughing.  I began to hyperventilate, and I kept it going intentionally when I realized what I was doing.  I sat there, naked on the asphalt, at 2am, staring up at the full moon breathing as fast and as deep as I could.  My back and chest began to tingle from oxygen deprivation.
