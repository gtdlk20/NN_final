We both awoke at around 7am and began to ready ourselves for the day out, showers, good breakfast, etc. By 8am our friend C and her boyfriend P arrived to pick us up for the journey to the park. We arrived at approximately 10am, parked up the car and took the monorail to the parkÂ’s main entrance. By now we are both very excited about the trip ahead of us, the car ride had given us a chance to relax into the day and bond with C and P who would essentially be our sitters while we tripped. To get to know this new unfamiliar surrounding we let ourselves take a few rides to get a feeling for the day ahead. After riding the Oblivion (vertical drop rollercoaster) we both began to feel a little uneasy about what we were about to embark on. We took some time to make a final decision and then at about 12pm we mixed the stones in with a yogurt and spooned the unassuming truffles into our eagerly awaiting bodies.
