Unlike the times I had done it before, which were all at night, my two best friends #1 and #2, and #1s girlfriend (GF) and I had my house to ourselves for the day, so we took them around 9:00 in the morning.  We sat on my front patio just chilling and talking while we waited for them to kick in. It should be noted that I live in the south, and this is happening during spring time when it doesnt take much to be amazed at the abundance of life everywhere.  As the shrooms slowly took their effect, I became amused with all of the leaves on the trees gently flickering in the breeze.  As I was staring at them, a large gust of wind came. As the leaves all rustled in unison, and the trees swayed back and forth, I felt like I was being tickled in my stomach, but instead of muscle tension and laughter being the result, I felt like I was injected with pure joy that ran through all of my veins.
