I do believe that marijuana is the only drug that Ive abused too recklessly. I know there are a lot of people out there who flat-out refuse to believe thats possible, and part of the beauty of the drug is that its not chemically addictive like so many others. Even I dont worry too much about addiction anymore, even though I continue to smoke daily. Ive taken breaks, up to a year at a time at some points. I feel like Ive grown up a lot since my time in college, when I insisted on having drugs every day. Thats still the way I prefer to live my life, but now if I dont have the drugs, I just accept it and make do without. Embrace the darkness, and face the demons.
