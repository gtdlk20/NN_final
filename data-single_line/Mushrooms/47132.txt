As we decided to walk back to campus, we were all silent, but thinking the same thing.  This experience was something that we would hold dear to our hearts, and the world just wasn't the same.  It's very hard to go from a natural environment where everything is silent and serene, to the bustling world that we are forced to live in.  It wasn't the greatest feeling, but I was able to accept it.  Out of all the things that I 'understand' while I'm on this fungi, one thing I could not figure out was the problem of self and no self.  It's the toughest question to answer, and I believe it still doesn't have an answer.  Maybe I'll take a full 1/8 next time and find out. :)
