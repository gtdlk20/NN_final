(T+2:00) I try to watch a bit of TV to grab onto reality, which was sneaking away from me, but it didn't help.  I loose my concentration and the people on the television begin speaking like a severely warped LP.  I can't control my thoughts, fear creeps over me.  There's ominous music in the air.  IÂ’m lost in the darkness.  Am I going to leave this place, or am I locked in?  Did I offend God?  Help me! Let me out! PLEASE!
