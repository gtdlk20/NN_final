My trips ever since the frog in the bathroom have been themed with lizards/amphibian characters.  Not bad if you love animals.  If you are reasearching good trips and bad trips, I would say that it was wonderful.  I have never experienced anything like it.  I'm glad I drank some water when I was taking the shrooms, it seemed to help me wash down the taste and keep me relaxed.  It was also a good idea to do it in a comfortable surrounding (it helped having the rest of my family gone), and having someone around who has experienced it before for comfort reasons.  Stay safe and have a good trip!
