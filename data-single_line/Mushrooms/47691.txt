After about 20 mins I was getting strange feelings in my stomach, kind of like when I am about to make a speech in front of loads of people and I'm not sure if I feel sick or not. This feeling would come and go every couple of minutes or so. The first sign I had of something was happening was the cracks in my crazy paving slowly moving forwards and backwards in time with my breathing. I looked at Dillan and he had huge pupils and a big smile on his face. I looked across my garden and I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. I could see every leaf and blade of grass around me in such fine detail. The grass was seperating into layers and flowing like waves in the sea. The hedges were stretching out towards the grass and swaying in time with every breath. I felt like the inside of my body was a thick warm liquid and my arms were melting and dripping off the end of my fingers. I couldn't stop yawning and every yawn was nicer than the last. I suggested we went inside so we went up to my room.
