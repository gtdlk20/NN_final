After a few minutes I felt the shrooms wearing off, so I suggest we roll another zig, my friend rolled 6 for us, 2 each.  He began our journey out to my friends barn, we all stopped out side the doors of the barn and started in amazement.  The barn was gigantic growing as we spoke, it looked bout 50 ft high in the air.  A bit scared we entered the second floor of the barn, and lit the candles, as I begun to smoke the zig, I became very buzzed and felt the best I had all night very warm and happy.
