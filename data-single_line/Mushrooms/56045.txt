The moment of madness was crowned by a situation when my friend went to take piss outside and I stayed inside the cottage, we still had the mental link and for my moment of alone I started thinking something in silence (that I dont remember what it was) but for a weird way my friend recalled from my thought something his father used to say... and I said it out loud... (dont remember what it was), it was multidimensional humor where I found it funny that to my mind there was no connection with my thoughts and what his father used to say and by the fact that I said it out loud what my friend though about my thoughts, in a situation where we had this conversation without any words but those few that I said out loud. (my friend could not see me but he could hear me) We started shouting, screaming and laughing again in a mad telepathic trance state.
