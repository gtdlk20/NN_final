Briefly, we all got in one room and once again the energy level spiked, slightly overwhelming Phil. Trance blared on a massive surround-sound system, and a minute of joyous dancing reminded me how much I wanted to rave again. Then Phil began demanding more shrooms, saying he wanted it to last longer. I asked him if he was sure, then gave him my last cup of tea, which I was going to flush down the toilet anyway. I saw him a minute later with a mouthful of dried mushrooms from his or someone else's stash, but Phil was happy and in control. However, I knew the tea had not yet kicked in and he was setting himself up for one hell of a ride. In the kitchen where I was getting a glass of water, he confronted me and asked to buy my remaining mushrooms. I refused, and he began to struggle with me to get it out of my hand. In order to avoid a physical escalation which would pit him against us and possibly ruin a few people's night, I relented and handed it over. Me, Walt, and Pete then hounded Phil to give it back, and we eventually got our wish, although Phil had already eaten some and we seemed to have made him visibly depressed. Later I ascertained that this was when the drugs truly began taking hold of him.
