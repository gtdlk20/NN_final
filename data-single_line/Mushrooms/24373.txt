People started to get up to leave, which didn't bother me until my man said 'Well, I'm going to go now.'  I felt uninvited, which made me think about how everyone else left.  I felt like I was the outcast, and that did not feel good.  So I again began to be quiet.  Now it was just me and my friend in the room.  I was not talking at all, which probably made my friend feel awkward, since she was trying to talk to me while I was just sitting there staring at her.  She asked if I was okay, so I nodded, got up, and sat down at a chair.  This overwhelming feeling of forgetfulness washed over me and I inquired 'Hey, do you know if I was supposed to do something right now?'  My friend told me no, and reminded me of plans we had that night.  I didn't want to talk about it, so I remained unresponsive.  I realized that I was weirding her out, and that made me feel bad about myself, so I got up and went into my room.
