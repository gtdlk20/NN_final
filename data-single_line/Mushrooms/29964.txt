A delicious aroma greeted us; Albus was cooking. To my relief, inanimate objects in the cluttered living room had stopped crawling, though the sensation persisted in my periphery. The sight of a clean counter and washed dishes nearly moved me to tears. Albus was more than a trip sitter, he had taken on the role of Papa Bear with pride. Wes and Manny were already chowing down on sausages hed grilled to perfection. A recurring mushroom theme for me seems to be gratitude; on a trip comedown, I feel so grateful for the simple things in life often taken for granted, such as food and drink.
