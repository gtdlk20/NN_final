The recurring feeling I felt was that it wasn't something to be messed around with, and all of the questions of the universe could never be answered but we can only better understand our place.  Also I heard from the being that those who dont use their brains, will with time lose the ability to access the being and, will thus lose the point of doing mushrooms.
