My friend Brad and I agreed we would take it one evening when I purchased 7 grams from a friend.  We would split it right down the middle, having been told that an eighth ounce is required for a sufficient trip.  I was also told that consuming them with orange juice, or vitamin C would enhance the colors and give a brighter feel to the experience.  So at midnight on the button we chomped down many dry caps and stems and washed it all down with a tall glass of orange juice.  The kinds of things that happened after this I wouldnt have believed if God himself told me they would happen.
