As soon as I got into the room I felt joyous, there was music, there were my best girlfriends, and everything was good.  One of my friends had her friends from home up and I made sure to tell them what I was doing.  We chatted, and as we chatted, I started my eventual trip inside my body.  I was sitting in a chair, and I had the urge to roll into the corner, so I did.  I stayed there for a while until someone said 'Hey, why are you all the way over there?', so I got up to move to the bed.  On my journey to the bed, my friend offered me a ritz cracker.  It seemed completely ridiculous that someone would be offering me a ritz cracker, I mean, what the hell were they thinking?  I got to the bed, and when I sat down, a few more people came in.  It was one of my good friends with her latest boy-on-a-leash, who was pretty shy.  Then came in my man and the other boys just coming back from my room.  I wanted desperately to go outside and walk around with my man, maybe even go to the museum, but soon I was unable to move, and feeling pretty damn embarassed that I was sweating so much.
