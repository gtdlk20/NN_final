Anyway, I'm sure there is much more I cannot remember, but I tried to do the best I could, there was definitely some high +3 occasions (such as the personality thing) during this trip, and I'd say the rest of the trip was a modest +3/+2. I absolutely enjoyed myself to the highest extent, and hope to soon repeat the experience.
