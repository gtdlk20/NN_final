Now I couldnt see anything. I banged my fist against the wall.  Get me out of this incubator! Get me out of this calamity, I yelled.  John opened the door and I toppled out of his closet. How did I get there?  Back on the balcony I saw an orange lion come trotting my way. It leaped into the air where it suspended itself, as if god picked up his remote control and paused the entire world. I turned looking through the sliding glass door and the scene of my friends kicking back in the living room was frozen. John was in the middle of throwing a pack of cigarettes to Fat Chad, and Duddey just sat there stuck in his own realm. It seemed as if time action stopped.  Smash his clock, the lion communicated to me telepathically.  Now I couldnt see anything. I banged my fist against the wall.  Get me out of this incubator! Get me out of this calamity, I yelled.  John opened the door and I toppled out of his closet. How did I get there?  Look what you did to my clock Ethan, John said angered as he handed me a battered clock.  But, you were stuck, the lion... I tried to explain.  Damn E, you are out there arent you, John retaliated.  I dried off from my shower, put my clothes back on and strolled into the living room to see what was going on.
