 M and I got up and walked towards the bathroom. On the way I was noticing how everything around me had the potential to turn on me, and turn my amazement and wonderment to sheer terror. I checked my thoughts, knowing the wrong one could instantly turn everything wrong. Every time I looked at M her face assumed impossible proportions, huge eye, spiral face. Then we decide to walk back to my house. The walk over was intense, I was seeing double and I could tell things were moving on their own. Whenever I tried focusing on anything, there was a lag and it seemed as if I was looking at a 3-D picture without the glasses on. Finally reaching my house, my entire room was pulsating. I picked up my guitar and played, the strings felt alien underneath my fingers, the music reverberated in my soul.
