I was now getting more and more nervous since my last experience with LSD was the first time I experienced loss of reality, and when it happened I got into a panic state and thought I have got a psychosis or something. Really terrible. Anyway, I subconsciously thought that this would happen again, but now on shrooms instead. This only got me more nervous. Really nervous.
