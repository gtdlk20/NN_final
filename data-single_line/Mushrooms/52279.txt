The next half-hour or so was an extreme adventure.  I was experiencing the world in a way I never had before, and what a world!  We had ended up right in the middle of the main entertainment district of Amsterdam.  We quickly lost interest in the fire jugglers, and started wandering through the streets.  I can only remember a bit of the next half an hour or so.  I remember lots of lights and colours, people sitting outside eating, drinking and smoking.  I saw other people who had looks on their faces similar to what mine must have been.  Big wide pupils, and expressions of confusement, contentment or bewilderment.
