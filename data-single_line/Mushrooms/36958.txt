When I left the forest, the overcast day had changed to a beautiful sunny day that I just couldnt help soaking up.  Upon arriving back to the bungalow, I realized that I had just walked into the presence of mad people.  My brother-in-law was laughing strangely and my wife was acting like a child.  I tried in vain to both find the mosquito spray and to talk to them.  I felt really frustrated at this point and a bit paranoid that the employees at the national park would know we were taking drugs, which they probably did in the end, given the fact of the hysterical laughter and also my brother-in-law screaming loudly as if he was a monkey.
