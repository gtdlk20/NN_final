Using the mushroom I could remember as far back to some traumatic event in my life. Once that event was remembered I could remember further back. So I started at 5 Â½ and worked backwards. It was amazing how the mushroom worked. It was like playing a tape of my life except when I press play I jumped into the scene and I was there! It was like traveling back in time.
