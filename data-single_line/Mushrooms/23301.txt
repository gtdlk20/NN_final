Movement is becoming far more enjoyable. Touch has become my most influenced sense. I leave the computer room (now declared the safe room) by gliding along the floors on my belly. Wanting to test how astounding things that normally take away my breath are now. I go to read a passage from Atlas Shrugged but the cat is causing trouble (Im distinctly aware she is not part of the trip.) I put her outside. Focus starts to become difficult. It seems most any new circumstance becomes the most important one. The importance seems to be in the immense enjoyment in any task I undertake. As far as I can tell, the drug is inhibiting the signals that would normally fire away to state;  (1) This is a book, (2) you got it from the library at the school thats (3) full of complainers, drama, and teachers demanding passes. (4) This book has inspired you and these are the characters inside in it etc. etc. Now it was just a book, and all I knew was that overall I loved it. The expectations formed from precedent were slipping away.
