	Eventually we heard the river before we saw it and with yells of glee broke into a run.  We climbed off the road and suddenly found ourselves on the banks of the small mountain river.  It was amazing to us, flowing continuously with life and power.  We explored our surroundings in wonder.  Not really knowing why, and with un-verbalized consent, we stepped carefully on smaller rocks and made our way to a large Rock in the middle of the river, where we layed down.  There the real fun began.
