About 5 minutes after eating the shrooms, we took off and drove to Cody's house where we parked the car for the night. We chilled in his room for a while... listened to some nice smooth psychedelic music, and anticipated the results of the mush. I played resident evil 4 for a while, and I had started to notice that Cody and Jessica were getting really giggly, Jess more so than Cody. I kept saying, 'this sucks. I'm immune to shrooms. blah blah blah.' so I took about another 2 grams over the course of half and hour. Finally, I came to the conclusion that maybe my unbreached focus on kicking some spanish-cult ass was taking away from the effects, so I turned off the game and let my mind go free. Fortunately, my hunch was right, because about 10 minutes after leaving Cody's house to walk around outside, the trip hit me like a ton of bricks.
