It was near the end of the summer after my senior year of college, and I had important decisions about life to make:  whether to stay around school and risk getting tied down or to move West and bum around for a while.  It was one of my last weekends with my friends from school, and I was faced with the ire of saying 'Have a good life' to dozens of my closest friends.  Still, I had a positive outlook about life, and I was having a shitload of fun just existing cut off from my parents, working and supporting myself for the first time.  After a summer of trying futilely to get away and do some drugs with friends, my friend Syph snagged some shrooms.
