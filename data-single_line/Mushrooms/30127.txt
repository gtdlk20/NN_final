Suddenly we could hear faint echoes of a loud P.A. system, wafting up the mountain from below.  It was dialogue, layered above that iconic Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western gunslinger sound-track theme, which plays whenever Clint Eastwood shoots somebody in A Fistful of Dollars.  I knew full well in my mind that this was coming from the staged train robbery for the tourists below, but echoing faintly across the distance, it sounded to me as if all the words were in Spanish!  Logos agreed, and I replied Oh yes, weve been in Mexico for some time now.  Logos burst out laughing, and I spotted the perfect rock, level and well sized, for sitting on.  I needed to sit down, and so I did.  I suddenly saw well across the valley below with perfect clarity two tiny deer coming out from the forest and looking up at us, responding to my mental commands to come out and show themselves.  I explained to Logos Look!  We are Naguals!  Logos did not know what I meant, having no familiarity with Carlos Castaneda and his encounters with the Yaqui sorcerer Don Juan Matus (which surprised me). I explained a little bit about Don Juan and his Apprentice -- and my feeling that in this eternal Moment, where all paths and times and experiences converge, that part of us which were Gnostic Bishops were also elsewhere as Sorcerers in Mexico, a kind of magical linkage that defied traditional categorizations of separateness.  We decided we would explore leveraging that connection to see what power or wisdom it might reveal.
