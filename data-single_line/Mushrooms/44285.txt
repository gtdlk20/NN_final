I felt like the Buddha, I felt like a prophet.  I was Marlow telling my friends what it was like to know the essence of good and evil.  I was God, God was me.  Everything instantly made sense.  The lights were flashing, the music playing, but all of that was background now.  I had found my groove and was sticking to it, and I had brought three others into my own spiritual space with me.  Not sex, not love, not death has ever given me such an epiphany.  For four hours I just sat there, drawing the positive energies of three other people into my realm.  I knew that this is what God must feel like when people are praying to him.  I was sapping up the love and good feeling that the others felt for me.  I was the embodiment of US.
