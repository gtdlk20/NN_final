I first noticed that the blinds over the windows were shifting, and the shag carpet seemed to be rising to flood the room. From there I was thrown into a different world. I watched a painting on the wall of a forest and a river shift and change, and the light in the painting seemed to be truly shining. I noticed light everywhere, and colors and stars, and everything shifted constantly. I made a journey to the hallway, because at the end of it was a room with a bright pink blanket that I wanted to explore. This was a house belonging to a friend's grandmother who was not home, and I had only been there once before. As I walked down the hall I stopped short. There was a painting of me on the wall. It seemed to be speaking to me, not allowing me to pass it. The weird thing is, this was not a hallucination, but there really was a picture that looks exactly as I see my face, of me. My friend bill came and saw it, and freaked out. We watched me for awhile, and then he somehow thought it was right to take the drawing/painting/photo (im honestly not sure what it really was) off the wall and into the living room.
