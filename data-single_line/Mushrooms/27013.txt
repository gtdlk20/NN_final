I started to have some introspective thoughts about my life and my relationships with other people, and I slowly veered away from my formal meditation. I laid down on my stomach deep in thought about myself. I realized, more or less, that I create who I am to other people and I create who I am to myself. I saw that I am only an idea to me and that I am only an idea to anyone I have ever met. The only real attachment I have to my name, my friends, my favorite music, the things that I find sexually attractive, etc., are supplied by me and my own mind. I make the decision everyday of how to dress, how to speak, what to say and, what to do based on needs that I have.
