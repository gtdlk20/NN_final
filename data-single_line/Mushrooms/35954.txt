J started tripping very quickly, he has very high metabolism and it only took about 20-30 minutes at the most for them to kick in.  Me, I took a lot longer and was starting to think I may not even trip.  But, after an hour or so, I started feeling it.  We were not sure what to 'do', so we just sat in the back room where we smoke, and figured we would see what we wanted to do when we were tripping good.  J was feeling so good he didn't care what music I put on, so I put on my three favorite mushroom tripping CDs (Radiohead's 'The Bends', Coldplay's 'Parachutes', and Tori Amos's 'To Venus and Back'), in that order.  We listened to Coldplay and Tori twice in a row.
