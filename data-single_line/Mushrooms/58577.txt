I then go into a state in which I wouldn't call sleep, but almost nodding out, coming to every once in a while. At this point I'm having OEV's, seeing stars everywhere, especially on the carpet, and the closed eye visuals are just unexplainable at this point as well. I remember at one point 'waking up' only to find myself still in this nodded out state, which instead of freaking out, I just tried to enjoy and mess with the visuals I was creating/seeing. Eventually I came back to what you'd call reality, but it wasn't much of a reality to me at this point.
