I put the spliff out, the mind loops are beginning to subdue me, and that's when the feeling set in, the feeling I only had on my last big dose, the feeling I've been preparing for. I was disconnecting from everything, I was shot out of my body, the fear set in as soon as I realized I was not in control again, this was it, I was dieing. There was no darkness, the visuals were so overwhelming, something straight out of an Alex Grey painting. I was trying so hard to just let the mushrooms take me but the thoughts came back from the last trip , I was so worried I was going hurt myself or someone else if I did not gain control soon.  I looked at the clock, what seemed to be days in this hell was only 5 minutes. I was in for a long ride. every now and again I would find myself again and I could hear a voice in my head saying 'just ride it out', and I think I heard my name at some point, which brought me back for a slight second. I was flying through some hyperspace, 'I' being I don't know. I physically was not to be found. it was like a bad dream, but suddenly I would find myself again , and everything calmed down , everything almost came to a complete stop. then boom! I was off again lost in what I thought was my room.  I kept thinking to myself that this was a bad dream and everything would come-to soon enough. Found the most comfy spot in my bed and huddled up to get nice and cozy.
