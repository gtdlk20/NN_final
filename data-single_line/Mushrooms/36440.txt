T+1.5hrs Other friends have come up to join us, and we all sit in the room talking, listening to music, and enjoying ourselves. I lie down on the floor next to vent, feeling the warm air pouring out, and it feels like it's flowing into me like energy, I keep putting my hand to it to feel the warmth directly, as if I could pick it up and hold air.
