For the next 30 minutes or so I was 'going up' to where I would eventually plateau.  I started to feel nearly euphoric, and the 'energy' in my torso intensified.  Also, I felt a tingling sensation on the back of my neck around the base of the skull.  I remember getting a couple of sticks of incense from somewhere and walking around twirling them in front of my face.  It was a nice smell / visual effect.  RP came looking for me and we went back over to the music area and sat on a blanket.  The symmetrical tapestries that I had mentioned before were rippling in the wind, and seemed very odd.  RP told me to look at one of them up close.  The one I chose was very colorful with some winged cat-like creatures on them.  They seemed to be breathing...porous almost.  The eyes of the creatures were solid black circles, and they looked as if they were pulsating...or beating like a heart, or maybe gyrating at a ludicrous speed.  And the tapestry in general seemed to be very alien.  It probably had something to do with the black light.
