After arriving late at night, we waited until the next afternoon to eat them.  There was a threat of some showers in the morning, but by lunch the skies were blue, warm, and sunny.  We were hoping to catch some stars at the tail end of it eating them at around 4:00, but we had to be leaving that night for a 2 hour drive, and just before 2:00 my friend Clock said 'We're wasting a beautiful afternoon.  Let's go.'
