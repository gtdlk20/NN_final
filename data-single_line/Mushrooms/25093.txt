In about 15 minutes I felt the shrooms slowly kick in I was in a perfectly happy mood since our room had an excellent view of the Strip and I had the room to myself since my friends went to eat dinner. I just sat and stared out the window feeling amazing bliss and in another 15 minutes I was trippin to the flouresent colors that Vegas provides.
