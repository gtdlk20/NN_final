I will start by saying that this report is largely about my experience with having to deal with my boyfriend's trainwreck of a trip (we'll call him 'Ace' for the sake of this report) while both of us were on mushrooms. I am known for having a great ability to keep my cool on any sort of substance I've done and definately had to pull out all the stops on this one. Both Ace and I are fairly experienced users of MDMA, cocaine, LSD, and marijuana. He had never tried mushrooms before and I had done them only twice with pretty fun results both times.
