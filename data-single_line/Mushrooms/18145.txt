The mushrooms effect was only increasing:  I realized that these shrooms were much stronger than the ones that I had been getting the few prior trips. I was amazed by the beauty of the scenery, sun shimmering on the water, beautiful beach and cliff running along the water for as far as I could see.  I kept gesticulating in all encompassing sweeps of the arm at the beauty that was almost too much for me. Look at that sky!  Can you believe that goddamn sky!  How can we possibly deserve that? I asked several times. Eventually, I felt I needed to just lay in the sand and lose it like I have only lost it once before:  it was time to shirk language and constructive conscious thought, to revel in my mad mindset and explore the maniacal realm of ego loss.
