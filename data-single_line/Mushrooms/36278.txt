After that we just went upstairs and watched TV as I came back to normal over the next hour.  I felt very tired and out of it after the experience but since it was a Saturday night I began drinking at 9pm and partied the entire night with my friends.  I felt very pleasent the rest of the night and was glad that I tripped during such a nice day.  I will do shrooms again but only on a nice day when I can be outside with friends and enjoy the experience with someone else who's tripping.
