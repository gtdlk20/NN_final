T would still not turn off the light so we began to get very mad at him. He started pacing around the room and said he was going to tell the world about what we were doing. He started to walk upstairs so I ran after him and held him down on the matress. He began to get scared that aliens were going to kill him. I held him and told him I would protect him. His heart was beating so fast that I began to worry he might have a heart attack. He was alright though. I told him that he needed to just lie down for a second and relax. He agreed. By now we were all happily tripping again, and we felt so connected to one another. We decided to leave the light on and try to sleep a little. It was impossible. A million thoughts were running through my head, but there was a period of silence for about an hour where we just reflected upon our lives.
