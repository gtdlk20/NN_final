10:20pm - This was the highlight of the trip.  My girlfriend rolled over and we started looking into each other's eyes.  The experience is incredibly intense and acts like a series of experiences that each seem to last a really long time but in actuality only last a very short time.  Within her eyes, I see the oceans folding out with the moon sitting above them.  Then I see them from outside of earth and they become the entire earth and we realize that we are each other's worlds.  The order of what happened next isnt important but what happened was.  I followed the lines of her face up through her forehead as they rose into this shining blue temple with an eye right above her hairline at the top of the temple.  A blue spinning cloud surrounded the eye.  This faded away as I stared into her eyes again.  She collapsed and started crying and explaining how she felt her body disintegrate and breathe out into me.  I tried to accept her life into my own and felt her become my soul and fill me from the inside and overflow out my eyes in tears of joy.  We stared into each other's eyes again trying to pass our souls and lives to each other and the world disappeared.  We slipped out into space and felt not as two people but as one traveling through the galaxy.  We whisked through beaches and stars and spun in each others arms in the heavens.  We came back and there was sand or salt in her bed and it seemed totally believable that we had brought it back with us.  This entire experience seemed to have lasted an eternity.  I felt like I had known my girlfriend for lifetimes and just experienced the death of time with her.  The whole experience actually lasted only 2 minutes!
