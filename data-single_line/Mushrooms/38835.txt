Meanwhile time stood still, the total experience lasted about 3 to 4 hours with a long tail after that with the inability to speak, awe, the usual giggling and uncontrollable laughter. I kept looking at the clock but it always showed me the same time. I knew time had passed because I had the concert on video as chronological time. The music of the concert was very clear and chronological which was a very nice reference to consensus time. I had means of measurement for my jumping out of time consciousness and perception.
