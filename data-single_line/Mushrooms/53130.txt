Descriptions of experience have been given by all 4 people present, and I think this shows nicely how individual tolerance to the drug and mental set can change a trip's character even when the dosage and the setting are identical. For example, note how the weather outside was 'beautiful' to Ei and 'pristine' to J, but only 'a little strange' to Ea and positively 'dreadful' to K. Similarly, the effect of the music was interesting, with some people concentrating on it entirely and for others it being just background.
