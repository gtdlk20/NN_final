At some point, the normal endorphin trip that I experience while swimming and the mushroom trip merged, and my suspicions that they had always been one and the same were confirmed.  The swirling colors that I see while I swim were the same that I saw on the mushrooms.  ItÂ’s just that the endorphin trip during swimming is generally less intense.
