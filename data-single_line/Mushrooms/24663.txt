Walking past the residential houses, some of them with people in the yards, most of them with dogs, was very difficult.  We had to walk in close proximity, so I kept some chatter about my sunglasses going for about ten minutes, hoping the neighbors wouldn't catch on.  They didn't, and we made it back to the house, with dificulty.
