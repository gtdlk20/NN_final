During this eureka moment my friend L had sparked a joint.  I took a few smooth puffs of the joint and watched as the smoke rose and danced its way towards the ceiling.  The smoke had upgraded into high definition.  My consciousness lost connection with all else other than watching the smoke swift and swirl into majestic patterns of flexibility.  At this point the visuals came on very strongly.  I looked at L and I swear it seemed I had complete x-ray vision; I was able to see the fine details of Ls jawbones. R was silent and he remained silent for the whole trip.  Im not kidding, we sat for about 6 hours and he did not utter a word until we both got in a cab to leave.  He would later tell me his experience was intense and generally very positive.  He didnt give a coherent answer as to why he remained silent throughout the trip.
