About 1 1/2 hrs into the experience (my time sense was working fine, though it seemed like it wasn't - e.g. Thinking 'it feels like it's about 2:00 now, but that's probably not right... [check watch] no, it is in fact 2:06.') I began to experience visual hallucinations. When I turned my head more than about 45 degrees, I experienced 'skips', like an mpeg movie at a low frame rate, or sometimes trails instead. I had slight auditory hallucinations, like someone whispering indistinctly in my ear, or music from far away that I could barely hear, but these were not very noticable. As I approached the peak, the paintings' colors became much more vivid and metallic or jewel-like, and seemed to move somewhat. Painted trees swayed in the wind, portraits breathed, the liquid in the 'glass of absinthe in a cafe' painting sloshed around in the glass a bit, etc. There was also a general 'dripping' effect, where individual colors seemed to ooze downward. At the time I thought these effects were deliberately added by the artist, though as I came down I realized that it was the mushrooms and not a painting technique.
