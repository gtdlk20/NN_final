The following report is a recollection of my fifth time experimenting with 'shrooms' (and the most mind-blowing experience might I add).  I have never been big into drugs.  I am particularly into psychedelics and expanding my mind, knowledge, wisdom, and experiences.  That is my reasoning for experimenting with this fungus.  I am the type of person who likes to try everything once, and do it wisely... but 'shrooms' have really made an impact on my outlook on life.  I did research on anything and everything about P. cubensis mushrooms before trying it.  I have always been very careful to make sure that I am comfortable and prepared for the experience.  However, this one caught me by surprise.  I had not planned on doing it until about one hour before I actually ate them.
