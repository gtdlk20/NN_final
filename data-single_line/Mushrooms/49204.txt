Anyways, after screwing around at the aquarium, looking at stuff, running around and laughing, the place closed and we left for home...it had starteed raining so we ran to the car and headed out. As soon as I got into the car, I began to have a really bad trip. I felt shitty...feverish, sick, lost...and it just got worse as we went on. I was sitting in the back, while my buddy and my brother were in the front...so as they talked, I just stared off down the road in front of us, and my mind began to darken. and wander.
