I consider myself kind of a yogi as well, and I take responsibility for all in my consciousness, because in the end, it's all kind of a joke, I've always felt like that life is art, and art is what's inside, if we collectively stopped blaming others and took responsibility for our own thoughts and used them to remember and create the paradise which this planet and which our spirits truly hold, theres no doubt it would happen, and I think really it would be pretty easy...
