Our decision to do a trip that day was a spontaneous one. It was near the beginning of the shroom season for where I live, for some reason they don't seem to grow until mid-October around here, and prior to this experience we had only managed to find about 10 liberty caps each time, so we had only had pretty mild individual trips since last year's season.
