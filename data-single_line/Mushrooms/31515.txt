All of a sudden the visuals kicked in. He saw them first. He was looking at a painting hanging on my wall that I had painted this summer. The picture looked 3D because each layer of the painting was waving. We then looked at my poster of the tree of peace. There was an earth surrounded by a rainbow. The beauty of it almost brought tears to my eyes. My boyfriend had a realization about self promotion. He said he didnÂ’t understand how people could be narcissistic or even think they were above others, when everything we know (including all of the words we speak) are a product of people who came before us. We both laughed at the truth of it. I told him that I felt really able to express what I was thinking and he told me that was one of the things that attracted him to me. We talked about words. I said that words could sometimes be limiting. He added that language is what allows us to communicate our thoughts and connects us in that way. Therefore, it is our responsibility to attempt to express inexpressible things in words.
