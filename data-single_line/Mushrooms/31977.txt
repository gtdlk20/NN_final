I came to the conclusion that all these experiences in life, whether pleasant or painful, were all just experiences, nothing is necessarily right or wrong.  Good and evil is something we all need in order for our spirit to grow.  In that sense we desperately need other people, and we especially need the people we hate, fear, despise and compete against in order for us to fulfill our personal aspirations.  When Terence talks about the end of history, he means the end of the egoÂ’s aspirations.  Because without self-wanting and self-satisfaction the wheels of history could not begin turning.  But without the wheels of history turning into full gear with the onset of culture and civilization we would not be in the position we are in today.  There was a trade off, a sacrifice that comes with civilization.  Similar to what Freud talks about in his book, Civilization and its Discontents.
