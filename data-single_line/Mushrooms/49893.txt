At this point the visuals of my trip had slowed down an immense amount and I was feeling a good stoned effect come on. It stayed with me until around 1 am with small amounts of visuals and closed eye hallucinations, I finally got to sleep around 2ish and that was the most intense sleep I have ever had. I slept straight throught the night which I usually dont do, and my dreams were very very real. When I awoke the next day I was still a bit stoned and had a not so bad headache, I went to school and feel I did pretty well on my exams. I still have the very happy state of mind from the trip and everything is still a bit dull. Kinda the same effect after an E trip, a little blunted. But I feel great and I intend  to seek out more shrooms and more hallucinagens, my only words of warning, BE PREPARED!!! There's nothing worse then trippin and not expecting what is going to happen. At a few points I was a little overwhelmed.
