I suddenly, amusedly, realised 'I Am The Walrus' taking that definition to mean that socially I am an outcast. Briefly, due to the extremely draining tone of the experience I worried I'd driven myself insane, or damaged my brain, I also had concerns about not coming down, my brain felt very strange, more so than usual. The odd brain feeling faded and gradually relative normality was back into the driving seat. I barely noticed the transference back to ordinary perception, comfortably drifting into the evening routine.
