This led me to a tangent about how I feel about luxury, but before I talk about that I want to discuss the popularity of my Reddit posts. Their upvotes are capricious and relate in no way to the amount of effort I put into them. Rather their popularity is a function of timeliness and pandering to the audience. I imagine it works the same way in Hollywood, just on a larger scale. So I wonder then, is it worth it for me to be true to my own artistic vision even if it most likely won't bring me fame or fortune? I think the answer is to strike a balance between writing what I want and what will sell. But I'm still at a point where the question is moot. I do not believe - okay, well part of me does, but he's often shut up by my self doubt - that I could write a wildly successful tale, and I truly do not believe I've developed enough insight to write something genuinely good.
