The first peak came on a bus ride where I noticed the patterns on the bus floor not as random splotches, but as eye and pig like forms.  This made me feel that sort of unity explained so often.  Aldous Huxley most excellently explains how spatial relationships and patterns change on psychedelics, everything becomes symbolic to represent the life-death cycle.  Fourth dimensions are perceived and understood, yet no word can express the beauty.
