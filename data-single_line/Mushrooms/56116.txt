Up until I accepted that I was an ignorant, and really accepted it as something that didn't make me any less than the others, which is when I started happily telling my friends that 'everything was pure shit', 'nothing really matters'. At that point I had accepted that all that was importance was existence, it was the only true, I was there on a small piece of land with 5 other entities just like me, because at that point I didn't have a body, my body didn't matter at all at that point I didn't have a body, my body didn't matter at all, I would look at it in such a funny way like something that was there and was mine, but I didn't have respect for. I thought 'What if I kill myselfÂ¿' and that didn't have a meaning because, time didn't exists, I was trapped in that state forever, if I'd kill myself, I would just continue on in that state after my body died. Money was meaningless, I would grab my phone and throw it around the sand. Sexual morbo wasn't part of that state either, when I had control I asked if I had been nude at some point because It just didn't matter to me. My friends were trying to get me to see the stars, which were amazing, one could see the galaxy at naked eye. But I felt the worst fear of my life, I wanted to run away, I wanted to cry, they meant to me that whole bunch of stuff that I can't understand and that I've felt fear for during my whole life.
