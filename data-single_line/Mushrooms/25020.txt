I started to dry my body and got a really overwhelming urge to vomit.  I turned to the toilet, and violently expelled all that I had just eaten. My thought while throwing up was 'Aw Fuck, they didn't have enough time to get completely in my system'.  This would be quickly disproved. I finished drying off quickly, put on my boxers, turned to the sink to brush my teeth and brush my shoulder length hair.
