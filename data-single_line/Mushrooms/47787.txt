So I'm waiting around, and was smoking some gravity bongs in the mean time. My dealer pulls up and my friend and I get in. He hands me back my nugs, as well as a second baggie. I asked what it was and my friend told me they were shrooms. I inquired about the price and determined that I could afford it. I was wanting to try shrooms for a long time before this, so as you can imagine, I was very excited. We got dropped back off where we got picked up and I took the shrooms out of the bag so I could look at them a little. The caps were dark red in the center, then they went on to orange, green, blue, and finally a white ring around the outside. The stems were blue and white, they had a little caramel color to them near the tops. I then ate the shrooms around 6pm or so. By now it's almost sun-set and will be dark in about 2 hours.
