It all started one day in the coffee shop that my friendÂ’s parents owned and he was expected to work at. We were alone there, myself and three other friends. The one who owned the coffee shop will be called friend 1, the most experienced user will be known as friend 2, who had done mushrooms many times before, and the last will be known as friend 3. I happened to come upon some mushrooms around 3:00PM completely by surprise and decided it would be a good day to try them. I opened up the bag and poured the dried mushrooms into my mouth along with some dust that was with it.
