The setting was out in the country, on the side of a hill that overlooks a lush and green valley.  There was much wood and terracotta in the buildings and I knew that some amazing visuals would follow within minutes of consuming the Cubensis.  Where I usually take the time to meditate prior to a psychedelic experience I hadn't felt the need to.  The beautiful locale made for a quiet frame of mind - quiet outside of the anticipation.
