By the time the henna has dried and is flaking off it is nearly noon. My skin hlds the designs lightly. The sun is hot but the breeze over the rim is nice and cool. It is time. I remove the medicine (dried mushrooms) from their bag. Line them up on the rug. Breathing deeply I take them one at a time. It is mid-morning to mid day. Although every time I do this it works... I always feel like nothing will happen this time. Weight unknown... a medium handful of stems and caps.
