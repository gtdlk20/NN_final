I remember sitting on the toilet, in the dark, with rainbow madness all around me, desperately feeling the toilet with my hands just to make sure that I was peeing in the right place. I had to keep reminding myself that there was a house around me, and it was arranged in a certain way, and I rebuilt the layout of the rooms in my mind, in relation to where I was, over and over.
