After a few years we left the park and returned to the house. L and I decided to eat another gram. We sat about watching the Animatrix (best eye candy this side of women) we were smoking and after a while the room filled with a thick purple smoke I could manipulate with my hands, I still havent decided if that was real or not. Junebug was noticably tweeked and on ocassion would interupt complete silence to ask 'What are we even talking about?' I was a little worried about him but hes well versed in the hallucinegens he can take care of him self. I didn't say anything because I dont worry about me until someone else does. He would later tell me that he couldnt seperate the TV and reality. He also told me that he was reading our thoughts, and with out me telling him prior, said that I thought he was fine but wasn't sure and that I didn't want to say anything, he told me that L was all out concerned. A fact L reported to me that night.
