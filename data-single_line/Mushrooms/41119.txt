The endless comfort of pillows and blankets. Arabian nights in the swirls of pleasure. I have spoken, there are words. I stand up, disorientated in an amorphous haze of room echoing around me. I am experiencing phenomenological echoes. Echoes of time and space. I make it to the toilet, trailing myself behind me, being patient to relieve myself. I splash water on the dark face in the mirror, endless vortices pooling around me. I am still coming up. Time has came and went. I am seeking some anchor into this reality so I do not become lost in this dream forever.
