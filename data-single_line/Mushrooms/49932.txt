There were a lot of other people tripping that night, but it seemed that I couldn't find any of them. I went over to this party house and a few of my friends were there. Some of them had been smoking crank and a couple others were tripping on X for the first time. We went for a drive to find some more crank. This is when it really started to kick in. Before the lights had turned all sparkly and there was drastic color change, but when we got in the Jeep I was gone. Superfast looking trails of light were all along the outside of the jeep and it felt like we were driving at light speed. We drove for a while, and then went back to the house. We smoked a bowl, but the wierd thing is that I couldn't see any smoke coming out when I exhaled, and I know I was taking massive hits. We were sitting outside the house and all the window were all different colors and the sky looked really cool. They all started smoking crank and I decided to leave, I felt restless. I wanted to find some of my other friend who were tripping.
