We go to the bedroom, strip our clothes off and get under the covers.  I begin having a cycle of physical sensations: Being too hot, being too cold, having gas (which I called 'guts!' every time it happened), being too skin sensitive, my sinuses overflowing, and my eyes watering. I would go through each stage over and over, in a cycle pattern. I was able to be more verbal here, though language was a chore.  During this cycle, at one point I could feel her palm on my back at my heart, and understood that she was feeding energy to the chakra (which she later confirmed).  We had a conversation about whether or not the physical sensations were connected to emotional states (her contention) or not (my contention).  We never came to consensus.
