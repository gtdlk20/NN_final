Oct 8  The new spores and syringes came today.  I made ten syringes from two spore prints.  I had 5 Tasmanian and 5 PES Hawaiian.  I inoculated twelve jars this evening as well, 6 Tasmanian and 6 PES Hawaiian.  These are both fast colonizers and should be ready for the terrarium in 14 days.
