From here on the visions changed to an electronic world of florescent flashing, movable textiles which created a landscape. I became aware of my body. I was standing in this world. I could move again! It was very dreamlike now. I have always wanted to lucid dream but never could consciously become aware that it was just a dream. This control was exactly how I imagine a lucid dream to be. I started walking around, running, when I jumped I sort of floated like the gravity was weak. It was so fucking awesome. The best part was I was thinking lucidly. I remember thinking 'Wow! I have total control and I am somewhere in space! Lets test some stuff out!' I was still me. I looked down at my body and was surprised to see it was made from a purple glowing electricity. Although I could see the outlines of my legs, hands etc. I was made entirely of glowing electricity. Even my face I noticed after a time. It was another dimension but it wasn't the land of the dead as it was before. I felt as though I was my soul exploring an alien landscape. I was me, It was a weird idea I was having. It was as if my personality was vibrating off me and I could see all aspects of myself externally rather than internally. I honest to god felt like I was a powerful unique character in a new world and I wanted to find others. I felt their presence, but I could never see them. I spent a good amount of time here. I got to the point where I could shoot energy from my hands and create electronic music from the environment. It was crazy. The trip continued. This was the last time i consciously enjoyed the trip. The last time I thought it was beautiful and fun. What followed, I can only describe as Hellish.
