A few weeks ago a casual acquaintance indicated to me that when the liberty cap season would come around here in the United Kingdom, he might be able to sort some mushroom brew for me. I had not taken shrooms since about five years back, when I was a teenager living in the Netherlands, and needless to say I was thrilled at the prospect. I have previously taken P. Cubensis ('Mexicans') on several occasions, providing me with some of my happiest memories, and C. Cyanescens ('Hawaiians'), resulting in one of the most visually chaotic and unpleasant moments of my life.
