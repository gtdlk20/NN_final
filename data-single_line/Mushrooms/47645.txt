We got to the park and decided it was time to smoke a few blunts. At this point a started to really zoom so time after having arrived at the park became incalculable. The three of use sat for a long time just smoking and talking, mostly about leaving society to while a way the says on some beach just smiling. The conversation was so liquid and easy it was like come up of ecstacy, I was totally blissed out.
