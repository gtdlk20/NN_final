I'd underestimated the potency of these mushrooms, though, because suddenly (about T+1:15) I started peaking hard.  Nausea set in along with a little bit of panic.  I breathed deeply and told myself to just go with it and relax, but my body was responding in a very alarming way.  I began to sweat and suddenly felt the strong urge to be by myself in a darkened room.  I went to our bedroom and sort of knelt on the bed.  My boyfriend and brother were understanding and after I reassured them that I was okay, they left me alone.  I could still hear the music through the walls but it wasn't a comforting sound.  The normally upbeat songs sounded like funeral dirges, and I began to wonder if I was dying.
