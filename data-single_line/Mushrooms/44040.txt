The come-down had to have been the best a part outside of the euphoria on the trampoline. Both of us got piss drunk and used his THC vape and fell asleep, I personally felt 'whole' I felt like I had just analyzed every part of me and I was the better for it. R felt relived that the confusion was gone. We were fuckin' happy and there were no worries in the world. We talked about what we learned and saw. It was a good day.
