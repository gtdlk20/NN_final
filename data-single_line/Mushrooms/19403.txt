Psychologically I was at some crossroads. I was mid semester of my neuroscience/psychology degree and had just failed psychology by 4 marks, (been a little too distracted that semester). So I was deciding what to do with my life, and wondering if Im in the right course. If I want to take up a career in dancing, pursue my passion for writing, or put more time into the production of music. I was unemployed at the time and hadnt worked for about 5 months (unless uni counts as work). I still dont have my licence and these were basically the only self esteem issues facing me at the time, I was a little apprehensive but basically ready for a spiritually enlightening experience.
