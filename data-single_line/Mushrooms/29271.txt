Around 4 hours into the trip, all the effects had mostly worn off. I had a bit of a stomach pain, which I associated with the mushrooms, but eating helped a bit (I also hadnt eaten much during the day as A said it would help not to feel nausea if I ate only very lightly before the trip). All in all, nothing I wouldnt take for that amazing experience that I had. Despite the bumpy ride it was beautiful, magical, eye-opening, educating, and just what I needed at the time.
