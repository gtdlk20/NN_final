Last words: I wish to repeat this procedure of learning aided by hallucinogens again some time when I am ready and when it is necessary. In retrospect using mushrooms at such a young age is very dangerous. My brain is not still fully developed and my brain chemistry is still developing. I have been lucky to have helped myself on that occasion but I know that other trips and other drugs have damaged my psyche possibly perfectly. I think that hallucinogens are genuinely dangerous and should not be tampered with, I believe they are less dangerous for people who already know their place in the world. This is because I'm young and mushrooms are powerful and messing with my brain chemistry at this age is messing with chaos. I may be able to handle it but I would not guarantee that anybody else would come out with such a positive result.
