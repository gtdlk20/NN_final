I dropped about 3/4 of the bag of hawaian mushrooms  I had bought on the way home at about 16.00, after completely starving myself for about five hours. I did this to ensure that the mushrooms would have their maximum potency since my earlier experiences had taught me that the power of the trip greatly depends on how much food I have in my stomach. One must always drink as much water as possible though. After about 20 minutes i started to feel the onset comming up and retreated to my room which I had fully prepared for some good tripping. The effects soon became very powerful and visual, and I tried to watch a movie on my computer.
