The six mile back up to the rim and my site was strong medicine. Arrived back at site for an exhausted nap and very light dinner. After dinner I wandered around and vibrated the lingering feelings of fear and loneliness. I have never taken the medicine alone in the wilderness. I feel strong in my intent to break through into another level of seeing tomorrow. no evidence of other people here.
