After eating the mushrooms with some Taco Bell (terrible idea) and washing it down with some soda, I decided to wait for the come-up by playing some video games. About 30 minutes after ingestion, surfaces took on a standard 'breathing' visual effect. From here until the end of the trip, the visuals did not get any stronger than this apart from colors being more vibrant and certain objects elongating and shrinking. The visual effects were subtle, though present nevertheless, which is to be expected
