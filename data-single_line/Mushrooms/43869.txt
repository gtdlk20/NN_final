To keep out minds occupied I figured we should re-construct a firepit that was once there. The campsite got kind of messed up because there was a huge flood during the winter so everything got kind of washed away. But we were joking and bringing stones up from the nearby river and placing them in a little dirt area that I cleared out. It's very tough to describe but it kind of just started with some brain fog, and gradually kind of noticing my thoughts getting kind of jumbled up and it being harder to form sentences.
