That evening, I took out and weighed 2.45 grams of Golden Teacher mushrooms and simply ate them all at once. In my preparation, I had mentally decided to not expect anything from this trip. I wanted to simply ride whatever roller coaster the psilocybin was going to take me on. I was just a passenger willing to see or learn whatever could be offered. Trust and surrender!
