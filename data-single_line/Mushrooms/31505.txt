About halfway down the main road, my boyfriend said he wanted to take more when we got to my house. I laughed and told him we still hadnt left his road and we may start feeling them more soon. He agreed and I think we both realized that maybe the time dilation had started to kick in, because it really did feel like we had been walking on that road forever. We kept passing people and I wanted to say hi to everybody. We kept passing people and I wanted to say hi to everybody. He kept laughing at their responses because he thought the way they said hey sounded funny. We passed an art tribute to president Obama. It was really cool and I told my boyfriend we should come back and hang out with the art. He seemed uncomfortable with the idea and I could see why. We normally communicate well, but on the walk I felt like we both were seeing each others perspectives especially well. When we got to my house, we saw my roommate and neighbor laying out in the yard. We talked with them for a little while and they asked us if we were coming from the library because of our book bags.
