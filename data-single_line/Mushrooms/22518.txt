These questions plagued me as I paced the room. I decided the fungus Id consumed must have liberated me from earthly existence, and that I would soon incarnate as another being, hopefully to have a more exciting and fulfilling life this time. I was beginning to understand that everything from my human life  my name, my friends, my every perception  had only ever existed in my mind, and that it was time to leave them now. I felt a vague dread at this, and there was also some apprehension in the background, where I realised my thoughts were no longer making sense. Whenever I conjured up a friends face, or anything at all about my human life, it all seemed utterly ridiculous... how stupid, that we go to work, that we die, that things matter to us or that we grow attached to people and things... stupid, and unbecoming of a God. So I forgot everything about them. Everything.
