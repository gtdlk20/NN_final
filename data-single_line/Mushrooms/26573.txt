Dosage of 2 chocolate chunks each (dealer weight: 4 grams each, but probably about 2-ish). We drove around with our  sober friend 'J' for about 20 minutes smoking copious amounts of weed. I began to feel the mushrooms building, at first it was a tingling in my feet that moved up my leg and soon I had vast quantities of energy. I was feeling VERY VERY cramped in the car and to be honest it was giving me terrible vibes.  As well, stomach pains were becoming noticable. #1 rule of treating a bad trip is change the setting. Reminding myself of this I suggested that we get dropped off at the forest where we had earlier decided to trip. March is fucking cold at night in norther/central Alberta (actually...its pretty much just cold 365 days a year) but we PLANNED AHEAD (IMPORTANT!) and bundled up to the point that we figured even if we passed out in the snow we would most likely survive.
