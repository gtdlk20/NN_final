We shared most of the brew out between the three of us (worked out to be 80 caps each) and drank, which tasted fine with a couple of tea bags and a lot of sugar. We didn't no how long it would take to start having effect but we started to feel quite different about ten minutes after we had drunk the brew, nothing intense at all but just a slight strangeness. My father then gave us a lift over to Ollie's house where we would spend our unconscious state.
