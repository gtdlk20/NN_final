I was driven.  I had found my door, although I didn't know it at the time.  All I felt was a pull to the ledge.  It didn't stop me from exploring a bit on the way, but I got to the cliff top in only a few minutes.  There was a crowd of normal 20-something people up there now.  I hesitated, not liking the looks of this and knowing I should probably go back down out of sight, but I had to know what the third jump was all about.  I stepped up to the edge, but there was a line forming, and I had to get in line.  I imagine the look on my face was a cross of intense curiosity and social fear.  I didn't like this one bit, but I had to jump that third time.
