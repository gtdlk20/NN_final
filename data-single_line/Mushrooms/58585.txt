My friend calls me and explains he will be here soon, so I decide to go outside and enjoy the decently warm, yet a bit chilly, weather and smoke a cig. I'm sitting in the middle of my driveway as he arrives, and I'm in that uncontrollable laughing stage once again. He's completely sobor and realizes fast that I am tripping hard as anything. We go inside and go back to the basement. The next hour or so consists of extreme tracers, OEV's, seeing multiple people when looking at my friend, I'd see him in like waves of tracers, and at one point I was unable to even speak words, just mumble nonsense. At that time as well I couldn't even understand what he was saying to me.
