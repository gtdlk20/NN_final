This was my best trip I ever had. B and I both had things planned out. We had the best place to trip and everything was in the best condition. Overall the trip, just like all my other trips, made me have a mental state of complete comfort with the world. I had a profound interest in the world around me. My boundary between my reality and my subconscious was broken. I felt like I understood everything about myself. Everything that ever happened in my life flashed in front of me and I forgave myself for everything I ever felt guilty for, and I was fully accepting of my life and all the things in it.
