Just like my first mushroom trip, the cars outside looked severely different. While walking on the right side of the street, they all seemed like they had been made of putty, and had had their fronts smudged to the right (my left). Every car was like this. I was so fascinated with it that I kept wanting to walk around each car and touch it, but it was a bad neighborhood and I'd probably get shot.
