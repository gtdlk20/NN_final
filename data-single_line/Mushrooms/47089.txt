I eventually fell asleep beneath like 7 blankets and I slept more comfortably than I had ever slept, had the weirdest dreams and didn't know where I was for like 5 minutes after waking up. I was so confused, and my head felt empty and depleted. I thanked the generous lady, she was outside, and I went home to freshen up for another day. That is my story, and I hope it wasn't too long for y'all...looking back, the whole experience has to be considered, not just bits and pieces. I can't criticize and regret, it's just not right. I either enjoyed it or not. The experience was supposed to turn out that way for it's own beneficial reasons and Im sure Ive learned a few things from it.
