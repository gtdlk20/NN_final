It was my roommate's birthday.  He's probably the best roommate I could possibly have hoped for.  I tried to call him about 15 times that night and never got through.  I realized how much I appreciated my friends and family and all the people who take care of me.  At one point, I was crying because I couldn't go up to my parents room and tell them that I loved them (well I could have, but it was like 3:30 AM and I was still tripping balls).  I found myself constantly at a crossroads.  Every decision I made seemed so amazingly important.  The Garden of Forking Paths.  Every moment was so precious and there was so much wonder and beauty and sadness wrapped in every little thing I did.  Wonder and excitement at seeing where a path would take me, beauty in how amazing it was to be alive and thinking, sadness in that I had to abandon an infinite number of alternatives to chase an infinite more ahead of me.  The thought reminded me again of Alice in Wonderland, and I analogized choosing a path and chasing it with chasing a white rabbit.
