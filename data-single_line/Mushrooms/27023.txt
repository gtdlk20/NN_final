Then I ran to my back door to make sure that was locked too. I looked out the back window toward the sound and to my great relief I saw fireworks being lit off about a quarter mile away. I was very shaken by this point but I was still able to figure out that it was Friday and there was a ball park not too far away from me, and on Fridays they play games and light off fireworks. The part of me that had figured this out was telling the rest of me to calm the fuck down. This didnÂ’t work as well as I had hoped. The mushrooms were really starting to get going. I sat on the couch, thinking, and trying to calm myself. I could feel a sensation in my body and my mind that told me I was in for a serious ride. The fireworks/3rd Reich incident had reinforced that paranoid feeling of someone coming to my house to get me, the seed of which was laid by my ex-girlfriend and my anxiety over her possible visit. It became less a feeling dread of having to entertain guests while high as a kite, and more of a generalized feeling of someone might possibly come here looking for me, and the prospect of this alone was an incredibly terrifying one.
