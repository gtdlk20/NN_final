It was around this time that I started to come down. I began to feel cold, very wet, and actually rather miserable.  My clothing was soaked to the skin.  I crawled inside my dark tent and fumbled around till I found the flashlight; it was then I realized that there was a leak in the roof, that my sleeping bag and blankets were underneath it, and that they were damp.  I stripped off my wettest layers, threw on a dry hoody from my waterproof backpack, and crawled under blankets to keep warm as best I could.  I felt utterly wretched, like a wet rat.  But worse, my awful state got me contemplating my own mortality.  It seemed to me that everything was so wet and cold that it could never be warm, dry, or anything good ever again.  I thought about how it got there, and came to this conclusion:  all things are slowly breaking down, falling apart, decomposing-- including us.  Including me.  We spend all our lives trying to fight against the meaninglessness of oblivion and that inevitable point when it's all too much and we are swallowed whole by the slow force called death.
