The conversation at dinner was when things started getting interesting/scary.  At this point time was extremely slow.  I felt like we were sitting there forever.  I began feeling the nausea again except it was more intense.  I looked around for a bathroom in case I was going to throw up.  W and J kept talking about normal things and I couldn't pay attention to it.  I kept looking out the window at the sunset and feeling all the sensations in my body.  The nausea would rise and my heart would beat louder in a state of panic.  I told myself that it comes in waves and to just play it cool and wait it out.
