This and I could talk random stuff non-stop, the words flowed out of my mouth much easier than normal. I enjoyed the after glow, which I am still experiencing actually. We went and saw a movie, then I came home, and wrote this. All in all, I ate a 1/2 eighth, and the effects were: cloud morphing, cool vision, mild tracers, mild closed eye visuals that are connected to my imagination, thinking is altered, thinking is shallow and fast paced, or it can be deep and meaning full, empathy for friends and people. Joy, awe, and thankfullness for your gifts.
