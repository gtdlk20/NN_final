The next day, a little hungover, my man and I got up and discussed what we should eat the shrooms with.  We ended up going to the store and I picked out some Bagel Bites, he picked up a Cup Noodles.  Then, we ate an eighth each while watching tv.  It took me longer to eat, because of the gross bagel bite-mushroom combo.  When I was almost done, my man went to go take a shower while I sat around watching tv.  Soon my man came knocking at my door, already tripping.  He was being so goofy, so I just could not wait for my trip to take effect.  Soon, I was ecstatic and laughing to the point of crying.  A couple of our friends came into my room to watch us, maybe even mess with us.
