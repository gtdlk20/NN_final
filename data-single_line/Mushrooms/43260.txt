I can say that as a first experience it is a philosophical one. Rocko alternates between two person in my mind. One is a mafia gangster who provide us the shrooms and the other is a professor. With the professor I talk of the origine of the universe, Rocko while I don't want to insult isn't very smart yet I discover my opinion of him is lower than it should be. Everytime Gimpy mentions the time we get down to reality. He says it every 10 mins or so. Then we talk a little and find something to talk deeper. We went through it all, how our body works, today's society, publicity, how the world will be when we're older, how it was before, aliens you name it.
