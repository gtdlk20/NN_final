In the _Primordial_Fire_, it burned me away, cleansed me of everything, parts of me beginning to melt and turn into dust blow away by the horrible force of this pure white light - I opened my eyes, as I felt a tingles in my body where the parts had begun melting - everything was back to quite normal. 'Oh, don't fight it,' I thought, 'let go. Let go. LET GO,' I said to myself, and closed eyes, stopped fighting it, the fire returning in the form of a volcano, volcano the size of the Himalayas, I was the volcano. I burned and oozed and was being purified - and this was not an unpleasant feeling, more like bittersweet, and I also felt very powerful... I was unable to completely let go, so this little doubt dwelt in the back of my mind, whether I should stop, for the intensity of everything was rapidly escalating.
