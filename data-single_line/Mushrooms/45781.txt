Let me start by saying that I'm not new to psychedelics, although I wouldn't call myself an expert or anything Â– more of an eager student of our plant teachers.  I am not currently on any prescriptions, and I do not take any OTC medicine, not even aspirin.  Without coming off like a snob, I treat every ailment with appropriate foods and essential oils.  I even make my own soaps, toothpaste, shampoo, lotions, and other beauty products.  It is my goal to live a natural lifestyle while also existing in the modern world. I do, however, smoke marijuana nightly to help me sleep.
