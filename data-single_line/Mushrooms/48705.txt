I began to think suicidal thoughts, but I thought about it in a positive light. Very hard to explain. I learned to embrace my death, whenever it came. I realized how small I was, and how big the universe was. I realized that everyone I know will die and soon no one would remember us. Again, I wasn't very sad about this, I just came to realize it. The song 'Do You Realize??' came on by the Flaming Lips and this just intensified these feelings. I thought of a story where 2 lovers lived in a white box, with a purple electric barrier between one another. These 2 lovers could talk all they want, but they could never touch each other. I'm not even sure why I thought that out.
