In an attempt to save my life I dont know if I was screaming, talking or thinking this, but I started yelling peace and love over and over for what felt like 20min. The patterns had faded and I was in complete hyperspace. At this point this overwhelming feeling of stupidity and sadness ran over me. Stupidity because I had just killed myself by overdosing on mushrooms and sadness because everything I knew was no longer. I was no longer a father, husband or human. It felt very similar to the ego death I had experienced on DMT however much darker because I also felt like I had physically died as well.
