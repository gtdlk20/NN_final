We divvied up the mushrooms at around 12:00 that afternoon, chewed them up well and swallowed. The taste was a bit stronger than other mushrooms I've taken orally, but they were fairly simple to get down and hold down. We had eaten little that day and the previous one simply to avoid upset stomachs and to experience the full effects of the mushrooms. After ingesting them, we decided to lie down and watch a movie simply to pass the time before they started to take hold. Now, I'm used to mushrooms taking at least 45 minutes to effect me, but these little crazies really snuck up on both of us. After about no more than 15-20 minutes we both felt ourselves start to vibrate and our muscles tensing up. I asked my girlfriend 'Do you feel that?' and she nodded, giggling, and I asked her to join me on the bed so we could be close together.
