I think what happened next is that I went through a multitude of dismemberment experiences--I was swallowed and then spat out by giant beings. It took a while for me to be reassembled and at first I was given the wrong head back. Evil entities appeared and started laughing and mocking me for having inappropriate body parts. The Mushroom spirits told me that I had to lie still all night, without eating, drinking or talking and that I would only be reassembled in the morning. They told me not to go to the toilet as the guy I share a toilet with would also try to eat me. After a while they relented and let me be reanimated. Then I had a vision of a man on horseback who approached me with a sword. He pierced me in the stomach with it, then gave me a book containing knowledge about which plants to use to heal people with and the mushrooms said that in the future I should ask them what page to turn to in the book to find the right plant to heal people with. I was also presented with a sword, the ownership of which I rejected and given a new body of finest gilded metal, together with a lot of new mushroomy knowledge and a new tongue to replace the one that had been cut out at some point in the evening.
