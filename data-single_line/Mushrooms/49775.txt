We sit down to relax, talk some shit and wait for the effect to come. After about 40 minutes the uncontrollable laughter takes over. Me and N, who hadn't eaten since lunch, get a stronger feeling than J and P. Numerous times we just look at eachother and break into laughter. The setting gets weirder and weirder, but it feels nice!
