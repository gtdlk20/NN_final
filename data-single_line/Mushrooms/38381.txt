Searching for the world in between the cracks I decided to see if shrooms could guide me to this place. At about 5:30PM, X and me had the first stem and cap go down, the taste of sunflower seeds stayed in my mouth. The preparation started while waiting for the upcoming trip. Music, incense, pot, henna, toys, and of course more shrooms for later.
