Things got really chaotic in a hurry for me however; the room began to spin around incredibly fast, and I was having very rapid visuals where single objects grew and breathed while walls began to disintigrate into nothingness very quickly.  My friends finished their game and we went down to watch a movie, poor choice the second; the movie was 'Bumfights' which was absolutely the worst thing we could have watched, the tripper is in very delicate and vulnerable mindset and a movie about fighting and drunks shed a totally different light on the experience.  My freinds sat back and laughed at it, I was having a fucking intense trip though; I began to feel extremely drunk and everything took on a sort of neon-pastel green and blue light, my vision was spinning and I was lost in a dreamy sort of trance, when I looked at something I could see different dimensions out of both eyes verging in on what we all knew as the world.  I was feeling like I was in a dream world; I had an incredible sense of deja vu that lasted the entire time, and I was remembering vacations I'd been on recently so clearly that the world around me resembled my thoughts.
