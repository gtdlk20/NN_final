So some kid I am pretty good friends with told me he was getting shrooms this weekend and asked me if I wanted any. I said 'sure'. So I got the shrooms, but I was a little confused when it turned out to be a piece of chocolate, which he said had the equivalent of 3.5 grams or an eigth ounce of shrooms mixed in with it. I was a little bit skeptical, but I went ahead and ate half of it when I got home, thinking I'll see what the effects are and decide if I want to eat the other half.
