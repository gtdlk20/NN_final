How to start this? I want to leave some semblance of permanency of the events of Thursday night before they too flee from my memory. These days my memory isn't what it used to be, you see. I find myself forgetting days and weeks at a time. More disturbingly, I've found myself forgetting skills I took as infallible. My typing has gotten worse, and I'm a distracted and reckless driver unless I concentrate. Whether this is part of getting old, the depression or the drugs I don't suppose I'll ever know. But at least I possess enough of my mental faculties to have moments of striking clarity and brilliance.
