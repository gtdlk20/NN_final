It was at this point that I went to take a shower and so did my gf. I asked her how she was feeling, and she told me that her body felt really heavy and slow, but she felt good. She tried to attribute it to being kind of drunk but slightly different in feeling, I figured she doesn't really have any kind of reference point seeing as she has never used any other substance before in a recreational manner, and that her dose tonight must have been pretty low. But was the honey delaying things even further?
