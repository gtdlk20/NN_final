And then I wondered why it never worked out with Justina. Was it because we were both scared of how real the love between us would be? Maybe that was true for me, it's too long ago for me to remember accurately, but it couldn't have been true for her. She loved and lost and played games with her heart repeatedly after she rejected me. And that was part of what hurt so bad. I never fell out of love with her, but she moved on to other men while I was still by her side in a role I didn't know how to play. But I kept trying. I tried my hardest with that trip to California. I let myself be in love with her when I went on that trip. There was little hesitation on my part. I still didn't have the words to tell her how I felt, or know how to make things physical between us but I tried as hard as I could with my actions to show her that I was head over heels for her. And it plain didn't work. That's what happened. She was distant after that first day and the little confidence I had was whittled down at every little rejection.
