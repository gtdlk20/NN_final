After about 10 minutes of this insane anger vibes things started to cool down but not to me. I felt as if 20 years had passed and I was now living in vegas in a cheap hotel room strung out on crack. I started to scream 'We're fucked so kill yourself' at everyone. J ran up to grabbed me by the shoulders and tried to talk to me but his voice seemed drowned out by a helicopter hoovering outside. I looked at the helicopter which was eye level with our room and suddenly a great searchlight was turned on directly into our room.
