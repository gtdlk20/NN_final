Across the street, there is a small bay called simply 'Back Bay' and there is a 3-4 mile walking path around it thatÂ’s used during the day by joggers and families. Being sunday night it was deserted. Perfect! This walkway has mile markers marked off in increments of 1/4 mile. By the first 1/4 mile marker I was already feeling a bit 'sparkly'. Mind you, this is not even 10 minutes into the walk. My friend told me this stuff was good but this is very promising! By the 3/4 mile marker I was definitely tripping. Amazing. I sat down on a bench and as soon as I did I felt the body waves that I always associated with mushrooms. The city was across the bay all lit up and the clouds were beginning to glow. The sound of cars driving by had an echo and I knew the real deal was starting to hit me.
