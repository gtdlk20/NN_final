After this there's nothing else to report that's much different.  After some more wandering around and staring at things, RP tracked me down and told me that he and his friend were leaving, and asked if I would be ok.  All I could manage in response was to giggle like a schoolgirl and nod my head.  so he left, and not too much later I went home.  By the time I got in the car, the mushrooms had worn off. There was just a very slight visual alteration...things seemed brighter than normal. I was very chilled out on the ride home, even though I was crammed into a tiny backseat with an annoying girl and a guy 3 times my size.  It didn't bother me; I was too much at peace.  And there's nothing more to tell.
