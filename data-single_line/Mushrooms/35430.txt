My trip followed the graph shown on this site very closely. I began to feel a buzzing in my head, which then traveled through my limbs. I began feeling a fair bit of nausea, chills, trembling, fast breathing. My friend, who had tripped before, helped to get me out of myself. He reminded me to breath slowly, told me the bad stuff would soon pass. All this occurred within about 30 minutes. Walking through the forest, I began noticing patterns, fractals, tunnels through the trees, rainbows of light, and my depth perception began to change. Things looked closer to me than in my usual reality. And then colors began to really stand out. Greens were the most vivid, gorgeous, lush greens of the grass and trees. All of this by the end of hour 1.
