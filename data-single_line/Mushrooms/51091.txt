It was about 6pm on a Saturday night, I was with a few friends on our way to go pick up some weed.  The person in the car who was hooking us up informed us that there might be a chance to get some 'shrooms.  I had only done 'shrooms on two other occasions, and both those times not much happened.  We all chipped in some money and told him to go for the 'shrooms if they were availible, and if not, just go for weed.  After about 20 minutes, he returns to the car and tells us the good news, he got the 'shrooms!
