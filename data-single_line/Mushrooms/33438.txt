There were two things that did matter though: the feeling that I wasn't getting anywhere, and that I had to pee. The first was probably attributed to the fact that I was standing on some rocks in a shallow area for 10-15 minutes, but I don't really remember. To solve them both, I saw a house up on the bank and I figured I could go use their bathroom. By the time I got started up the lawn some police stopped me to ask that I go over to this cement area. One of them proceeded to ask all sorts of questions and I just stared at him blankly. He wasn't real, as far as I could tell, so why should I strain my already strained brain to reply. He initiated a mental game that I enjoyed, so I tried to play along. I guess I passed the sobriety test, and he told me to get back in the water. As a note, I didn't think this really happened until much later as I came down, when everything else I was experiencing turned out to be real.
