I slowly came back and started speaking to my friend and one of the first things I remember was turning around and being like THAT! THAT RIGHT THERE! because I figured out what that roaring was. The air conditioning unit noise had been turned into some kind of cosmic mechanical roar that locked me in place in that other dimension (the white light) by its sound alone. I remember talking more but I dont remember what about. I think he was trying to get me to stay calm and explain what happened, but it was near impossible. We sat and talked for a while (still cant remember about what) and then we went inside. I was still tripping pretty hard. We started watching Malcolm in the Middle and I was in a nice place. I kept giggling at the dumbest shit. I still couldnt explain what had just happened. I was still trying to process it, but got distracted easily by shit. I had the attention span of a baby. I remember looking at the clock and it was about 2 AM. We talked into the night about various things. I had an amazing experience with him, I was so happy to get to do this. I felt so peaceful with my old friend, just chatting like we used to. Hes always been important to me but I never realized how much until this trip.
