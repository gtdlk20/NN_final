I got up and walked outside. I laid on the wet ground while it rained, in nothing but a t-shirt and pants. I laid there quietly. Thinking to myself. About myself, about my life, about everything going on in my life. I was tripping so hard at this point that trees looked like the size of the sun and other houses were breathing on me. I lapsed into a mental coma of everything sad. I touched my face and it felt like putty. Disgusting.
