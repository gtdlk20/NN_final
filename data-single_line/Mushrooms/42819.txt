Once all of our running around was done and over with, we were back in Peters and Zulians dorm room with our alcohol by about five oclock, with the vast majority of the evening still ahead of us. Peter had ducked out of the room for a moment or two, but I hadnt really thought much of it. He re-emerged a moment or two later with a smile on his face, allowing the door to shut fully behind him before he spoke. I found us a nickel bag for the night! His roommate, Michael Zulian seemed excited but the rest of us were lost.
