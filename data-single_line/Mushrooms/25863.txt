It took quite a while for me to get comfortable and suppress the embarassment since I thought I soiled myself. I put on some music and we all relaxed. Once I was digested and spit back out in the nakedness of the bathroom I felt like she were there; only in another dinension that our simple brains can't imagine. Once we were all comfortable in the warm glow and soothing music of T's room I craved her presence. I needed H's body to be near me since I had lost the feeling of her presence that the Goddess had provided while naked in the flowing water of the tub. I forced myself to be content with my surroundings and the rest of the evening was quite pleasant.
