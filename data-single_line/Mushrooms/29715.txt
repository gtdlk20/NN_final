I came back to my body, and was catatonic for roughly another hour or so. I opened my eyes to find the headlights of a car beaming over me, while M and his mother carried me to the car. As we drove out of the woods and back to the house, the mushrooms were whispering in my mind that I was being reborn. We reached the house, they gave me lots of water (the best water Ive ever had in my life, as I was so dehydrated) and put me to bed on their couch. The last words I heard before falling asleep were from the mushrooms, and they said Goodbye, Eeshock. We love you.
