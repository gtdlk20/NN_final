Well about 5 min after the lizard king incident, my friends returned. All but one, M. Apparently he had gotten lost again but this time on the strip. My friend B started to freak out and yell curses at everyone since M was missing and he might be seen by B's parents. I started to get very fearful since he was become quite upset I tried to look out my window but kept getting drawn back into the drama. Suddenly B screamed 'Everyone shut the fuck up!' in a very loud scary voice. I was freaking out big time because he was yelling because the phone was ringing.
