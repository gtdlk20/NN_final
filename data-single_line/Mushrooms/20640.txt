This was the prelude to what I can only describe as some kind of inter-dimensional song-and-dance. This was the prelude to what I can only describe as some kind of inter-dimensional song-and-dance. It felt very sensual and playful, but still very careful. Participating in and being present for this show caused things to reveal themselves in greater and greater levels of complexity. The gradient of the blue field began to ripple, and I got the impression of a sheet or a veil that was having wind blown over it. After the rippling came rotation, first slowly but eventually reaching cartoonish levels of speed. Once it had begun rotating fast enough, the geometry came back but with a much more urgent and wild intensity. First came a spiral, then many other patterns that I don't remember, and this culminated in what I can only describe as a spiders web fractal.
