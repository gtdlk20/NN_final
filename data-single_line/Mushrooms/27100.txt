Afterwards we played in our bed of sand together like children in a sand box.  Our bodies were coated with grains of fine creamy colored powder and our mouths were full of it, as were our eyes, yet we both relished it.  I recalled licking his eyes while we were making love so that he could open them to look at me and so that I could look into them, which partially accounted for the gritty feeling and scratch sounds emerging from my mouth.  He looked especially happy and renewed to my eyes; his smile was like I have not before seen and his beautiful green and brown eyes sparkled and shined.  I found myself sorting through various emotions for our new relationship while also thinking about my recent loss.  It has been very difficult for me to open up to another being after having lost something so very special to me in the not so distant past.  I reminded myself that although some things go unexplained reasons exist for all events, and my experience today was a powerful yet gentle method of such an exploration of queries.
