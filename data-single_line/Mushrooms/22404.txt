When the day arrived, the weather forecast hadn't been lying. The temperature was at about 20 degrees Celsius, the perfect temperature for shorts and a t-shirt. My good friend W came over as planned, and we jammed a bit with two of my guitars. Although W had been considering eating the other dose I bought for him, he decided not to, as he had a very frightening bad trip about a year and a half before. Ergo, he decided to stick with some high-grade weed I'd been saving for that day.
