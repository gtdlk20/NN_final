I continually tried closing my eyes for about an hour, only to have the sensation of thousands of thoughts, images, and feelings pulse through my brain, almost like an information overload and wishing it would stop so I could go to sleep. It was more annoying than anything else since it wouldn't have bothered me so much had I not been so exhausted.
