Across the street and an alley, there is a group of dogs who constantly bark. Usually I would not let Lola go over there because I was sure that she just wanted to bark back at them.  This time, I felt an urge to allow her to lead me. So around the block we went, me trying to smoke a cigarette and her desperately pulling on her leash. We soon got to the pack of dogs that were in a chain link fence. There were two young pit bulls and a smaller white mutt. Everybody was barking like crazy, and I stood there and watched. Then, something happened.
