Soon after this it started to rain. A dribble at first and at one point it was straight coming down. At this point I was definitely feeling high, not like maybe its kicking in but like 'fuck man I'm high.' The shrooms we making me feel realllly mellow and kind of like I wanted to faint almost. I didn't really have too much physical anxiety but I did feel pretty uncomfortable. I kept like zoning out and just staring into the brush ahead of me.
