Oh yeah, The snows still melting, guys. I know you want to eat the snow. I think what was going on here, with my insistence that everyone had to eat the snow, was a feeling of inevitability. I was certain that they really HAD to eat the snow, or the trip would never end. The trip couldnt end until they ate the snow. I was making a similar mistake as Kirkegaarde makes, when he conceives of God as a being perfect in all ways, including existence. Therefore God exists. The mistake I was making was confusing existence in thought with that thing actually happening in reality. Simply thinking about something is not the same as that thing actually happening, but with such logic circuits blown or rerouted, I recurrently experienced thoughts that I felt must inevitably happen simply because I had thought of them.
