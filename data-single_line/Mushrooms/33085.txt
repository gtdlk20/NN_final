2:00am - The next DJ's are a hip hop/glitch outfit that totally blow my mind. I start stumbling around the back of the hangar I guess, not really in control of my body by this point. I feel no sensation in my body, although I can feel pressure in my stomach because I have to urinate. The problem is that I cant conceive of the idea of peeing or toilets so I just deal with the discomfort. I feel like my mind is being carried off and chopped into pieces by the glitchy clicks and cuts coming from the main stage. I feel like I'm being sucked into a big vortex as I stumble in a circle around the place. As I look at anyone their bodies change and morph, melt and change colors. Things start to get pretty scary as most people look like multi-armed skeletons, but I keep telling myself I'm just tripping hard and try to deal. I can also stop the hallucinations briefly by simply changing the direction of my wandering around, as it seems to take several seconds for things to start getting really freaky in my field of view.
