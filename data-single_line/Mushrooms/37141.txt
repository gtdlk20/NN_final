T +2:45 I go upstairs to use the bathroom and marvel at how interesting everything in the house is.  I suspect that this is what a child feels like when experiencing the world for the first time.  I have no prejudices.  I experience each object for exactly what it is as my mind refuses to fill in any blanks for me.  I look in the mirror for awhile in the bathroom.  I see no visual distortions and assume this to mean that I have a balanced and positive view of myself.  This makes me feel good.  I had promised Kevin that I would play guitar with him, but when I leave the bathroom I find J in the family room and we stare at some photos for awhile, both seeing the same distortions.  We then sit down and I experience a strong mental connection with her.  This is the beginning of the telepathy that will continue between Me, E and J for the whole night.  We both talk about how we wish we could share this understanding with others, but there is a verbal and experiential barrier.
