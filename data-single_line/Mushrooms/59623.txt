Time seemed very distorted and what was 3 or so hours seemed to take a whole day to pass by. I had heard about people tripping on fly agaric for days, and still not coming out of it totally for years. I didn't know if this was true when I heard it but when I was on liberty caps, I honestly didn't think that after hallucinating so much I would ever come out of my state. This made me extremely petrified and I actually remember quoting to Tim and Pete 'I don't think I am ever gonna stop tripping' This was near the end of the night when things started to get dodgy and at one point found myself being sick down the toilet thinking I was going to die.
