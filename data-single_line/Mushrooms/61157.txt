The night was spent watching movies; I don't think I would have been capable of anything else.  I am a psilocybe veteran and this is without a doubt the most mind blowing experience I have ever had.  And it was one mushroom!!  This was the third flush of a liquid culture produced casing.  I guess the fungus is getting stronger as I am getting older.
