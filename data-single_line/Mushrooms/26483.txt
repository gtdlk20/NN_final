So, what the hell. I already know it's bad to take psychedelics too often, having done that for a few years until I had sapped all value out of them for a pretty good span of time. I already know some psychedelics are essentially worthless. I have come across no phenethylamines, for example, that tune in to the holy God-energy. Most of them have an amphetamine-based energy. Mescaline comes closest, and is a great spirit teacher. But learning from a spirit teacher is different from tapping to the universal and multi-dimensional God-energy waves.
