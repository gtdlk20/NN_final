Then the rest of the night I sat at the table we were at and everyone was trying to make me feel good and it was helping a lot. My trip turned out to be pretty cool once it was all over. I look back on that night to this day and I say that was one of the best nights I have had my whole entire life. Even though I had a bad trip its not going to stop me from trying it again.
