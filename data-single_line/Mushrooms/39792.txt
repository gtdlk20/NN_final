I had recently received about 8 grams of Cubensis Mushrooms from a friend of mine who had been growing them in Colorado.  After sitting on them for a while, I decided to make a short trip to San Francisco (I live in Santa Cruz so it was only an hour drive north) to see a friend (henceforth known as 'T') and munch the mushrooms in an attempt at a friendly afternoon trip.  The day was windy, partly cloudy, and we were in good spirits.  We were both experienced trippers.
