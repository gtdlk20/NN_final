1:10: I went to the bathroom and then I noticed that everything was moving. A towel on the floor was swaying around like a leaf but interestingly it never got further or closer to or from anything else in the room, the walls and sink and everything seemed to move around the towel to compensate for the swaying. I was amused and yet nervous about this. Because wellÂ…towels don't move by themselves.
