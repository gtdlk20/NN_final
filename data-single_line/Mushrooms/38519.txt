My previous first time affairs with drugs had always been troublesome to say the least. My first Ecstasy experience was very negative yet after using the drug more often and learning from my negative experiences I always thought I had a tight grasp on reality. However this was my first Mushroom trip and I was determined to show myself I could handle it. With a mind set of ignorance and arrogance, I assumed after previous frightening experiences with loss of reality and such, I could take anything that came my way.
