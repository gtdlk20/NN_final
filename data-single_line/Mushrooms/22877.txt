I'm convinced I had such a moment Thursday night when I was under the influence of psylocibin. No, there were no paradigm shifting discoveries or get rich quick schemes to be found. What I decided to explore that night was the inner realm of my psyche. As such, this post will be selfish. I will be writing entirely about myself and the specific struggles of my own life. There are no grand overarching lessons to be learned - unless you create them for yourself - and there are no immutable truths to be found - unless you can see clearer than I.
