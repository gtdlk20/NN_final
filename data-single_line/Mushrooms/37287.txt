Convinced that I was dead, I began to think about my family and friends and how they'd react to the news of my death. Not great stuff to consider. I got up and walked around the house, acting as if my concerned friend and his parents weren't actually who they appeared to be, then walked out into the street and walked half way up it before my friend's father came out to stop me. I demanded to know 'Who are you?'. His response was, 'I'm your friend's dad'. I said 'Yes, yes, I know you look like him, but who are you really?'. Heh.
