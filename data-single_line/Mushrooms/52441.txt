I also felt and thought that what I am missing from my daily life is a quiet meditative space.  That when I use the mushrooms I act in the way I would choose to act more often.  Integrating the meditative, contemplative, quiet, connected feelings that I produce and act when seeking Spirit with mushrooms, may be more effective than doing the mushrooms themselves.
