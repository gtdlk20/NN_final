A put on some music through little speakers he had brought. He put on 'Carry On' by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. It was by far the most beautiful song I had ever heard. Part of the lyrics are 'Carry on, love is coming, love is coming to us all' and I realized that yes, love IS coming! And what a euphoric feeling that was. I could feel myself sinking deeper and deeper into the chair. Before long I had no idea how to get out of the chair, if getting out of the chair was possible, or if reality even existed outside of the chair.
