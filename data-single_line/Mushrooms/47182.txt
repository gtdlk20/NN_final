The aftermath was quite mild. We just went to see some friends and smoked a few joints and drank some beer. I didn't feel exhausted, I was only hungry because we skipped dinner. I did feel a bit irritated towards my trip-partner, but that lasted only three days. I really needed to overthink what I had experienced, since it was so intense. This trip changed my view on the whole world. I already knew it was all fucked up and useless. But it's more clearly now and it has given me the strength to share these thoughts with other people.
