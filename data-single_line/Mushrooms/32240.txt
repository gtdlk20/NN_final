But in those 5 hours I learned about myself, my fears and how to control them. I learned that the mind is a powerful tool. I also let go of a lot of things I had been suppressing and I bonded with my friends in an amazing way. I also felt the presence of God. It was just a 5 hour trip but it seemed like a 5 year journey. Now, every time I tell people about shrooms, I won't ask did you have a good 'trip'? I will ask, 'How was the journey'?
