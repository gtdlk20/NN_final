The second time I ever did mushrooms when I was 16 I had a terrifying experience. I wasn't very familiar with mushies yet (my first trip was a low dose of cubes) so I didn't really know the respect that a high dose of psychedelics demands. Hell I figured it would just be like being high on cannabis with more visuals. Anyways, somehow I managed to come up on around 4 grams of Cyans and a few grams of some dank.
