Up until here, the experience has been reasonably easy to describe. But now I am getting to the real deep part of the trip, the part that defies any attempt to put it into words that accurately describe to others what I was experiencing. All I can possibly convey is a pale ghost of my thoughts and feelings. Also, after this point my memory of the trip becomes a bit fragmented. A sure sign of going a little too far out, that recollection of the experience, the ability to bring it back and integrate it with the sober mindstate, becomes difficult.
