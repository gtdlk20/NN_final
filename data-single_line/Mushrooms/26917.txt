Again, like last time I could speak in tongues.  When I spoke in these tongues it was a fast almost gibberish sounding made by the rapid tongue movement.  When done quietly I could speak with tongues on the in breath.  I called it round breath, as in round trip, both ways.  Under tongue also fits it nicely.  This highly evolved language is used to communicate with 'Lord' besides when he prophesizes, when I am making friendly conversation with Him.
