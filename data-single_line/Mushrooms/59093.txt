I finally got home, I still felt a little funny but I was sober enough to be around my mom (thank god). But my mom wasn't home. I looked in the mirror that night and studied my pupils, they were getting bigger and smaller. One would grow and the other would shrink, this happened for a while, but I didn't really care. All I could think about was the next time I would do that again and how much I couldn't wait. That was the best day of my whole lifeÂ…well, kinda. J
