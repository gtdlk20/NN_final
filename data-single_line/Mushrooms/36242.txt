I waited until Saturday.  At about 4:30pm I went to one of the cafeterias on campus and bought a cheeseburger.  I took it home and opened it up and put the eigth of shrooms inside it.  That was a horrible burger, it tasted so dry and dead but I didn't care since I knew they would taste awful.  I remember looking at the clock, when prep was done and I had finally eaten the entire burger it was 4:53pm.
