We steeped into the lobby and walked around for a bit my friend M didn't understand I was having the time of my life and that I was in awe with everything. After about 10 mins of walking around the lobby I suggested that we roam the city he said okay but he wanted to get everyone. Then he left, and I was alone but this didn't bother me I had written a note on my hand that told me what room I was staying in. When I re-enterd the room everyone stared at me in shock wondering where M was. Apparently he got lost, which seems incredibly fucking stupid to me since I was tripping and he was sober. Anyways about 5 mins later he arrived and they began drinking vodka 80 proof. I just sat down at my window again completely memorized by the insane ass colors. My mind was in a state of utter bliss. It seemed almost impossible for it to go wrong. Holy fuck was I wrong.
