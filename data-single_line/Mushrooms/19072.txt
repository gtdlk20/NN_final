Goopstar shook up the brew and took the first sip, passing it clockwise around the circle to Cory, who sipped and then passed it to me. Before drinking, I held the brew up and consciously stated my intention, I am calling in healing on all levels of my being. I felt the need to heal myself of my recurring sickness. Then I sipped too, and passed it on my left to Miel, who passed it to Alice. Round and round the brew went, four full rotations before we had finished it.
