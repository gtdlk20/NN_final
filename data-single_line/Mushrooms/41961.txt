Me and my friends were planning to go to the park. The day before going I was able to get some mushrooms. Me and my best friend decided it would be a good time for her first trip. Over half of our friends said it would be a bad idea to trip there and thought it would turn out bad. We thought we could handle it and ignored them. We were confident that we would be alright, especially since we had no fear of rides.
