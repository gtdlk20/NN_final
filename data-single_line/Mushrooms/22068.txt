Then I heard two tones. I do not exaggerate Â– in fact words elude me to properly describe them- yet I will say they were the most beautiful, utterly feminine, sweetest two tones I had ever heard. My entire body was bathed head to toe in pure love. I sighed and wanted to cry from the beauty. I wanted to hear them again. They never sounded repeated. I guess there was no need.  The other music continued. It was a male voice and I decided that rather than just listening I would try to join the conversation musically. I imagined what I would play if I had a guitar with me. I began JAMMING with the mushroom gods! Oddly, my notes seemed to play BEFORE I actually thought of what to play!
