John and I have taken mushrooms together a lot in the last few years (about once every two months), without difficulties. I've eaten from this batch twice before and John once before, and several friends as well, without any problems. This was the first time I made a tea out of this batch, but a friend of mine had made a tea in the same manner once before.
