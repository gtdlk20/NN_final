Recently, I moved into my own apartment in a quiet neighbourhood with lots of trees.  It was a sunny Saturday afternoon and I planned to do nothing but just enjoy the place after two weeks of unpacking and painting.  Having tried shrooms twice previously, I enjoyed them immensely and found I had quite the affinity for them (or them for me).  It seemed like a perfect time to finish off some remaining shrooms I had, as I'd heard that tripping could be particularly pleasant on a sunny days.  It also seemed like a good time to try tripping on my own, and given the serene atmosphere I was only slightly uncomfortable with this.  I'm not sure of the exact dose, but I estimate about 1 gram.  I thought it would be a mild trip, so I was not to be disappointed.  As you shall see, I will never look at houseplants in quite the same way again....
