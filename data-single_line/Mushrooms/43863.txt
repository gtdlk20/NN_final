Anyways I drive and pick my two friends up, we're talking on the drive there about what it's going to be like. Where we were going is a little camping spot that me and an old friend of mine use to go to because it's very scenic and it's like out of the way so no strangers will happen upon us. We get there and make the hike down towards the river where our spot will be, there's a little marshy section that you have to traverse in order to get there.
