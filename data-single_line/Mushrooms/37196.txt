Saturday, Nov. 17th. Imagine after finally arranging a mushroom hookup on their way to your house, that there is to be a meteor shower that very night; in my 6 years as an overly-curious psychonaut, I don't think I have ever been as excited. This was my first serious intense trip with mushrooms, having only tried at most a half 1/8th on a few occasions and being somewhat disappointed with them. I had expected something more geometrical and structured, like my brain had become accustomed to with 600+ hits of LSD throughout the years. The following is the most accurate account I can give of the most intense connection with the world I have ever felt, and the most wonderful memories a person could carry with them to the grave.
