Five days later I had the afternoon off work and with my previous good experience in mind decided to buy some more.  On opening the tub at home I thought the mushrooms looked somehow wrong.  They were exactly the same type as before but appeared a bit shrivelled and had what I think might have been some sort of mould on them.  With hindsight I should have trusted my instincts but at the time I thought 'I've just spent Â£10 on these, i can't just throw them away'.  So I brewed them up and swallowed them down.
