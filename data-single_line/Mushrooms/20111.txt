Suddenly the show was over, and I was drawn back into the world around me.  I felt very happy.  I went back into the museum and started exploring my altered senses.  They had a big well that steel balls rolled around in to demonstrate the effect of gravity on orbits.  The balls left long tracers behind them, and seemed to spin and turn of their own accord, almost like they were alive.
