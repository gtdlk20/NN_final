My sense of body position disintegrates  I get proprioceptive tracers, and when I move my hand I feel its presence lag behind. I quickly move to one side, but it doesnt feel like it stops  it feels like I throw it to the side into infinity. At some point I realize that a disproportionate amount of my body perception seems to be focused on the face and hands, and I wonder if it could be related to the somatosensory homunculus.
