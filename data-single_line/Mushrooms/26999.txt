I realize this is all kind of long winded and you prolly donÂ’t care too much but I think its necessary background for my little story here. So, as the concepts behind meditation, the teachings, and their desired goal started to become a little clearer to me I became a bit more interested in the effects of hallucinogens and the possibilities of experiencing the world (and primarily, experiencing myself) from an altered perspective.
