On my trip I found myself constantly touching things just to make sure they were really there. I finally got to B's house and his first reacting was 'Man, you look fucked up! What the hell are you on?' I told him I was shroomin face and he just laughed at me and called me an idiot. He invited me in and he proceeded to tell everyone I was whached out of my mind. Even his mom (she's cool and didn't care). The time is now almost midnight. It took me over 3 and a half hours to walk 5 miles. I don't know why, or where I went. I just know I eventually made it there. This was the only time I was so messed up that I turned down weed. B and his friends who were there (who were also my friends, although, not as good as they were B'), and me all went into B's room. They smoked one of the fattest rolled blunts I've ever seen, and I just layed on the bed in his tiny room. The room was so baked that I was coughing from just breathing the air. All the while I'm staring at his wall tripping my face off, and thinking that I'm going to die from eating poisonous mushrooms.
