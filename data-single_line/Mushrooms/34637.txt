I now had 12 grams of premium mushrooms bubbling in my stomache and sending me into a cartoon wonderland.  I was completely torn from reality and sent into a state of pure nirvana where I floated in a limbo like world.  I was still having glimpes of the real world and it seemed as if I teleported from the drum circle to concert with my friends.  By this time it was 1 a.m. and the festival was in full gear.  The band was jammin and the lights from the stage caught my eye.  They flowed in a wave like pattern to my eyes and almost had a separate water like sound to them.  I looked up into the star filled sky and just as I did someone had fired off a firework which looked like a spider when it exploded.  The spider stayed in the sky and then seemed to grab me and sling shot me into space.
