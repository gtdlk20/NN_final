We decided to take a break and we sat down. M bought some chips and found he was staring into the worker's soul as she tried to get him to pay the £1.30; he just gave her a handful of change. She could sort through it all. As he came back to the table he looked incredibly pleased with himself for buying the chips. He didnt finish them. He got a major case of the giggles and some guy with an attitude thought he was laughing at him, luckily we diffused his complaints. Otherwise a fight would have occurred.
