The mushroom spirits wanted me to undergo more dismemberment but I told them that I couldn't deal with any more that night The mushroom spirits wanted me to undergo more dismemberment but I told them that I couldn't deal with any more that night so they relented, realising that otherwise I would crack up. During the evening the mushroom spirits were communicating with me telepathically and they told me that I had to go into and merge with the wall. After doing this I got a glimpse of the mushroom spirit. He was a little man who closely resembled a mushroom and talked in a variety of voices (he sang like a virgin in a high pitched female voice and then started talking in a gruff northern accent).
