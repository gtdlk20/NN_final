As I sat and watched my friends eat, I stared at the ceiling which was now beginning to move slowly back and forth, as if it was breathing.  Then the light from the candles began to move higher than naturally possible along the walls and was dancing, it was very beautiful.  After leaving the restaurant I went back to my other friend who'd eaten the mushrooms with me.  We were both extremely happy to see each other, but now we were feeling the effects, which were becoming very intense.  We both felt very confused, and couldn't decide what to do.  We were in our friend's bedroom, who was laughing at us because of a similar experience he'd once had, and trying to decide whether or not to go to this party.
