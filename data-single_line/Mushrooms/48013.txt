Initial effects took about twenty minutes, we felt the familiar comfortable feeling in our limbs and a slight clouding of the mind. Soon after this I had my only strong hallucination of the whole experience: As I stood in the garden the stones seemed to form a pattern which began to extend around me, eventually I was left standing with this pattern stretching infinitely in every direction. Those who initially intended to observe then had to leave. We decided to walk the two girls who had initially been with us back home. The journey involved a long hill which it took us a very long time to travel down. We left those we were walking with at the bottom of the hill and began walking up.
