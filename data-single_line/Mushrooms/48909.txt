I got kind of sick of just sitting there, so I got up and wandered back to my room.  I went into the bathroom and placed my hands on the white tile; only then did I notice that it was really setting in.  My body felt incredible, like the deepest orgasm ever, just lasting... I studied my hands against the tile, and I could intricate rainbow patterns around my hands and spreading up the walls.  I wondered why I hadn't noticed before.  My hands, too, were covered with intricacies; all the little lines made fascinating patterns that I just stared at, all the while feeling amazing just being in my body.
