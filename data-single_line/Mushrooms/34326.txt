The trip I'm going to tell you about is from my first ever grown mushroom. I was with a friend at my place and decided to take 3.5 g of mexican shrooms in lemon juice. My mistake was to take mushrooms with this guy who never took before, and for a while he was very annoying because he wouldnÂ’t just shut up. That been said, let me tell me about my trip.
