Noticing my discomfort, Albus took his trip sitter title seriously. He retrieved a surprise from the van - a newly finished drawing he said he hoped I especially would get a kick out of. When he unveiled it, I gasped. Clearly, this beautiful illustration mirrored a photograph Id taken after stumbling upon a solitary chair in a dark, dusty, empty barn one day. It was marvelous, better than the original photo; I really wanted to gaze longer but every object in my vision was breathing, swirling, bulging, and shrinking, the contents of Albuss picture included. The more I stared, the more it moved, and the more I panicked.
