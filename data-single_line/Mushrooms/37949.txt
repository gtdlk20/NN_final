At 1700 I ingested 2mgs of DOI in a water solution of 1mg to 1ml. My friend with me took 1 mg. After about half an hour I could detect something there but it wasnt very strong. This gradually increased at a slow pace with slight colour enahncement, jaw tension and a feeling of anticipation. If I wasnt aware of how long this drug took to come up then I would definately have been tempted to do more at the 2 hour point. I didnt however, but did take another mg at 2000, as did my friend, with my girlfriend having 1 1/2 mgs also.
