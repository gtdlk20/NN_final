My sister and I sat on the bed, Z sat propped up against the desk, while Y sat on the futon in the middle of the room.  After a short while, Z looked totally spaced out, a drooping smile on his face, I knew he was having a good time.  At one point my sister stood up rapidly, with a peaceful smile that told me everything was alright, and I saw as she turned towards me, golden light echoing from behind her strawberry blonde hair, and I was instantly reminded of so many images of Jesus.  She looked like an angel.  She gave me a warm smile and I smile backed.  On the other hand, I looked over to the slouching image of Z, and his black buzz cut blurred and formed horns.  He looked to me like a demon sent to Earth to cause mischief and mayhem.  He gave me a devilish grin that seemed to say: 'I know you know who I am.'
