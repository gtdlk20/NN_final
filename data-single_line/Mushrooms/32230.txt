I decided to go to the toilet again. When I got up on the toilet platform, I became extremely giggly and started laughing uncontrollably. I became so happy and so liberated. I felt that I was free from every single chain that had held me down in the past. I was so happy I took off my shorts and just started to move about. Then I saw this giant sitting on the bench near the toilet, and I started talking to him although I can't remember what I said. Then K brought me back down to our table and that was when something extremely empowering and enlightening happened. Whenever I listen to music I often close my eyes and imagine out a perfect dance routine for the song or piece I'm listening to. In this fantasy I am of course a superb dancer with incredible skill. In real life of course I haven't danced for at least 5 years or so and I stopped ballet training at the age of 13. But on that day, I felt like the dancer in my fantasy. Skilled and confident. I started dancing in my spot at first. Really feeling the music. And before I knew it I was dancing in front of the whole bar. Spinning on the poles, doing acrobatics from table to table. I was performing for the crowd and loving every minute of it. I was on a high from having an audience to perform to. It made be deliriously happy. I was doing stuff that I never thought I could or would do. I hadn't been this flexible in a long time. I was executing all kinds of moves that were very uncharacteristic of my personality and also my physical ability. It was then that I had my 'Aha' moment: everything really is in the mind. Our physical abilities are really only limited by our mental barriers.
