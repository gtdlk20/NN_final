Around +2 hours into the trip, as we're walking back to my house, B turns to me again and tells me that his stomach is starting to hurt really bad.  I ask him if he's going to throw up and he doesnt say anything.  Me being on shrooms, having a fairly good time, and my friend looking pretty bad, I start to get a little paranoid.  Around 10:15 we are on my street about 3 minutes away from my house.  Neither B or me is talking.  B then turns to me and in a scared voice says; 'Man, just talk.. say something, anything..'  I guess the silence and increased awareness was really starting to scare him. I tell him we're almost home.
