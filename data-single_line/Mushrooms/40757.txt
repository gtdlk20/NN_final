My first time doing any illicit substance was mushrooms (3.5g) two months prior. It wasnt the heroic dose, so I still desired to know whether consuming a greater amount would provide an even more profound experience. Perhaps contact with other entities? A more profound ego death? The inconceivable? This is a report about my experience with 6.1g.
