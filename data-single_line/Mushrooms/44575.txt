Soon after I'd say t+2:00 my girlfriend fell asleep I looked at her for a while because she looked so beautiful.  She was wearing a black shirt and her eye was shaded and it r came out to me like her shirt was outer space and her eye was a hole through her face where I could see into the universe.  This in turn made me think about god and if this drug really did get me closer to it.  The world aroung me started to seem holographic which became proof enough for me.  So worried about upsetting god by peeking into his alternate reality (hey I was shrooming!), I decided to close my eyes and listen to some music.  I decided on some soft classical which turned out to be amazing.  Fuck techno this was incredible.  I could actually see the music.  I saw the notes come into exisance and fade away with swirls of color, soo mistical.  After that I started to come down, and I reflected on the journey.  I had so many insights and the visuals were everything I've dreamed of it  was amazing but at the same time overwellmingly frightining.  All in all I needed this trip to happen to me, it has made my life more intreguing.
