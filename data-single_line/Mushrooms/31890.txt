Following a week of rain, I discovered an untouched patch of golden tops around the corner from my house. After picking and drying these specimens I was left with 10g of dried mushrooms. After a week of storing them in a glass jar, I ate 2g and tripped in my room. The experience left me with an odd and unsettling vibe, seeing as I had things to do and was not able to properly enjoy the trip. My mind was solely focused on the tasks I had yet to finish.
