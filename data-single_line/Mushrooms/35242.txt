This particular experience wasn't my first, but was the most profound experience I have had. That morning I had listened to Soul Coughing on the bus ride to school (this is an imporant fact for later). Upon entering the school, I was approached by a good friend, who produced the mush, and suggested that that day would be a good day to indulge. (I would suggest not taking any psychedelic at school.)
