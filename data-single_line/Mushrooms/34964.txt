This is the time I had been waiting for as it was the time my last trip fully kicked in.  It didn't feel half as strong, although I was getting some open eye visuals that looked more like closed eye visuals.  Little eyes of random color creeping over my vision, but not actually physically affecting the room around me.  I was sort of disappointed, but now completely relaxed.
