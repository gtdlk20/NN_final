I recently picked a crop of three different strains: Cambodian, Brazilian and Golden Teacher, it was roughly 50 grams of fresh Psilocybe Cubensis. I was hoping to do them as individual strains but this flush did not produce the necessary dose of 50 grams of the individual strains so I had to mix the strains and even use a little dried to get the equivalent of 50 grams fresh.
