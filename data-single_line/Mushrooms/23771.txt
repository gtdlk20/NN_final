I finally snapped back into reality and I saw that J had found a garbage bag and thought it would be fun to get inside of it.  With much struggle, he had managed to get lost inside it and couldnt find his way out.  I found this very amusing, as did the others.  I found it very difficult to hold back laughter.  I felt as if I was in some sort of circus or zoo with all of us running around laughing uncontrollably.  All I can really remember thinking is how much fun I was having and repeating it over and over in my head.  We all decided it would be fun to go for a ride in my car.  None of us were willing to drive (fortunately), so we called up a sober friend.  S agreed to drive us around because he needed some entertainment.
