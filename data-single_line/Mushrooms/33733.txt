He is the leader and he begins telling me about the people he has seen while walking earlier. The park we have chosen for our trip is full of bizarre, generally shady, and interesting characters. The people he points out, coupled with his way of describing them, is completely hilarious to me. A white guy rapping, walking around in a bush, listening to his headphones. A weird looking guy in a car just staring at us, presumably doing nothing else. A Mexican guy wearing a bright green shirt. As we walk around, he describes each person in a manner that I find incredibly hilarious. I feel like he is both leading me around the park and leading me into the world of mushrooms. It was partially his earlier glowing experiences that persuaded me to try the drug. He explains to me that mushrooms can be enjoyed on a goofy level, but they can also be something more serious. This is a theme that we expand upon as our journey continues.
