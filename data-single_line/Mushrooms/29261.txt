The time took on a very strange appearance during the whole trip. Sometimes it went very fast, sometimes slow, sometimes it didnt exist at all. Same happened with the appearance of existence of everything. While we were having some conversations with A, it felt like, even though he was talking about himself, he was talking about me too, and everything that existed. I had the impression that everything is just a big cosmic joke, a play, a theater, where we play different roles to experience and keep ourselves entertained. It felt like everything is one and same, part of the same oneness, like a multifaced god. I also could see different faces of A very clearly  sometimes I could see him talking from his ego, which annoyed me, sometimes it was his inner child, that I just wanted to take care of and caress. And later on, I could see his beautiful divine masculine soul.
