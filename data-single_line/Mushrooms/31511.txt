(2-6 hrs) We lay in my bed. I pulled up my shirt and let the air just flow over my stomach. I felt an unbelievable sense of peace wash over me. I thought my stomach looked so strange. I could see my heartbeat near my belly button and was fascinated by the way my stomach went up and down with my breath. I felt very disconnected from my body. I knew that my body was just my shell . My boyfriend was really enjoying the music and I was really enjoying watching him. He kept talking about the music and he started using a weird voice occasionally in his speech. His pupils looked so dilated and it gave him a wild look. It kind of freaked me out but not in a scary way because I felt so connected to him. I knew that if he started to get too crazy for me I could calm him down.
