My internal dialogue was as erratic as a schizophrenic on acid at a circus.  Its time to die boy, its time to die, I heard a demonic voice tell me.  Do you accept initiation into this order? Another strange shimmering voice asked me. I began to see the Masonic symbol of the crossed compass and ruler looming in the air above me.  Do you want me to rip your spirit to shreds? Grind your bones and make gelatin to feed the legions of the underworld? Do you want me to castrate your soul? Chimed in another demonic voice  Do you accept initiation to this order? Repeated the strange shimmering voice.  Im the master of thirty three. Im the supreme council of the highest degree. I bathe in blood and swim in esoteric seas. Sacrificial rites of iron and stone is my decree. Follow me and join the elite. So mote it be! So mote it be! Uttered still another voice.  My body quaked and shivered. I felt a surge of intense power move up from the ground to my feet and then to my brain. I took a step back, tossed my head back and then threw it forward.  Die!  Do you accept initiation to this order boy?  No! I replied to the evil voices.  I heaved out what looked like a ten foot jet stream of black putrid projectile vomit. It filled the toilet. The vile substance bubbled and smoldered. I could see demonic faces within the noxious mass. Their claws reached for me from the bathroom fixture.
