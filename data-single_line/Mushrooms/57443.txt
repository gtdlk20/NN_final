Being anywhere else from the moment I took the shrooms was like a new world. As the minutes went buy laughter filled the air. I didn't know why they were laughing but I couldn't help but laugh at the things I was seeing. It's about an hour and a half or so into the trip and I was loving it as well as my friends.
