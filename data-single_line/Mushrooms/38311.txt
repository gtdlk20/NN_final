As I realized this and began to accept it as a truthful notion it was almost as if I happened to bump right into myself. Not the same self that looks back at me in the mirror every morning, but a self that presented to me a new attitude or vantage point of things. It was a self that felt very familiar to me, but one that had not been visited in quite some time. For a moment it felt as if time stood completely still. I took in a deep breath and felt a strong sense of tranquility. It felt as if I stepped outside of myself and was feeling a separate consciousness than what I had felt before.
