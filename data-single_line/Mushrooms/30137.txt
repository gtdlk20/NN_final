So much more could be (and was) said, but in the end, those things shall be recalled from secrecy to mind by us, when we read this testament, and we end this record here with the thankful affirmation to the Universe that it was a successful Synergy of Magical and Medicine paths for us, the first rather than the last.  We re-integrated with normal life below the painted off-limits lines a little wiser, a little more focused on next steps and refreshed, and leave this testimony here for future discovery and reflection.
