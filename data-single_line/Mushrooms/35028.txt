I dont recall how long it had been. I was sitting in a chair completely oblivious to the people sitting right next to me playing Mario kart but we ended up heading to a nearby park. This was where the trip became the most intense, we walked outside and I connected myself with reality once more. We stood near 3s car, which was sitting about twenty feet from us and five feet beyond that was a large tree. Everyone was standing around for some reason I could not understand and I was feeling very uneasy. I looked up at 3 and he was obviously taking a new shape. 3s shape became very dinosaur-like. This may be due to my recent viewing of the movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas where people became dinosaurs under the influence of LSD.
