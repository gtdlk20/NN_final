5:40- we were almost off the trail, the trail looked like it had words all printed out on the gravel. No words at all existed of course, I knew that, but it seemed like an endless scramble of words were laid out all over the trail, none of which I could make out. When we got off the trail we went to the mall, where we went to a John Deer store, it looked so colorful. We read a couple of  children books, which we were absorbed into. Then we would come back to reality and try to act cool, but it was impossible. We left the mall and out to wendy's resturaunt. I wanted no food. My stomach was fine, but I was not in the mood for food, I was tripping. There were bad vibrations coming from everyone I felt. My friend devoured a meal, which did not look pleasing at all. I only had coke, which seemed to not go to my stomach, but to my throat and then would dissolve into all parts of my body, I had no stomach. I felt pretty trippy, I wanted to reach my hand inside my body, and throw out the mushrooms, I wanted it out of my bloodstream and brain, I tore up a burger wrapper in frustration of wanting this feeling gone. It felt like a medical pill high, but bad, like an o.d of pills
