Eight pm I tipped the dry earthy heap into my mouth and swallowed with a glass of water, not easily. No going back now. I put on some light music and lay back down on my bed, waiting for my extremely trippy room to start connecting with me. If you truly want an amazing psychedellic environment my room is absolutely perfect. Cedar wood walls are tiger skin like and look psychedellic when sober. All of the extremely detailed drawings on my walls accrued over the years from talented friends create characters in the trip that, dance, morph and stare into you. I knew this from prior experience.
