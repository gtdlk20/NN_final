I ended up with about a quarter ounce of dried mushrooms, enough in my mind to provide 3 people with 3 nice trips, as I had experienced with Adam 3 years ago. I had wanted to share the experience with my wife and another friend of mine, Ann. Coincidentally Adam had come up with another quarter himself and he and his wife decided to join us.
