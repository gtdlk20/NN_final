We ate three grams of shrooms in Chris' room.  His room is the perfect setting for a psychedelic trip.  He has a black fury carpet, but his ceiling isnt finished (his room is in the basement).  From his ceiling he has old CD's hanging from string and has black, red, and green lights throubnout his room.  On his walls he has miniature pepsi signs painted on and a Molson Canadian logo which covers the whoe wall.  He also has a beer can plane hanging from his ceiling.
