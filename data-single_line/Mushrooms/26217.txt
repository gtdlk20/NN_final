Over this period of time, I could feel the mushrooms taking effect. Colors appeared very bright, and my depth perception was somewhat skewed. Time also began to slow down a little bit. I also looked at pictures and posters on my wall, and they seemed to be rippling on the surface of water. My sentences became less coherent as my conversation with Nick progressed, and I became giddy with excitement to the point where I couldn't help but giggle as I spoke to him about how tonight was going to rock, and all things regarding drugs, etc.
