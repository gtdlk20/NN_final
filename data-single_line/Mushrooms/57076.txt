In all, I would say it was a great experience, maybe not one I will ever do again, but certainly worth every ounce of it, even the uncomfortable stages. I was happy I drank a lot of fruit juice, dressed classy and confidently, and was with people who were willing to adapt with me and most importantly, WENT WITH THE FLOW!
