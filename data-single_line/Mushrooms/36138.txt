Music takes on a brand new meaning while on mushrooms. It seems to pick me up and carry me with it. Pictures sing along with it, and it takes on a whole new sound that I simply donÂ’t hear when sober. It's impossible to understand anything being said in music. Its all one sound, coming near me and drawing away (yes, even sound contorts and moves), totally surrounding me and comforting me. Being a musician myself, I love music. But my perception of music is forever changed for the better. Music is beautiful while on mushrooms. Everything is beautiful.
