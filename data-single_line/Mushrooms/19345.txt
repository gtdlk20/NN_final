I became very silent and internal for awhile, beating myself up and feeling a little dead inside. The wonderous realizations of life being an amazing gift we should be grateful for I questioned too, by association of having them along with my delusional thoughts. I was now feeling very alone. Before, I felt like everyone was on the same page as me, but now I felt that there was nobody who truly understood me.
