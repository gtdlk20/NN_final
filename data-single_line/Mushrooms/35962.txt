The presence (who I still have not found out her name, but I am currently calling her my 'spirit guide')  was touching me from above, but I felt her 'arms' (not really like arms, but that's the best I can describe them, and there were more than two) reaching into me and touching my back, and all the parts of my body that are in pain.  I have major back problems, and my back, neck and shoulders were hurting especially bad last night after the long day we had.  She was moving my head, shoulders, and body into positions that would be more comfortable for me and relieve the pain.  She was telling me without words that I would be okay, that everything I had been worrying about with my pain, my reliance on my painkillers, and relationship problems with J and my family, were all going to be okay and that everything would work out.  I believed and trusted 'her' totally (I don't know why I say she's a woman, I couldn't see her or hear a voice, but I felt like she was female, and that she had blond hair (?)  I also felt like she had a feline quality...like she was part cat and part woman.  No, not the Catwoman).
