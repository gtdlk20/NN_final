After ingesting the mushrooms, as the intensity of experience slowly increased, I noticed something strange and distinct compared to my previous mushroom journeys...patterns, geometrical shapes of a kind I had never seen before. I recognized them as being Aztec-like. I saw Aztec gods, giving me knowledge, telling me secrets, leading me through some kind of ancient places, they told me how this life is a test, which we must pass. I saw their buildings, it was very realistic, everything. I saw one temple, and on the top of it, there was some bright golden light with was radiating the most beautiful light ever, radiating light and love. I encountered some kind of jaguar people, which were very friendly and loving. I relived the experiences and memories of Aztec people. On one occasion, when my sitter asked me if I was alright, I looked at him, and clearly saw him dressed as an Aztec priest. Interestingly, afterwards I read an account of the late, great Dr Albert Hofmann who ingested 3.2g of dried lab grown P. mexicana mushrooms to bioassay them for psychoactivity, and he reported exactly the same thing! 'When the doctor supervising the experiment bent over to check my blood pressure, he was transformed into an Aztec priest, and I would not have been astonished had he drawn an obsidian knife.'
