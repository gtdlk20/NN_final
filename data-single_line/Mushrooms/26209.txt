At about 9:30, however, my desire to trip grew large enough to eclipse my good judgement. I promised myself I would take a full eighth of an ounce at 10:30, and I made all the necessary preparations. I dressed in very comfortable clothing, in layers so I could take off some clothing as my body heat rose (as it tends to do while tripping). I also got some vitamin C lozenges, orange juice, and water to help get the mushrooms down.
