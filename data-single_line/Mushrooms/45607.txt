The third individual in the small group has been studying to apply for entrance into a nursing program. When asked what she was experiencing, she noted that she asked them to show her DNA, and was taken down into the double-helix to directly perceive the amino acid structures and the links between them. She asked to see metabolic processes occurring in the organ systems and was taken into the individual cell structure to apprehend it with direct awareness. The mushroom indicated to her that it would assist her in achieving her goals and open doors for her. As she explained these experiences to me, I recalled my own awakening, facilitated by serious work with the mushroom, begun over 40 years ago, to discovering my own destiny, and the promise and encouragement of the spirit in the mushroom to assist me in reaching what, at the time, appeared to be very lofty goals; all of which have been fulfilled beyond my wildest imagining. On an everyday level, the windhorse is also very much linked to what is commonly known as good luck.'
