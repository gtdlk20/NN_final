This leads to the realization that I should eat healthy. I look at the food and for the first time, notice all the grease, saturated fats, and everything bad that comes with it along the line. Heart disease, being fat, dying young, and how if I ever have a family, it would be sad for me to pass away because of not eating right. I decide on leading a healthier lifestyle, since then I've lost 15lbs.
