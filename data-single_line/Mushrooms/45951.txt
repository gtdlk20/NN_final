1:15 PM - It's been almost an hour after ingestion and I'm feeling a very light, mild relaxation and general chilled attitude. *Slight* slurring of words which my friends notice but they don't tease me that much about it. They're playing xbox, assassins creed, and the environment is very relaxed. I feel comfortable with everyone here and it feels like I've just had one or 2 drinks, without the dizziness or messiness- just an all over light numbing sensation, it feels very clean and smooth. I'm a little hungry so I ate a banana and take a multivitamin+minerals tablet (I always take one a day).
