The five of us arrived at the Oregon Coast around 4:00 PM. We set up our camp, and proceeded to bring our other supplies down to the main beach area. We had plans to make a natural sweat lodge on the beach. We rolled large round stones underneath our bonfire so they would soak up the heat of the evening fire, later to be rolled into our sweat lodge for heat. I insisted that everyone should fast as much as possible before eating the mushrooms. Nate and Steve whined about their hunger, so Pete dolled them small amounts of organic nuts. Everything was as ready as it could be.
