As my body started to tingle and my ego started to fade I saw my vision start to blur and I started to hear a loud buzz or hum. I slowly took the blanket off my head and saw fantastic colors all around the room. As the shrooms intensified I found myself slowly falling off the bed, once on the floor my ego was dead. I was stuck looking at some sort of force. Way too difficult to see and and too intence to find out what is was. I belive it was my spirit of some sort. My mind started to boggle at this time, I had really bad retrospectives on my personality.
