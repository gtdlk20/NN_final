So S comes over and we take my car around town.  I feel lost, disoriented, and confused whenever I actually have to do something.  Any simple responsibilities we had for the rest of the night, such as going to the bathroom, walking, finding something, etc., became known to us as our burdens.  We had several words and phrases throughout the night that only us four understood.  I usually experience this sort of connection with others while I am tripping.  I felt very connected to them in many ways, and still do because of the experience.
