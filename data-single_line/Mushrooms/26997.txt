I had wanted to try mushrooms for a long time before I had actually gotten around to my first experience. At first it was more of an Im young and I love getting fucked up, well Ill give myself a little more credit than that. I had taken LSD thrice before and had some very profound (also very morbid) thoughts and experiences. As I kind of grew out of my self imposed stereotyped role of teenage rebellion and sank more into my self imposed stereotyped role of a 20 something beginning down the path of self realization and drinking too much coffee. I also began reading Buddhist literature and trying to understand my mind and this world, through meditation and the teachings.
