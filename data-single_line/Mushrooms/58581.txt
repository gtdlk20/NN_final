I quickly return back to the nodding out state I was explaining about before. This time I don't even realize who I am.  I am forgetting where I am, what's going on, and everything; my mind as a whole, is just a mess. I quickly look around 'in my head' and see my personality broken down in a few (I don't remember I think it was like 5) different people. They are all doing their own thing, and I am some how observing them all from 3rd person. This is incredible to me, because I still have this sobor personality, while watching these images and such in my head. This fasinates me for what seems like hours, but really was probably not much longer then 20-40 minutes.
