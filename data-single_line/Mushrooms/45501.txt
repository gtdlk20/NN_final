I fell asleep pretty fast and then woke up about half hour later drenched in sweat. I was overheated so badly so I got out of bed and tried to open my window and find some water. As soon as I opened my window I became freezing cold and scrambled to get iunder my blankets. This continued to happen for a good 30 minutes and I  was tripping out really hard thinking some very fucked up thoughts.  Finally I somehow managed to fall asleep and everything went downhill from there.
