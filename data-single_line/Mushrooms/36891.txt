We walked through the school parking lot and started back to my house. We were really excited. We walked through the college and ran through some sprinklers. We hopped the wall that separated the college and the grocery store, and headed towards the street. We got to the stoplight and waited. We ate approximately 1/4 of each of our shroom nuggets. They tasted like crap.
