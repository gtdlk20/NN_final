So we walked back to the party, but somehow the groove had changed for the worse. Everybody seemed to be stressed-out, on the hunt for something. So S. and I decided to leave the party. Again there was struggle with the tire (I broke the valve off but managed to pump it somehow) and cycled back through what was the perfect very early morning. Stars were bright and I could feel every little unevenness in the road and even gravitational abnormalities (or so I thought) and used them to glide effortlessly towards the city. We stopped at a small bridge to watch a blackbird singing right at the top of the bridge and sat down at the side of the bridge to watch it. We just enjoyed the beauty of its singing and the blinking stars and me my visuals. As we sat there we pondered again the ticket-bracelet (the one with the strange saying) - it was a misprint and should have read: youre not a tree.. instead of  not a free.. We both smiled and that was a great finish to a great evening.
