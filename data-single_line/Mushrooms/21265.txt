- I felt that I went on a trip through every single possible human emotion there is to feel, everything a human can possibly experience. I felt in extreme, overwhelming depth, all at the same time. Realized that life is just an accumulation of emotions/reactions to experiences, and that I cant believe I still have a good 60 years to go.
