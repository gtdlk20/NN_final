I felt safe and peaceful throughout and my breathing was very calm. However this little weird unreal world of fucked up perceptions seemed real, sort of like an ugly country you dont want to visit again. The sense that all are one (You, me, Saddam Hussain, Jesus Christ, my granny, my parents, enemies, colleagues and friends from past and present and future) was kind of reassuring but it was also annoyingly morbid. Like a merry-go-round in a dismal fairground with cheesy music playing. This became a kind of looped trance for me, and eventually I snapped out of it by turning my head at different angles, since it never seemed to get any more positive in mood.
