My friend invited me to a small party he was having where some folks were going to be doing them.  I was especially excited for two of my friends who were going to be trying them for their first time.  He had obtained some chocolates with the mushroom ground into a powder and mixed in.  He said that 3/4 of a chocolate had 'put [him] on the moon', however there was no exact measure of potency or quantity. I cut my chocolate in half and gave the other half to my friend.  It tasted very much like plain dark chocolate but there was that faint aftertaste that indicated what was really going on.  I sat alone for a while and chewed slowly and calmly, focusing on my breathing and practicing paying attention, trying to overcome my fear and trepidation.  When all of us had finished our chocolates, my girlfriend who was staying sober drove us over to a nature preserve nearby for a hike.
