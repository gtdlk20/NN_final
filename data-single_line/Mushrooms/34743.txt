The moon was full and beautiful and made a wall of light come down in front of the deck above us. My friend said 'now we go to the golf course' (which was through the woods behind his house). This petrified me. It was dark, I was seeing things, and he wanted me to walk through the woods to the golf course, which was known to be regularly visited by our town's ever growing coyote population. I said 'No way man we should wait. I canÂ’t do it !!' and he responded to me by saying 'It doesn't matter! You can do anything you want! All you have to do is want to do it!!! Just let it go and come with me!!!!' and with that he took off through the woods. I walked slowly. A cluster of bushes made a hideous evil face at me, like a goblin getting ready for halloween (which was 2 nites away) and looking to make me his appetizer. With my friend's words still echoing through my head, I looked at the monster, and told him out loud 'Fuck off.' He smiled at me and allowed me to pass.
