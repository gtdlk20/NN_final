As I got ready to begin my trip I burned some sage, played my flute, and smoked a cigar as an offering to the gods. Then I poured very hot water from a thermos over 3.5 grams of powdered cubensis. After letting it sit for about ten minutes, I stirred up the concoction and down the hatch it went. Within twenty-five minutes my thighs began to vibrate wildly with energy. I closed my eyes and found more light and depth with my eyes closed than with them open. As the mushrooms began to take over my consciousness I tapped into a flow of information. It seemed so ancient and yet the visuals were so high tech, almost futuristic. I began to realize that the mushroom is both ancient and futuristic, timeless and infinite. My companion on the journey noted how similar our experience was to the world wide web, only we were surfing the internet of our own consciousness, cruising through the web of our own minds. Yet somehow we were also tapping into a timeless database of universal wisdom, beauty and love. I couldn't get over how beautiful the visions were, like a swirling sea of shimmering light all around me. My companion remarked that it was like scuba diving in another dimension.
