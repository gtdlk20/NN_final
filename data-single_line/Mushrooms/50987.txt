In a small, desolate corner of the desert, there isn't much for an average teenager to do. I had come to realize this and I had been analyzing the world around me - what did my life mean, who were my true friends... ect... ect... On this particular night, when there were no parties, nothing good at the movies, and definately no guys to be dating, I decided to treat myself to a special trip, besides my normal practice of driving around smoking bud and contemplating the mysterious of the universe while listening to music. So I met up with a friend who sold me approximately 5 grams of shrooms. One of my friends who was present at the time said that just looking at the shroom-filled cellephane 'gave him nightmares.' Indeed, they were fine shrooms, a white color with blue streaks throughout. There were several caps and many twisty, curly parts.
