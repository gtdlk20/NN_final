My eyes strayed straight ahead as i realized i was at a resort on the same lake as my cottage. My purpose became dreadfully clear: i was to find myself near here. I kept tracing the shoreline until i came to the clearing that was the golf course. It was truly a magnificent sight to behold; i saw a perfectly trimmed grass clearing, with the crystal clear lake to one side, with the moon reflecting softly off the water. On the other side of the clearing was the dark, menacing woods,casting shadows and concealing evil, no doubt. I felt frightened by the woods, but reassured myself by refixing my eyes on the water.
