The best way I can describe shrooms to a person who wants to try them for the first time is, one doesn't see anything that's not there. One sees visuals from what's already there. For instance, I went to the bathroom and started to do number 2, but what caught my eye was how the bathroom would change color from light to dark to light. And this pattern on the wall was literally moving, I couldn't look at it without it moving or me just laughing histerically. It was now about 2:30 am full face tripping at this point, everything was disstored and I mean everything, cats, people, furniture, you name it it was fucked up. But unlike other trip stories you read or may read I did not really have deep thoughts or life changing experiences instead I had a 100% visual trip which was awesome.
