Anyway, that night we ate the mushrooms plain. I ate 3 (my stomach already felt slightly uncomfortable) and Jim ate 4, leaving one medium-sized one left. we had eaten some beef jerky and teddy grams an hour earlier. Again, I have no idea how many grams this was, but judging from the fact one mushroom definitely weighed more than a dollar bill (.999 grams), we ate about 5 grams each. this was Jim's first time tripping shrooms, and my 6th.
