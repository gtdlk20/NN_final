Through the rain and the darkness, I felt the draw of the forest on the edge of the festival grounds.  I had felt and seen so much in only a small garden, and I wondered what would I encounter surrounded by huge trees instead.  In a moment, I was off down the deserted lane, walking past deserted shops.  The darkness felt alive, too, and it swept around me, drawing back, lurking, hiding, following me; it didn't feel malicious or particularly frightening, but it made me feel small and timid.  Devoid of the bustle of people it usually held, the festival grounds seemed taken over by nature, in all its wild, ruthless beauty.  To use Anne Rice's term, it felt like a dark night in the Savage Garden of creation.  I felt as though I was an emissary of mankind -- the only member of the human race to enter this sacred realm adjacent to the real world -- and that I needed to bring something of the human race with me as I journeyed; I knew that, to hold on to who I was and not be consumed by the Savage Garden, I had to somehow express my species as I went, what we were gifted with. So, being a musician, I began to softly sing.  Soon, a short melody coalesced; it seemed to carry both hope and joy in the first part, and ominous caution in the second.  In such a dark night, and with such overwhelming surroundings, I think this melody helped keep me sane and kept my experience positive.  It would have been so easy to sink into fear of the unknown, to be mentally and spiritually destroyed by the presence of ancient nature, and have a nightmarish trip.
