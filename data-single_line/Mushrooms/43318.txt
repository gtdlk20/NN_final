We all convened at one of my friends house to take the shrooms. They were dried, withered looking, and small. The plan was to eat them and come up when we reached Marley Fest. H started to boil some water to make a tea. We tried, unsuccessfully, to use a coffee filter as a tea bag when we poured the water over the mushrooms. Eventually all the mushrooms ended up in a glass being stirred by H. The tea mixture looked rather disgusting. It was dark grey, rather opaque, and chunky. After passing through another coffee filter with a tea bag added, we declared it drinkable. The drink was warm, red, tea-smelling. I took two huge gulps right away and thought to myself this isnt bad; it tasted just like warm tea. The subsequent sip I had was worse, almost nauseous. We had fished out all the actual mushrooms and placed them on a napkin for eating. H tried to eat them raw but had a difficult time chewing and swallowing. I put mine between some bread and peanut butter as did everyone else. It could have used some jelly.
