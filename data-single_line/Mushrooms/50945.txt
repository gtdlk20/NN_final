At around 12:30, me, Andrew, and Pete felt sober and ready to drive home, and the knowledge that Bryan was staying behind to keep an eye on Phil made me feel as if we had succeeded in our efforts to accomplish a great trip without any negative repercussions. What I didn't know is that Walt and Bryan would soon pass out, leaving Phil alone and still wired. He later said he barely avoided totally freaking out, and only regained control early in the morning.
