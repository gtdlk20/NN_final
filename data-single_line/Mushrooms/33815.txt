The trip took place alone, in my room, as is my preference with psychedelics, including Cannabis. For the majority of the time my room was dark, candles were lit and music was on an ambient level. I had 3 mixed CDs set up with bands like: Tool, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, and The Beatles. Spent the majority of the time in my bed. The time I dosed at was 10:25PM.
