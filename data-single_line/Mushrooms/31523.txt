At some point he decided to call his friend and I called my sister to talk to her about the experience. I called my sister to talk to her about the experience. I felt so strangely normal when talking to her. I tried to sum up the experience but I knew that there was no way for me to convey it. During the conversation, I looked up to see him having a conversation with my poster of Jack Johnson. It made me laugh so hard. He danced around the room. I didnt want to get up because I knew my stomach was not ready for me to move around. Eventually he came back and kneeled down beside the bed to talk to me. He looked at me and said that he couldnt live this way forever because he would be so caught up in the experience that he wouldnt eat. I told him I felt like shrooms were so powerful because they prevented you from lying to yourself and if you have been lying to yourself about something in your life it could be a very upsetting experience.
