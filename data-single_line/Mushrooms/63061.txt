Group of 4. Two couples. We rented a cabin in the woods for a weekend. Arrived in the afternoon and set up the cabin for our journey. Had dinner, cleaned up a bit, then ate our dosage (3.5 for the girls, and 8 grams for the guys). We sat in the living room on the floor as our playlist played in the background, bouncing a ball on to each other during the come up. After about 30 minutes we could feel the effects kicking in,. We all agreed it was coming in much quicker than our group trip a couple months ago. After about another 45 minutes one of the girls got sick in the kitchen. She seemed to be ok, no big mess. We helped clean up and reassured her that it happens sometimes. Everything was going great then I lost my phone which was controlling the music. I was agitated but at this point didn't have it in me to go on a search. The music was still playing but I had no control over it. Then I lost my weed. Again no biggie I thought. Then while some mellow piano tune was playing my visions went to death and violence. I wasn't worried I would act on any of these. I loved everyone I was with. I was more worried I was looking at who I really was. Coinciding with these visions was a skyrocketing body temperature and what felt like heartburn. Eventually the visions faded and the trip was fun again. I guess I'm wondering if anyone has felt the same before? Was it the loss of the music and green? Or the feeling of my body? Or something dark inside of me?
