11:30-11:35PM Starting to feel an initial body high.  My vision appears to be a little bit more glossy than anything, kind of like a marijuana high but slightly less intense.  No visuals yet.  I can feel the crawling sensation throughout my arms as I type this passage.  I feel a lot more tranquil now; I was really rushed with anticipation waiting for this trip to happen in the last few minutes, but that anticipation has subsided.  Definitely a slower reaction than previous trips, because I had eaten pumpkin pie and pizza before eating the shrooms.
