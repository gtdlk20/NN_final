One night, I convinced my best friend to eat mushrooms with me.  Though I'd eaten them twice before, the first time feeling nothing, and the second time nearly going insane, I enjoyed the second experience and wished to feel that way again. At around 8 p.m. we ate the mushrooms and washed them down with water.  Then I left him for an hour or so and, along with two of my other friends (neither of which were on mushrooms), went out to dinner.  I couldn't eat because of nausea, but sitting in the restaurant I felt very restless.  Any little sound I heard was the most disturbing thing, including the chopping of the cook in the kitchen.
