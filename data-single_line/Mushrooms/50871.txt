I sat upright on my bed and began staring at my closets and the space between the two. A small deer's head was perched in the middle of the closets. It was an ominous and overpowering figure to me. I thought I heard him speaking to me, as to worship him as a God, for he was so high above me. I got on my knees and started to pray... but why? I got up and smacked myself. 'This isn't happening', I repeated. I sat back on my bed to only find myself staring at the closet space again. Now patterns and colors were taking effect in my mind. The space turned a bright orange, and shots of spirals spewed through the wall. My eyes wandered and hit a lamp. The lightbulb in the lamp seemed to have an alien face of sorts on the inside. It was telling me, 'Come fight me, you can't so anything, you weak fool, Come fight me now!'... 'Fuck you!!', I yelled out. I was going nuts. This was pure insanty. I layed down on my bed, mouth to my pillow, proceeding to blow warm air into as a relief. As I did this, the ground ballooned up. I sucked the air in that I blew into the pillow and realized I was controlling this phenomona. wow!
