I was just sitting around telling my friends how I wasn't feeling or seeing anything yet when I started to see color trails.  I thought 'YES!  HAHAHA! Finally!'  Soon I was starting to feel like I shouldn't be in my room anymore.  At this time, my friends and my man were watching this adidas commercial online with the light off and the shade pulled.  My room was cluttered, and there were drips of cough syrup on the ground, from the night before when I had drunkenly given my man some of it to remedy his cough, along with the spoon with some drips of syrup on the desk.  I was sitting on my bed, looking at the drips and spoon and I thought to myself 'Damn, this room is so messy', but I guess I said it out loud because my friend said 'Yeah, it's like a prison cell, haha.'  Just my thoughts exactly.  I needed to be out of the dark, messy, prison cell room because it was evil.  I grabbed my purse, my jacket, and my keys, and ran off to my girlfriend's room.
