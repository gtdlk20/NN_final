Mindset: The weekend prior to this trip, I had tested some of the mushrooms IÂ’d bought. They were only a month or two dried, so their potency was still near its height. I tried the lemon tek technique, which I had not done before, and ended up getting knocked on my ass alone and terrified. Furthermore, I struggle with depression and anxiety, and had been going through a rather down period a few weeks leading up to this trip - feeling very dissociated from my sense of self and from the world around me. Therefore, I was a little nervous going into this trip with my boyfriend, but felt that if I could make it through that difficult trip and be able to hold onto my psyche throughout, I would be able to handle things this time as well. Using psychedelics with my depression consistently makes me feel much more grounded and connected when I come back to the world.
