After this self-acceptance breakthrough, things take a dark turn. I re-experience the screaming of an abusive family member as a child. Not the visual. Just the voice - screaming and rambling. The screaming sticks around for several minutes. Very disturbing. I hope the voice does not stick around. Eventually, it leaves.
