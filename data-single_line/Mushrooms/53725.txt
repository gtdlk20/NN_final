The next evening was an experience i'll never forget. The day started off simple enough, with a hot cup of coffee and a cigarette. I then went to see if my friends were home yet, and with luck, i had caught them as they were packing up to go back to the city for another week. However they purchased most of my mushrooms from me, leaving me with about 4 grams for myself. I decided that night was when they would be consumed. Besides, i hadn't had a spiritual experience for a while, so why not?
