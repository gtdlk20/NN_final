It all started with me not having done psychedelics in awhile and wanting to do them again. I missed the feeling of reality and wanted to feel it again. I was at work and my co-worker told me about having done shrooms recently and had got them from a guy who I know to get weed from. I bought a whole quarter (7 grams dried) which ended up to be 7.3g total and I planned on doing it on the weekend.  At work today though I had someone crash into my parked car and so I went home and made a claim for it and thought it was early in the day so I thought to myself. What time other than now is a good time to do these shrooms.
