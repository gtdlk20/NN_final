I went outside, called my girlfriend, told her I loved her a lot, started to feel bad, and drove home.  At this point I thought the trip was nearing its end (like the last time I tripped), and I just had a buzzed/stoned feeling.  I drove home (it must have been around 5:50pm according to my cell phonethere was some traffic also) and hoped to sleep it off. yeah right.  Once I got inside, (my mom was home) I went into my room and lay in bed.  I crawled under the covers and tried to shut my eyes.  I had a gassy/cramped feeling in my body and I started to get anxious.  I  began to see different green and light green visions (from what I remember).  I was getting a little freaked out because there was a constant sound of crickets at this pointthere are no crickets at this time of day.  My mom said she was going somewhere, I said OK, and shut my eyes again.
