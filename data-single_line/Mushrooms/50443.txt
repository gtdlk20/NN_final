The thoughts that were going through my head were so strong now that I could not keep them in my head, the energy was too strong and I had to transfer it to something physically, so I started to sway my upper body backwards and forwards... as I was doing this I would get glimpses into reality (can I really call it reality after what I have experienced) and hearing my friends... one sentence that I heard was somebody that was shouting that we were like small kids, curious about everything, and once he said that I was warped into a new dimension, I found that everything I looked at intrigued me, I was like a baby, seeing everything for the first time, the colours they moved and spoke to me...
