Ill begin with a short description of myself, because I think its applicable.  I am a 21-year old undergraduate student.  I am a very solitary and laid-back person.  I have been smoking marijuana for years, and have not experimented with many other illegal drugs, though I have heavily researched many of them.  I write this about a month after these events took place.
