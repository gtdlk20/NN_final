Towards the end of the festival I was growing quite hungry. My friend and I managed to get the motivation to stand up and journey towards the corndog stand. Ordering was the hardest part. I ended up getting four corndogs and three drinks. I assumed water would be free like it is at any other restaurant but it wasnt. The total cost came to about $23 but I didnt mind at the time. I was focused on the cashier, who told me you need three more dollars about 20 times. I was quick to get out of the way, the line seemed to stretch on 30 deep and I was afraid I was holding it up. On the way back to our site my friend had discussed the exact same thing.
