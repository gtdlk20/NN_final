At 2:40 (T+3:05) my girlfriend went to her room to download a game driver. I continued to spend about five or ten minutes looking at the ceiling. I then looked at wood grain on the cabinets. On the first trip I had not seen any distortion; now the wood grain was flowing slightly. I looked at the wall and was intrigued by a small bump above the doorway. It seemed to have personality -- it was his job to just sit there on the wall and I empathized with it. By this time the Claritin-D-like feeling had subsided (yay!) and I now approached the magical third hour of the trip.  I felt like the slight anxiety had vanished and left me in a magical state of mind. As with the first trip, this vanishing of the anxiety seemed to be the indicator that Part Two of the trip was beginning and that the effects were plateauing.  It seemed that I was hearing various faint bell and chime noises, almost like an auditory sparkling; this didn't seem to come from my ears but from my brain (similar to the sensation of playing a song back in your head). It added to the entrancing appearance of the world around me.
