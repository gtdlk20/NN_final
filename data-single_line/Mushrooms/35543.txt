It takes about 30 minutes to walk to the pub from his house.  About 5 minutes before we arrived, I noticed the 'tunnel-vision' effects of the mushrooms coming on.  They aren't bad effects, they just kind of give a sense of purpose.  I am aware of everything going on around me, but if I walk in a straight line I get a kind of 'tunnel-vision'.  Good tunnel-vision =] We entered the beer garden' but saw no friends there, so we went inside.  As soon as we got inside the smoky atmosphere scorched my lungs.  It felt horrid.  I had always had a bad reaction to open fires or smoky areas when tripping on shrooms.  I am very sensitive to olfactory stimulus when shrooming.  I went to the bar and ordered a bottle of water, which made my throat better.  My friend and I sat down at a table and listened to the band (acoustic, but miked up - mellow).  The noise was as usual for the pub, loud but not irritating.  I saw no other friends at the pub.  We were sitting at a table when the trip really began.
