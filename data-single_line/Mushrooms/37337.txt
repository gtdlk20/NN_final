I kept an eye trained to the hilltops for ranchers, but the first thing we discovered actually discovered us first.  A black helicopter buzzed by overhead, with D and I standing out in the open.  The sight of this bird of ill omen froze us, but after exchanging looks we decided not to let it get to us.  We crested a hill, and after scanning a dozen or so cow pies, I spotted something moving.  It turned out to be a young man who hadnÂ’t seen us, apparently.  He was downhill of us and past some underbrush.  I thought he was a ranch hand, but D hand-signaled for us to go talk to him.
