I've wondered if I'll retain the lessons I recieved during this unbelievably profound experience. So far, it's Sunday afternoon, 2 days since the trip, and my epiphanies still feel deeply embedded. I feel almost superstitious about going to that space again before I've seen if these understandings filter though in my day to day life, if I can be braver and truer to my intuition and life-path. I wouldn't treat this as something to get out of my mind on anymore, except in the most respectful sense! DXM has become quite unappealing by comparison!
