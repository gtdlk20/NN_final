But something strange happened the other night, I ate two grams dry of Ban Hua Thai and another one gram about half an hour later, I find these quite potent but however they did not seem to be having the desired effect on me. I had supper, then decided to have more shrooms because I thought I was not really tripping but I was, I then proceeded to eat two grams cambodian. This time though I sank into serious thought and then snapping back again to what my eyes were seeing and my ears hearing. But as I often drifted off in strange thoughts and perception I started eating more and more of my mushroom,. I then devoured 5 grams of Dutch King, another two grams of cambodian, and then chowed down +- 18 grams of A-strain, this was weird though, when I got into the 18 gs of A-strain, I was stuffing my mouth full and chewing and enjoying the taste so much, I usually want to gag while chewing  shrooms! All the mushroom I ate was cracker dry, from the first mushroom I ate to the last was over a period of 4 hours.
