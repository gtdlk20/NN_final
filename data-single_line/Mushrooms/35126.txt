So that went on for about 30 minutes. After I stopped, I started giggling uncontrollably. It was very funny. I really had to take a piss so I stood up and was stood there looking at my bedroom door which was less than 10 feet away. After what seemed like forever I made it over to the door and walked out. Took a piss, tripped out on myself in the mirror (very cool feeling) and decided to look outside through the blinds. The world seemed huge. I began to pet my cats and my hands just melted into them. I picked one of them up and held her in my arms. Ridiculas feeling. I had tons of energy and wanted to do something cool. I thought 'Ooh... IÂ’ll get on the internet.' This is when the trip goes bad.
