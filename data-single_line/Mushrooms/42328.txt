This is my documentation on what happened September 19, 2009.  It started off with me waking up, excited about the coming day.  The night before, a friend and I scored 23g of mushrooms off a very good friend of mine.  I was just waiting for a call to go pick them up.  At about 4 pm, my friend gave me a call, so I headed on over there.  I got there and we just hung out a bit.  We left about 5:30 pm and met up with another friend of mine who was also going to share this experience with us.  We met up and went back to my house so that we could start the trip.  When we got back, it was me, R, Asia, and a sober friend just kind of hanging around, just in case anything went wrong.  At some point later in the night, one of my best friends, M, also came over.
