After standing up for a while so proud of the fire I created which thinking back to it I'm shocked didn't burn down our woods I just feel out it and I feel like I smoked a shit tone of weed. I feel like this the rest of the night. After going home I call my cousin who's trying to calm me down cause I have no explanation on how this tiny ass mushroom I ate fucked me up so bad, he tells me a story about something similar that happened and the feeling in my head was probably blood pressure from getting a little overwhelmed from the visuals and it just made me tweak out the rest of the night cause of what the shroom chemical does mixed with it my slight panicking it. After trying to go to sleep(I'm wide awake but tired if it makes sense) I get this feeling every time I breath like I'm sucking in way too much air I eventually fall asleep waking up to feeling great with not the slightest feeling in my head like I did a drug/medicine whatever you want to call it
