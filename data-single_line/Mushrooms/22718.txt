Later, I was strongly aware of the sound of crickets coming from my open window. I listened intently, enjoying it. Slowly, the sounds they made turned into imagery. The cricket chirping was transformed into little critters. In a high domed structure which I tentatively equated with my cranium or my brain, someone, one of the tryptamine denizens, was playfully chasing the little chirps-turned-into-critters; it was a game, and it/he and they seemed to enjoy it immensely. I felt a sense of wonderment. I was grateful beyond words. To think that the mushroom would show me such things. I felt childlike, filled with an immense innocence. This was a grace, as I did not feel I deserved it, I did not feel worthy.
