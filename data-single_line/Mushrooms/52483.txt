I have experienced mushroom trips a few times before this experience so i felt bolder and more prepared to eat a larger quantity. My friend and I picked out a tranquil sunday and set off to his house in the country (i always feel more comfortable during any trips being outside-no walls).We ate our doses and decided to run to the store while letting them settle into our systems.
