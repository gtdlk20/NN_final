What a mistake!  Within an hour I was writhing about on the floor wishing that I could die.  I was sweating profusely and could not get warm even though I had the heating on full and was wrapped in two thick blankets.  I repeatedly crawled to the bathroom feeling nauseous but couldn't throw up.  I was also urinating a lot as I was drinking water at a fairly rapid rate - about 4 litres all together.  The water seemed to relieve the nausea to some extent.  My joints and muscles were aching a lot and I could not find a comfortable position to lie in.
