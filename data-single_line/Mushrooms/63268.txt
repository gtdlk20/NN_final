The only thing I can actually remember from reality is running aroung naked and being extreemly agressive with people who were trying to help me.  I am happy live every day as it comes type of person and am not mean to practally anyone.  My trip kept going untill the sun came up the next morning to which I smoked a bowl and said 'what the fuck just happened' and went on with the rest of my weekend.  Though I stayed away form mushies and went with happier drugs like mali and x.
