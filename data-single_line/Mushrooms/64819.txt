Truth is I am irish, and I'm proud to be irish, and I know who my family is and everything, and that's the reason I am crazy now I suppose, kind of a funny mess of a curse which mixed everything up, and even cursed not to have the best memory to recall the exact circumstances... The truth also is that I'm black, and I'm also proud of that because black people are awesome and the world is entirely too effing racist still, but it's gotten and is getting a lot better, which is great, maybe I was racist in a past life, and a more unifying truth is that I'm descendent from weavers... And that's just what it is.
