I woke up very early the next morning quite cold, but with no remaining effects of the shrooms that I could tell.  I was in a strange and philosophical mood the rest of the day, but that probably just came from trying to digest all that I had experienced.  It wasn't the easiest trip I have ever had, but it was definitely the one which imparted the most wisdom.  I have recently acquired a quantity of Amanita muscaria extract, and when the weather gets a little warmer I have every intention of having another outdoor trip in the woods -- though perhaps not in the middle of a rainstorm this time!
