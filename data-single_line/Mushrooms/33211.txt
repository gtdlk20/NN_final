At the early part of the trip I was going to lay back and relax but when I did the main room light then took on the role of a kind of alien operating theatre lamp beaming its light on an area around the location of my collar bone. Whether its intentions were benign or not was not clear. I decided on my negative frame of mind that I wasnt going to let it develop into some nasty operation situation which I didnt think would be an encouragement.
