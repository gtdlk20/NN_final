By the time we had everything done the water was boiling and we tossed 2 of the four bags in, and smashed them very hard with a spoon and we watched the water turn pitch black. Afterwards we put the black water into a large container and mixed the kool-aid (grape flavor) in. We drank the 1st batch in about 20 minutes and I had 6 8oz. cups and then we waited while heating up the 2nd batch of water. about 45 minutes the stomach cramps started going away and I felt the tingling sensation that was in the top of my head rush throughout my body then it all hit me, I was watching walls move with beautiful patterns and colors. Everything felt just as if it was going to be another one of those mushroom trips but the second batch was done and ready and so we let it cool and the effects of the 1st batch were hitting hard in heavy.
