Suddenly I felt an urge to sing to the music... today I can not remember the words but what I do recollect is the fact that my words were inspiring to the people that sat around... as I sang more and more people disappeared from the forest... I realized that I had to leave too; someone was shouting my name... It was one of my old friends (that had not taken mushrooms, in the beginning I thought this would be a nice security, but later he would play a big part) he was asking me what I was singing about... I looked up to see him but before I had reached his face, he had turned into the giant stone statues from lord of the rings... as I looked back at me, I found myself in the river, slowly travelling on the small waves, the water surged through my body, I swept me away so hard that I felt that I was going to puke (somehow I knew that would not be good) but I couldnÂ’t control, before I had a chance to stop myself the bubble was surging through my throat, just as it exploded out of me I expected to see my puke, but instead the thing that was leaving my body was my soul, my teeth felt a giant breeze and my body was being drained from its life force.
