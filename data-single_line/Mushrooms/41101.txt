Where is the touch of life? The opaline wash of sensuality. The pearl in the tongue of gratitude. Now is the echo vibrating into the entire coagulating crash of insensate love. Reproducing endless waves of poetic light exploding into wishes of planetary/interplanetary survival. The nightship of the blind horizon. Setting sail in the winds of the stars. I am hogwash in the melting pot, split in myriad ways and rent asunder. The cauldron of childhood, the daily magic of the setting sun, the fleet of neutrinos emanating from the shellfish on the rocks under the first wave.
