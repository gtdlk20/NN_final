T +3:30 Kevin has me look at fractals with him on the computer.  The sense of inifinity is amazing, not to mention the fact that they are constantly in motion.  However the visuals are either not as strong now or I have gotten used to them.  I seem to have a better verbal command now so I describe to him my experiences thus far.  He seems very interested, and I remember that he has just insufflated one of his ADHD pills.
