While my friend and I were eating them in a school parking lot, I saw a man with a gun run toward me and try to shoot me.  I screamed, only to realize he wasn't there, then we both laughed for about ten minutes.  The next four hours was a wonderland of hallucinations.  The trees appeared to be dragons, all the lights were brighter, and buildings and cars seemed to stand out differently than usual.  They all had a somewhat glossy and cartoon look to them.  Then at 5:30 a.m. when I finally got home and to bed, I couldn't sleep because of all the sounds in my head.  It sounded as if a factory was working in my brain.  Clanging, crashing, buzzing, humming, whistles, all were going on, including songs I had heard earlier in the evening.
