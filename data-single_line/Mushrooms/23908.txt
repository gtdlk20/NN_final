T+03:00ish - The fit of laughter was the last straw, I had to take a crap now.  I'd been trying to hold it until we reached W's house, but it just couldn't be done.  I dropped my pants behind a bush just in time, though I could have sworn I pissed and shat all over them in my hurry.  Upon later inspection, I found that my pants looked and smelled perfectly clean and I must have hallucinated that part.  I had nothing with which to wipe (which I didn't consider until after my body had been emptied), and I looked around for anything.  I could find nothing but a patch of leftover snow.  Take my word for it, there are few things more unpleasant than wiping your ass with snow, but you do what you have to do.  I felt like I had completely lost control of myself and began to panic.  I needed to be indoors and couldn't think of anything but the fact that we were lost in the woods during the wee hours and cold freeze to death.  I was quickly crossing the line from good trip to bad trip, but my friends were able to calm me down by reminding me of the beauty of the stars.  I gazed at the stars and forgot about my worries, it was that easy.
