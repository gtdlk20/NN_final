I was sitting on the floor surrounded by my friends. I was pretty hyper and happy. Someone put Tool on, which obviously would have blown my head off to a degree anyway. Loz had a book with a shiny cover, which he was moving in my line of vision, towards the left hand side. He said himself that he wasnt trying to do it in time to the music, but it looked like it was rippling in time to the music. Then I could see over on my right side of my vision John E tapping his fingers, I think on a basketball so I started drumming out some beats on my knees. This was at the end of schism (where there is a substantial amount of drumming.) I didnt take my eyes off lozs book at any point but Johns hands in the background completed it for me.
