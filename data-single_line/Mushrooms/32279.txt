Me and B were quite the drug users. We were best friends, we hung out almost everyday and smoked bud. We've had several experiences with mushrooms and other hallucinogenics. This was one of about 8 trips that we've done. Most of which we did together. B and I never really liked other people. We never drank, never took pills, never did coke, or even ever partied. We were two good friends who both explored psycadelia, and meditated, and smoked pot, and studied many sciences.
