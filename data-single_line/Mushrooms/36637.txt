Guido held me for a long time, we were convinced this was our planet and we had named it Shangri La. That we had reached enlightenment and this is what enlightenment was like. We were the only man and woman on this planet. I do not think we kissed alot, but we held eachother, for hours on the beach. Standing in the same spot, head to head.
