Cory asked if it really mattered to communicate the experience to others. At first I said it didnt really matter, but then came back to the conviction that indeed it did matter. If this experience could make people realize the divine gift we call existence, simply being alive and experiencing, then I thought it would do the world a lot of good. Maybe some people wouldnt be ready to have this kind of experience, but for those who were ready, it would give a profound sense of gratitude simply for being. Faith that there is no need to fear, and everything is okay.
