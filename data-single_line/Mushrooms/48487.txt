We ingested the mushrooms, as is, at about 7:15. We all drank a small amount of orange juice to help with the taste, which was not all that bad. Rhino tripped on an empty stomach, I had some peach rings and a sandwich before tripping. We hit my ice bong a few times to help with any nausea we were to encounter. We moved inside and sat on the couch, waiting. I, personally, enjoy that short period of time between where you are and where you are going, when you are waiting for your drug of choice to sit in. I like the adrenaline you feel as you anticipate the new feelings you are about to discover. However, tonight was different, and I was a little antsy, perhaps because I had read that if you ate the wrong type of mushrooms, you would die a most certainly painful death. I wondered where on earth these ones came from.
