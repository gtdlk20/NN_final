Every element of my experience reflected a fundamental archetype of reality. The self, the elm tree above me that acted as my axis-mundi, the orange tree and grass that provided food and habitat, the house I lived in, and even minor elements like the smell of incense and the ceremonial objects around me all seemed to be fundamental qualities of existence itself, as if they had always been there and always would be wherever my soul traveled in time and space. I understood that the human is the highest expression of nature, that humans are the most fulfilled expression of the universal self, and that all of reality, including the earth and its myriad vegetable, mineral, and animal beings, support them in their endeavors. I saw that all humans of all times and places are essentially a manifestation of the same creative desire, and who possess the same fundamental fears, hopes, faults, and aspirations. The aspiration of Western industrial culture is, at its most fundamental level, no different than the aspiration of the Native Americans that I so often idealize. We are all after the same essential end, though our means may vary. The world I lived in, though flawed, was incredibly beautiful. I felt extremely happy simply to be alive in it, and no longer felt shame in being part of a destructive culture. All of life is destructive. But it is always in balance as well; its simply a matter of perspective. There is no need to fret over the details. We are constantly in search of a future that will never come, forgetting that ultimate contentment can only ever be found in the present moment.
