For an hour absolutely nothing happened which was weird because the past five times Ive used shrooms the effects onset in the first thirty minutes after eating them.  I was getting pretty pissed off they werent working.  I started thinking to myself maybe I didnt eat enough shrooms, but then I remembered I ate like five small caps and a couple of stems, and I had eaten a big breakfast so maybe they were just taking a little while.  You might think I'm crazy wanting to trip while lifeguarding but honestly think about this; I hate the job, I mean everybody thinks its so great being out in the sun all day, but its boring as hell, I have to socialize with old geezers and their old fucking wives who are always hitting on me and I get sunburned like a motherfucker. Plus, nobody actually drowns.
