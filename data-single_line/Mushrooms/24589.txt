To sum it all up, this was the greatest night/morning of my entire life.  Better than sex, better than smoking, better than drinking, better than anything I have yet experienced in my brief 18 years of life.  I learned so much about life and death and felt a much stronger bond with all my close friends.  It was truly a life changing experience and I encourage all who read this to try it at least once.
