Me and Dorian were in my car right down the road from his house. His parents were still up so we were waiting for them to go to bed. We had eaten the shrooms about an hour ago and smoked a few bowls over the course. I was tripping a little but not much. The worst thing that could have happened happened. His parents called him and were pissed off that he didnt rake the yard yet. He had completely forgotten about it. Scared as hell we pull up to his house. We didnt know what to do. He brought me into his room and I layed on his bed. He said it wouldent take him more than 30 mins to rake the yard. I sat there and then it really hit me. He had a digital clock that shined on his ceiling. I have no concept of time and the clock was jumping around going from 8:45 to 10:15 to 3:00 and I just laid there watching it. I also kept getting txts from my dad asking were I was over and over. I had to have gotten about 50 txts just asking were I was. No matter how I responded it just said 'Where are you?' I knew it had to be fake but it was still creepy as fuck cause I was tripping out. I was thinking about the weirdest things like 'what if that is the actual time on the ceiling and I'm running around the neighborhood causing mayham?'
