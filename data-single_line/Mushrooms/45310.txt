T = 4:30 - We began to drive back to our college, but stopped back at our original spot for a half hour. JP decided to stand in one spot for most of this time, just staring at the sky or at the mountains in front him. I told myself that I viewed the world in a way that was very logical: at the end, everything is a simple yes or no answer; you just had to break it down enough. I felt like I was in a movie, and I was just a walking talking, clich√©. This was disheartening.
