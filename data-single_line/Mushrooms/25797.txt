What I am increasingly becoming aware in these mushroom trips are the immensity of the powers that I wield as a human.  I consistently surprise myself during my trips with the feats I can accomplish.  I began to think about how, about a month ago during a trip, I was capable of sustained physical exertion for five hours running through the woods in the nature preserve.  I have played guitar during my trips and played such complex and moving music that I have nearly brought myself to tears.  Sitting there in meditation, marveling at the power I wielded through simple finger tapping, I glimpsed how powerful more complex forms of expression, such as classical music or language, could truly be.
