So three of us, young shamanic initiates, left the old shamans home and drove to Mercs keep for a night venture into the unexpected. It was a basement apartment, or more so like a large open space room with red walls, candles lit, comfortable seating, beanbags on the floor, a bed, and a coffee table. The room, even before taking the Sacred Mushrooms, had a psychedelic aura, a sense of heightened energy. A sacred vibe was radiating through us.
