I hop out of the water on a ledge with my friend at stomach height with his feet in the water under me. I tell him he needs to jump in and to trust the advice of the madman who did five grams. I think about the magical FIVE grams and realize it's been staring us all in the faceÂ… We have five fingers on each hand. Nature made it so easy for us on how to guess the correct amount I rant off about this and my friends laugh and joke about it, I ask them to prove me wrong but happily go along with their jokes.
