Eventually, the sober people had to go home, and everyone else (except Asia, who was out on the patio tripping on my couch) decided to go see Nine.  I didnt want to be left alone at my house, so I went as well.  We got there and went to watch the movie, but 15 minutes into, I realized that I shouldnt be there, so I went outside and wandered.  I saw two brothers who were smoking out in their car.  When they noticed me, they kind of freaked out.  One of them told me that he works there, its nice and he gets to see movies free.  I didnt really want to talk to him so I said that I would leave them to do what they were doing.  This part of it was kind of nice; he said that his brother doesnt smoke, what would that make him if he allowed it.  I believe he was lying, but seeing that kind of thing was nice.  I continued to walk around and I was appreciating the little bits of nature that was in the area.  I started to think about the universe, nature and manmade objects.  How beautiful nature is and how it grows.  Then looking at manmade objects, such as buildings, they may have been nice once, but once it starts rusting or getting old, we leave it to die.  We take out so much in the world for things that we believe we need, only let it fall into disrepair 10 years later.  But, it ended up being alright; I got home at about 4 in the morning, with Asia still on my couch.  I stayed up a bit longer and started turning everything off at 5 am.  Asia woke up and told me that he had just stopped tripping.  I told him to analyze what had happened and that we would share stories at some point. He then left my house and thats how it pretty much ends.
