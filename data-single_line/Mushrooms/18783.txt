After having eaten the half of the stuff, I felt mild nausea. It was really weird to feel it just a few seconds after chewing and swallowing, I had the feeling of poisoning myself badly. I forced myself to finish to eat the whole thing. Then I turned the TV on immediately, to watch the Simpsons, laugh and forget this nausea, and wait for the effects to come. At this time it was 8:45pm. I went quickly to brush my teeth in order to clean my mouth from the bad taste of the truffles. It helped to calm the nausea. But immediately I had some tremors and I was laughing at the Simpsons too easily. Fuck. I was watching the Simpsons to wait for the effects, but they were already starting to come.
