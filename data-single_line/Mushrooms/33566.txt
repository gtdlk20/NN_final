250 - 350 min: I'm not sure what happens next but my friend A leaves me and I lay down to rest. I'm quite far away from any light source now so it's very dark. I close my eyes and there is some really scary laughter going on. I get stuck in another mind loop where I start wondering who I am. I'm not really sure about the answer and I feel very empty and dizzy. I struggle hard to break this line of thought and after around an hour I open my eyes and slowly sit up. I'm not totally sure about this part of the journey, it feels like a black hole to me.
