The water was the strangest thing ever, though it felt incredibly nice. The liquid soap felt incredibly weird when I rubbed it between my fingers. The steam seemed unusually thick and floated in a strange sense. I cant express my thoughts enough to describe how ridiculous my journey into the other universe of mushrooms was. I just stood there in the shower, not doing anything, for probably a good 45 minutes (though it seemed like 2 hours). I stepped out and the steam in the bathroom was hovering in a thin layer. I slowly swept my hand through it. Doing this caused the steam to make spirals and slowly move away. I noticed intense tracers when moving my hand. I looked in the mirror and saw that my pupils were extremely huge, which is normal on psychedelics, but it still tripped me out (by the way, mirrors can be very strange when shrooming).
