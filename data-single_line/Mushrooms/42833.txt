We all continued to drink slowly and about two hours later, I remember Peter rolled a second joint, but even after that I wouldnt be able to decisively say if I actually took the hits properly or under the influence of the drug. But I decided I wouldnt worry about it, and ended up passing out on the floor of Peters and Zulians dorm room as I often did. Id be lying if I said I didnt have a slight hangover the next morning, but it was actually rather tolerable compared to some I had felt. I just felt a little tired and slow to respond to others, but I felt more reflective. I sensed that there had been this change that had taken place in my life, but I thought back on how much I had achieved already  that could never be taken from me, regardless of any changes that occurred. I spent the day with my friends and that night we drank some more and then tried the process again. Thinking back on it, I dont know how Peter ever got three full joints out of one single nickel bag, but he always was conservative and efficient with his weed.
