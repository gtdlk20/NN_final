Using this drug was a wonderful idea. It allowed me to jumpstart my perspective and it took me to a level of insanity I have often pleaded for when in dismay. While the startlingly clear insight is a wonderfully ecstatic moment, it only happened to me as I came back down and ultimately it did not teach me any new theory of life or perspective I had been missing. I found actually, that in those matters I would be happier sober, with something being important because it has accumulated the history that makes it so, then to be unable to hold something in my life above something else. I plan to use it in the future with a list of instructions written on me before hand.
