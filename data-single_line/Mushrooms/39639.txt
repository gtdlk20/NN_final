I had taken mushrooms before. Twice before to be exact. The first time was unnerving to say the least, but I had fun trying to float down the stairs head first. The second time I had to stay more aware as I was with someone who had never taken them before. I felt composed as I watched him submerge into a paranoid more 'spicy' version of himself. Maybe the position of experience left me feeling ok.
