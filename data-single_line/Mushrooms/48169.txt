I prepared a bed for them and checked on them at regular intervals, John threw up a couple of times but was otherwise ok. Lana was of course quite shaken, but they were otherwise fine after that, tripping a good bit, which passed after about two hours. Everyone else missed this and were and enjoying themselves, so I told them Jon had fallen over, he seemed ok now, and that I was keeping an eye on it.
