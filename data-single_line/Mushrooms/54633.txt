10PM I was blasted into another dimension or universe.  Luckily my friend was over and he knew what I was experiencing. Luckily my friend was over and he knew what I was experiencing.  To any normal person I would have been thought to be insane at that time.  The world was my oyster.  I could manipulate my surroundings, pushing and pulling the walls to go where ever I wanted them too.  Occasionally there would be a small earthquake and I would have to steady myself.  This was the first time I had ever tripped so hard that every sense (touch, sight, taste, hearing, and smelling) was tripping.  I questioned everything in this reality, because my entire body reacted to my hallucinations.  If a vortex opened in the floor, I invariably would be sucked into it.  I think that if I hadn't been an experienced tripper, I would have freaked out on it.  There were lots of audio hallucination (things slowing down or speeding up, occasional music and people talking to me), time was of no concern to me, because a minute seemed to take an hour, and an hour sometimes flew by... I just gave up looking at the clock, it was pointless.  I saw a lot of aliens and arms wrapping around everything.  It almost felt like the earth was cradling me.  Very calming.
