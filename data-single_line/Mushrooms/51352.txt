Anyways, we started our walk downtown. Wow, what an amazing walk! We had to stop everywhere, just to smell a flower, lay in the grass, talk to dogs that were out with their masters and much more. Everything was so fun and beautiful! It was truly bliss. As we walked for hours, we finally returned home. When we got to the park near my friends home, we realized that we were coming down and the peak was gone. We didnt feel bad over this, we just enjoyed everything. We all guessed what the time was, and we guessed that it would be about 4 am, since we had done lots of stuff. We looked at the watch, only 1:45 am! We were amazed.
