Suddenly the air conditioner came on, which created a vibrating, echoing noise.  I thought I heard some sort of odd thoughts in my head (similar to schizophrenia), and I just wanted the cricket noise to stop.  I said something out loud, and realized it had a echo or reverb effect to it.  I opened my eyes and I began to make noises with my mouth, because I was very interested in these noises.  I shut my eyes and odd, clear, tube-shaped rabbit looking creatures were there.  I watched them for a while.  This frightened me eventually and I opened my eyes and stared at the ceiling.  The ceiling suddenly became a perfect pattern of Aztec-looking designs, all squared off evenly, with a mix of colors in their lines.  Every vision I saw at this point seemed to be even, blocked, shapes.  I then looked at my starry starry night painting, which morphed into one blue texture with the wall.  Throughout this whole time I was very schizophrenic, and agitated.
