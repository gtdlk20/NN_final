7 PM - Shrooms have peaked hours ago and are starting to gently decline, throughout this experience I've noticed that the Clonazolam has numbed some of the spiritual feelings you often get from shrooms, which is quite a shame- but for somebody who is prone to bad trips, it's a life-saver- I've been able to enjoy all of the visuals and slight connectivity/oneness feeling without worry. The visuals have been very interesting as always, being in nature was fantastic, and the walk home was pretty cool due to the roads slightly twisting/turning and looking different than usual. Very odd and mind-expanding.
