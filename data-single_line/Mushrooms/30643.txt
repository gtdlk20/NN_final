Dosage: 0.75 g (~8.25 mg psilocybin, ~1.13 mg psilocin) Context: My girlfriend, who will now be referred to as M, and I have been in a relationship for just under 2.5 years now, and have been living together for the latter 2 years. We have both experimented with psychoactive compounds on many occasions, including cannabis, LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, as well as a plethora of legal compounds. After a long day of class for M, and a long day of work for myself, I suggested that we partake in a small dose of some dried mushrooms that weve had for quite sometime. Having dosed from this batch before, we have determined that dosages ranging from 0.5 grams to 1.0 grams result in a full, but not overwhelming, experience. With our familiar and cozy apartment being the setting for the following experience, we were both comfortable. Other than a little mental fog from the days activities, my mindset was well prepared for the ingestion of the substance. Keep in mind that these notes were written during the experience.
