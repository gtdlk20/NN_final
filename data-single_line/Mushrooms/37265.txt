I sat in a chair and looked around me. As the influence of the chemical on my brain increased I took images and ideas from the things I saw around me. A bank statement from HSBC turned into a memory of staring up at the HSBC building in Docklands. Seeing a cardboard box with NIGHT or something similar written on it in big black letters sent bad vibes, and I kept moving my head and looping through the different things I saw; an apple, letters on a board, a weird (even when sober) rendering of a cat on the wall, a book of 3D images. Ideas started looping along with them and each thing I saw became more exaggerated.
