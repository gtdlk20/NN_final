Man on Earth controls that of which we know as time, time to us quickly leaves when we lose all sense. .Time to us could be one second, but to the universe, eternity. It is distinctly plausible that we live on this Earth as merely a first stage in setting up our own perspective of what we would want in the afterlife. Every other animal being on Earth also has this choice. It is also plausible that when we die we can truly remove all sense of our reality and come to the conclusion that we could start our reality.
