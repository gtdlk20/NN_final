I'm a novice psychonaut at the very most. I've only taken mushrooms twice, once about a week before this report and once just yesterday. I've experimented with acid a few times (and LOVED it) and have smoked cannabis habitually for just over four years (I tried it at 10, and started smoking habitually at 13). Most people reading that will probably either be disgusted, or feel sorry for me, but cannabis helped me so, so much. The only negatives I've got from this are slight feelings of anxiety and paranoia, but they're attributable to my metaprogramming to some degree as well, and are outweighed by the positives to such a huge extent. Heck, it made me an incredible intellectual and greatly expanded my mental power, among other things. But I'm going off on a tangent aren't I? I should be telling you about yesterday..
