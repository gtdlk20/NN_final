So anyway that was kind of deep to me. I realized that Im too hard on myself. I saw that any experience had is never truly bad or good but that we bring our own perceptions of that experience and attach the emotions that come with that perception. I saw that it wasnt important that I was fat or skinny; if millions of people loved me, or no one in the world liked me it was all a matter of how I perceived the situation. Through this I saw me. I truly felt that I saw myself, objectively in my minds eye as I was. Free of embarrassment or shame of things I have done, thought or said, free of the need to want to be attractive to the opposite sex, and free of all the other things that are the constant distractions that rule my ordinary mind. I felt and saw the innocence I held as a child. Even though I had my previously stated realization of bringing emotion to a situation which is fundamentally not good or bad that didnt stop me from crying like a little girl. I cried out of joy at the realization that I was okay. I was a good person and I didnt have to be so hard on myself about everything, and I didnt have to worry about things all the time. In the middle of my tears I had also begun laughing hysterically at the joy of these ideas, and yelling out Im all right! Im all right!
