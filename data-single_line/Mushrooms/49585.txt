It was a Friday night me and my buddies had just gotten home from our picking field and we were ready to begin the cleaning process.  After cleaning the massive amount of very fresh looking mushrooms. We decided that it would be best to make 2 big batches so we divided them up kind of equally into half pound and half pound, and we shoved them into panty-hose; kinda like a home-made teabag.
