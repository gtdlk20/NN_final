We went outside again and smoked a joint. After that, I became completely at peace and felt like I should do some stretching. I laid out on my bed and stretch some yoga moves and it felt incredible. I must have fallen asleep watching television, as did my cousin. The next day was painful to wake up to. My body felt dead, but my mind was more clear than I could remember. I had been a heavy pot-smoker for two or three years before and craved it daily. After my mushroom experience, I did not seem to need marijuana. It was just something people did in their bored free time. I had also tried other drugs, like acid and dex, and now feel disgusted of ever doing them. I most likely will never take shrooms, or any other hard drugs, again. I might smoke weed now and then, but it feels good to know that I don't need it to live life.
