I'm a pretty experienced drug user, having tried many substances in my life, especially hallucinogenics. However, up until this point I had never laid a hand on mushrooms. When I got a call from my dude Ryan saying he had shrooms, I immediately scrounged up $35 and went over to his place to buy an 8th. It was my good friends birthday, and I wanted to make the experience all the more special with mushrooms.
