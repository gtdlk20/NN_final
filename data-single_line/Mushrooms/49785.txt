2 hours after swallowing the last piece of mushroom we decided to go out for a walk. We find ourselves in a very calm and silent neighbourhood, no one was outside. We begin to walk down to road which J lives on. It feels like almost everything expresses some kind of feelings. Some trees are evil, some trees are happy, some trees are old. Some cars look very aggressive kinda like watchdogs. None of the mentioned things are frightening though. They all just seem to express their feelings so that we know where to walk and where not to walk. We never thought something would attack us or anything, the things only protected what was theirs and we had no plans on trying to take that away from them.
