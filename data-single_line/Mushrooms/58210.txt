On the way over walking down the path flanked by trees off the rear of school property I noticed my friends hands were making coloured trails as he walked. Its coming! I thought to myself.  Then we 4 went and smoked up. For the next while I just enjoyed looking at things, and found myself to be very relaxed.  We just wandered around the parking lot for another hour or 2, listening to bands, seeing who was there and who was on what.  Then we went and smoked up more.  By this time my high was totally different, while wearing my sunglasses, it was like I was in a bubble that was around me, and I had the feeling that I was seeing the world for what it really was.  The trees and plants looked so perfect and beautiful, the tarmac and grass was bouncy to walk on.  My friends were talking but I wasnt hearing them.  Right ripped and in my own little world we made our way back to school and wandered some more.  Then, we spent the next hour and a half standing there listening to the bands play.  Again, I experienced the feeling that I was inside a bubble floating around looking at everyone else.  For a while I was not even self aware.
