The great day happened. We planned a homebirth. A beautiful experience intimate and sacred for my husband and me to enjoy. It became overwhelming. We had a little of dry mushroom extract that I tried to help me cope with the labor. It didn't work. So I rushed to the hospital because 'it hurt too much' . I had a traumatizing delivery there. My husband and I were not allowed to be together. I thought for months that 'the mother' had failed me. But I see now that she was there all the time. 'She' is with me all the time. I just have to learn to turn the volume down of my ego and I'll be able to hear 'her'. I think mushrooms take us to the state of mind that we are supposed to live in. But then is our job to remember and work our way back there by ourselves.
