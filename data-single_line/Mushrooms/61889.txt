We left the house and I decided to drive **really bad mistake**I could not remember where I was or what I was doing. And it was raining which made it 100 times intense. I started thinking I was in the 'stan- by eminem' music video when he was driving with his wife in the trunk. And I was like o my god, I could even hear the music (that was not actually there). So I got hungry and decided to go to mc donalds. I was so trippin out and scared cause I thought I was dyin or something that I could not eat.
