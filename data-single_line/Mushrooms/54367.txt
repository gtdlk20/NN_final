It is a privilege to be able to explore the outer reaches of the Innerverse and the borderlands of Hyperspace.  If we dont do it, nobody will.  Meditation, NDE experiences, dreams, astral travel  they all go somewhere but it feels to me like with psychedelics we can go much further, faster and with much greater ease.  We can stumble and fall and get back in the saddle in a flash  and stumble we will and embrace the lessons we must.  I feel that as a species we dont explore and fully embrace who we are for our full timeline, from conception to transition to the next stage (death).  We kind of accept more or less remembering our first experience at 5 years old or so but dont bother going deeper.  It is scary stuff  it is the great unknown and the great terrifying darkness.  When we ask our psychedelics to show us the full truth, they show us the full truth and that involves the scary parts we wilfully ignore and know nothing about, consciously.  I would say it is our duty as explorers of the mind to actually go into those dark caves and dive into those black pools.  Life itself can be very scary, especially when it is looked at without distractions.  In my philosophy it is better to deal with the shadows right now then to leave them until we lie on our deathbed.  A life unexamined and all that.  Still, this type of mega dose trip makes it tempting to state: Ignorance is bliss.  Once I open Pandora s Box, the Void it contains cannot be unopened, so it is then better to become friends with that space between the atoms.
