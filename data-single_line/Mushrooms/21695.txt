We got inside. This is when existence stopped working. The first thing to happen was the utter destruction of linear time. I collapsed onto the floor and lay there as my body slowly faded away to join the fractals that composed the ground and my mind wandered off. For the next two hours I faded in and out of physical unconsciousness. My conscious state consisted of an EXTREMELY warped real world, my unconscious state consisted of my mind traveling to separate worlds. I don't know the order any of this happened in so I'll just list them as they came to mind.
