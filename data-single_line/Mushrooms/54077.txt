Not long after that we decided to go out in my yard to wonder around (and I was also carrying my bong with me the whole time in its case). I also felt a very strong love for my bong and treated it like a baby and a pillow the whole time. And at this point every 1 has the 'giggles' and is laughing about everything and anything. So were in my yard and were just having fun throwing a neon green inner tube at each other like a Frisbee that we just randomly found in my yard then we all just sort of ended up on the ground looking at the sky.
