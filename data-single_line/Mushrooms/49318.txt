It was a quiet and unpleasantly lonely Saturday evening, and I felt as if the spirit of the mushroom wished to speak to me. I gladly smudged myself, meditated, and accepted the challenge offered. I gladly peeked into my dry chamber and acquired four grams of cubensis, quietly munching them down with some orange juice, sitting on my futon. Being on an empty stomach, I was rapidly catapulted into a very stoned, confused feeling. I began to feel very heavy, and my thoughts wandered in the direction of love and light. I embraced the warm feeling radiating from within, and released the negative energy I usually harbor. Thoughts seemed to swirl about my head rather rapidly, and I began to write them down. The writing quickly turned to incomprehensible slurs, so I decided against it.
