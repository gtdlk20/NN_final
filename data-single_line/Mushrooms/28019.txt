I have had a lot of different trips with a lot of different people, including romantic partners. This was the first time I had ever had what I would describe as a profound, transcendent experience. I felt intensely connected to him, to my self and my body, and incredibly present in the world. Things felt more alive and real than they had in a long time. This feeling lasted for weeks after the experience: the depression lifted and I felt that my worldview shifted dramatically for the better. While the effect isnÂ’t permanent, it gives me hope to know that those feelings of awe, beauty, and incredible intimacy are always available to me.
