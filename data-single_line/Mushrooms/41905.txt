T+60: As soon as I leave the lake and enter the woods there is an unstoppable grin on my face. The area is outstandingly beautiful when sober, but the vibrant autumn colours are practically glowing at this point and I cant help but exclaim as to how amazing everything looks. I dont even have any particular direction Im going in but just keep walking toward anything that feels right, being sure to stick close to paths. I start going up hills that seem to go on forever and find that really amusing. I yawn frequently and there are tears in my eyes partly because of it and partly because of the overwhelming feeling of euphoria. Life becomes very clear as Im walking. The things that I was anxious about when I was coming up and the problems I had planned to think about during the trip seem silly and the resolutions came naturally and with empathy.
