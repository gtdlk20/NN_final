I was never much of a hallucinogenic kind of guy. Though the times I did mushrooms or starved myself of sleep, the experiences were always memorable. One night while sitting on a street corner watching a few of my friends make asses of themselves (they drank themselves stupid) a friend of mine had came across us. Him and his cousin had been picking CanadaÂ’s finest mushrooms all day for the past week. We live on Prince Edward Island and if anybody here has heard we supposedly have some of the best Psilocybin Mushrooms in the world. But then again that maybe blatant patriotism but all the out of towners that indulge while here are pleasantly surprised.
