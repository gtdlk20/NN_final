For a while I have been researching the therapeutic benefits of hallucinogens and how they unlock the subconscious, with results that are nothing short of amazing, but requiring proper awareness and work on oneself.  I am not religious, but do feel that there is much more to life than just this.  However, it's more intellectual, and not felt.  In reading of psychology and other mystical shaman experiences, I saw a common thread:  The idea of trial by fire, armed with knowledge and an openness to want to grow.
