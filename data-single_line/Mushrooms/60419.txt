After walking down onto the street, I continued walking until I reached a Ruby Tuesday's. It seemed like it took them forever to bring water to the table. I thought it would feel cooler in the restaurant, but I still felt warm. I knew if I left the restaurant it would feel ten times hotter outside, but all I could think about was bolting out of there and getting to Atlantic Avenue to catch the 507 bus that would take me home.
