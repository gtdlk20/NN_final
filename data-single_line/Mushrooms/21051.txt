All the thoughts I remember from the fractal rainbow space still make sense to me. They're thoughts I'd formed or collected gradually in the 12 years since I first heard someone else talking about what I now call consciousness. They feel more intuitive now. I really do feel like I'm on the same team as everyone and everything, even when we seem to be working at cross purposes for a few thousand years at a time. I can imagine a level of zooming out where it's all part of the same dance. I'm surprisingly content to think of waking life as one of many little dark loopholes in psychedelic space. The dimensions of space, time and person feel interchangeable, such that the distinction between self and other is the same as the distinctions between here and there and between past, present and future.
