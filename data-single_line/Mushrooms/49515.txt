My friend (we'll call him dude) and I took a semi-quick drive to Reno, checked into our room at the luxurious Sands (same number of stars as the Super 8 motel) and prepared to ingest. This was dude's first trip and he took 2 grams of Mazatec, while I took 2.3 grams of PF. Considering that dude gets ill when he smells mushrooms; it was impressive to see him down his 2 grams almost immediately. I followed suit so as to prevent embarrassment. I felt the uneasiness that I usually feel after ingesting shrooms. After about 15 or 20 minutes, the TV started bothering me, and the psychedelic colors of the sheets on the bed began to make me feel uncomfortable. At about 30 minutes, we decided to go for it, and headed out to the casino floor. The walk down the hallway, and elevator ride made me feel that I was tripping, but it can be hard to tell considering the strange colors and patterns of the carpets.
