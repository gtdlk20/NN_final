The journey through the woods was amazing. The trees were dancing with the breeze, tickled by the streams of colorful peace signs running up their trunks. I made it through to the 12th green and my buddy and guide was there waiting for me. We ran as fast as we could through the grass, my head disconnected from my body and just floated effortlessly over the wonderful green ground. We soon found out that running was not a good idea and I felt a slight bubbling in my stomach, a faint reminder that I was putting my body through hell to release my mind. We both laid down and watched the stars and moon in their beautiful patterns that spread through the whole universe. My friend and I got into a very deep conversation about laws and money and how none of it was real and we found ourselves screaming 'FUCK THE RULES' and laughing hysterically.
