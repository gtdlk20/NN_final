Me and my friend A went to Amsterdam this summer and we thought we'd eat some shrooms over there, we went into a store and the guy selling them told us that a pack of mushrooms would give us a good trip. However, we thought we needed an intense trip (I still regret that till now), so we took 2 packs of Hawaiian mushrooms and decided to eat them next to the fountain in central Amsterdam. My friend A had never experienced shrooms before and this was his first experience. I remember the guy at the store told us to eat half of the pack first, wait for 30mins and then eat the other half. I thought I'd just eat the whole pack really fast and just get on with it. A ate the first half then went to buy some orange juice and came back within 30mins and ate the other half.
