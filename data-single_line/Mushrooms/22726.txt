I then came upon the phenomenon that relates to the title of this report. As I closed my eyes, there in front of my face, in an area I've come to call my event stage, or ampitheater, there happened some amazing things to the structure of space. I saw it (not as clearly as I would have hoped) bending, twisting, twirling, revolving back unto itself. I opened my eyes, then closed them again, and it happened again! I don't know how many times. Those of you who've done Salvia divinorum will recognize this as almost a signature phenomenon of it, this twisting of space. I have proven, at least to myself, that this also belongs to the tryptamine dimension.
