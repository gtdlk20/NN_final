D hears me scream 'Help!' He runs over and I say, 'Get me out of this!.....this time!' He pulls with all his might and I don't budge. Colors sweep through my face and starts to morph. D then goes to his room. He hears me talking to myself. I keep saying random things..just gone. After an hour I snapped back in reality. We chilled for awhile and the called it a night.
