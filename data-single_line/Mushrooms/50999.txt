By this time I was having some bad-ass open eye visuals. I could hardly see my room any longer, it was if a screen of red and blue swirly dots had covered my eyes. I layed down and covered up and had a long series of open/closed eye visuals, and then slowly drifted into a peaceful sleep. I wasn't 'hung over' or anything the next morning, in fact, after going to sleep at 5 in the morning after a 6 hour trip, I woke at 8 AM, ready to start my day in the beautiful new world that I had discovered the night before. Emotionally, I felt pretty happy, pretty satisfied. I felt that I had found something beautiful within myself, and even if no one else knew it was there, I knew it, and I had seen it, and that comforted me.
