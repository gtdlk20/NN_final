I'm dying! I cant get up and theres this roaring I hear that I cant explain! This is truly the end! I thought of how fun my life had been and I was so thankful. I had so much fun! The good definitely outweighed the bad! I know Ill try harder in the next life! and I accepted dying. Goodbye beautiful world, I thought. I braced myself but nothing, just more white light. Then, Planet Earth slowly fizzled back into my sight, as the trees in the backyard manifested themselves again. More and more of my vision came back and I realized I was holding onto the grass and dirt of the Earth beneath me. The roaring was still there and I processed more of my surroundings for what felt like forever and then the roaring stopped so suddenly, it was almost like somebody popped the bubble of whatever weird dimension I got stuck in. What a release! Ohhh, I moaned and the relief from that noise ceasing was extremely euphoric. I could finally hear my friend again. What a release! Ohhh, I moaned and the relief from that noise ceasing was extremely euphoric. I could finally hear my friend again. He was like Are you okay? What happened? over and over but I couldnt speak. I couldnt speak about this for a day or so in completion. I got parts out but communication really failed me, especially at first. I dont remember saying anything except Im coming back, Im coming back as my soul came back into my body and learned to speak again (or thats what it felt like) and I took a while to process everything. I looked down and saw my hands and the jeans on my legs and the rest of my body. Im a girl. I have a nameyeahthings came back slowly. I knew this guy next to me but it was hard to figure out exactly who he was. I couldnt remember much, I had to recollect the people I love. It wasnt too hard but it was eerie that it took any effort at all. At least I was already with someone I was extremely comfortable with.
