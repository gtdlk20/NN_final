Suddenly we were back in the casino, surrounded by the noises. It had been about an hour since we ingested and I felt the need to attempt to interact with the craziness of the casino, so I sat at a video poker machine. The animated cards kept me interested for quite a while, and luckily I only lost a few quarters. Eventually, I stopped playing and just watched the moving lights and characters. The jacks seemed particularly amazing at the time. I had the impression that I was near a peak as because of the intensity of the lights and noises and people. We decided to leave again and to try and cross that four-lane street. It seemed like the right thing to do.
