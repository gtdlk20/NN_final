After I rinsed I opened my eyes and to my suprise H2O was no longer being dispersed from the shower head, but rather a steam of lovely colors.  My thoughts were 'What the Hell, its only been 15 mins since I'd eaten, I Gotta Get Going, especially since I have to ride my mountain bike to the house.' and I stepped out of the shower to grab my towel.
