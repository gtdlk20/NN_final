In the end, we were successful crossing the street and railroad tracks. I asked dude where he wanted to go and he indicated that we should head to the biggest casino around. So, we headed. Suddenly, dude says, Oh my god, it's the lizard version of my boss! I stopped, looked at the billboard, agreed with him, then leaned against a lamppost and watched the sidewalk start to breath. I must have been staring at my feet and the sidewalk for several minutes while dude mumbled something about lizard faces. The people walking by must have thought we were insane, but we certainly didnt care.
