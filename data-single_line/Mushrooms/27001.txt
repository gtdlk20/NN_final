I acquired the mushrooms with a friend of mine that was visiting from college for the summer. I had purchased two bags, each with about an eighth of an ounce (though it looked like more) of cubensis, and he bought an eighth as well. We were going to go walking in the park and experience nature and that kind of hippy crap. My plan was to eat one of my baggies and see how I reacted with him in the park (it being my first time and my friend being much more experienced I thought it would be good to have a baby sitter) and then (unless I had a really bad experience) I was going to take the other bag of drugs (mushroooooomss.) alone at my house and well I honestly dont know what my specific intention was but I know it was along the line of delving into the depths of my mind and looking for truth, spirituality, obstacles,  the true nature of existence, and my ego less self. You know, hippy shit.
