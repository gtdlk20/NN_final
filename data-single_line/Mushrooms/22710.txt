But it is the emotional content that was paramount for me. Parenthetically I have to explain that I had been off mushrooms for a long time before I started again just a few weeks ago. Circumstances just didn't lend themselves to experimentation, or maybe I was just making excuses. Now, with this trip, I got back to mental places that I had not visited in many years. What joy! The first flash of this was somewhere atround the middle of the trip. I realized suddenly that I just felt something (and saw something!) that I had in a long ago trip, an exact mental state and the accompanying imagery. I was dumbfounded. I didn't know that this was possible. It happened again just a few minutes later, a different state and image. I can't explain here the characteristics of what I saw, but I can assure you that a definite sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu was present.
