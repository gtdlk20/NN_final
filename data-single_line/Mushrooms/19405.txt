The setting: At home, I usually live near campus in the country, but was visiting my parents for the holidays and decided the comfort of home was a very good place to experience a spiritual trip as its a place for me that is recognised as safe and hold some nostalgic attributes to it as well. I also had a little head cold that wouldnt leave, and when its winter, the warmth of the inside is very comfortable.
