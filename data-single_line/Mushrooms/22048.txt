Up ahead I spotted a man and his son drifting on a row boat. I gathered myself back to my very sub-six 100 feet height and sent out a High fellas! hoping there was not too much giggle mixed with my words. They waved back and I continued on the pond loop trail.  The blending feeling continued and grew stronger. I sort of felt like my head was put through one of those photo effects where all the pixels are smeared outward 360 degrees from the center. I entered a stretch of the path (a path I knew very well and was quite at ease) that was darker  more overgrown with arching trees that blocked most of the sky. I felt a bit creeped-out but I refused to let this slip into some kind of bad trip. I booted myself in the beshroomed butt and just marched on. Up ahead the opening to a clearing sat like a landscape painting framed in a fancy, wooden frame one might find lying in a garage sale. In actuality it was an opening made by hanging trees but my tunnel vision and blending really made it appear like a framed painting. It was a pretty rendering but cheesy. Was this the path to follow or was it the less picturesque trail that veered off to my left a bit? This cant be the trail- its too obvious. I looked at the alternate. No. The cheesy nature painting was correct. Dont overcomplicate life, the shrooms seemed to be saying. Sometimes the obvious path is correct!
