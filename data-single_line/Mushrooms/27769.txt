Still I walked, and played, and saw my future, horrifying and alien, spin out before me.  The only continuity was that, in every bizzare movie of the future that I watched, I had my guitar, it was all I had to remind me that I had not always been the madman I felt myself become.  Finally, I reached a crossroads in the middle of campus from which I could not repair.  I tried to leave in each direction, but was unable to walk beyond the reach of the piercingly bright streetlamps outside a wholly unfamiliar building.  I was too scared to leave, and lost myself in abject despair.  I lay down finally, unable to walk and fight my mind any more.  I laid myself down to die.
