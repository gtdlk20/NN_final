I mean, it was without a doubt communicating with me at the time.  Imagine what you would do if water rapids were telling you they hate you and wish you were dead.  This kinda freaked me out, so I returned to the shore and continued down the stream to this dead log covered in moss and mushrooms.  As the sun set, the moss turned into an almost neon color, and the mushrooms shifted around on the surface of the bark in a random pattern.  The sunset was absolutely beautiful through the silhouette of the red, green, and orange trees.
