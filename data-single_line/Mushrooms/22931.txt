This wasn't an aggressive, energetic dance, like from earlier. Rather I was just exploring what my body could do. I snaked my arms through space and whispered across the floor step by step. I should mention that my room was pitch black except for the light of my smoke detector. I danced across my room and when I looked up, I saw the green light of the smoke detector making a peace sign. It brought a smile to my face. I wish this moment had lasted longer because it brought out a side of me I didn't know existed. But alas, nature called and I had to go to the bathroom.
