This is where the shrooms take over and I am along for the ride.  I was sitting in my chair thinking, and all of a sudden I was not at my apartment anymore.  I didnt know where I was, or what I had done.  I didnt realize that I had taken shrooms, and if you would have asked me anything I would have not been able to answer you.  From what I can remember it seemed like I was strapped to a table, my feet and hands were bound, so I couldnt move at all.  Then the voices and the smell of a hospital came.  People were telling me that if I didnt throw up they would have to operate.  I was starting to freak out.  I was telling myself to stay calm, stay calm.  Then I would feel better, but only for about a minute.  Then the voices came back.  This time they said I would die if I didnt make an effort (effort for what I didnt know)  By this time I thought that I passed out or something and my roommate had taken me to the hospital.  I could feel myself pissing on me (to find out later that was not the case), It felt that I was dying. I could feel them taking my blood pressure on my arm.  I could feel every pounding of my heart, which felt like it was going to explode.  All this time my sober roommate was telling me to stay calm, its only the shrooms, I really wanted to believe him but everything seemed so real.
