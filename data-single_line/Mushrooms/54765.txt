Her needs are tended.  I feel relieved that she is feeling well again, and returning to her experience. I head outside, taking my puppy with me.  It is -15*F outside.  It is the most beautiful snow I have ever seen.  It is fresh, it snowed about an inch overnight. The dog is very concerned   Seems to think there is something with me.  She runs frantically around the house. I bring her to her kennel, so we can have some peace.  She is just a puppy, I love her so much.
