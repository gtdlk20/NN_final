I must give you a little info about myself first. I am almost 20 years old, a sophomore in college and in the past year have developed this strong interest in psychoactive drugs, especially in mushrooms. I have smoked marijuana countless times, tried opium once, had a little run with coke and have done some wippets here and there.
