I began staring at the woods outside of the porch.  Soon all of the leaves of the trees became a continuous pattern that extened across my entire span of vision.  Then, to my utter amazement, the pattern moved closer and closer until I seemed like the woods were right next to the screen of the porch.  It was like I was enclosed by an encroaching jungle.  My concentration was broken when our petsitter showed up to to walk the dog.  This was unneccessary since I was already watching the house and the pets.  I felt slight paranoia and fear as she seemed to completely ignore our existence, and to top it off she was clearly a Butch-esque lesbian who looked more like a man than you could imagine.
