I decided that it was time that we kick up the buzz a little more so I suggested that I trek back to my truck to retrieve a lighter for the bowl of sunshine I was about to light. Unfortunately, no lighter, but I was back at the lake, which looked like a crystaline sea. When I was in my truck I caught myself dazing into the leaves and greenery that led back up to the trail. Without warning, an aural buzzing began to grow louder and louder in my ears until it sounded as if I was surrounded by a group of pissed of grasshoppers. For some odd reason, in response to all the static-like noise, my mouth drooped to an entirely opened stooper, uncontrolably. Then, when I looked away, all was well. I traveled back up the hillside and came into view of my beautifully blissful partner who was then sitting on the trail with a smile, awaiting my return. Following our trip back up into the wilderness we stopped and stared at several of the trees that all appeared to be breathing with life.
