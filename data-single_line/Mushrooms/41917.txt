My mood got increasingly worse and I suddenly realised it was getting very dark very quickly and most of the walk was through woods. I looked at my phone and I had 14% battery left. My phone likes to die at random times, and I was suddenly unsure of the way home. I saw I had missed calls from my mother and was panicking about my situation. I figured I can only safely do one thing with my phone before it was likely to die. The thought of calling my friends and asking them to come back was really embarrassing, like I would be failing myself for being unable to do the whole trip on my own wits and survival skills and that they would resent me for being arrogant enough to think I could make it all the way back and for making them even later for dinner. I thought about calling my mother but I would only worry her and sheÂ’d never find me before my battery ran out.
