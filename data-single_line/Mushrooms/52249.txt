After having another joint and a pint in a coffee shop, I saw an eye-catching mushroom shop.  What made it eye-catching were the two fine birds serving on the till.  I went in with Dave and asked them if they had any Philosophers Stone.  I had read about this stuff in the store I bought the Liberty Cap from.  I had found out it was strong, but didnÂ’t buy any 'cause they were only selling 4 grams for 30 guilders.  The info they gave me was that you need 8-15 grams for a strong trip.  The fit birds in the store told me they would sell 15 grams for 35 guilders.  I was amazed, I thought I had stumbled on one hell of a deal.  It seemed so good that Dave tried to buy some, but they only had one box left!
