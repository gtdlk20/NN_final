When I knew I was seriously tripping was the scene in the Elevator with Cameron Diaz. They still weren't making any sense. You know when you look at your fingers and move your eyes out of focus you will see 2 of each finger? Well that's what Cameron Diaz's face looked like, only instead of two faces in a wide space there were like five all in the same small space. It seemed like it was going in slow-mo. If I hadn't of already seen the movie several times I would have sworn they were just doing visual effects to show you how high Hunter Thompson was. Although he wasn't actually high in that scene.
