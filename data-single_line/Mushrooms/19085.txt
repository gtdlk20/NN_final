The mushrooms were coming into fuller force by now, each minute marked a huge increase in effects. If I had been lost in the hallway before, now I was lost and confused. I couldnt see anything through the crackling visual patternings, and walked into the wall by accident. Continuing down the hallway towards two faint bars of bluish light, I eventually found myself running into our bed, only a couple feet away from the window which was the source of the faint blue illumination. Well, at least I had found my room! I tried feeling for my backpack in the dark. Is this it? I couldnt tell. It didnt feel quite right, and yet I was sure it must be my backpack. Where was the light switch? I flailed around, spinning, half falling. Reaching out desperately for the light switch, and not finding it. How could it be so difficult? Why did it have to be so dark? I was so disoriented I no longer knew which way was even back to the hallway. Finally I managed to orient myself and turn on the light. Then it was the work of a second to find my backpack and pull a clean pair of socks out. Lights out, and I groped my way back to the round room, passing Alice who was on her way to the bathroom.
