Dude saw a boxing match on the TV at the bar and wanted to sit down for a minute. I staggered to my seat and leaned my head on the bar. The large Budweiser sign started breathing heavily, getting really tiny, then taking up my entire field of vision. Things around me seemed closed in and were almost entirely breathing. While the sensation itself was relatively enjoyable, I had the feeling that the people around me could tell that something was amiss. When dude got tired of watching the boxing match, or couldn't focus on the TV anymore, we left the bar. We decided that it was about time to get back to home base. Walking was getting a little more difficult, and the prospect of rolling around on a casino floor was somewhat daunting.
