When I close my eyes, over some seconds I begin to see intricate fractal-like patterns, though Im surprised by how object like it is? Here a pattern in my head forms out of a house, there components of faces (especially mouths?) form new patterns. Seeing disembodied portions of faces makes me feel a bit uneasy, so I would try to move my attention away from them.
