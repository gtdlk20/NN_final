A little preface: I had been interested in hallucinogens for a long time, when a new acquaintance, lets call him A, offered me a chance to go on a mushroom trip with him. Before we could take the trip, however, something happened between us  we experienced a weirdly strong attraction for each other neither of us could really explain, so strong it felt almost physically painful for my part. We didnt act on the attraction as I was in a relationship already, but the experience really shook my world, so when we took the trip a couple of days later, I was hoping that it would bring some clarity into the situation and what was behind it.
