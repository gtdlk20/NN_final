I felt the need for some feminine comfort, and went to search for Miel and Alice, finding them cuddling naked up in Goopstars room, called the aquarium due to its blue-washed walls and the dolphin painted on the wall. I climbed into bed with them, still feeling a little dead inside and anxious, just to cuddle. Cory and Goopstar came up after a while. They went outside to burn this old mask of Corys, the head of a jackal, guardians of the gates to the underworld. This symbolically completed their own death phases of the trip. They came back in, talking about how they wanted to kill a rabbit, and asking Alice if they brought in a fresh rabbit, would she eat the liver?
