Everyone ended up going back to the living room and found places to sit. We were all exiting the Insanity of the initial part of the trip. I looked at the clock and it read 9:15. Only 2 hours had gone by but it seemed like it had been days. The really crazy hallucinations had stopped and everything had taken on shimmering saturated jungle lushness. We have a large watercolor of red apples floating on an emerald green random geometric background that boiled and moved in beautiful hypnotic chaotic madness.  Kate watched it with me and seemed to actually be enjoying it. I apologized again to everyone. Adam laughing said Apologize? We should be thanking you! This was genius bro. You are a fucking mad scientist. Thats whats great about you, you are this really smart guy, but you do crazy shit. I try to get as fucked up as you did, but I have to buy my shit and I still dont get as mad as you did. You decided to trip and brewed up this incredible shit all on your own and sent everyone into orbit. I think it is fantastic.  Adam continued singing my praises and I just laughed. Yeah, I was the real mad scientist. I acted like I knew shit about mushrooms and I knew absolutely nothing about them at all. I had never even come close to tripping like I had or even like Kate and Ann had.
