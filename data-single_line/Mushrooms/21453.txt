I curled up on the couch to wait. I start experiencing waves of 'buzziness' much like being high on marijuana or light nitrous.  This state is very sensual, and I find myself aroused, and any physical contact is pleasurable.  This state lasts perhaps a half an hour, and as the waves come upon themselves spaced less further apart, I notice my partner is curled up on the other couch. Occasionally I hear snoring or labored breathing so I ask a couple of times 'are you ok?' and hear noises of assent.  I'm not extremely worried, only keeping a human connection at this point.
