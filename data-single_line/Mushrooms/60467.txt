I started out by planning out my day. Just like most journeys to the unknown. I strongly felt the urge to ingest the mushrooms around 3 o'clock, so I could witness the fall of the sun around six. About an hour before the trip I decided to take an hour long weed nap, I didn't want to have a weed high during my trip. I like just feeling the all out effects of the mushroom.
