Suddenly a million memories started flooding back to me. But they werent memories from my life. They were memories of the ultimate truth. The answer to every question. This is definitely the hardest part of the trip to explain. It was like an incredible never ending déjà vu. The feeling kept getting stronger and stronger as I was soaring through this new spiritual dimension, I didnt have a body to hold me down. Nor did I have a self to hold me together. When you are on the earth existence, its like you have blinders on, making you forget about the truth. But once you leave the earth world, the spiritual understanding comes back to you.
