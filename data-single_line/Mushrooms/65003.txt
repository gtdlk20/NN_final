I noticed my friend B, who was sitting in the back of the car wasen't saying anything at all, I asked him if he was ok and he quickly commented that he's starting to trip hard.  Hearing this, I roll up another joint and we smoked it.  The ride back to my house was very relaxing, and I felt my mind wander off thinking about anything and everything. I was having a great time, and I was pretty sure B was too.
