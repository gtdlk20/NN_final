It is un-English-able but it was beauty on a cosmic and galactic scale. I use those words cosmic and galactic because I somehow those words fit best with what I was experiencing. I really felt completely fine and not frightened or even nauseous but completely astonished.  I start to consider that I was experiencing a symbiosis, telepathy with the mushroom I ate and was experiencing somehow the consciousness or mind of the mushroom. You are what you eat and this thought did not seem wild or crazy but made a good deal of sense.
