Ace was being pretty quiet at this point and really just looking around a lot. I found out later, when he was able to hold a conversation again, that he was feeling similar paranoid thoughts as though everyone in the theater knew what we were up to. Once the movie started, I made it about 10 minutes before the hard core visuals started in (T+0:45). All the people in the movie looked like claymation figures and the music was very repetitive and rung in my ears for the rest of the night. I remember asking my sister's friend numerous times if the movie was animated. I was very restless and couldn't find a comfortable position to sit in the chairs and kept shifting around.
