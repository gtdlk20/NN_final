I jumped in the shower, but my vision was so distorted I thought I kept seeing dirt on me. I tried not to let that deceive me. The fabric on the wet, blue rag kept moving around like stop motion worms. I got out, got dressed, and went downstairs. Things were continuing to look pixelated, but I got myself a bowl of fruit and sat down with my mom and my brother. When I looked at the dogs, it looked like their fur was moving around. I ate an entire box of candy cakes and went up to bed.
