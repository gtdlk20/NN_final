'That nexus.  The water keeps calling me back.  It was like a womb ... a cold womb ---- aqua, the light playing above ---- I felt so perfect.'  Looking at the pad now, the handwriting goes from scratchy, and becomes more and more flowing until it is almost cursive, 'Like I was part of the water.  I want to be there again.  Like on the Gulf of Mexico with the sun so HOT, then cold.'  The handwriting suddenly becomes very straight, yet messy; almost maniacal, I remember feeling intense feelings of sexuality here, 'And Koala there ------ like a dune of bronze flesh just rising out in so perfect a beachscape, saying 'NOW IT'S PERFECT.''  This was an intense flashback to my first trip, but it ends just as abruptly, in once again flowing handwriting:  'Like the water.  I want to go in the water again.'
