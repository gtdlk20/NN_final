I took the whole 1/8 and chewed a couple at a time holding it in my mouth and trying to get all the juices out and then after chewing it to a really good pulp I would swallow.  This took me about 5 minutes or so to finish the whole 1/8.  I want to say it took about 20-30 minutes for me to really start feeling the physical effects of it.  It kinda felt like some sort of weird drunkenness, my limbs got all rubbery and noodley feelingit was a really cool feeling actually.  I felt a little nausea and discomfort through the whole thing but it wasnt all that bad.  I set my room up with a few candles and I lit my alter candle and some sandal wood and asked for some guidance during my trip.  I laid down on my bed and waited.
