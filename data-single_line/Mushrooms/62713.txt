I sat and thought that it couldn't have thrown something at me, it wasn't real. So I went back to my room, and it was still there. I sat on my bed facing it. It turned and looked at me. I saw it was a white floopy-eared rabbit. With a strange grin, and a star 'tatooed' on his left eye. It just looked at me. I got really scared again, and left my room. And din't go back.
