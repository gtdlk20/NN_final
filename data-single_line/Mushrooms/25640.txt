11:30 P.M. - Finally we found the bag right under a blanket on the bed that we had been sitting on. TRIP was extremely relieved and suggested that we finish up our bags. TRIPs mom came down at this point to put his younger brother to bed in the room just outside of ours. We went out to greet her carefully making sure we didnt say or do anything completely idiotic. His mom asked where the red blanket was for his younger brother and we calmly got it for her after some minor arguments. (We desperately wanted that blanket for some reason, even though it served virtually no purpose to us, as we were only sitting on it at the time and not actually using it.)
