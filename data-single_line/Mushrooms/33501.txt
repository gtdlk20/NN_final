We opened the door and walked back into the kitchen when the second wave came on. I went to the bathroom and it seemed very small and when I emerged I asked him 'Did the house always slant like this'? He laughed and said no, and I realised that it definitely wasn't over yet. I felt a strong urge to leave the house again so we got our shoes on again and headed out, a different direction this time.
