While sitting on the toilet, I could see myself in the mirror. It was somewhat disconcerting to see my face morphing and melting. Much like the main room, everything in the bathroom was moving. I was confused by the person I saw in the mirror. He looked familiar, but I knew it wasn't me. There were questions flying through my mind. Where am I? Why am I here? How did I get here? Am I really a goddamn Asian? I could hear dude outside saying something about snakes and bats, but I was contained in my world. There were random thoughts about my family, friends, my feet, my cock. I looked at myself naked. It seemed like a bad idea. I looked so ugly and strange.
