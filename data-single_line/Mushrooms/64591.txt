I was in a modern city in a nonspecific country and was told by a voice that if I could fit infinity into my head I would become God.  So I proceeded to try to pack everything into my mouth, the ground pulled up like a bedsheet and fit into my mouth as I ate it.  I could feel my consciousness expanding, seeing the universe as a whole and understanding what I was seeing. Right as I was about to see everything perfectly I woke up choking on a blanket. I ended up with a really sore throat and a horrible sinus and ear infection. I guess it was my punishment for toying with Gods power.
