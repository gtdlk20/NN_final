(1-2hrs) We walked inside of my house and went up to my room. My boyfriend lay down on my bed, while I attempted to plug my iPod in to listen to some music. I could definitely tell that I was a little overheated from walking outside and my room looked really inviting. The shades were pulled down so it was dark but you could still tell that it was beautifully sunny outside. We put on Phish and lay on my bed for a while.
