After about six hours, I was starting to get back to normal, but with a horrible feeling of having truly broken my psyche.  What did I expect when I asked to be shown the Beginning and the Truth or the Core.  Who wants to see the actual first electron spinning around its own center of masslesness?  He who keeps asking and lifting curtains, will ultimately, eventually, see the cold meaningless truth.  It is meaningless because the Universe and Life are steps towards realising Meaning.  This is an ultimate message of hope and glory  that one thought lead to a singularity which spawned a Universe seeking and finding that Meaning, through Will, through Novelty, Beauty and Love.  The intangible, ungraspable, intued but never boxed-in and measured reasons and results of the Cosmic enterprise.  I can say this now, six months later, and it has absolutely taken me that long to come out of the trip fully.
