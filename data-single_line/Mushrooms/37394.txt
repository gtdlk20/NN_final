I hadnt been using psychoactives for more than eight months when I decided that I was ready for my second mushroom journey. I had one other light experience with the sacred fungi a few months before.  I guess I should start with my first trip. It was a fairly cloudy/cool winterish day. I had been looking for some psilocybin mushrooms for a while and had been very close, but failed.
