My second (and so far most well-executed) mushroom trip was, I'd like to think, substantially better planned and executed than the harrowing, trainwreck of a trip I had put myself through just a few weeks prior. Having learned the titanic significance of set and setting the hard way, I now felt ready to plunder the benefits of the psychedelic experience. What would follow would be prove to indeed be infinitely better planned and carried out, albeit with intense amounts of struggle along the way.
