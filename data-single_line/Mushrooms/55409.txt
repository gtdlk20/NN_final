As the first hour passed I noticed small auditory changes but nothing to intense after about another half an hour passed I thought this was as far as it was going to go. Half dissapointed I laid down on my bed and listened to some pink floyd at about the second song I start to fell this strong pressure that seemed to be concentrated on the back half of my body after a few minutes past this feeling got stronger and stronger. My stomach felt a little weird like the felling where I have taken some pain killers and I can feel it when they start to dissolve and absorb into my stomach.Then I sat up and zowee my whole body felt extremly light and odd I went over to the mirror looked in it and as I suspected my pupils were litarally as big as dimes. After I saw this it was confirmed I was trippen.
