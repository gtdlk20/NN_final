Oh youre losing it mate, and why are all these people around? Faces faces, a gallery of faces looking at you strangely, curved, as if through a fish eye lens. Theyre lucky though, lucky to be in the truck, because all else is darkness nothingness a vacuum a void beyond even a nihilists worst nightmare. Oh I see, theyve come to see you have a bad trip, and bammmmmm you shoot up, look around wildly, like a wounded animal, getting once last glance of its surroundings before a cheetah leaps to kill it.
