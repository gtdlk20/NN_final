After about 6 hours, I felt 'myself' again, but still slightly affected. And I felt wonderful, minus a bit of slight nausea and a mild head ache. During a walk, I felt as if I was seeing for the first time. I was able to see birds at the slightest movement and identify detailed characteristics. I felt free and light, and at home in my body. This feeling lasted for nearly two days, and continues to some extent. I feel a desire to be outdoors, exploring nature.
