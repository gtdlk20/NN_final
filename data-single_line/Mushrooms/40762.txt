September. 3:09pm I was happy and excited yet respectful of the experience to come. I water fasted for 24 hours prior. As a holy ritual, I weighed out my remaining amount of ground up Taj Mahal mushrooms. It came to 6.1 grams. I swirled the powder with water in my Dark Side of the Moon cup and enjoyed the earthiness through a straw. I laid down on my bean bag chair and awaited the magic.
