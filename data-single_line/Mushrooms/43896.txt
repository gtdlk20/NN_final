After our little hour walk we went back to the car. We were in that car for about 2 hours on the dot, spent most of our trip in there actually. when 9pm came around we all wanted to leave because it was dark, we had run out of water and food pretty much and I anyways was starving. I felt as though it was my responsibility to drive because it was my car but I was honestly still feeling high and wasn't comfortable driving back. My friend Mitch volunteered and we switched seats and after a bit of getting comfortable behind the wheel we were off.
