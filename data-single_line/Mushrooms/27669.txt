The next day I was awed at the experience Â‚ without a doubt my most profound psychedelic exploration to date. I understand now what Terence McKenna has been saying all along; music and nature are transcendent and inspirational in themselves without the mushrooms, but it is the internal psychedelic experience that offers us a unique opportunity to explore usually inaccessible regions and encounter vast landscapes of mind and consciousness, unknown realms of love and beauty and information. I'm not saying that tripping out in an ancient forest or dosing at a secluded spot by the ocean during the day is wrong. On the contrary, I have enjoyed many wonderful journeys in just such locations. However, if you have never tripped at night in the pitch black with no social distractions, I leave you with this thought - the darkness has much to offer. My thanks to Terence McKenna and Psilocybe cubensis.
