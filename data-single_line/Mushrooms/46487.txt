Just yesterday I was lucky enough to experience a medium dose of Psilocybe Tampanensis. We bought a vial of the stuff illegally from a store and were originally planning to split it between three people. The mushrooms were dried and rock hard, and a friend ended up crushing them up finer so they would be absorbed better. As there was another group endulging who had 1/3 of a vial remaining, I decided I would eat that too because I was really in the mood for a strong trip (we were told 1.3 would be enough). We went for a short walk to wait for the drug to kick on, cracking out a box of nitrous along the way. After about 20 minutes and a ciggarette, i began to feel quite strange, but I couldn't put my finger on what I was feeling.
