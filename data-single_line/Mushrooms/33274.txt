During this half hour, I began to go deep in thought and think about things my mind could normally not handle. I thought about time and how strange it was. It is really just numbers and something to keep track of our lives. Nothing that really matters. The other thing that I thought about time was that we never have time to just simply be. We labeled everything we do on a daily basis by hours, minutes, seconds and so on.
