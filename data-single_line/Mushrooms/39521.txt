I started to wander around aimlessly shortly after this, staring at anything and everything. It felt like I had been born again into an alien and extraordinary world, and was exploring its intricacies with a very child-like and innocent curiosity. I wandered on a path back and forth between the dirt road and the area in the trees where music was playing; muttering things that I'm sure made no sense at all. I did this quite a bit. A guy handed me a bottle of Mr. Bubble, which became a source of much confusion later on.  Somewhere lying on the ground I found a neon-green cargo netting, and for some reason decided to drape it over myself and walk around.  The funny thing was that I was completely aware of how absurd I must seem to everyone around me, but I didn't care at all. I walked around several parked cars that people were sleeping inside of, and stared at them through the windows. And then I decided to walk towards the lake, which was about 100 meters away. I would walk about 10 paces and then stop and stare at the bottle of Mr. Bubble in my hand, completely confused.  And then walk 10 or so more paces, stop, stare confused, repeat ad nauseum.  It was ridiculous.  I finally got to the lake. At this point I believe I was coming down.  I was very calm and 'at peace with the earth.'
