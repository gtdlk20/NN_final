Entities - I felt like I was coming up to the inter-dimensional door / barrier of some ineffable thing, something that was distinctly OTHER, not in an alien sense, but in a creator/manager of the universe sense. I had NO desire to knock. I came barging in once, a long time ago, and the defensive retaliation left me psychologically crippled for a long time. Fair enough, lesson learned - donÂ’t barge in on others.
