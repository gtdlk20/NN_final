Cory told me an old aphorism, of life being a well. Sorrow is the shovel that digs the well, and happiness is the water that fills it. Given this, would you really want a shallow well? This resonated with me, that sorrow and joy are really opposite sides of the same coin, and that the greater our ability to experience one dimension, the greater also our ability to experience the other. We talked a little about how sometimes psychiatrist drugs just level us out, taking away the sorrowful lows but taking away the blissful peaks also. I have said before, and I will say again, I would rather live a life of peaks and valleys than an existence flattened out.
