Cannabis was a revelation. So little effort was required to produce such profound effect. On my first time, I had three tokes from a red-seal laced bong. I soared. I must have laughed for half an hour straight, just at the fact I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on all this time. Every sense was amplified, and distorted. I was hysterical and hyperactive, but, above all, I was happy. I ended up having an excessive habit for seven years.
