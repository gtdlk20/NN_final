I got up and went to the bathroom because I had to pee, and decided to gaze in the mirror, I saw double hazes around my body, and my hands had tracers when I moved them.  I started out just moving my hands and watching the tracers and then I just started to flow, my hands and arms were dancing with all the energy around me, it was really cool, it was like I was just letting my hands ride and dance on this energyÂ…kind of like when your driving and you stick your hand out and dance it on the wind except it was different and way cooler.  This flowing freely lasted through the whole trip and I think it was the best part.  My mind and thoughts flowed freely as did my emotions and I felt totally free and beautiful.
