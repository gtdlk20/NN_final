The past few months I've been interested in growing mushrooms and as my first time I didn't follow the correct colonizing/fruit temperature causing them to grow insanely slow. After growing a heavy yield and selling a few grams to friends I decided it would be a good weekend to try my grow. The plan was to have my friends who I wont name do them with me around our fire pit in the woods by my house where we always hang out in and drink(I figured it would be a great setting because of how much fun we always have and also growing up in these woods my whole life I feel very comfortable (because we were doing them at night). But as the time comes some of them back out because of work and girlfriends and I figured I wouldn't do them alone so I'll just drink (it was Saturday so it turns out to be and 4 friends M,A,M,D,T. M and A were originally going to do mushrooms with me but end up doing acid instead and talk me into trying my product anyway so I said fuck it I'm gonna take 1 mushroom to see how potent they were(this mushroom I took was maybe a gram at most) the worst I'm gonna get is a mood change and maybe a few patterns on the floor (I haven't ate in maybe 4 hours) and id also drink a few beers so we got our cooler and went up to the woods.
