We walked around disoriented through the forest. Nobody was capable of selecting a path, when it came to a fork we would stop and talk hysterically for what seemed like ages. I was tripping quite decently by then, I figured I had level 2 visuals at that point, which was as far as they had gone on any previous trip as well. We walked and walked and laughed smoking more weed. I'm a crazy bad asthmatic and sometimes weed just grabs me by the lungs and chokes. One particularly large hoot (I was absolutely unable to feel how much smoke was in my lungs, I just breathed out and smoke just billowed). I coughed like crazy, and :( I managed to cough so hard as to induce projectile vomiting. Imagine talking to your friends and suddenly just puke alll over. I threw up non stop for about 10 minutes, dry heaving and the whole unpleasent lot. I was an absolute mess. We sat down on a bench where T and B proceded to smoke more weed.
