A lot of people came into the kitchen, because they were fascinated by the idea of someone who was tripping balls on what they perceive to be such an exotic substance. People started interrogating me about the shrooms, what they were like, and I got asked a lot of stupid quetsions like 'Can you see purple unicorns?'. This frustrated me, and the large mass of people suddenly fucked with my emotions. A wave of fear and discomfort overcame me, and I isolated myself from everyone else in the attic. As soon as I was away from everyone else, I suddenly felt much calmer and at ease.
