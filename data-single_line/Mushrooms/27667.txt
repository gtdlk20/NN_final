There was a dialogue going on but I couldn't figure out if I was communicating with my deeper self and accessing my own true wisdom, or if this was the other and I was channeling some infinite wisdom through another dimension. Whatever it was, it told me this: We've been doing this forever and we always will be. Welcome, we are glad you came, we have been here all this time, and most people don't even realize it. Isn't it funny that most people are scared of this place? Come back and see us again.
