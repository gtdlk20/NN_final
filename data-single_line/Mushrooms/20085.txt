Several minutes later, I began to feel nervous.  I wasnÂ’t sure what I was getting myself into, and I was afraid my friends would find out and look down on me (which was a ridiculous concern).  I began to tremble and feel very claustrophobic.  We had just finished our meal, so I threw my money on the table and went outside while my friends worked out the tab.  Outside was much better.  I liked the sunshine and the reduced noise.  By the time I had finished a cigarette, my friends had come out, and I was much calmer.
