Then my friend wanted to screw with my mind and he said he thought my arm broke when he stepped on it. Before he finished his words, I felt my bones shifting as they broke apart. I looked to my arm and saw a bump as the bone pushed up on my skin. I sat there telling myself, you are tripping, your arm is not broken, your arm is fine, rugs dont even have arms, I dont have arms and therefore how could it be broken. I laid back and watched the ceiling fan move to the music. I then realized that all day, everyday, with no choice, the rug and the ceiling fan look at each other. I named the fan Garry and began to talk to Garry about his life as a fan. I asked what he thought about the rug and if he thought we were good people. Hours had gone by, by this point and I was beginning to come down. I got up and set up my hookah. I spent the rest of my trip laying on the rug smoking my hookah with my girlfriends friend. I felt so content and so bonded with this girl. I felt as if id known her forever and that we were best friends (which is funny cause I never used to like this girl). All in all, it was a great night.
