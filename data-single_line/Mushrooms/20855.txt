What? How is that possible? I cant believe it. My Inner Self said. The voices continued their dialogue, that strange sound that comically reminded me of the parents voices in Snoopy cartoons.  A sort of ngwa, wa, wa ngwaawa.  Im what? My facial expression is dumbfounded. For some reason royalty comes to mind though the Inner Self didnt state this. I am reminded of David Icke stating he was the son of God and being obliterated by character assassination for it. Here I can understand why he said what he did. My feelings of being full of myself dissipate. Im what? I repeat. Here my eyes began to stream tears again. For me?! My voice breaks again. Forme...? I repeat in awe. I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude and humility. Here even Me Lying on the Bed understands what was being said to me. I felt this particular piece of information. Something about what is waiting for me, something like paradise, some unexplainable reward that defies comprehension. Something like heaven, though these words are pale and inadequate. My understanding that this is for me/all of us, fills my soul with elation. Here words ring in my mind. My Mothers voice, and my own voice of the Inner Self whispering the words, No one gets left behind. I absently repeat the words verbally for several seconds and smile.
