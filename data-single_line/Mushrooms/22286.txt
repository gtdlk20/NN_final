I lay back down and began to forget who I was, I kept asking 'Who am I?' in my head and getting answers that began with 'Gregg Dix' and ended up with 'no one.' I was definitely speaking with myself, or another part of myself.  I got up and walked over to Jeff who was under the blanket and looked very comfortable and happy, I lay next to him and he gave me my pillow.  I began to feel it very strongly and Jeff told me he believed that the strongest part of our trip was yet to come.  I began to feel slightly nervous and asked Jeff what we were doing, he said I had eaten mushrooms, I asked him if he had as well and he responded with a yes.  I asked him if he was my brother and I told him that I am Gregg Dix, he seemed to know all this already, but as I told him my name it seemed meaningless and empty.
