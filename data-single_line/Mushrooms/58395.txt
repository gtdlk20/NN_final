As bucks do, this one raises his head often to spy lions, but I stand in the bushes and smell him but he doesnt notice. Next he slopes to drink again and I raise my hands like ears above my head and when he looks up he sees me against the sky looming there and exits vertically from the streambed as though through some sipapu into a fifth world. The earth drums and he is gone and so is the reflected red light from the facing cliffside. Across the stream is a flat area under the big pines. I manage halfassedly to get a fire going and am totally involved in the flames which seem right then important as heat that can sterilize and cauterize because I have carried here a secret illness from the city Ive escaped and it hangs here in the dark green expecting an exorcism.
