As I approach him I hear him mumbling things like 'god danmit stop stop it danmit just fucking stop it god I fuckin hate it I hate it no' then I come up to him and as calm as he can say it he says 'whats up man, and note that as Im looking at him that I can see the darkness flowing from him as if I can see him having a hard time and I could literally see his bad trip. I just ask calmly how he's feeling and whats up and he replies that he feels the craziest hes ever been then walks a few steps, stops, sits down, stands up,sits down then rolls on the ground then gets back up so I just put my hand on his back and tell him to calm down and just sit down. Then I cant remember what exactly happened next but we decided to go back to Akmed and Mcmurphy (who are going out by the way) who are still just chillin. Then Lucifer says he has to walk around more now so me Lucifer and Akmed just go for a lil jog while Mcmerfy chills in my yard.
