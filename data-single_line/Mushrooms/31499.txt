(0  30 min) I took the shrooms with my boyfriend on a beautiful, sunny Saturday. We could not have asked for a better day to trip. We started out taking a half of an eight because we didnt want to take too much our first time. We ate the shrooms in yogurt and sat down to watch the end of our teams basketball game. I felt a little nervous but mainly excited. I kept paying really close attention to my body looking for any sign of change. I felt a light energy in the tops of my forearms but really nothing else. We won the basketball game after a layup and everybody in the room erupted in celebration. I was really grateful that we could get a good buzz from the game to propel us into the rest of our adventure.
