After taking 5 or 6 small caps and stems and eating them the effects came on slowly, over the course of 45 minutes.  I first noticed when we were blowing bubbles in the back yard and the colors were becoming blindingly bright, I could see the vibrations of the bubbles as they quivered in the air. Later I looked up at the stars and noticed they were made of 3 colors like a 3d movie, my friends were enjoying something in the house, but I didn't feel light and childish as I had before, instead I walked to the fire pit and sat, staring into the flames.
