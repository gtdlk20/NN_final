From the time I entered the house, and then for another 2-2 ½ hours, I was on an area rug right near where I had entered.  Things become very hard to put into a chronological perspective here.  I lay on my back and looked up at the iron chandelier above.  D was looking too.  The metalwork was created in the shape of leaves, pods, etc. and it was basically a normally symmetrical, round chandelier shape as seen from the floor.  However, it was moving and breathing like an organism.  I said its moving and D said, its growing.  Immediately I saw that it was, in fact, growing from the center out, as if it was expanding as it breathed.
