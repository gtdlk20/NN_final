About 30 minutes into the movie (T+1:05), I was pretty leveled out on my high, feeling the same visuals and restlessness as before and didn't seem to be increasing in intensity. Ace, however, began poking me repeatedly and telling me he had to go to the bathroom. I told him just to go on his own, but he persisted that he couldn't. My sister's friend finally agreed to go with him and he stumbled the entire way out of the theater. They were gone about 25 minutes and I was told that Ace refused to go into the men's restroom because he wasn't sure that was the one he was supposed to go into. He ended up wandering around the lobby of the theater for 20 minutes while my sister's friend followed behind making sure he didn't do anything that would get him kicked out.
