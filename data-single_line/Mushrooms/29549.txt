Thinking of this, I was suddenly battling the universe.  I stole a pen and wrote on my arm 'I can't see where I am and how to come back to space and time'.  It was a complete existential meltdown in front of a bunch of other tripping people.  Everyone else was in their own world and I couldn't be pulled out of my trip.
