T+1:10: It felt like I had been drawing my 'house' for hours, and retrospectively it looks like it took hours! I was worried I was wasting too much of the trip and finished the drawing with a sense of urgency. When I checked my phone it had been just over twenty minutes, but I had finished my drawing and was suddenly reminded of the instruments I'd brought in. I decided to play the piccolo, (I haven't had tuition or practice) but it was amazingly fun, I had mild cottonmouth before I started, but at the end of it THE DESERT WAS IN MY MOUTH. I really got caught up in some of the tunes I would make up, and sometimes I'd find myself repeating very simple tunes over and over and over, marvelling in their wondrous sounds. When I decided to stop playing my mouth was so dry it felt as if I had dry glue in my mouth, and I absolutely tripping balls at the amazing sensations of thwacking my tongue against the top of my mouth and prying it off. Sculled nearly a litre of water, swallowing was also an amazing sensation. That's one of the things I love about psychedelics, increased sensory input, especially somatosensory input!
