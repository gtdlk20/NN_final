The car ride home was extremely enjoyable, we realised that we werent coming down as fast as we thought and were still experiencing moderate effects. No-one really spoke for the first hour of the journey as we were both in our own little worlds. I was playing live on stage at a festival and M felt like he was in a film watching the world go by. We then arrived home, said goodbye to C and P and went to our local Pub for a few quiet beers. We both sat feeling extremely good about ourselves and chatted extensively about how Phat and Mint the day had been. By this point we were both pretty much completely down. All in all an extremely enjoyable day.
