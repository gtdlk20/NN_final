I sat for a while longer, but the sun was now shaded, and I felt like I wasn't in the place I wanted to be.  I went back to the bags, put on a turtleneck, and found a notepad and pen in someone's bag.  I sat down and looked out over the water, all alone on the rock.  I sat on my grandmother's quilt, and it just seemed so comfortable and warm, I didn't ever want to leave.  I began to flash back to my first trip, on a Florida beach.  I saw the blazing sun, the eons of waves in front of my disembodied legs, my trip buddy's smooth bronze body next to me.
