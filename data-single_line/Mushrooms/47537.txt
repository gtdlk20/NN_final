In the following weeks I had many a flashback dream. Id wake in the night feel like my blankets were swallowing me. Id also awake and feel a total body high and almost like I was tripping or stoned. The amount of feelings I could feel were expanded by shrooms and carried over into my dreams. I have had more crazy dreams constantly since. I think the mushrooms also changed what my experience is when I smoke weed. Being high seems like much more of a different reality now. Ill do these fancy mushrooms again when the weather is nice. Weeeeeeeeee.
