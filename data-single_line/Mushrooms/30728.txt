I was laying there with eyes closed and everything feeling great when all of a sudden a face slowly shifted into being. My eyes were definitely closed but I could see it clearer than anything Ive ever seen. It was simply a face with no body, but it was a crystalline face. Not identifiable as male or female, but oh my GOD was it beautiful. The colors that resonated from it were other worldly and there are no words I can form to describe its beauty. I looked at it and asked (not verbally) Who are you?. It replied I am your true mother. I replied back what do you mean? My mom is right over there. It smiled and said Yes, that is your mom, but I am your TRUE mother. Im getting teary eyed writing this, its so real to this day. I have NEVER in my life felt so at home, the feeling of belonging was so genuine and overwhelming, I began to cry. I then asked it Why am I here? What is my purpose? It simply smiled and replied You know why and exited from my vision. I was so touched and at awe I dont really recall what happened for the next few minutes. The body euphoria was so intense I felt like I wanted to throw up. Then, I had my last major experience.
