I got back inside and related to my friend what happened, I then sat on my bed and she let me think in silence. So the energy I thought was my moms higher self was none other than Mom. Gaia. Im sure that it represented all female maternal energies but yet.it was actually Mom. Our mother Earth. I felt honored, and precious. After my week with the mushroom, a series of synchronistic events led to me to pack my bags and move to Colombia, South America, but that is another story.
