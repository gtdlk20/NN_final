My big head and small body was floating through some sort of earthly consciousness, the immediate consciousness of all mammals on shrooms.  I floated by a cow, who looked as if she too had a small body large mind.  The cow and I could communicate, much the same way that I communicated last trip, but on a much smaller level.  The friendly cow greeted me with a 'hello' (in thought of course), I, with a happy/excited emotion, said to the cow 'How's the weather in your parts?'  The cow then telepathically showed me a big green meadow in full sun, very beautiful weather.  The cow expected a reply as if asking me about my weather.  I replied 'Dark here, but warm,' and I continued to float past.  The next entity that I came across, I call it an entity because I am not for sure on exactly what it was, was a wild boar or similar looking creature.  He then gave me some friendly and good advice.  I canÂ’t remember for the life of me, I was still lying on my back with my eyes closed in my bed.
