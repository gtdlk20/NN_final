By 1130, we decided some weed would be a great way to put a familiar spin on the trip and chill us out.  We went outside, the change of scenery certainly was welcome, and smoked in the warm spring weather.  It had to have been at least 60 out at midnight.  Having now grounded himself, my friend was able to look back on the experience in awe and equally, admiration.  As much as we feel in control while on the drug, the mind is a powerful thing and it can be unpredictably unpredictable.  Laying out and watching the open expanses of the glowing sky brought back a few visuals but our minds were at peace by 12.
