Thankfully its gradually getting better. Slowly but surely, the marijuana legalization movement continues to move forth. I wouldve never thought that the United States would have legal, recreational marijuana before Canada, even if its not on a federal basis yet. But I fully expect Justin Trudeau will be elected as Canadas prime minister in 2015, and then its only a matter of time before the drugs made legal here too. Fortunately for me, through some new friends, I finally had my eyes opened to how ignorant I had been while I was midway through high school.
