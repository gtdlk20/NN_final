I started receiving what I can best describe as genetic memory of the mushroom- its long history with humans, and I gained some insight into the shamanic possibilities it possessed. I was shown a number of paths I could follow, from reliving someone else's mushroom trip to experiencing death to performing acts of magic. It reminded me of the final scenes in Hesse's Steppenwolf.
