At T + 2 hours, approximately, I got up, drank a few mouthfuls of water, used the restroom and got my notepad out.  The first thing on my notepad I wrote was, 'a high frequency energy flows through my mind.'  I have always loved prophecy, and will find and read whatever knowledge I can about future events.  I will listen to anything anyone has to say regarding the important future; especially future that involves any major crisis.  This 'Lord' as I call It, was speaking to me.  I could feel it like nothing IÂ’ve ever felt before.  I was conversing with some type of advanced alien civilization.  Conversing in a language that has the power to transcend time and space.
