I decided it would be better for me to keep walking or else I would just get stuck sitting there all night. Only the first 30 seconds of getting up did I have any negative feelings. When I stood up and took a few steps, my equilibrium was way off. I felt as if I would fall over backwards. For a few moments I second guessed my decision to eat the mushrooms and became worried that I would become 'that girl', the girl who gets fucked up, runs through the street naked or something and winds up in the hospital or worse. Fuck it, whatÂ’s done is done, this is what I wanted so I should be grateful. That seemed to work and the bad feeling were quickly replaced by what I have called 'Holy & Blissful'.
