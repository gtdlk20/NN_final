At last we reached the Eagles Nest, a gentle divet of erosion scooped like a 10 foot niche from the rounded mountain side, with a flat base, easy to stand upon and room for two or more to rest, relax, and take in the view.  Logos invited me to sit, but I did not feel as if I should, feeling it would be difficult for me to get back up again from the bare rock floor (I am too heavy).  I enjoyed the last vestiges of trails in my vision, but more interestingly, the fact that I could see better without glasses than with them.  At this point the stopped train somewhere below sounded its horn very loudly as it began to move, to a great cheering of the tourists, and Logos discoursed on the pomp of Man and his need to announce his presence to the Universe.  I felt comfortable with them below, and understood their need for an existential shout or two as part of the pattern that rules below -- We however, weÂ’re not there and were safely higher.  I did not wish or feel that it was time for the trip to end, but felt that we would do better to return to the Sitio.  When Logos agreed, we returned.
