She made me a peanut butter sandwich and carefully laid out the first dose of shrooms. She warned me how bad it will taste and that I would need alot of liquids to wash it down and get the taste away. I ate the sandwich, which didn't taste that bad, but it was unpleasant biting into the dried shrooms which felt rock hard. I finished the sandwich at 8:30, and we went out back so the girls could have a smoke. We all smoked some pot, and stayed out and talked. It was about 9:15 when one of the girls told me since I didn't notice any difference, I should take the rest, so I had another sandwich.
