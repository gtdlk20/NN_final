1:20 Minutes: I walked over to my bed and I felt I had spider legs. Like they were really long and pointy. So went back to my computer and listened to some techno music and closed my eyes. It was INSANE! As my eyes were closed I felt and saw things as if I was traveling through space. I counted about 12 different worlds that I went to. Then this lady took me to space and I was really believing that it was happening to me. Then I opened my eyes and I was like WHAT! I'm still here. So  I went and layed down by my heater and I heard lots of voices talking to me. I would have conversations that lasted years with them, only to look at the clock and only seconds have past. Time seemed to take forever, and before I took them I never thought it could seem so long. I thought people exaggerated but its true. Time seems FOREVER!
