I was overcome with feeling positively freezing. I had a numb little finger on my left hand and was shivering down to me feet, which brought a brief worry about pneumonia. I would also be concerned about having a heart attack later due to a rapid pulse and chest pain. I wrapped myself up in the sleeping blanket. Bestowing sentience on him I said, 'Come here you' to Socrates, a stuffed grey squirrel monkey soft toy and the best tripping companion ever, as I pulled him over to join me in my snuggled up state. That it had snowed and settled earlier in the week had a great deal of influence on what transpired next.
