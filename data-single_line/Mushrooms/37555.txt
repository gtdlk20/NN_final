The night I got home, Nader (my friend) gave me a call and we smoked a few bowls of weed in his car, and probably picked up some free food at Wendy's (where he works). We returned to my house and chilled in the basement until my parental units were in bed, and also waited a little for our food to digest. At around midnight, we ate a chocolate each. The one I ate came from an earlier batch then the one I gave to Nader, and had chunks of something (presumably shrooms) scattered throughout it. Nader, however said his tasted just like chocolate. Either way we both tripped, but I am convinced my experience was more intense than his...
