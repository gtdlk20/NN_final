The music seemed to surround me, carrying me on its rhythms. A song by Deep Forest came on called Hunting. The words are some kind of chant but the music was being played really slowly in my mind and I started to understand the words. They said, Hold me briefly and let me go. I sensed it was about souls who had ventured too far or had somehow been trapped by some being or force. Once they were caught up they could not get loose and they were crying to be set free. I sensed some evil spirits then. I knew they could not harm me if I did not want them to or let them so I was not too scared. There seemed to be faces coming out of my walls but could not break free. I felt sad for them and a little scared at the same time knowing there was evil out there. I dont know if I was supposed to help them or if I had been shown this for a reason.
