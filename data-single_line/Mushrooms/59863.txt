About this time my brother kicked my tripping ass out of his room since he had to work so I lay in the hallway for what seemed like two hours tripping on the walls and the ceiling and laughing to myself because they were all wavy and pulsating and appeared to come closer to me.  I was able to somehow soom into the ceiling and see the smallest particles.
