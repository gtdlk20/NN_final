Suddenly, something happened and I snapped out of it with a shock and had to open my eyes.  Everything was seen through a swirling haze of energy, colour and shape fuzziness.  This is no surprise but looking at my arms and the cat, who was sitting on my lap (probably the element that made me snap out of the fractal dream) an ancient memory surfaced.  This was the thought that triggered my freak-out that was about to happen.
