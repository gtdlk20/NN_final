I chewed down the mushrooms with some regular water (taste pretty nasty as usual) and sat down begind my desk waiting for them to hit. As I was sitting at my desk I started to think about what I was going to do during the trip, why I even found it nessesary to eat them in the first place. I told my mind to stop being a bitch and just enjoy the mushrooms I had purchased for it, and I went from my desk to lie down on my bed. That's when I started to notice a little stomach discomfort. I guess I didn't chew well enough (what to expect with the horrible taste) and that my stomach wasn't very pleased about this. I found it no reason to panic, and told myself this was normal, it had never really before bothered me like this, but I told myself it was nothing I couldn't handle as an experienced shroomer. I remember telling myself 'Our apologies for the slight discomfort, Trip Inc. wishes you a pleasant flight!'.
