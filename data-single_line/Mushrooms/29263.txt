At some point (maybe around 2 hours in to the trip) I went to the bathroom, and looked myself in the mirror. My face started to change shape as I watched, and I realized I could probably go on some wild trip just by following the flow, but I decided I wanted to go back to A, and see where the whole thing was headed.
