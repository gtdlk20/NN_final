As fast as that 'episode' came, it was gone, in a flash I was no longer on normady beach, but on a beach in some jungle... My friends were now cannibals! They were going to kill me! I got up as fast as I could, ran into the trees... Upon arriving in this forest, it was a bloody mess. A bear had just been here, and completely oblitirated a hiker. The bear was coming back for me, I thought. Back to the beach I went.
