I love the mindfuck of psychedelics, and try and relax and think about my problems and my mind just doesn't seem to care, I'm too happy to want to worry about anything, I want to just enjoy the time I am having. I have a couple ecstasy tablets left, tested, MDMA, no meth, and my friend wanted one so I thought what the hell, I'm already completely messed, why not see how much farther we can take this. Surprisingly I didn't get much from the ecstasy, other then a nice chill comedown from the shrooms. Surprisingly I didn't get much from the ecstasy, other then a nice chill comedown from the shrooms. We later rolled a joint, and that quickly brought back the tracers and things were floating once again. I remember at one point looking at the bed and watching it wave around (like a water bed) and lifting almost as if a magician was doing some sort of illusion.
