My mind took me on a trip traveling through time, feeling as though my consciousness is that of someone else and seeing myself.  I felt guilty, enlightened, scared, trapped, loved, and at peace. I felt guilty, enlightened, scared, trapped, loved, and at peace.  At times I felt dissociated from myself and this world; I had the feeling of being on the edge of things greater than this world.  Feeling as though I was the total mercy of God and that I was playing with power I should not.  I couldn't remain in one state of mind because my thoughts and my senses of touch and sight were moving too fast.  I'm playing one scenario out in my head which is terrifying me, while I'm playing another scenario that gives me the greatest happiness, while every nerve in my body creates visions that also want to be at the center of my consciousness.
