My peak lasted for about an hour and a half before I started to come down, rather reluctantly considering the great time I was having. During this period I relaxed under a tree and meditated with goats and rabbits milling about around me. The inner serenity and peaceful, ecstatic oneness I seek during meditation was readily available almost as soon as I shut my eyes. I was unbothered by CEV's, and able to calmly reflect on the teachings of my past experience. This was truly a loving, friendly substance, and I believe the aforementioned meditational rite to be a contributor to the psychoactive love.
