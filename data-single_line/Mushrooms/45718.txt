At this point I part from my phone conversation and the trip just gets more  intense which I couldn't even conceive possible. For literally the whole  trip I am laying on my bed unable to move. I start hearing voices, and the  tv's sounds/voices become the narrirator to my trip, and I truely believed  that the tv was not what I was hearing, but it was me creating the sounds I  was hearing. I thought this simply because everything I heard related to  me in some way, certain things were bold and loud to me which I found  strange.
