Soon after ingestion, I began to wonder if I had actually taken enough (didn't have accurate enough scales to correctly measure). The only way to gauge it was to wait and see how strong the effects turned out to be. The first thing I did was to rapidly compose a Chillout playlist and lie back (for England!). Effects came on very gently and soon I found that I could switch between reality and mushroom-reality by thinking/focusing.
