Then it hit me.  My body temperature jumped what felt like thirty degrees; I was sweating my ass off.  My hands and arms began to tingle.  Then the visuals hit.  It was a myriad of kaleidoscopes I could not concentrate on...I thought I better lay down to get my bearings.  I laid down on the bed and immediately felt better.  Began watching 'Balls Out: Gary the Tennis Coach.'  After the visuals subsided a bit, I was able to concentrate on the movie.  And it was hilarious.  After that movie ended I watched Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. I was so enamored by the colors and details, I couldn't follow the story.  Ended the night listening to the Ipod.  The music was unbelievable. I tripped with my significant other and couldn't help but realize my paranoia, though. Paranoid thoughts ran rampant for a couple hours. I guess that's why McKenna called 5g + a heroic trip. Don't think this amount could have been done in a social setting....
