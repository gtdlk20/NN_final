Some time after that there was a turning point. Suddenly, somehow, after all the processing of negative things, we got into the same rhythm with A, or thats how I felt. He was holding me and I felt he was healing me somehow, being very supportive of my process. He started to caress my arms and my back, and suddenly everything just started to flow. We were breathing in the same rhythm with each other and the whole of existence, we were one with the Universe. His touch felt like a flowing river which I was a part of, and at the same time it was sparkling like cold fire. Somehow it was full of passion, yet I didnt feel it was sexual. More than anything, I felt love, pure unconditional love, that I felt the Universe consists of, and I had a very motherly feeling towards A, as if he was a child and I wanted to hold him in my arms. I had a clear feeling I needed to heal A somehow, so I did (side not: I was learning to be an energy healer at the time). I didnt know what I was doing, but I didnt need to know, I just let myself go with the flow and be a channel for the healing energy, I knew it would do what was meant to without me interfering if I just let it flow.
