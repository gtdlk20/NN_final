I had planned to eat the last of my portion when I began to peak, and I sat down on my grandmother's quilt to eat them, with Dina and Clock doing the same.  We smoked a j, and I was babbling about something when Clock said '91, what's the difference between the first and second jump?'  You see, I have a theory about the relative altruism of people who jump off cliffs into water that I had told Clock about after my first jump.
