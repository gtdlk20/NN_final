Then all of a sudden, I started crying, really hard. Id been laughing and then it just changed. I was amazed. I was there wondering what the fuck was happening, how did it change so fast? Id seen Rachel cry on mushrooms and I just hadnt understood how it was possible to go through such an extreme change so fast. I remember saying at the time but Im not even upset. And I wasnt. I felt everything so intensely. Then Id get flashes of sadness, really intense sadness. But so fast I wasnt even sure if it had happened. Fells walked past me and I made him sit with me, because at that point, it was the most important thing in the world that I was near him.
