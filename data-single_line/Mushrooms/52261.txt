After smoking for a while, I suddenly found myself to be totally fucked.  Across my vision, three fluorescent lines had appeared.  These we superimposed over what was really there.  And they moved with my head.  Although they would lay themselves over things, they were translucent so I could still see what was really there.  At this point I also noticed the door looked very strange.  Where the lines of the woodgrain had been before, there were now fluorescent colours.  They followed where the wood grain had been, and the colour depended on how dark the wood grain was.  I could see the door as a collection of fluorescent yellows, oranges, greens, reds and blues.  There were points on the door where the fluorescent colours were dripping off it.  The colours were flowing, almost like a liquid oozing down the door, but really slowly.
