I reached a Nexus.  The minute I felt it, I realized I had only felt this nexus once before, the first time I shroomed one afternoon on the Gulf of  Mexico with the sun blazing and the surf breaking at our feet, I had lived a lifetime with a beautiful, bronze, young, and hot trip buddy.  I was there again, but I was too happy to analyze it; I was home once again.  I think it's something with me about the wetness, the texture of the water, the muffled sounds of a crowd or the underwater world, the warmth of the sun, and maybe the touch of human flesh that brings feelings of absolute comfort and content because of the tactile similarities to the womb.  And every time I came up for air, it felt like I was being reborn.
