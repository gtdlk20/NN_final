Finally, there was only an off-white powder in the dish.  When scraped out, it was about a pea-sized pile of the flaky stuff.  It was a monday night, which is good because tues I only have night classes.  Being kinda new to psychedelics, I don't possess any paraphanelia like pipes or bongs.  Don't plan to, either.  I was alone at the time, just got back from classes.  My curiousity was such however that I just couldn't resist.  I put all the powder in one of those aluminum foil pipes I hastily made for the occasion.  I held a lighter underneath and started sucking.  The smoke was incredibly thick, not so much hot, and lasted only like 2 seconds, then all I got was air.  I immediatly lay back on my bed.  The smoke was easy to hold.  Almost immediatly I felt the effects.  It was as if an immense wave of relaxation hit me.  At that point I closed my eyes, sinking into the incredible depth of my bed.  It felt like a womb, warm and caring.  I exhaled.  My body was starting to glow with some sort of energy.
