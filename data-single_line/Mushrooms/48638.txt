Very jittery , I can tell this is going to be a crazy night. The effects keep building stronger and stronger. I'm sitting next to my computer watching live in Pompeii with all the lights on. the visuals are alot more overpowering at the moment than the body buzz. i turn on 'Jerry Garcia - bird song' to put me in a good mood.
