The comedown was quite okay. I felt starving. I had a beer, a meal and a cigarette. Bak to normal life. I'm not going to move tomorrow to any ashram. This implies too much, I don't have the energy to consider  this seriously. But for sure I'm going to increase my practise of yoga and take care more and more about the words I use and try to love people as much as possible. This is the only way for me to have a good life.
