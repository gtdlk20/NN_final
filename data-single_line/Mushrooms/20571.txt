The moon began to glow extremely bright, and intense white light that blurred the details. It was unbearable to look at but I was paralyzed. For the first time I tried to change the trip consciously and for the first time I could do nothing. The moon became a face. A human face. It was plain, generic. Slightly dark skinned. Like a pocket of data, direct to my brain, I was aware this was the image of our species. I became aware of more people, hundreds crowded together all with similar faces. Two crowds seperated by a pathway of light down the middle into an opening of hot white light where the moon was moments ago. Now there were thousands of people, hundreds of thousands, looking up at me expectantly. Pushed and squashed together so tightly that I could only see from their shoulders up. I had an epiphany that I was looking at my ancestors. Every human that walked this earth in spirit form. I knew I was the product of their lives. That they lived instinctively to survive and replicate to ensure the success of our species as we all do now. Now was my time on the pedestal, in the light of life and one day I would join them. It was then I realised that I was in the spirit world, a visitor to the afterlife. I was terrified, amazed, paralyzed and it was really happening.
