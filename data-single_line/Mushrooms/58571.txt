I had had a really stressful day, but had also aquired an 8th of shrooms, all caps, maybe one or two little stems out of the whole bag. I don't mind the taste at all, but I was hungry so I threw them on a sandwich and started munching away. Directly as I take the last bite, my mother walks in the room, and decides she feels like talking to me, and this just builds up my stress, so I keep pushing away until she finally decides to leave (about 20 minutes later).
