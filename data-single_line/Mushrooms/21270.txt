- I felt born again - I was literally acting, feeling, experiencing what its like to be a baby, I even looked like one. Thousands and thousands of moments flooding at me, like they do all the time, but this time it was without filters and as if for the first time. And my body/mind was instantly reacting to every single moment, in one hundred different ways, as if it didnt know how to actually process any of them, as if it hadnt learned how to yet. Ex., a small wave from the lake just barely touched my leg and it sent an overwhelming shock of happy to fearful feelings, plus the sense of touch being explosive as if Ive never felt water before.
