Jeff eventually convinced her to let me pass, and we walked back to the tent contemplating the insignificance of the womanÂ’s protest.  When we got back to the circle of tents, Jeff asked me to go into his tent with him, and I accepted.  Bear in mind, it was about noon and 90 degrees in the shade at this point, and going into the sauna-esque tent was most appealing at that point.  We retired to the air matress inside and began a long and meaningful talk about our current experience.  We wound up intertwined and I naked, slipping in and out of consciousness.  I can only guess it was the heat that caused it, but unlike the hyper-alertness I usually experience during a mushroom journey, I was totally lethargic.
