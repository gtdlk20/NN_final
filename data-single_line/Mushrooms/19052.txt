The house is tapped on spring water, and by wandering up a path into the forest behind the house, you can come close to the mouth of the spring, drinking water from a split piece of bamboo placed into the path of flow as a drinking fountain. There is also a smaller round temple up there that is used for Ayahuasca ceremonies during the summer, although it is pretty chilly at this time of year with no heat.
