I figured we were just stopping by, but he told us to come inside as it would take a while. And I enter this sketchy, freezing cold crack house. The place is trashed and it is filled with addicts. I tried to find solitude and some peace in the bedroom but on this poor excuse of a mattress all I can see when I close my eyes is moving patterns like a built in kaleidoscope.
