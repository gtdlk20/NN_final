I pretty much blacked out for a few minutes at that point. I was running around and screaming and even tried to go outside naked in the cold, knowing somehow that I could be taken to jail but not caring because you canÂ’t really put god in jail, god is always where god needs to be. The others were trying to restrain me and get me to calm down, telling me I was not god and none of this would be real in the morning. To me, they seemed like they had all become wiser and were trying to ease my transition into godhood by calming me down. I thought they had known I was god the whole time and had only been maintaining the dream with me.
