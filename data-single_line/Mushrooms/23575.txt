While I believed wholly that I was outside of the normal spiritual plane humanity exists on, I was still able to objectively observe and consider my situation while tripping.  I made observations of the alterations in my perception and mental processes, and thought through my plan for the rest of the night.  When I reached a clearing which held a bridge over the edge of a marsh, I took a break from my journey.  I was supposed to get a ride with a friend that night, which was obviously not a high priority anymore; I decided it was far more important to complete the experience I was having, so I called her on my cell, and told her to head back to the city without me, and that I would find a different ride the next day.  It was bizarre -- using my phone was like a pocket back into the normal world.  While I was talking, in the clearing, consciously taking a break, I could feel the edges of the spiritual realm a short distance away all around me.  As soon as I hung up, turned my phone off, and made the decision to return, I was immersed in the spiritual realm again.
