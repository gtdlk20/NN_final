It's worth mentioning, before I begin, that I am a very spiritual person.  I don't adhere to any one religion or set of teachings, but I hold a reverence for all life and nature, and maintain basically animistic beliefs: that all things, animate or not, have spirits and are essentially spiritual.  I'm sure my spiritual beliefs influenced this experience to a great degree.
