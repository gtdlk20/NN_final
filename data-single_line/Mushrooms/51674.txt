Nobody was quite feeling it yet except for me.  A bad part was probably that I was doing it with my lovely ex only three weeks or so after we had broken up and maybe two after she had screwed another guy and only after she had come back to me.  Emotional problems were very hard that night.  I noticed that I couldn't explain very much very easily as we were walking.  My ex was laughing hysterically and I realized that I wanted her to shut up so I turned around and screamed at her, not feeling what I was actually saying.  I wanted to hug her and tell her that I was sorry, but I was completely afraid of anyone touching me.  Especially my best friend.  He had the appearance of a circus clown in a certain light and I wanted him more than anyone not to touch me.  Well, he was the only one that would come near touching me.  I was pacing in circles and raving in my head, thoughts going so fast that I don't remember what they were.  I remember my ex dancing in the street like a little hippie and her friend being completely stagnant, so I stopped paying attention to them.  I stepped off of the road for a car and in the snow (the melted holes to the ground) was a face of a skull staring at me, gaping with its jaws in a sinister laugh.  I remember then that everyone was in the snow piling it into their faces and my friend Ian was raving about how we needed to be with our friends and go to the woods.  I was afraid of the skulls and bones in the snow so I stayed on the road, which enraged him.  I started to see a low humm on the horizon of mixed colors, blue, green, red, yellow, it was beautiful.
