While my intent going into it was mostly to have fun evening at home by myself, I was also hoping this trip would be healing in some way. Id been feeling pretty low and worn-out by my lifestyle. My nocturnal job with inhumane hours had been grinding on me for a couple of years. Id been abusing alcohol hard and steadily for a decade. Id been on SSRIs for most of that decade and felt like they were just mitigating the fallout of my near-constant hangover, keeping me in a constant, low, dull depression. Id gained a lot of weight and was feeling pretty sickly. I was lonely and feeling alienated.  In my exhaustion and despair, I decided to go sober for February and see if I couldnt put a little order to my messy life, or at least lose a couple of beer pounds.
