As I withered away into eternity my thoughts wandered in search of other existence. But there was only I. And with this thunderous realization I created existence in a manner reminiscent of the bibles 'let there be light!'. My consciousness was split between all life which existed as I lived each life I had created. With each birth I would forget I was god and with each death I would remember but only for the infinitesimal time between the two. In that moment of time I could choose to destroy the universe I had created and return to my whole self. Yet no matter the hardships and brutal deaths I experienced I was always reaffirmed in that brief moment of time between life and death that nothing but I was real.
