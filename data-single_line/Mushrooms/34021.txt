At one point, one of the red hot coals fell out of the top of the hookah and Ace grabbed it with his bare hand to put it back in. We all gasped and told him to drop it because I don't think he felt the hotness on his fingers. He had a mild burn on his fingers but wasn't really too worried about it. He went to the bathroom (this time by himself) to run some cold water over the burn, and opened the women's bathroom door. There was a girl in there and he yelled at her to get out of his bathroom. As she walked out, he grabbed her on the butt and she began freaking out yelling and calling the owner of the place over. (Side note: we saw the girl at a club months later and apologized and explained the situation and we are now good friends with her.) I was very confused at this point and didn't really know what had just happened. My sister and her friend talked to the owner (whom they knew I guess) and smoothed things over so we wouldn't get kicked out. Ace came back to our table and I asked him what he just did. He told me that I was talking to him in his head in the bathroom (telepathy?) and told him to kick that girl out and grab her butt. This seemed plausible to me at the time and we sat calmly sharing the hookah and chatting about all the people around us for the next 20 minutes (T+4:00).
