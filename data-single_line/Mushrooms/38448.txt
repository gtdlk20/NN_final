My girlfriend and I talked for awhile. As we did this I continued staring up at the ceiling, my trusty gauge as to what was happening. Instead of merely shifting or distorting slightly, the ceiling was broken up somewhat into smaller-scale distortions (about 10 to 12 inches wide). I then noticed that many of the bumps on the ceiling were tinged somewhat chromatic (in red and blue), as if viewed through a diffraction grating. I looked at the skin on my arms, and could see it distorting slightly, almost flowing slowly like lava.  I looked in the kitchen at the water faucet.  It looked slightly creepy there by itself, and I was nervous that I'd see it bend or move around.  I satisfied myself that it wasn't moving or doing anything weird.
