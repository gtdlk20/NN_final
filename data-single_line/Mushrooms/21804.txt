Entheogenic plants sprouted on my radar screen and I learned about (but didn't yet try) Ayahuasca, cacti, and shrooms courtesy of the internet. Something seemed to be guiding me to these natural, spiritual tools. A friend told me about a successful clinical study with hallucinogenic mushrooms making cancer patients feel more positive. She gave me about one gram of dried shroom. They were the white kind with black spores, one of the more potent of the psilocybe types.
