I told my friends, who were feeling quite sick, to come outside and see the power of the valley. They were not feeling well and apparently having pretty bad trips. Two of my friends threw up, but nothing could wipe the smile off my face as I sat in the middle of this great valley of power. Thoughts raced through my head as the nature of the place taught me about its history and begged me to do my part to keep it from being ruined by civilization. As i sat and pondered these thing my friends began to feel better and we decided to take a walk down the river. When we are on shrooms we tire easily so after walking a little ways down the river we sat down again and began to talk about the what we had been seeing. As we were talking all of our attention turned to a lone duck flying above us. All of a sudden the duck swooped down and flew right at us and landed gracefully in the water next to us. As you can imagine, this was an awe-inspiring sight to us.
