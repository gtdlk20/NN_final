I was very scared to take them because of my history of bad trips but I knew the dose was low enough and I had benzos on hand if things got too out of control. I did not have any expectations for my trip as I didnt expect to get very far with 1g. We took them in my bedroom where I have my home studio set up and just laid on the floor for the whole time. The person I was tripping with who I will call O wanted to change scenery a couple times but we only moved once to a different room with a big window so he could see outside and then quickly moved back. Overall I would definitely say that this was a positive experience.
