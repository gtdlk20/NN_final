I relaxed and let my mind drift, and the first hour passed surprisingly rapidly. Other than the RGB-blips there were practically no visuals, just the faintest hint of 'wave interference'-type patterns in the background with eyes closed. The only detail I still remember was the sound of a jumbo jet passing overhead; the immense, building noise filled my head completely for a few seconds. The Orb was then changed to _Meditative Music_, a CD of reworked Chinese meditation tunes, which was absolutely brilliant. The music transported me to another world. While I could not really _see_ where I was, I could _feel_ the music, the emotion behind every note of saxophone or flute, and even though I speak no Chinese I could understand the singer's chant as an expression and celebration of the joy and ecstasy of existence. Words fail me here, I cannot describe my state of mind other than to say that it was incredible.
