I didn't feel anything for about 45 minutes (me and N were begining to think perhaps they weren't the right kind of mushrooms, but at that 45 minute mark they came on strong, I took a walk in my back yard and I was starring at the the large tree in my neighbor's yard for what seemed like hours and it actually bent over and shook my hand, this freaked me out and I ran back in the house, I figured I was outside for hours so I thought the trip was almost over and I was really disapointed, but when N informed me it had only been 15 minutes I was excited cuz I knew it had just begun. I, for some reason thawt is beyond me found Opera Whinfrey (spelling?) very amusing but while watching half of her face melted off and sorta like in terminator 2 there was metal underneath (she was a robot)
