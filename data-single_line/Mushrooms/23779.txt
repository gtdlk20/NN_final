We continued walking and sat at the top of the hill silent for what seemed like hours.  It never got boring.  We all sat there and thought.  I felt as if our thoughts were all in unison.  I was thinking what they were thinking.  I was feeling what they were feeling.  Eventually we walked back to the car.  We were all coming down from the trip on the ride back to ZÂ’s house.  The trip lasted for about 5 hours, which was one of the shortest trips I have had.  It started, proceeded, and ended very gracefully.  I was ready for it to be over and I had not experienced anything too overwhelming.  This was a glowing experience.
