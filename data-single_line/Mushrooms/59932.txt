	When we got back to the campfire, I noticed there were many people there, all of different races and backgrounds, who all got along on the common basis of love for music, campfires, sunsets, entheogens, and lightning.  The music started to take on a life of itÂ’s own and wrap me around it and show me the forgotten corners of my mind.  I have never felt such a pure connection to everything that is, and time and space and myself disappeared and all that was left was what I can only assume to be what we call God.  This was the peak of my experience and I have drawn inspiration from it to this very day.  Remembering that moment is what gets me through a lot of though days.
