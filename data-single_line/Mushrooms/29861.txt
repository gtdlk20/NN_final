Beyond the mushroom I thought perhaps Earth was minded and I had tapped into its consciousness and maybe the sun was conscious and somehow I was picking up all of these galactic conscious energies and I was tapped-in and having a very real and very profound experience of light and energy displayed in this non atomic world of beauty beyond my imagination.  I saw endless impossible machines made from jewels and light and everything was flowing. It was more than psychedelic. I enjoy psychedelics and listen to music while trippingÂ… this was different, this seams to be a place where something is going on; like a non-atomic universe or dimension made from information, beyond math or language.
