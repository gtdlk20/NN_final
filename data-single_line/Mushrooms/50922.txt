Phil was someone I had gone to school with for years, and who seemed most eager out of all of us to experience the trip. When I had first met him he had been the embodiment of hyperactivity, but had settled down over the years until he could pretend that he was entirely normal around most people. Still, the two times that he had tried drugs with me after convincing me he had matured enough to handle them, I had been somewhat disappointed. It had been a long time since then, and I hoped he had changed, but I was slightly more worried about Phil than anyone else.
