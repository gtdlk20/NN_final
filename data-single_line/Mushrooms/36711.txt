Gradually the trip faded after that, the storm began to settle down and the voices quited as I returned to the world; I had seen myself in the mirror, seen a hollow and souless expression in my eyes, I know my being was on some distant astral plane where I could hear the voices calling me, it was like inhabiting a differnt body of myself for a few hours.  we lay in my room listening to the genius of Pink Floyd and burning Nag Champa while we just vegged in bed and gradually faded into sleep; it was an exhausting but very empowering night, intense and harsh but always with a feeling that I was enjoying it and ultimately very happy, I became much more contented with myself and came to be very hopeful about my future.  Of course we all connected and felt like we were all together and on the same mindset and all, but I got hit hardest the next morning.
