N had to leave and I was all alone, thats when the really deep philsophical thinking started, I felt like I had the universe figured out in my head but when I tried to put it into words nothing made sense, needless to say this frustrated me and got me very upset, I went to get somthing to eat, but on the way to the kitchen, somthing caught my eye, the fake tree in my living room was on fire!! I started to freak out but then I realised that the flame wasn't consuming the plant and when I touched it, it didn't burn my hand, thats when the tree started to talk to me, about my life, about the universe, about all the questions in my head that were frustrating me and then everything became so clear, not that I figured out the universe like my original goal was, but that it was clear in my head that I wasn't meant to understand the universe, and that certain things are meant to be a mystery and since the whole situation reminded me of Moses and the burning bush incident in the bible, I figured the voice was God himself and I realised that there is too much that can't be explained and too much beauty and too many questions with no answers in the world for there not to be a God or heaven, and that heaven must be so wonderful because there is where you'll get all the answers to your questions, that experience brought me to beleive in God again and ever since that trip I've beleived in God and 'most' of my religion and my life has been better because of it.
