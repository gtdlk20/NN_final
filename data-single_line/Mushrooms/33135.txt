After a period we traded off exploring, eating wild rasberries and becoming wet trying to drink from the waterfall. Each waking moment was ecstasy in its wonder and beauty. We were in a new world where we could see ourselves as important strands of the fabricated web of the universe. Time was all powerful and allknowing but not all loving. It destroyed and created in a perpetual motion of change. We were caught in a series of explanations, understandings and revelations. I learned of my body in relationship to my space. I was able to be observant of my surroundings and to appreciate what tools and abilities I had acquired. As time passed the sun came in patches as light summer rain clouds came in. Then came thunder that rumbled for miles rolling along the mountains like a dream of great giants playing at bowlers with great stones. It was a treat for the ears.
