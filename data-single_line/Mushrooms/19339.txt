By now, I felt I was really coming back into a grounded state of consciousness. The bizarre delusions I had experienced during the peak experience had lost their sense of meaning and inevitability. I found myself now feeling kind of scared and anxious. I was scared at the possibility I could actually have drowned myself in the bathtub. I was scared that I had gone so far out that drowning myself in the bathtub seemed like a great idea.
