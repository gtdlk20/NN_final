I wanted to call up my step mom and tell her that I respect her as a person. I wanted to call my father and tell him to I love him. Mostly I just wanted to be nicer to everyone. Even if I didn't like them. I had always been mean to people just because I thought they weren't as smart as me, but I now realized that everyone is both very stupid and very wise at the same time. They are wise because only they can understand the things they've been through, and they are stupid because they will never understand what others have been through. Somehow knowing this, and knowing some other piece of wisdom I picked up during my trip, but now forget; I realize what the yin-yang symbol means. It's not about balance. It means everything is the same, and equal. I can't remember anymore, but I knew this during some of my trip.
