I had been assigned the task of house-sitting for a family friend. She was decently well-off and had a well-sized house in the middle of a not-so-nice area, which was mostly surrounded by cheap row-homes. That nonwithstanding, the house was gorgeous, certainly better than mine. It was well furnished with comfortable furniture and plants everywhere. Anyway, upon learning I was meant to be taking care of the house for a few days, I went to see it and somewhere in that process I said to myself 'this would be a lovely place to do those leftover mushrooms I have'. My significant other and I had an eighth between us we decided to split.
