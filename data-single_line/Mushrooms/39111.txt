Somwhere near the end of the Summer of '93, my head had been turned inside-out by a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, LSD, and the mighty, mightily awesome music scene that was pulsing with the diversity so sorely lacking these days. Consider Lollapalooza 1993: Alice In Chains, Primus, Arrested Development, Fishbone, Rage Against The Machine, Tool, and many others. A person would find it nigh impossible to duplicate that scene in this Millennial climate. Strange, but true. Also, it should be stated for the record that, aside from a cliff-side, Guamanian Episcopal school, my exposure to religion, Christian or otherwise, was negligible. The only 'spirit' I was concerned with was that which needed a mixer and a straw.
