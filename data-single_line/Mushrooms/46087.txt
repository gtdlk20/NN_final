Immediately after downing the juice, we all headed down into my basement for another smoke session. Slowly, we were becoming more giddy and joking around a lot more. After a few bowls and a blunt, we headed into my living room, which seemed to be the best spot in the house to chill out. However, on the walk up from the basement, we already were feeling a little spacey. We all felt a strange drunk-walk out of nowhere. There are a bunch of very soft leather couches in my living room that my friends say you can just melt into because they're so soft. A few of them wanted to play some COD4 on the Xbox, so they tried to connect controllers/start up a match. This failed miserably as we were already becoming very forgetful, and slowly nobody could play any video games because we were coming up so fast (as expected with the lemon-tek). I remember one of my friends turned around to me, and asked Are they supposed to be kicking in already? I feel it, and I just smiled and said I was totally feeling it too. I noticed that my perception at this point completely changed. I could no longer feel the high from the pot, and reached a whole different level of high that I think I haven't felt before on any of my trips and I've done mushrooms about five times, acid twice, salvia once. It was a very lucid feeling, almost clear-headed, which I didn't expect.
