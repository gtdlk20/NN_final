At +3 the few hallucinations I had had were almost all gone and we decided to go outside. Getting up and getting dressed was difficult since coordination was less than optimal, but we managed it and stumbled outside into a world covered in pristine, white snow. I tasted some, it was fluffy and delicious. After walking around outside the cabin a bit, admiring the tactile squishyness of mud underneath the snow, we decided to go take a look at the lake. We made a detour to the bathrooms, where the hot-air dryer and a stream of water falling from the roof proved to be fascinating, and then continued on our way. A bank of snow maybe half a foot deep on the side of the road proved to be a formidable obstacle, but I gathered my courage and stomped across it and Ea and Ei followed, K having returned to the cabin to listen to more music. Ei then collapsed into the snow, lying on her back and staring at the sky, and Ea & I went to investigate a strange sight. In the middle of the field there was a circle of stone, with a metal grid in the middle. I'm still not quite sure what it was, suggestions ranged from an alien artifact to an outdoor grill for munchkins to a well designed for sunbathing. (Concept.)
