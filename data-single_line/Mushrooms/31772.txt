But I didnt even realize that I was starting to slip away. I began to black out. The cyclical thoughts were getting to be overpowering and it was as if my mind was just breaking. Looking back on it now, its as if most of the trip from that point on just didnt exist in time. Its not like I have long drawn out dark periods in my memory where I just wasnt sure what was happening. The time itself just doesnt exist in my memory at all. Its like I closed my eyes when the trip started to go bad, and when I opened them it was over, three hours later.
