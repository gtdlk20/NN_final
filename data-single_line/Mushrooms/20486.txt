Later I am laying in the tent, eyes closed, riding the energy washes. Just watching the land from the open door is deeply satisfying. I loose the thread of awareness-continuity here and find myself getting up to walk to find... something... something else. I keep looking to see the non-ordinary. Intending the miraculous.
