The entire drive home I was really coming down, didn't feel emotional low really just like tired. Like I felt mentally drained and it was hard to make conversation at times, not because I was disoriented but because I felt really stoned. My friends driving was surprisingly good and nothing really sketchy happened on the ride home. I honestly think at that point he was higher than me but I was just feeling so like stoned and out of it that I'd have trouble concentrating behind the wheel. It was definitely a good call though because he got us all home safe.
