4.	Now, I am having realizations about consciousness and God, I am starting to lose the feeling in my body, as I lay on the bed, time has completely stopped and my room is now an ancient domain of infinite knowledge, it seemed like it was the end of the world and no worldly ideas were in my head only knowledge that would change the understanding of the world was there.
