The night sky looked amazing, almost like a Van Gogh painting. The trees and mountains seemed to be breathing. The mushroom godhead was still in the air but this time he/she seemed to be approving. This gigantic feeling of relief washed over me. As I was about to scream out, Im still here! I suddenly find myself back in the bedroom in a fetal position holding my stomach looking towards the digital clock in the corner. 11:44pm?! Wasnt it 11:45pm when I looked up? It didnt make any sense. With breaks and gaps in events, I went from looking at the bathroom mirror to running to the front door to looking outside at the night sky. It was like I was stuck in this bad hellish groundhog day. I seemed to relive the same sequence for what felt like an eternity. I was stuck in this horrid time loop. Then I found myself looking at myself living the time loop from a third person perspective. What a waste of life, was the only thought going through my mind. I had given up all hope of getting back to reality and coming down from the bad mushroom trip. I began to dissolve into hyperspace again, and images of myself laying on my bed murmuring something about how much I love my wife and son started to repeat.
