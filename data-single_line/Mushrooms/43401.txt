About 15 minutes into the journey I began to feel light already.  I knew this was going to be a good trip right away.  About 15 minutes after that I got the giggles beyond belief.  My friend was talking on the phone and all I could do was laugh at every word he said.  The feeling was unexplainable.  It felt like the combination of being tickled, while hearing the funniest joke at the same time.  This went on for a good 10 minutes.  I lauged at regular intervals throughout the trip.
