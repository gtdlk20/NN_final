I have been looking to try many diffrent types of mind altering substances for a very long time, since the new year of 2002 actually. I finnaly got my hands on some mushrooms that I was told were very very very powerful. They were prepared in chocolate that was molded into the form of a devil. The 3grams of shrooms had been ground up and added to the chocolate when poured into the mold. I was very anxious to try them as soon as possible since it had taken so long to get a hold of, the only problem was I had mid-terms the following day. I had a long talk with my friend S who assured me I would be well rested although not perticulartly crisp for the following day. Now the next problem, my parents were still home. Well I decided that I was going to take them anyway and just lock myself in my room until my mom went to sleep upstairs. So at around 8 o clock, I called S and grabbed soem O.J. I ran into my bathroom and quickly devoured the entire piece of chocolate. It was now a waiting game.
