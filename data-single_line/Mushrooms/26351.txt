3:00am - Still unable to sleep.  I woke up my girlfriend asking for some pain reliever to help get rid of the cramps in my back that were really mild but were intensified by the drug.  I couldnÂ’t find any so I just lay there and cried wishing for the experience to end.  The effects were really mild but I was just focusing on the smallest things in the room and couldn't sleep.
