After some time of pure oblivion, I realized that I was not dead, and that i was freezing cold, and bone-wearyingly tired, in body and soul.  I picked myself up, and walked resolutely out of the crossroads, clutching at my sanity like a drowning man at a life-preserver.  I knew only that if I kept moving I would eventually find a place to sleep, to cast myself down and sleep until I knew that all this ravening chaos was but maya, illusion.  When I finally returned to my room, it was 6:30 in the morning.  My roomate (who had taken my lighter from me earlier) asked if I was all right, and I said 'Yeah.' My other friend was sleeping on my bed, so I put a piece of cloth beneath my head and lay down on the concrete floor.  I was too numbed by the wreckage of my evening to do anything but thank the god I don't believe in that I was myself, and still alive to fight another day.
