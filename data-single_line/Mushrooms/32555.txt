4:20- while he was in the bathroom I just walked around trying to pass some time, pressing the buttons of the vending machines, and then it started to come on to me. At first it was just a weird feeling, lightheaded, and a good feeling of energy, like an adrenalin rush. Then it started to get a little sketchy, I noticed everyone looking at me as I was strolling around, I had to get out. My friend got out of the bathroom and we headed back to the cabin to meet another friend whom be planned not to tell about the mushrooms.
