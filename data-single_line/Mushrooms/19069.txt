Before drinking the brew, we all drew cards from the mayan oracle deck. Alice, Cory and Goopstar all pulled the number 7, indicating they would be on a similar wavelength to one another that night. Miel pulled the number 10, and I pulled the number 13. I donÂ’t recall much of what the card said, but if it relates at all to western interpretations of the number 13, then I had pulled the highest vibration card, and a number infamous for chaotic and unexpected outcomes.
