I knew then that I create my own reality, through and through. I can be anything I wish to be. Literally anything is possible; I am truly God in the sense of omnipotent creator. Build an empire and rule the earth? Go for it. Travel to the moon? If you wish. Become a jaguar? Its only a thought away. I can travel inner space, outer space, and the four corners of this physical plane simply by traveling there with my imagination. And if this whole human thing is too boring, I can destroy it all and start a whole new universe from scratch, like the gods of ancient myth. Perhaps I realized, in a way, that the mind is as powerful as anything else in the physical universe. There really is no difference anyway, it seemed. I felt incredibly powerful knowing this. However, I then recalled the concept of yin/yang. This was not a new concept to me, but I had never felt it to be so real on such a deep level. Every action you take in this world has an equal and opposite reaction, I remembered; there is no spiritual free lunch. Every good comes with bad, and vice versa. Pleasure begets pain, joy begets suffering, and success begets failure. But perhaps, I thought, if I (the eternal, universal awareness) am experiencing joy, what does it matter that there is pain on the other end? How can it be real if I am not experiencing it? It soon became clear, however, that if I am able to delight in joy at the expense of others, I am still experiencing the pain on the other end, simply removed by time and space. There is no real separation, after all. It will always come back to you. On top of this, I saw how although my potential is infinite, I am restricted to a certain degree by cosmic inertia, or what some might call karma. It is much easier to move from A to B than A to Z in one step, and the harder you try to force your will, the harder the universe will push back. Infinity comes with checks and balances!
