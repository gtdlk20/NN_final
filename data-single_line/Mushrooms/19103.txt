And then we all fell silent. The only noise was when Alice would make little Mmm! Mmm noises, like a small animal being repeatedly startled, or like the sounds a woman makes when being sweetly penetrated by her lover. The humming, twirling motion came back. I was tripping hard. For some reason I was thinking a lot about our van, and recalling when we had last taken it in for an oil change. There was a very pushy mechanic who pretty much told us every fluid in the vehicle needed to be sucked out and changed, and that of course they had all the machines here to do just that, if we were willing to cough up the $1000 or so it would have taken to fix everything he thought was wrong. I was tripping about how he had been a bit of a dick, but all in all he was a human being and just as worthy of my acceptance and foregiveness as anyone else. And I thought that, perhaps, I might take the van in to some other place some day and ask them to suck out and replace the mysterious faded pink fluid that I remembered vividly from back then. I felt it would be worth kicking in a couple hundred bucks to keep the van in good running condition (after all, it has nearly 400,000 km on it, and is still running awesome!). Strangely mundane thoughts for a mushroom trip.
