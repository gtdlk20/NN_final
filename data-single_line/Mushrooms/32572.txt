The feelings of that night were odd, very odd, but a good odd. At points I felt like I wanted the high to go far away, at others I loved it and felt so happy and willing. I suggest it to anybody, but have it planned, we had no trip sitter, it may have been a more pleasant experience with one, but until I tried, I never understood the feelings, words can only explain so much, it was most certainly magical.
