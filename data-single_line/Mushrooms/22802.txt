We ventured around the area for probably almost two hours. I realized that life was all about every single thing expressing itself in it own way, its in own niche, and contributing to the whole system of life. I looked around and said, Those trees are just over there, doing their wavy thing, that fuzzy is doing its fuzzy thing, just being, as it is. I looked at trees and they would sway mysteriously in the gentle breeze.
