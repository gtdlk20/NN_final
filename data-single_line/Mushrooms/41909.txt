Time isnÂ’t very possible to track, but during this period I petted the fluffiest dog in the world and said hey very briefly to the women who was walking with it. The dog seemed like the happiest creature on the planet and the fact that it came up to me to be pet and licked my hand stuck with me for the rest of the trip. Every area I walked to was somehow more gorgeous than the last. I found myself thanking the trees and was incredibly grateful to be alive. I found what seemed to be a big stone totem at the base of an electric pylon, which was actually just used by the energy companies in the area for some reason (had key holes and stuff), and I thought about how these things function as monuments to electricity.
