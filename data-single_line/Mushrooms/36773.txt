I put on Shpongle's 'Once Upon the Sea of Blissful Awareness', and we both closed our eyes, holding hands, as the mushrooms were doing their magic. Things were getting very interesting.

But soon enough, colors came jumping from every direction, creating colorful drawings, constructions and machines of all sort.
