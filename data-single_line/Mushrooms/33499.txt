I decided I wanted to go back to the park, so I sat up, found my sandals, and we left. Every tree had a face, everything seemed so friendly. I smiled at everything. I held his hand and we walked together. We left the park and walked for a very long time, until the road ended. I was sober again. We decided to walk back to the house.
