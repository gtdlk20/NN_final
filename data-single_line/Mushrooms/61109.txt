This is just another one of the mind expanding experiences I've had thanks to drugs. The day before this trip I had taken a 1/4 Roll of a 'CP' pressed ecstasy (which am I assuming made my serotonin levels unbalanced for my trip). I bought 3.5gs of shroom caps from a hippie that sells me great acid and potent shrooms. I've had good and bad mushroom trips in the past with visuals, mind fucks, etc... This trip I had extremely faint visuals that I had to focus my complete attention on.
