We sat in the grass at the park and embraced the little time we had left of the trip. Visuals were less intense by this point in time - around 5:30pm. It started to rain quite heavily, and it lifted my spirits. I sunk into the lush green and allowed the cold water to trickle onto my face. I smiled. The rain was beautiful, as was the presence and comfort of my friend. As the rain got increasingly heavier, I craved nothing more than hot food and a warm bed. We got up and walked to the main street, my legs felt heavy and jelly-like under the weight of my body. I tried to point to the burger store, and once again struggled to fully straighten my finger. We indulged in hot chips and coffee. Every bite of the greasy fried potato warmed me from my head to my toes- it was the best tasting food I had eaten in what felt like forever. I felt comforted and safe.
