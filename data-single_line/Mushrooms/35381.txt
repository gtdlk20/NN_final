Warm thoughts of my friends at home finally get me to my feet and back safe to my place. There they are sitting on a bed doing tarot cards. They all knew I was high and cracked jokes making me smile. As I changed into warm PJ's, made some tea and enjoyed the last of the undulating carpet patterns. I was grateful for being who I am, for having the friends that I do, and for seeing the next steps to take in the path of life. No weirdness, no bad feelings, all good. I can now say that the mushroom is an ally.
