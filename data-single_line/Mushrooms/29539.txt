Soon, naseau hit me.  The visuals began shortly as well.  The carpet began to look like trees sprouting from the ground and the wallpaper began shifting and moving. It was amazing but it all became a bit too much and I went outside.  I sat with one of my friends and we noticed the grass the same way, a strange kind of neon squiggle.  He went away for some reason and I continued to sit outside.
