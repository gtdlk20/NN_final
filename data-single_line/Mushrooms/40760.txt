I live in a house on a gated property owned by my employer. The house is toward the back side of the lot, behind some old cinder-block buildings, away from the steel-gated entrance. My wife, our son and I are the only ones who live on the property. When we first moved into the newly built house, I dug a big hole in the back yard and installed a concrete underground room (Its an excellent chill space). My employer is cool like a friend, but not quite cool enough to know I was doing psilocybin, so my plan was that when we were done working at this property on a Saturday, I would go into the underground room to stay alone in silent darkness, adventuring into the inexplicable. Then when my employer and the workers were definitely gone, I would go outside and play around in the daylight. Meanwhile, my wife and son were staying at my in-laws house because my wife didnt want to associate with drugs, not knowing the effect of mushrooms.
