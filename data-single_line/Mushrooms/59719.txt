Oct. 6  Five jars are just a couple of square inches from complete colonization.  My previous assumption that the cakes colonize at higher temperatures are wrong, they do much, much better in the 81-84 range.  They have been in this range for 3 days now.  Im positive Ill have a few jars in the fruiting chamber by Friday, the 11th.  Once I bought more jars in preparation for expansion, I replaced the two jars with new ones.  Apparently, something bad happened to the spores in the treasure coast syringe.  The two jars that didnt grow were treasure coast and the two new jars I made were also treasure coast, and they showed NO growth.  The two original jars, when I cleaned them, had no growth at all.  This leads me to believe that if the spores had not been fucked up, I would have had 100% success on my first attempt.  Not bad.  Still, no signs of contamination in any of the jars.  This is going to be a very successful experiment in Mycology.
