Well, we tripped more, I didn't feel the presence of my guide again though.  We talked and started coming down after about 3 hours since we took the mushrooms.  I'm glad we took a low dose, b/c it was just enough to have that experience and enjoy the beauty of it all.  I wish I could have been on a mountain or somewhere beautiful in nature rather than in our apartment.  When we decided to trip, I thought I would just have 'fun' like the other times I've done mushrooms, I never expected a spiritual awakening of sorts.
