I arrived at my fraternity house where the party was taking place, and ate the entire 8th. I had read many reports of nausea and general discomfort associated with taking mushrooms, but I never experienced any of these symptoms. They tasted sort of foul, but I just washed them down with a can of grape soda, which eliminated the bad taste pretty effectively.
