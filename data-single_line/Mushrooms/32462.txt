Well thats about it. That was our new years day. On the way back my wife experienced a time distortion. When we arrived back at our things she couldnt believe that we had arrived. She could not connect the walk back up the beach with our arrival. She was convinced that she had lost some memory and said that she has just woken up and we are here and she doesnt know how we got here. I talked her through it and it seems that she did remember all of the pieces of our journey she just couldnt connect them with our arrival.
