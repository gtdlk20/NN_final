At what must have been at least an hour into the trip, I was firmly removed from normal egoic consciousness, and engaged in what I can only describe as the realm of the collective unconsciousness. I also felt increasingly under assault by the aggressive energies entering my awareness. I eventually could not distinguish between external noises and what I thought were possible auditory hallucinations in my head (but which felt like incredibly real and malicious spirits). I began to wonder whether or not I was losing my mind to some degree (and this actually gave me a profound glimpse into what must be the perception of a schizophrenic mind). I tried to get up and move around, but my body felt incredibly weak, so I resigned to lying in the sunny grass, now engaged in a battle for my psyche with the demons that had arisen from my subconscious. Although the warmth of the sun felt nice, I could feel the rays burning my skin, and so I decided to move back to my blanket next to the altar.
