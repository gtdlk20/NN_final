I decided to move to a more comfortable place and prepare for my trip. I layed down on my cozy bed, more anxious than I have ever felt. I found myself starting to stare at inanimate objects and household furniture. I layed on my back only to realize that my ceiling had become a black ocean with white mountains protruding from its underneath. This amazed me, I was in awe. Patterns in the mountains started to come about. My eyes were tearing now, which scared me. I was thinking maybe I took too many and it's having effects on me. Maybe my brain was leaking!! nah... but I know I was scared when this started to happen. I was freezing now, I dont know what had come over me.
