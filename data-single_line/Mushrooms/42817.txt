Nick was in the same classes as myself, which were held at a downtown campus. When they were finished for the day, sometime around three oclock that afternoon, he and I caught the city bus back to the main campus and our dorm rooms, where we met up with Evan, Peter, Zulian, and Mike and then bussed back downtown to the liquor store. At least during the school year, shuttle busses were scheduled to run from the main campus to the downtown region every seven minutes, and all students got free transportation so I really cant complain. At the liquor store, we each stocked up on what we thought we would need for the night. I got myself several beers and a bottle Captain Morgans spiced rum. Then it just took one final bus ride back to the school again, where we would finally be able to start drinking!
