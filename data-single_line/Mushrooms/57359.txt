We decided that the river would be cool to go down to and we could sit on the walkway and smoke some weed. At about 12:00 we made it to the walkway and we decided to stand around and have a smoke really quickly. BAD IDEA. We were all standing around completly ripped out of our skulls. Brad was in the middle of a sentence....took a drag of his smoke...and fell completly face first into solid concrete. At first he just lay there in a pile on the floor but soon he got up and began to crawl around making the strangest noise I have ever heard. I flipped him over and had a look at his face, half of one of his front teeth had been knocked out in the fall and there was blood all over his face. ( I was flying by this time so there might not have been as much blood as I thought). After about ten minutes of rolling about and spitting blood up brad instantly switched back to himself and began began laughing at himself and saying how weird that was. We went back to my house and cleaned brad up and watched batman begins (which was crazy). Towards the end of the trip brad had another bad spill in the bathroom, he fell through my shower and completly destroyed evrything around it.There was a major burnout and I my body began to move and stretche. It had been a crazy night but nothing to make me not want to zoom occasionly.
