T+1h45: slowly returning to baseline. Not as cold, but the tea probably helped with that. Nausea passed. Music still sounds great, though. Still got one hell of a body high going on, but can only tell when I get up. Spent the last 45 minutes listening to music. Got some very subtle closed eye fractals. Definitely past the peak, though. I think I may actually like this.
