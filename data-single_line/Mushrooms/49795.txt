A few minutes after 00.30am N, P and myself decided to start our journey home. Finally, we arrived home safely. The night had been very satisfying and we were all happy when talking on IRC when we got home. Everyone had had a great time. The trip wasn't very hard, but it was a great and fun trip. Just made our night totally satisfying!
