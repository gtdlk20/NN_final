The effects came in an exciting rush after only about twenty minutes.  Perhaps I'm unusual in that I actually enjoy the earthy taste of dried mushrooms.  I could still taste them when the geometric patterns started to appear in the shady parts of the room.  Sunlight was beaming through the living room window and patterns of light were bouncing onto the walls from various shiny objects in the room.  These patterns resolved into the faces of Aztec gods.  I was listening to the potent music of Dead Can Dance, the voices guiding the patterns into sensual dances.  My grandfather's old clock, vaguely bird-shaped, seemed to want to fly off the wall, pinned down somehow by its swinging pendulum.   Mesmerized by this, I melted into the sofa where I sat and relaxed into a state of bliss.
