I put a playlist on, and it for the next hour, there was an electronic rock concert in my head - booming, immersive and wholly uplifting. I closed my eyes and flowed along with the beat and the gentle instruments that spoke of hope and excitement and things to come that were out of this world. Even the gloomier tracks failed to bring me down, instead bringing me into a more awestruck and 'deeeep' state of mind. I was open to the emotions in the music like never before, merged with it, and at the same time so happy, so damn alive. This, I knew, was what it meant to really live.
