IÂ’m glad nobody noticed that I was crying in the closet, because that would have cut the experience short. It was an awesome feeling that I keep in a little bottle for whenever I get down. The rest of the trip was pretty uneventful. Even the first part was pretty inconsequential compared to my flashback time travel experience.
