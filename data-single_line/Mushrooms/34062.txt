My memory on this experience is a little fuzzy even though it only happened the other day. About 2 weeks ago I purchased 3.5 grams of Mushrooms from a friend of mine. He said that they were 'The best shrooms this house has seen' which he also mentioned 'Is saying alot considering how much shrooms have come through here.' It was 35 dollars for the whole bag ($10 a gram).
