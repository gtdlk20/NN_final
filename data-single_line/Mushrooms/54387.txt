A vital point to remember  and this is a point that one cannot take into account during a trip and even not for a long time after an intense trip  is that different psychedelics have different concepts of reality and of core concepts of existence, of emergence and of becoming.  On the lower heroic doses (5g dried equivalents), the likes of spores, vines, leaves and cacti more or less agree and give very similar experiences of the Multiverse.  This is probably due to there still being a balance between Self, Ego and psychedelic anima (the spirit and the molecules of the psychedelic).  The moment the dose is increased to overwhelming amounts over 10 dried grams, however, the plant spirit takes over and tips the balance in favour of its idea of reality and the workings of the game.
