All in all this was a mind-blowing experience and yes it's been said before but you really really need to have respect for psychedelic drugs. I thought I was prepared but this was far more intense than I could imagine. The dose was also a bit too strong for a first-timer so make sure you are aware of the dose, especially if you're quite light-weight like me. I should've started with around 1 grams, and not +2g. But I don't regret taking the mushrooms, just feeling a bit remorseful about taking such a strong dose for a first time. Despite some bad and frightening moments I still think I can learn something from them, and the spacey part of the trip will definately be an enjoyable memory for life.
