Rocko starts to trip and says so aloud. Gimpy is lost in his world of internet and we leave him there until he's done. Me and Rocko start to talk. However the only high I have is from the weed. Except from a certain feeling that '' something's not right ''. I eventually convince myself that what is not right is that I am not tripping. I tell both of them I am going to take a leak.
