I took three capsules of dried mushrooms at 8pm. an hour later, when things felt a bit weird but not that weird, I dropped another two. The first thing I noticed, and this was when IÂ’d only taken two, was my sense of perspective being heightened. everything seems sharper and more pronounced on mushrooms. rob was sitting on my lap and I was very conscious of him being very close to me, (more than usual when someone is sitting on your lap, obviously ) there were people behind him and they all seemed to be in layers. you know when u see some scenery in a play? everything is in layers, sea in background, then green hills, some trees etc etc. but it was with people this time. and rob seemed darker than them too.
