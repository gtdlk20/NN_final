I was at a Reggae concert when a stranger approached me.  It was 8 o'clock on the second night of the three day concert, and he looked to be in his mid-40's.  He offered me an eigth of cubensis for 20 dollars.  I declined that offer, and proposed to him that we trade substances, for I had more of this fantastic strain of pot than I needed at the time, and I was hoping to achieve a better mushroom experience than the last panic-stricken hellish time I had spent in the fetal position in the back seat of a friend's car. That time, I had known without a doubt that I had been abandoned and would suffer greatly at the hands of some unseen evil, and then, eventually, die. As we all know, mushrooms vary greatly by variety as it relates to the experience, and this time, at this Reggae concert, I was hoping to settle the score with my foe, psilocybe cubensis.
