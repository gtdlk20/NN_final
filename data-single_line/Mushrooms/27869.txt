When you push through the pain and reach a state of inner peace, THEY will visit you. When you hear them beginning to whisper in your ear, calmly introduce yourself and tell them why you came. They will know this already, but it is just a formality. They will ask you to enter the darkness, lie down and close your eyes (pillows and blankets are good here). Do what they say and they will produce miracles for you. Once you pass through their little world, they will release you into the void.
