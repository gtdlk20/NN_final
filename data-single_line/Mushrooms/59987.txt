I can't say what time it was, as I had lost all concept of it by now, but eventually we all decided to go downstairs and listen to a CD my friend had brought with some trippy music on it. We went downstairs, but most of the guys couldn't stop talking or laughing, so they abandoned the music and went up stairs. I was the last person in the room, and I remember trying to walk towards the stairs but I kept forgetting why it was I wanted to go to them. So I just stood there with my head back and my eyes closed.
