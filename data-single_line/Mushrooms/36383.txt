I am rather prolific in meditation, so I experimented with techniques; this led me to be able to control the trip as in what angle to percieve the world.  Finally, I understood cubist conceptions and the nature of Einstein's theories.  Humans that I saw on the trip were more sort of caricatures in nature; yet I could identify with their needs in terms of Maslow's hierarchy theory.  Visual hallucinations were vivid and pulsating under closed eyes; reds and blues and yellows reassured me of the beauty of life, of existence.
