It made me realize there is no need for fear, ever, because after all its only an experience. Whatever happens, its ultimately okay. I thought it wouldnt matter if I used our real names in the report or not, since there was no need for fear there was no need to hide, either. I thought I could tell my parents about The Experience, and get them to read it and relive it through my senses, warning them in advance of course about the heavy nature of the trip. A lot of this I said out loud at points, but fragmented, scattered. In retrospect, I dont think the others were actually on the same page as me, and in many ways were simply humoring my ranting and raving. But at the time, it seemed to me we were all on the same page, all in agreement, all having The Experience together.
