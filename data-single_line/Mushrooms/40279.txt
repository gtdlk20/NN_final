T+2:30: The trip overcomes me. S has moved slightly away, and I have neglected to follow. I stop dancing. I stand in the middle of the dance floor motionless. I stand staring at the colorful lights and feel the universe shifting around me. I feel like the fibers of the room, every atom in the volume of space around me is expanding  retracting and stretching in an insane symphony. And I realize people are staring at me. I catch up to S and continue dancing.
