It is also best when one has achieved a significant goal in life or reached a benchmark (even a small one) that makes one truly happy about the achievement. To me this is very important. I set so many goals for myself and may feel depressed if I dont reach them, but if I break those goals down into smaller tasks that are within practical reach, and visualize each task as part of the larger goal, I then have reason to celebrate. Even if I have to push the larger goal into the future it is gratifying to reach these smaller benchmarks. Take small stepsbut take steps.
