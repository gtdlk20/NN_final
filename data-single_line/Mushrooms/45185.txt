I dosed 5 grams (dry), having read this to be a good 'full' psychedelic dose. What followed caught me by surprise, as I stared at my HUGE pupils (now the size of two pennies) I slowly became convinced that I had gone completely insane. Everything was breathing and changing shape, while my mind was racing with absolute and utter craziness. What seemed like an eternity was actually about 5 hours filled with intense chaos, including multicolored visuals (I called them ufo's) forming out of thin air and changing shape/volume contrast,complete with audio hallucinations. Needless to say my mouth was agape with disbelief for days after the intense experience and I was still looking for my marbles a week later. To this day I grow my own cubies and dose once every few months finding each experience although not as crazy as the first, still worthwhile and more benevolent than my years of drinking and getting into trouble as a result. For me the 'legal' booze and chainsmoking which always goes with it are much more harmful than any amount of natural substances, such as psilocybe mushrooms.
