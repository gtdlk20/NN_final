We had some logistical difficulties. My guide said my concerns about our interpersonal dynamic were relevant and serious and I'd better not trip with them. My guide said my concerns about our interpersonal dynamic were relevant and serious and I'd better not trip with them. The babysitter showed up late. Several hours later than I had expected to start the session, I was frustrated, probably hypoglycemic, and seriously scared that my sitter would back out and I'd be stuck with my trauma indefinitely. Finally the guide handed me the jar of medicine, picked up the toddler, and left. The babysitter-turned-trip-sitter absolved themself of all responsibility for my experience or outcome, and suggested that I taste the medicine and decide for myself how much I wanted to take.
