I was having the most amazing trip. It was definitely the best experience of my life. I had a total out of body experience, I was up in the sky, the bright purple sky. I wasn't just in the sky; I was part of the sky. I felt so peaceful but it was all so intense at the same time. I felt powerful, like I was part of something bigger than me. I felt powerful, like I was part of something bigger than me. I do believe that I found my inner happiness. I must have turned on some music before I passed out because I heard it in the background. Then I heard someone yelling my name, shaking me and trying to wake me up. I know now that it was my boyfriend but at the time, I felt like the sky was talking to me, welcoming me. (This probably sounds dumb to most people, my boyfriend and roommates don't understand at all.) Anyways, I eventually started to wake up but I was so confused. I didn't recognize my boyfriend at all and I was scared that I had a stranger standing over me. I didn't recognize my house either. It was so confusing but I finally realized where I was. Once I got up, I drank some water and felt amazing. My boyfriend was so stressed out and worried about me, he didn't believe me when I told him how great it was. This truly was a life changing experience. I feel like a completely different person now. I'm not sure what caused me to pass out but I definitely had an amazing trip.
