So I went inside very nervously, headed straight to my room. Then headed back to the front door to make sure I'd locked it properly. Then headed back to my room. And I started taking my clothes off. My mom knocked on the door and I don't know how I managed to get her to leave me alone because I was barely able to make coherent sentences. But I did, and she left. My foot knocked against a basket of clean laundry that she must have placed in my room that day and I immediately felt ashamed. I was (and still am) living like a 23-year old man child. I have other people do my laundry for me. I have them cook for me. I don't pay rent. I don't pay any bills actually. In fact, I demand money of my parents and don't contribute one iota to the family business or anything else. Feeling this way was so diametrically opposed from how I'd felt when I was out on my own in the cold. I was proud of myself and could hold my head up high then. Now I was disgusted by myself and wondered how other people could stand to be around me without recoiling. These feelings are caused partly by the fact that my dad throws these things into my face all the time. He tells me my sleep cycle is fucked up and right then I couldn't remember when the last time I'd gone to sleep was so his words were coming back to haunt me. But it is unfair of them to call me childish and selfish and at the same time not allow me to leave. It's unfair, controlling, and contradictory. I'm making efforts to move out right now. The main idea that I'm going to take from this trip is that I need to leave my parents. They're an obstacle in the path of my self-growth and if I want to blossom I need to be on my own away from their judgmental, manipulative actions.
