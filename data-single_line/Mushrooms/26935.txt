You [as a species] cannot abandon me in this period of evolution.  You will destroy yourselves! You are smart enough to build weapons, but too stupid for your own good.  Do not fight each other.  Work together.  This is the world power [I'm unsure on what that means].  The people who you call government deceive you.  Biology is each organism for himself, I control you, do not control each other!
