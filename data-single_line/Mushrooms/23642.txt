I got on the computer and felt terrible. I was in a bad thought loop. I consulted a new friend who had tripped before, and found great comfort in his counsel. He showed me a video that was visually stimulating, but I also found frightening because of the 'fire head' and the 'mushroom men' I eventually had to stop watching it. I was out of this negative thought loop in around an hour, and I think it may have been largely a result of the drugs wearing off. At one point I was in the downstairs bathroom and looked into the mirror, and deduced that I was a monster. My face kept morphing into new shapes, and became more and more ugly. I tried to escape the bathroom, but papers stuck to my feet and I found them to be a great discomfort. I looked on the wall at two drawings I had done as a child. I finally understood why I had done them originally, and the actions that I had made while producing these pictures. This bathroom was evil, and I wished to avoid reentering at all costs.
