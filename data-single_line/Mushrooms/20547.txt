The mushrooms were gold caps and there were around ten of them give or take, pre-dried. I chopped them finely on a board until it was almost a powder and the end result was four to five grams. I knew it would be the biggest dose I had ever attempted so I was nervous as the countdown to eight began. I meditated, set an intent of knowledge and pre-rolled a nice long and skinny joint ready for when it was time to escalate the trip. I had coated the joint with Marijuana Kief so it was potent enough to do its job, and I loaded a bong for later, also with a dusting of THC powder.
