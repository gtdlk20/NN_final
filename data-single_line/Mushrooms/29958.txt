My knees shook as a line from the good old Brothers Karamazov entered my head, Fall down on the earth and water it with your tears. This would have happened had a voice behind me not asked, How are you doing? It was Jimi. Good, I responded, regaining my composure, I was just talking to this tree. He smiled without a hint of deprecation. His experience thus far had been intense as well; only now, three hours in did he finally feel comfortable listening to music. A monumental relief for a musician!
