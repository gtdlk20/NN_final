So, everything is everything.  My existence now is merely a conversation of atoms that collected together randomly from the creation of mother earth.   Form this argument, we can deduce that I, and everything else in the world (or the infinite universe for that matter) has always been alive and dead at the same time.  Life and death are illusions that humans constructed.  Much of our existence is based on this idea, but who is to say that it is true?   A rock is definitely not alive in the same sense that a human being is alive; rather, a rock is alive in a completely alien sense that humans will never understand.  A rock exists; it is a conversation between a collection of atoms just like us; it thinks on a level that humans will never understand, just like how a rock will never understand the way humans think.  Suspend disbelief for a moment, and put yourself in the rocks's shoes.  Who is to say that the rock doesn't perceive mankind as being dead and itself as being alive, just as we percieve ourselves alive and the rock as dead; therefore it lives.
