the last few hours have seemed like years. still 'I' am not anywhere near reality. the room i was in wasn't mine, in fact wasn't much of a room at all. i still had NO control over my thoughts, feelings, or body. I was scared to think that if I did fall asleep that I might do something stupid without even knowing it, such as wandering outside or causing physical harm to me or others.  My ego was blown apart, I had literally felt death, and somewhat accepted it's presence.
