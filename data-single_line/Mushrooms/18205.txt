We found a weekend to go up to a cabin owned by our university.  It was myself, two of my best friends from college (Syph and Clock), and a really good friend I had gotten to know well that summer (Sugar).  A mutual friend of everyone came up with us to enjoy nature and ended up being our sitter (Dummer).
