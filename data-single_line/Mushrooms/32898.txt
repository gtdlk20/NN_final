This trip was completely amazing, enlightening and successful. Z had a great time and felt as though his mind had been transformed for the better. K, who had experienced it many times, felt like it was a solid good trip. G enjoyed it, even when not tripping. I came to a lot of conclusions and used the drug not for recreation but as a way to really make my standard of living better. My five senses were working great, my mind was more accepting of things that used to get it mad. I felt as though I really could see the inner soul of people and understood them at a more loving level than before the trip. I plan on tripping one or two more times this summer and then taking a year break.
