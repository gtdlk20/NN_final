Blueberries aside I started thinking about my family and my relationship and my life. What I have to be thankful for. As well as what I could do better and where I have faltered in my life.

It was kinda heavy but also rewarding. I find I have these self reflective moments on come down. I find I have these self reflective moments on come down. And it was beautiful and I think an important part of hallucinogenic trips. Although not the funnest part.
