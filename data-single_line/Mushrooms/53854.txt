I started sipping on the tea around 7:30. My girlfriend K did not drink any tea, she was drinking whiskey I think. I didnt know how strong it would be so I wasnt planning to drink any particular amount. In 15 or 20 minutes I started feeling it. When I eat mushrooms I go through a rough phase before I start to feeling good, but with tea the rough phase is mild and short, and that was the case that night. The most intense part of the high came early on: I lay down on the bed and when I would closed my eyes I'd see eyes and Aztec designs that made up a rolling, indigo landscape. Then I would have the feeling that I was melting into that landscape, becoming part of it.
