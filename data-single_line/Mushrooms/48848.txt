It started in my bedroom. With nobody home and the PM hours creeping by, I sat alone at the computer, wondering what I was missing. Not really missing the world outside of my room, but the inner world. The world inside me, the world inside you, and each individual world that we all keep inside of us. I decided at about 11:15 pm that I'd like to take a little voyage to my higher knowledge...A vast forest of endless deciduous trees and babbling brooks that scattered themselves amongst the forest floor; a peaceful and serene place that I could simply lay flat on my back in, staring up, alone on a distant and beautiful planet.
