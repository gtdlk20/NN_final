It was summer when this experience took place, and this wasn't my first.  A couple of friends and I had heard of a music festival that goes on every couple weeks at some guys farm.  We decided to go because of the reports of large amounts of mushrooms and possibly lsd at this festival.  We packed our things for camping and headed to the festival.  It was a warm summer day and my life seemed to be going good, I had a girlfriend, I had a nice job, and I had no previous bad trips.
