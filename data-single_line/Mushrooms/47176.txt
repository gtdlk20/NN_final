The trip kicked off. The visuals were absolutely amazing. It was like I was seeing everything in some kind of DNA-strings and they were everywhere. The whole house was moving and vibrating. It went dark in the room and the only colours in my visuals were purple, green and red. The psychological effects were stronger than I had ever experienced before. It was like a psychosis. We were lying on the floor screaming out 'What the FUCK!' all the time. That was because we suddenly both realised that everything mankind does and has done in the past, is completely USELESS. A whole bunch of bullshit. Our everyday lives were useless, it didn't matter anymore. The fact we had friends was strange. The fact we had a body was strange. Computers, and especially the internet, were evil. And smoking cigarettes was good.
