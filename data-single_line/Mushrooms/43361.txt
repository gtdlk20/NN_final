The festival came to an end and most of the people had left. We had about three false starts when leaving but eventually everyone mustered up the energy to stand up and go. We bought a blunt as we left and smoked it on the way back. A few people questioned how to get to our vehicle but I somehow knew the exact way. ItÂ’s as if my subconscious was quietly paying attention during my entire trip, taking notes on where I was, saving them for when I actually needed them. A sort of tether to reality. By now I was simply high from the blunt. The ride home was quiet, as was my journey upstairs. Minutes still felt like forever as I listened to Metal Fingers before I knocked out.
