It was awesome!  The drug was well into the upswing by now (+1:40?), and the fall was a freeze-framed instant that was jolted away only by the cold of the water closing over my head.  I found quickly that I could still swim fine, and went to the top.  On the way up from the depths, I notice an awareness change.  I usually stayed out of the darker deep reaches of this river, just for a fear of the blackness and rocks down there.  As I was under, I noticed a beautiful green glow of the sun coming through the water, and felt very nice about being here.  Just for a split second, though, I may not have even realized its importance at that time.  I treaded water until I started getting tired, then headed for the rocks.
