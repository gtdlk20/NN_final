By far, the most interesting part of this experience was the car ride home.  We split what was left of the shrooms (approx 3 grams) and hit the road.  I wasn't entirely comfortable with a tripper driving, but to be honest he proved to be perfectly capable.  There was lightning, amazing sights, and about 1/4th an ounce of weed passed between the four of us.
