I had recently started to ween myself of lexapro because I didn't like how it flatlined my emotions, sure it helped with managing my depression however it left things washed out. Things had started to look up and I thought it would a good time to start coming off them. I was only on around 10mg so it wasn't a massive decreasing and from what I had a read on the net, some SSRI's can actually dull some trips. This fact would play a major factor in my upcoming trip.
