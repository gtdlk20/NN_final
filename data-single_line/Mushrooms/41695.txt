I was finally able to obtain them on a sunny Monday afternoon, and bought an eighth on my way to getting my nails done (hah). They were gold caps, and the bag was a good mix of stems of caps. I spent the next few hours debating when I should take them, since I was alone and had no set plans for the day - or any more money for gas, cigarettes, weed, etc.. and after I had weighed out the pros and cons of doing them on the spot, I just went for it.
