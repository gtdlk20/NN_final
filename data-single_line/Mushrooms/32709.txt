I started feeling the shrooms coming down, As it was around 11pm at this time, and decided to head off to bed. I called to my cat spiritually again when I saw him, and told him if he would like, he could follow me in my room, lay down with me and watch some tv. He followed me into my room. I laid on my bed, and he immediatly curled up between my arm, and torso. I pet him for a while until he fell asleep. He has done this on occasion, but never so affectionate. He understood, and I understood. We were one. I felt one with the entire universe. I realized that everything is One. It was a very odd feeling.
