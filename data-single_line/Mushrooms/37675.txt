Then, as I started to go, what felt like a cloud of pure ecstacy enveloped me.  I started to breathe heavy just taking in the experience.  It's the type of pleasure that is impossible to describe without having the listener feel it for themselves.  Needless to say, every pleasure sensory nerve in my body suddenly lit and I couldn't do anything but let the waves pass through me with my eyes shut.  I finally stood up, the pleasure feeling still running through my whole body, and all I could do was collapse in the darkness onto the bathroom floor.  The next several minutes I was just lying there, looking at the closed-eye visuals I was seeing.  Patterns of twisting sharp objects, like geometric Christmas trees, would imprint themselves in the blackness, and they danced to the ambience of music that was still playing from the video.
