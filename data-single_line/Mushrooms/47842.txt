Around T+ 1h 15 min the visuals started becoming far more prominent.  The sidewalk was rising up towards me, and I soon found that everything I looked at was too intense, would trip me out too much.  I looked at the sky, and the clouds writhing down sinuously like snakes.  I turned my eyes towards a field of grass, and it turned into a waving sea of grass, an army of grass marching towards me.  For relief, I looked at the grass at my feet, and it turned a strange tan colour, and seemed to be disintegrating in a sepia wind over hundreds of years.  Looking back up, I saw a line of Lombardi poplars, in brilliant fall orange, an orange that seemed to flow out of the leaves, to emanate from the leaves.  These trees were contrasted against an intensely cobalt blue sky, and the side of a brick building.  The bricks seemed to be crawling around, and they would form geometric patterns on the wall.  Everything was the most intense experience of my life.
