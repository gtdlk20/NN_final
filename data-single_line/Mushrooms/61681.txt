We were in my room trying to get ready and then I felt the effects come on. I heard my sister talking and she was walking up the stairs. I came out of my room and I started to walk down the steps when my sister and I walked past each other I remember trying to step on her.(she is 22 so it wasn't like I was gonna hurt her)I just got so angry all of the sudden and I wanted to hurt her. She just laughed and pushed me out of the way.
