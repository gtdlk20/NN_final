My first time was quite a hilarious experience for me (mexican shrooms), I felt like the world was really funny, people's faces seemed funny and at the same time weird, all their facial expressions seemed very clear as well as their behaviour, I was tripping on every single thing (the car stereo, talking to the trees, and many other funny shit), yet that only lasted for 3 hours or so.
