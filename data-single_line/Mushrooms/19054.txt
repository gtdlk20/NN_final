Most of our trip took place in the large round room downstairs. We set up a grid of crystals in the center of the floor, aligned with the center of the ceiling which projects down into the room a couple feet and has a quartz cluster embedded in it. The floor is covered with woven mats, geometrically patterned in greens, reds and blues. There is also an infinite amount of blankets, pillows and bedding around the walls of the room. It was dark outside and the only source of illumination was a cheerful beeswax candle near the center of the altar.
