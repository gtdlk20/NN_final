I crawled into the nearest tent and crashed out.  It was as though the nasuea spread through my whole body, leaving me utterly weak and powerless.  The inside of the tent was amassed with visuals swirling in slow motion.  Everything outside the tent, however, was amassed in fast-forward hallucinations.  My friends were not feeling the same way I was and wanted to do some hiking.  I understand.  I was left alone.
