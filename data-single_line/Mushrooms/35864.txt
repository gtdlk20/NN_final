The AFI music was too harsh so we put a sublime CD and talked about how Bradley Nowell did drugs and died. It reminded me of how numerous amounts of my friends had been strung out on drugs. My best friend had been strung out on pills and sent to Utah. My girlfriend was expelled from school because of her meth addiction. Other friends had been strung out on coke, heroin, LSD, a lot on meth, and one had been raped because of drugs. Not that this put me in a bad place but instead it put me in a place where I realized that I would not fuck up my life with drugs. My life was just too much fun and too important to use drugs as an escape. M and I got to the point where we said that all we would do was drink occasionally and if any drugs only safe ones like shrooms and once every four months. It also gave me a sense of hope by helping my friends.
