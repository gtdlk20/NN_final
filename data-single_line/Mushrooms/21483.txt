I slipped into 'cell space'...I saw myself as a collection of cells. I felt like I was dying, my heart and breathing stopping. And I heard myself say to myself 'You're the only one making this shit go, so make this shit run'. My perspective was of something outside of my body, but viewing my body like a machine or puppet that I needed to keep running if I wanted to continue experiencing the world as I had been. So I dedicated myself to the task of keeping my bodily functions functioning: heart, breathing, peristalsis, etc. I remember thinking that if I were sober, I wouldn't have to think about this stuff, it'd be automatic.  I pulled my perspective back, to see my face grey and looking like tree bark. Not scaly, like some bark, but long strips like wood grain along my cell structures. I then came back to myself, but still 'loose' in space time.
