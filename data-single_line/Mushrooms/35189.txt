There is nothing in this world that can possibly be trippier than that tunnel on shrooms. The ground is made of uneven, rippled and cracked concrete, covered with all sorts of multicoloured grime, and the walls are even worse. There were all sorts of patterns and images forming out of the slime and pockmarks on the wall. The trippiest thing was, the wall was made out of wood and concrete at the same time. This completely baffled us. We spent what seemed like a very, very long time contemplating what it was and what it could mean. When we touched the wall, it was definitely concrete. When we looked at some parts of the wall, it was definitely concrete. When we looked closely and around the edges, we noticed the wood pattern and splinters around the edge.  We eventually decided that the only thing it could be was wood with a thin layer of concrete over it, and carried on with our trip.
