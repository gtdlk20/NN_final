Every year I go to a small town outside of Amsterdam to attend a string music festival with some other kids my age, and every year we have a tradition of smoking a lot of the pot and eating a lot of the shrooms. This year was different however, only 2 people (me and 'Jim') wanted to try the shrooms. We went into a smartshop by the flower district in Amsterdam and asked the guy what we should take. He suggested splitting a box of P Cubensis from Medellin, Colombia (my birthplace actually). A box of shrooms there contains 8 mushrooms of roughly the same size, although I am still not sure how many grams it is all together.
