The reason why mushrooms tend to act as such an effective catalyst for panic attacks is, I think, because of the disturbing level of mental clarity one maintains throughout. Unlike the muddy, loving high of marijuana, the mushroom trip is both crystal clear and psychotic; a volatile reaction if ever there was one. In retrospect, I think the anxiety was caused by the strain of mushroom (cyanescens is one of the more potent strains of shrooms available). On Cubensis, I feel virtually no panic at all. Cyancens is the sort of shroom to be used with great moderation (once every few months at most), as its intensity is simply far too overwhelming for constant use. The anxiety and sheer sense of fear I felt while experiencing its effects is beyond description, but then, so is the intense euphoria I felt after having passed the summit.
