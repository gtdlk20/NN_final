At around 6:15 they started to kick in. I felt almost weightless and like I was trancending into a higher dimension. I felt extremely relaxed, slightly nauseous, and somewhat anxious and nervous as this unique, but interesting feeling took over me. I decided to stop playing because I couldn't concentrate, and turned on the Tv, laid back on my bed and just relaxed. After about 5 minutes, the feelings became more intense. I started seeing patterns in my wall, and I kept seeing Ronald Raegan in my pants out of the corner of my eye. At this point I was very nervous, but not in a bad way, just excited.
