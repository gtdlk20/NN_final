Last time I did mushrooms I was in Edmonton on my friends birthday when I went to surprise him! It was good times. Waking life is a fantastic movie and incredibly good on mushrooms. Yet I was still in a group setting and I definitely felt some awkwardness. I personally find social situations on mushrooms or acid, any hallucinogen for that matter, a little bit weird and kind of takes away from any soul searching as well as still kinda worrying about social boundaries to adhere to. Makes me feel uncomfortable at some point one way or another.
