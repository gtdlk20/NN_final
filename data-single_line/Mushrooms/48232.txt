Another important event in relation to the body high was when I was walking down a flight of stairs with my then 5 layers of clothes on. For one, it felt like my body was about 3 times its normal size, but as I descended the stair way I started to press against the right side of the wall. About half way down, really concentrating on that feeling, I felt my arm go through all my clothing and through the wall. It almost threw me off balance, but because I didnt actually pass through matter, the wall supported me as I went down the rest of the way. This was the first time that I had a body trip, which I didnt think happened on shrooms. Im accustomed now to the body high, but not body tripping.
