Medication/Supplements: I take no lithium or anti-psychotics for my bipolar. I have decided that medication is not for me after thorough research. I do take N-ACETYL CYSTEINE supplements, ashwaganda supplements, omega-3 supplements, B12 supplements, and folic acid. All these supplements are taken daily.
