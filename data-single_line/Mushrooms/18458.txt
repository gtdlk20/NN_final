I'd like to share this experience that was quite different from the previous ones. I am usually very reluctant interacting with sober people when IÂ’m tripping and like to stay in close proximity to a safe spot. This time however, I walked far away from my tripping base and did that on a busy hiking trail full of sober hikers. Strangely, these hikers helped me to have one of the most insightful, philosophical trips I ever had.
