I yanked off my headphones and asked S how he was feeling. He didnt feel anything yet. I sat there and listened while he was watching Avatar: The Last Airbender and it sounded so strange to me. The speech seemed slow and dim and I couldnt really understand any of it. Suddenly S said I think Im starting to feel something. Which got me pretty excited. My friend S takes anti-depressants and I think  this is why things went how they did for him. By this time S had smoked a bowl of my dank.
