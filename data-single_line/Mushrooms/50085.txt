them boom out of nowhere i remebered (i never forgot) that i was raped as a child and it started to really get to me like it never has before i could usually blow it off and not think about it but i couldn't then and i started crying like mad. so we went back inside and we just decided to sit and talk for a while and my ideas were just flowing and i finally came up with a good reason of why i am a vegatarian and why i don't believe in god. Over all the experience was great and made alot of things clear to me. i didn't see that many crazy visuals but i just felt alive it was one of the first time i totally felt happy and not depressed even though everything around me was sad.
