How to start? I suppose I'll start with the mushrooms themselves. I had two grams and ate them in the bathroom of my parents' house where I currently reside. The taste was nothing enjoyable but wasn't particularly unpalatable either. Eating them was simply an obstacle to go through in order to achieve my goal of altered perception. This was at 11:37. With a portable music player in my ears, a book of Rumi under my jacket and a scarf around my neck I left my parents' house and began walking towards the park. The night was chilly and the air bit at my hands. I was wearing a couple layers though and was not too bothered by it as I ambled along down 20th Street. On the way, I decided to start the night off with Canned Heat by Jamiroquai. I keep trying to tell myself that song is my anthem since I relate so well to the lyrics, but it rarely provokes a strong emotional response. Tonight was no exception. It was a good song, but nothing special. So I switched over to Jimmy Eat World, the band that played the soundtrack to my late teens.
