The movie is finally over and we go back up to my room; A wants to go on an 'adventure', I want to smoke on this adventure, so we pack up our supplies and go out for a walk, this might just be Mistake the third.  The first attempt at getting outside I get fucking cold so I have to go get a better jacket, the second attempt we make it probably 100 feet up the hill before deciding the wind was too much and that we'd rather smoke in my room anyway; going back down I say I'm really cold still and run back down towards the house, A runs in front of me and says something like 'what are you running from', the shrooms turn this into phantoms dodging about yelling 'what are you so afraid of' in a teasing tone.  We get back inside to my room, the rest of the shrooms must have hit me about this point because I'm seeing walls disintegrate in seconds when I look at them; I have this feeling like I have been shown what I was and what I have become and the whole trip was a battle to answer see if I was happier now, the answer was yes incidentally.
