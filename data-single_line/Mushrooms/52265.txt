By now I was starting to trip hard, and I must have looked weird.  I was sweating profusely.  It was mid-summer, and Amsterdam was scorching, and the shrooms as well, I ended up looking like IÂ’d just come out of a sauna.  I was making less and less sense as my words were getting quite jumbled.  Dave and Carl started giving each other knowing looks as well as occasionally side glancing me.  Despite being such good friends with them I started to get stupidly paranoid.  I knew they were thinking I was fucked up, but now I had started thinking it was they who were fucked up!  It was almost as if I forgot about taking the mushrooms, it was like as far as I was concerned I was sober.
