(02:04) This is M. B is in the bathroom and I have taken over this trip report. THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET FUNKY! B is the light of my life and Im so glad that we can experience these substances together. Earlier (around 01:00) B and I were sitting in silence and I was admiring how comfortable that silence truly was. Google docs just shit itself and now that Ive been able to reboot it in a new tab Im handing this back over to B. xo - M
