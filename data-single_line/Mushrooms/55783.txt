'R' had a similar experience once before and her and I spend a good hour talking about what 'it' was all about. I spent the rest of the night talking and dancing to any music I could find. 'D' was talking to the mirror for a good while and eventually asked me if I had a copy of alice in wonderland, he wanted to read about the jabberwocky! We were all really comfy and happy and took lots of pictures and went out in the snow once or twice.
