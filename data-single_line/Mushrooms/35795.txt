Aside from Y, there was nothing but smiling faces.  Whenever I turned to look at my sister I got a glowing, warm, honest smile as a reward.  Z, in classic alpha male fashion, had taken more than anyone else.  He had barely said anything, which was how I preferred it.  Looking quite devilish while doing so, he did nothing but grin and stare at the walls.
