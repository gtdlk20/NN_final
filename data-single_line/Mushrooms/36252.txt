We walked to J's car and got in.  It was such a beautiful day and because Spring was coming all the trees were beginning to have buds on them.  I rolled the window down and J put on a Senses Lost CD.  I remember feeling like a hippy.  I kept feeling so connected to nature.  Whenever the car moved the breeze blew on my face and I felt so good with the music filling my body and making the sky dance in my head.
