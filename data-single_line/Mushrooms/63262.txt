As we got to my friends tent I realized that I needed water and could not lay off the fact asking everyone and anyone for it.  I finally got my water but still had my anzioty so I decided to lay down in the grass and look at the stars.  At this point in time is when the effects really started to kick in.  My body started to feel like the grass was growing all over me and then turned into arms which pulled me under ground only to shoot me straight back up into the air and back to reality.  I then knew this was going to be like no other trip.
