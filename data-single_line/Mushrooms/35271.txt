I would say that before taking any drug it's best to research it, and just make sure to have a good setting, and nice understanding, grounded people around. Also to be prepared efficiently for the experience. (Whatever that might mean for you.) (I would like to add that throughout the day there were periods of time in which I knew I was tripping. It was not all complete chaos, I knew who I was every once in a while.) Anyway, Peace.
