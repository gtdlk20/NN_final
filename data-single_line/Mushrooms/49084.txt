Winamp visualizations were amazing. I felt so happy to just be sitting there watching crazy patterns and lights. T started to talk to some people on MSN, so I sat grabbed a sleeping bag and lied down on my futon (next to the computer). I suddenly started to cry because I didn't know the man/woman who made the zipper for my sleeping bag. I mean, think about it. No one ever notices, but if there wasn't a zipper the sleeping bag would be open, and very cold. Or all one piece, and hard to get into. I was very, very sad because I had never taken the time and think about the person that made my zipper. At the time, I knew crying over the zipper was stupid but I couldn't help myself. T and I laughed over my feelings for the zipper.
