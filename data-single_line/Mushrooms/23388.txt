I feel more positive about life. Although some of the concepts I understood on shrooms can easily be created while sober, I understood their significance on shrooms. That's why those ideas have been applied to my everyday life. I guess that is what enlightenment is: seeing something so beautiful that it is instilled in your mind. For example, when I listen to the music that I listened to on shrooms, I still feel the sense of 'connection' to that music. I think shrooms is a very peaceful, enlightening medicine for the soul. If you're curious about shrooms, try them. While you're on them, try to find a purpose to yourself , and if you do, you will be enlightened. Also, be around people you love, they can save you, like 'A' and 'E' did, from a bad trip. I liked life before shrooms, I now LOVE life.
