11:00 P.M. As I listened to my headphones, outside, watching people walk by, I could still sense their emotions and I felt so good. So good. I felt at one with all the beauty and at one with the ugliness. I forgave myself for my ugliness and my damage to this world and gave up my sins with the wind. I forgave the people around me for their dirty looks and asked myself, what is so strange about this guy (me) sitting here on the ground, smoking a cigarette, listening to music, and enjoying his experience of life?
