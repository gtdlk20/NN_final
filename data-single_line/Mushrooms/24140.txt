But hold on a tic here mate, of course they have no free will, theyre not people,  theyre characters. This is a movie. This is Hero. You brought it with you remember? To use with the laptop during a lull in the music, a lull in the drugs, a lull in the hedonistic revelry in which you longed to immerse yourself. You are watching a film. Remember this, dont let go, dont let go, dont sink for gods sake back into it, dont sink.
