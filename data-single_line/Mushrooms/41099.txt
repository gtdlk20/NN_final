Keep breathing. I am in the waves. I am the waves. Burning, churning sub linguistic manifold esoterica. I am the waves. Burning, churning sub linguistic manifold esoterica. From the frost into the marked man. The substance of hurtling space dust at the forest of life. The spark and the meteor. The metre, the rhythm, the white light expanding over metaphor. The dogs of time barking at infinity. The curling madness of love, beauty and desire hidden in the thumbprint of humanity.
