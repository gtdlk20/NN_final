As I continued to work on cementing space time (with the occasional slip into staccatto-time), I heard the water running in the kitchen. I came in to find my partner disassembling my hookah (which I had smoked tobacco from earlier), and I explained we were high and that I'd clean it up when we were sober. I went back to bed. As I came to the end of the 'space time' experience, I heard the water again. Fearing I had once again slipped into the beginning of 'forever time' I got up and saw my partner cutting fruit.
