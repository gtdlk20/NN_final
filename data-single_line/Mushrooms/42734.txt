My mind was getting to clouded with random thoughts and I began to feel to overwhelmed by the trip. The normal twitching and moving I get from mushrooms was also more intense then usual. I was not scared and not bugging out I was just having a lot of discomfort. I couldn't remember how long ago I took the mushrooms and I couldn't calculate how long the trip would last. I still did not become scared just very confused.
