I was lying on the floor again after about 30 minutes according to the alarm clock, and I grabbed a piece of paper and a pen that I keep in my Camelbak and just started drawing.  It mostly ended up in scribbles, but I did write down a few words such as 'john' 'me' 'reality' and 'life' which makes me think now that I was trying to ground myself back into the real world as the trip was starting to wear off.  I could now control my arms again, which is how I was able to draw on the paper.  I finally just rolled onto my back, still seeing the closed-eye visuals and feeling out of my mind still when I finally fell asleep, perhaps at about 3:30, making my trip last about 3 hours, but feeling more like 3 days.
