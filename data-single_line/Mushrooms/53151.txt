At one point the scenery in front of my eyes turned into a purple sunset, in which a strangely beautiful woman (nymph?) was doing a strangely beautiful, swaying dance. Much to my amazement the nymph was suddenly transformed into one of my closest friends with whom I had unfortunately lost contact and whom I worried about. I was overcome by a joyous feeling; I knew that my friend was fine, and that she could somehow feel my presence, as well.
