Buddy was definitely tripping hard, mabee a litte harder than me and D.  A little bit goes a long way.  Just one small cap and he was trippin hard.  If you are ever going to trip with a dog or other animal I would suggest a few things.  Concider the dogs age.  I would not recomend any age less than about two and a half years (about 15 or 16 in dog years).  Even that may be young.  Basicly make sure they are out of the crazy puppy stage and are fairly mature.  Never force a dog to eat something that is going to have such strong efects.  If he had a bad trip I imagion he would be pissed at us for giving it to him.  We offered the shrooms to Buddy freely and let him decide.  If he had not eaten them we would not have forced him to.  Second make sure they know and are comfortable with every one they are going to come into contact with. A stranger might upset a dog, potentially more if he's trippin.  Also know their personality, shrooms are not for every person, or dog.
