The taste of the mushroom dust mixed with the lemon juice was one of the most vile things I have ever had. I don't mind the taste of mushrooms just by themselves, and I have never tried making tea, but the sludge I managed to force down was on a level of nasty I had never experienced before. With more experiences under my belt, I now know that this particular batch just really didn't taste too good. This quickly came back to haunt me. Either way, I managed to down everything, said good night to my parents, shut my lights off, laid down, and pulled up some good old Terrence McKenna. Naturally, I don't agree with everything he said, but I have a deep love and respect for Terrence and his brother. I was drawn to what he had to say because I also always wanted to experience true visions, and IÂ’ve always been on a slightly mystical streak. Much like how the older generation had reacted to Huxley, I heard the things he described and also simply thought "gimme that, that's what I want". More specific to mushrooms, I also wanted to test if the claim that they can speak was true. Experiencing both of these things was my goal for the night.
