The journey to the metro station was intense, the Come up felt extremely uncontrollable. I felt myself bounce from one foot to the next and I the scenery around me was giving off a glow that turned the colours from grass green to turquoise and the sky blue was almost neon. MÂ’s journey and my own journey are now separate. As we got on the metro I felt myself feel very uneasy as if I had got on a boat. I sat next to two clubbers and although we were only a few inches apart I could not make out anything they were saying. My vision drifted to two women opposite me and them over to M sitting on the chairs to my left with someone he knew and was in full conversation. There was a constant neon glow surging through the metro and I felt my self laugh every time I felt it go past.
