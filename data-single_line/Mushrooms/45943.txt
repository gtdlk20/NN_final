I'm not one to get hooked to these little fuckers (take it easy with benzos, try not to use more than once every 2-3 weeks), so I just ordered 5x 0.5mg (500 microgram) pellets which should last me about half a year at least, as 0.25mg (250 micrograms) of Clonazolam is supposed to be rather beneficial for a mild but decent benzo experience and I rarely use.
