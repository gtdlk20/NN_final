I don't remember the ride back, up until we arrived at the gas station where we got our milkshakes.  When I got mine it was all melted because I was in the bathroom tripping out to my reflection once again.  When I ate my M&M; milkshake, it was extremely good, until I bit into something strange and moist.  I exclaimed loudly, 'What the fuck?' only to find that I had bitten into a cherry.  I felt a little bit stupid, but like before...didn't care.
