When I stepped back into myself I saw the world with a new set of eyes. As I looked around I saw everything for the first time again. A new fresh breath of life had been thrust through my lungs. An entirely new sensation had overcome me and its effects had me at a stand still, just looking at this complex system we call living. I found my self for an instant in a sea of endless existence.
