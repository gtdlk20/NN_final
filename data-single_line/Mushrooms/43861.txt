I am the most experienced out of the three of us specifically with Mushrooms. I had done 2.5g once before with some friends in our student house. That was a fun time so I went in confident that I wouldn't freak out this time. My other friends have never done shrooms before or any other psychedelic for that matter but have always wanted to.
