One day we went out picking, me and two mates, call them D and K. I can't remember if I'd ever tripped with W at that stage but me and K had tripped together a few times, IÂ’d introduced him to mushrooms. We out to a patch near my childhood home, it was virtually unknown to the local psybernauts and was therefore likely to be more fruitful than the usual haunts. We managed to get enough to cram fill a paper bag full each. We had know idea how many were in those bags but it was well into the hundreds.
