So about half an hour later I get up to go watch some TV and take another 2g to consider eating once I get upstairs. After about 10 minutes I get paranoid about forgetting about them or losing them as the visuals start to take effect, and I start overanalysing the tv show I was watching. It became overwhelmingly easy to relate the scenarios to my life and absorb points of view as apposed to language.
