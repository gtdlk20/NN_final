Then my brother told me to put on the Issues album but Korn. I had a stack of about 40 cd's and when I picked them up they felt like they were melting in my hands. I tried to find the cd but was unable to, he had to find it. It is a wicked album to put on. So we shut of the lights and stared at some tiny lights about a cm in diametre of blue and red. I had hooked them up to my stereo as to light up when base accured. It was amazing.
