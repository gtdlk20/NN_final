6:30 pm: This experience went totally different than I had expected, which seems to be one of the only predictable things about mushrooms  unpredictability. It was really horrifying for a while, there. Felt like I had been swimming in anxieties and fear for an eternity. But I came out of it. I was able to have, acknowledge, experience, and surrender completely to those feelings, and come out of it. It really felt like I was never going to come out of that. Thank you for letting me come out of that. Thank you for letting me experience these emotions head on, instead of just being frustrated for having them. Thank you for giving me tears. Thank you for giving me tears. Thank you for providing me with the awareness of love in my life during this experience. Thank you for scaring the everloving shit out of me. It sucks, but its good to have the shit scared out of you every once in a while. Man. I am really shaken up. I am glad to feel in control, again. I feel more in control, now, than before I started this today, actually. More in control of these feelings. Also more aware. It is still kind of hard to come to terms with. I still dont exactly know where this fear is coming from. But I certainly feel better equipped to manage it in the future. There was a beautiful moment of reconnection to my childhood self when I was crying in the bathroom. Crying brought me back to that wild, out-of-control feeling of having emotions you dont understand. I wanted to bury myself in my partners chest. In my Moms neck. I felt so alone for a time. Alone with this fear. Alone with this fear. But, Im not. Im not. I am not alone with this fear.
