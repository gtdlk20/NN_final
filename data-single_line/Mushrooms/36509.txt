No lets go to BK(burger king)  They replied. I needed to go to the bathroom so I went in. I dont know if I peed or not because all that stands out in my mind is me looking at the mirror and seeing my self drip and reform and swivel. I leaned forward to the mirror and look at myself I was perceiving myself differently. I was glowing and flowing like energy. I grabbed the edge of the mirror and started to pull. What happens next is unbelievable but I believe it to be true. As I was looking in the mirror and seen me in a more pure form I transcended slightly and was able to manipulate the mirrors physical form through energy or something because as I pulled it bent like rubber. In a curve as though it was flowing like energy as well. As I witnessed what I was doing I looked at Wayne and said The mirror is bending.
