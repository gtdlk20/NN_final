- People who drifted into my mind: [actress 1] after S said that I seriously look like [character]. [Actress 2] a lot, I felt like I understood her completely and really needed to meet her, like I know exactly where she got [drama series] from and could predict what the second season will be like. J (my best friend from childhood), felt absolutely sure that despite everything and our broken relationship, she is my soul sister and that she knows it but doesnt know it consciously yet. My current acting instructor, that I knew what she meant by well of emotion and going deep that she keeps talking about in class. [Screenwriter] and understanding where he built his acting school from and wanting to ask him if hes done mushrooms before, and assuming that he has (how could he not), wondering if hes ever had an experience like mine, really needing to ask him. [Writer/scientist], I couldnt decide whether he knew about it too, I think he was always on the brink but never truly gone in, and N of course, but he didnt come in until the second half of the trip.
