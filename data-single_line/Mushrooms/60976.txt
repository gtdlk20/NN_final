My experiance began one month ago.  After a hectic saturday night I was woken up that sunday morning to a friend beating on my dorm door.  I initially pretended I wasn't there but after awhile I decided to give in a find out what he wanted.  I opened the doorm, SHROOMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I FOUND SHROOMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He exclaimed.  After about 7 hours and 20 bucks he manifested the shrooms for me and a few of my friends.  There were 7 of us and we all bought an eighth.  I told my friends I was going to wait to take the shrooms, seeing as they all have a high level of suggestability and I wanted to truly experience the effects and not have to wade through everyone elses star gazing reports.
