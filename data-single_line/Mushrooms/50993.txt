After about an hour and a half of tripping two of my friends stopped by, with a bottle of Parot Bay and a 40 oz. of Mickey's for me. We drank, smoked bud and cigarettes, drank some more, and laughed. My friends were a little startled by my trip, after all, they were drunk, and had never really been around a shroomer before. They kept telling me how dilated my eyes were and I kept telling them how happy I was that they were there for me, when so many of my other friends had left, and how I could have fun without those other friends (many of my old friends had left for college and I was kind of in the middle of an identity crisis about it). The drinking and smoking only added to the high, and I started to speak in whispers and comment on the rainbows that were flowing from my friend's mouths, that's when they decided to leave.
