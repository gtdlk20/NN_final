At this point I became dissolved in the trip. Terrence McKenna speaks of being digested and reborn by the Goddess. I haven't decided if this is a Goddess of the entity of the mushroom, the entity of psilocybin, or of the organism that is our planet and all it's life forms. All I know is that I was completely chewed up last night. I faded in and out of reality several times and with each lapse I lost consciousness of time and space. When I finally grasped reality for more than a brief moment I felt wet and dirty. My brain comprehended that I had soiled myself. In my simple three-dimensional comprehension I thought I must have either vomited in my lap or urinated on myself. I felt dirty. Turns out I was completely clean.
