I prepared the shrooms separately, Kate and Ann were afraid to do Adam's because they were afraid of the source. I ground up the shrooms in a coffee grinder, added the juice from a quarter lemon and then added boiled water to this and let it sit for 10 minutes. I followed this recipe for both batches. I filtered the tea through a coffee filter and measured out doses with a measuring cup, giving myself twice what Kate and Ann got separately.  I mixed up the same concoction for Adam and Jen using their 8 grams. So basically Adam, Jen and I were going to be doing in the range of 3.5 grams and Ann and Kate about 1.75 grams.
