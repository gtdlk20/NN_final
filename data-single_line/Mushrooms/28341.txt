Suddenly I am gone. Every fragment of myself is gone. No visuals. Just an eternal sensation. Suddenly I am gone. Every fragment of myself is gone. No visuals. Just an eternal sensation. A sensation of the soul, my true self. The self I have always been, and always will be. I am in total control and without control, I am nothing and everything, simultaneously. I am outside time and space.
