My family had decided to take a trip up to Lapush, a beautiful beach in the Olympic rainforest, and I had invited my friends T and P. Our second night there my parents told us about a great camping spot on second beach and we set out at about 6:00 with a tent, some munchies, sleeping bags, warm clothes, a few black and milds, and a half an ounce of dried Amazonian Cubensis. Upon arrival we marveled at the perfection of the camping spot: it was hidden about 5 feet back from the driftwood in a flat empty spot in the underbrush, another good five feet above the beach, providing a perfect view of the ocean.
