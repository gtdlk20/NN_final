I found my way to the front and sat down, making myself comfortable. I was in the most incredible state of mind and it was getting better! Everybody here are my friends and everybody knows everything about everybody here and the druming and dancing express that unity to such extent, it was driving me crazy. With my eyes bulging out of my head in excitement, I started swaying back and forth, moving with the drums, enjoying the hell out of the occasional dancer finally coming around at my side of circle and doing the sexiest dance in the world, looking at me with hunger and eagerness, giving me a full fledged boner! That intense gaze gave me this mystical, unexplainable feeling, and that feeling eventually turned physical and vibrated straight from the bones out to the open air, contributing to the energy that was already airborne.
