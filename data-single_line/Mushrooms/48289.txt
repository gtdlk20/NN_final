We went inside and watched some show of T.V. The people's faces on the show all seemed to morph and sway with different colors, mostly green now. Around 10:30, my parents called, and we all froze. I didnt think I was capable of talking to them now, so I told everyone to let it ring. A few minutes later, they called again. One girl told me to answer it and say I was in the shower and try to make the conversation with my parents as short as possible. I did as she said, and managed to fool my parents.
