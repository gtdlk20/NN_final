My tripping roommate and I decided to take a walk around the neighborhood to see what interesting things we would find.  Everything seemed alive, breathing in and out.  The trees, the sky, cars, you named it was alive to us.  This only being about an hour into our trip I was still able to control it pretty easy.  Before returning to the safety of our apartment I noticed a bush just down the stairs from where we lived.  This bush was not only breathing it was turning all different colors.  It was so beautiful I stared at it for a good 10 minutes.  By that time the outside world had taken on a mind of its own and it started being a little freaky.  So we retreated back to our safe haven.
