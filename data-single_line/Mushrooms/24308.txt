As the experience had been quite profound and intense I had delayed taking the second dosage. I was still tripping very hard when I took it at around a quarter to two. I had a bad case of the fidgets, so I forced myself to sit and relax in silence. Chirruping and other sounds familiar from psychedelic music emerged. A golden Buddha/Alien statue confronted me about my identity, in a scene very reminiscent of the stare of the 'confuse a cat' sketch cat. Opening eyes from this, all was roughly, warmly painted (a la Scanner Darkly) and fluid looking/feeling. I felt like I was floating through the sensation of the happiest sunshine day of the year, a comforting, cozy, connected, contented feeling. The light from outside became bright flaring sunlight, the opposite of the snow scene section of the journey, it felt like peak of summer.
