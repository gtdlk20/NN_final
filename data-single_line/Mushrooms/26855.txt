In short, my entire existence at this time seemed like a web, not like a spider web, but a web following a linear plane sequence, made from strands of time, space, depth, feeling, and senses, spanning infinitely up, down, left, right, and everywhere in between, glowing all the while.  One thing was for sure; whatever sense of normalcy I had 3 hours before, was completely shattered.  Eating that mushroom had taken the time/space continuum and ripped it open, leaving a gash for me to jump in to.  I stood up again, and walked into the living room (careful not to look into any mirrors for fear of freaking out completely), and looked at the clock; it was 2:30 in the morning, and the drug was beginning to take a back seat to my overwhelming need for sleep; So I went back to my room, lay down in bed once again, and drifted off peacefully into the vast sea of existence.
