About 45 minutes into the trip, I sat down on the sofa in my house.  I was beginning to feel the intensifying mushroom energies and began to get the oh shit I took too much thoughts.  I sat on the couch for a while in a somewhat fearful trance, thinking about the fact that I would have to be dealing with this for the next four hours at least.  Then I began feeling the traumatic intense energies that seem as if my body is threatening to black out or go into seizure (I had gotten this several times before while very high on pot, I am not exactly sure what it is).
