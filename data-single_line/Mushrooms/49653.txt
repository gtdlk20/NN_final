John E was sitting opposite me still, and both of us started improvising drum beats for the song lateralus. I used KTs arm as a hi-hat and the beat really impressed both me and john e, which seemed even more amazing. He is one of the people I have to thank for that night because sitting and listening to the latter (ho ho ho) part of that song, he made me hear some hi-hat work that Id never noticed before. This would have blown me away normally but that night, it was enough to make me cry hard again.
