We popped in the Powerpuff girls movie and I don't know how long before time had passed before I started to feel weird. A different state of mind came over me. We were sitting in her basement, it was dark outside and her dog kept howling outside the glass door. Pretty soon, I became completely confused on what was happening during the movie and it became almost intolerable to watch. I noticed I was clenching my jaw alot, but this just might have been because I couldn't wait for the movie to get over. I felt like I was going to jump out of my chair. Then the movie was over and we went outside-to her barn. It was so peaceful out there. I just sat in the snow and listened to her horse eat. I went into my own world.
