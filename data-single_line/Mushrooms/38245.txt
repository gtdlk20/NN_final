0:50: I couldn't take much more of my friends inane drivelling. It wasn't that I was angry at them, they were just detracting from my goal of self discovery and they were enjoying mushrooms in a different way than I was. They were all relatively inexperienced shroomers, maybe they'd done it two or three times each. So I left them and went upstairs.
