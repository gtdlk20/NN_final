I saw a group of 3 guys at a table at the far end of the bar and then this strange thing happened. I became a lion. No words I use right now can describe how I felt. But I really was a lion. I wasn't pretending to be a lion. I became a lion. I felt like I was prowling around the 3 guys, kind of like choosing which one to devour. And I just prowled around the bar of a bit. Then 5 minutes later I became a spider. My hands moved like a spider on its own accord. After that, I became a scorpion. And I felt what it felt like to be an insect. To crawl on the ground. One of the guys lifted up his toe and I got so frightened. Everything around me was huge and tall, but my tail (which was my leg) was always ready to sting if the need be. After a while, K became slightly worried. She acknowledged my existence as a scorpion, and after she did that she brought me back to the table where I calmed down for a bit.
