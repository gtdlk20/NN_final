I got over-confident and exposed myself to some triggers that I'd avoided for months before the session. Then I had a panic attack, not the worst I've had, but scary enough to make me worry that I might be slipping back into old patterns already. I think I'm going to be okay. I'm still actively integrating the session. Writing this report, especially the section on set, has been a lot more emotionally intense than I anticipated. I'm going back to microdosing, and thinking about calling that other friend who offered to sit with me. Maybe another session, a similar dose of the same medicine, and a more intentional welcome home to waking life afterwards, will help.
