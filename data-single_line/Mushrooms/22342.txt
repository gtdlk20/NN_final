My spiritual experience came to a climax after ingesting 3 g of psilocybin mushrooms. After a period of nausea and disorientation I began to see visual distortions. This was pleasant and relatively entertaining; however the trip became increasingly more intense. I began to feel as though time had ceased to progress in a linear fashion, but rather had folded in on itself, creating a series of loops. I found that as I focused on pleasant or unpleasant thoughts and sensations their emotionality and experience would spiral into increasing intensity and that I could steer my trip by choosing where to place my awareness.
