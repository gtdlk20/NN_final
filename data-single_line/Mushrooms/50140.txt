After about 30 minutes A left me to rest and went downstairs. I remember lying in bed with my eyes closed, yet all I could see was a riot of colours and lights. At this point I became very introspective. I experienced some very profound thoughts, and I suddenly became very insightful. I remember having a conversation with some mystical being. We discussed my mental health problems and the voice explained to me that I shouldnt be ashamed of my problems and that if I accepted who I was then I would be peaceful. This being helped put to rest a lot of my inner demons and made feel comfortable with myself.
