The thought police huh? I think you better call in work tomorrow Ether, joked Fat Chad.  I held my hand up next to my ear as if it was a phone.  Sorry boss, I ate way to many hallucinogenic mushrooms, and trip still am I. Dont think Ill be work making in it today, I jested in return.  Now I couldnt see anything. I banged my fist against the wall.  Get me out of this incubator! Get me out of this calamity, I yelled.  John opened the door and I toppled out of his closet. How did I get there?  I looked at the clock on his wall. Five hours had passed since we had arrived at his apartment. I was confused to see that the clock was in mint condition, regardless of my memory of destroying it. My perception of the last hour was completely distorted.  Instantaneously, bright light filled the apartment. I heard a disembodied voice congratulate me on passing the test of using death as an advisor.  Hell yeah John, your electricity is back on, I told him.  Yeah I wish, then I could listen to my new Ratt compact disc, John complained.  The room dimmed back to the gentle glow of candle light.
