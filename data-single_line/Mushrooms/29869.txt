I though how ironic all the self-righteous, god-fearing people who attend church every week had no idea they were praying to a mushroom, perhaps even an alien mushroom from another planet or even star system. Perhaps the mushroom is from a planet in the star system that went supernova and created our solar system. None of this seemed odd to me.
