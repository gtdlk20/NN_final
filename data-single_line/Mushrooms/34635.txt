This went on for another hour before I decided to go and find more shrooms, and that's when one of my friends gave me half of his bag for free which I ate immediately.  I cannot explain the extreme technocolor world I was walking in, filled with faces, shapes, color, and sound.  Every step I took seemed to sink into the ground like walking on a spongey alien surface.  I sat down with a few rastas that were playing guitar and bongos and smoked a few bowls as I listened to the echoing thunder of the bongos and lighting.  The told me how their friend had bought a quarter of shrooms and still had a bag but didn't want it because he was having a bad trip.  I gladly took the unwanted boomers from them and ate them immediately once again.
