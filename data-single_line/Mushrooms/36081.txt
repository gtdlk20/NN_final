I'll save you the trouble of reading in depth about the typical shroom effects, and instead just quickly summarize. Breathing felt *great*. I would take a deep breath and I could feel it filling my entire body. It felt as if each breath was the best breath I have ever taken. Music sounded great, as usual. Even at this small dose, I saw some small visual distortions on my computer screen - mostly just wavy images.
