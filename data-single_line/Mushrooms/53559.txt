After about half an hour we drank some mushroom tea. Taste was as icky as it had been 5+ months ago and before that, and all effects felt somehow very familiar. Though quite diluted, in spite of the very long pause. While stoned, the tenseness of the jaws was not felt coming on, and legs felt quite feeble already, so only coming on-effects were introduction of extra reverb into each sound, and very slow deepening of all thoughtpatterns... Visuals also came quite colorful, but the patterns I usually see on the retina (small dots, waves and squares of different color) were absent. Some Thursday Afternoon was being played, and we both decided that it w as bit too lame, as we both listen to it very much while reading and such.. So on came Terry Rileys Shri Camel.
