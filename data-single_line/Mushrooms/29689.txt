Leading up to my overdose, I had come back from a month-long study in India regarding the intersection of western and holistic (traditional) medicine. I became very depressed, early in my senior year of high school, and my anxiety was running rampant. To put it lightly, I was in the worst possible emotional state to take 7 grams of mushrooms, especially without extensive prior experience and research.
