There was a relation of movement to the music, but not how I normally dance - it was much more patient. In no rush to make a big gesture, the smaller gestures were keenly felt (As I write this, I realize that the awareness of the quality of patience in this moment resulted in a profound internal re-experiencing of the concept of patience in general; the same happened with other concepts - I would come to recognize them in the experience, and the experience would take me on a roller coaster through the Platonic form of that concept). This would be ((interfered)) with if I looked directly, or tried to do the thing myself. I had to let something possess me.
