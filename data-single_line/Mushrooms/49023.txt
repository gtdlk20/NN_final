We made our way into a nearby forest for a more interesting setting. When I got up I felt weightless, and walking there seemed to be a more challenging task mentally than physically. The forest was eerily quiet and made us all uneasy. My hearing became more acute and I started to notice every little noise around me, even the tiniest rustle of leaves and branches. When there was absolute silence my ears rang with a strange, quiet buzzing noise. All the while it was getting colder outside and clouds had started to thicken. I felt uneasy in the forest, the branches looked cold and bare and somehow menacing. I looked at my friend and his lips were pale and a little blue from the cold. My mind immediately conjured morbid thoughts of all of us dying there in the forest (from poisoned mushrooms), and our pale, blue-lipped corpses being found half-decomposed weeks later. This must be what a bad trip is like, I thought. We decided to leave the forest and head to my friend's house.
