By the time I got into my friends house I was feeling like a piece of dirt.  Just knowing that tomorrow I couldnt call her or even see her pissed me off to the point where the next person that said something to me was going to regret it.  Everthing I looked at or thought about was making the matters worse.  So before I did something stupid I got up and left.  I just walked around by myself checking my watch all the time. Time seemed to be moving at a slow crawl.  After 5 hours of this I was ready for it to end but it wouldnt.  I didnt know what to do I just wanted the high to be over.  So I went to my car and turned it on.  And just sat there looking at my driving lights.  By this point lights where all intensified.  They where glowing bright and rich with colour.  This was the only part of my trip where I felt calm and didnt think about my ex.
