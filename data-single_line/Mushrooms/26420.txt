So now it's 7:00pm and I'm pretty high from the mushrooms, and looking around I notice red/orange/yellow tones are enhanced. Also things look, well, more interesting. In another 15 minutes I was having some nice moving visuals, like objects slowly shifting in patterns and slight morphing. Nothing too extreme but beautiful nonetheless.
