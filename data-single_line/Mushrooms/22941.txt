After writing for a little while on my blog, I reminded myself that I wanted to listen to Someone Put Your Hand Out because I relate so well to it. So I put in my earphones and went under my blanket to get lost in my sadness. I began crying at some point because the song brought up memories of Justina. And I felt a sense of loss because right then I realized that never again would I trust someone so unquestioningly. I trusted her with my personality, with my feelings and with my dreams. I'm not saying that she betrayed my trust or did anything mean in the slightest. But I gave her my all and she never reciprocated. That hurts. Like a motherfucker. I know now to never give someone my love without asking for theirs in return. That's the minimum it'll take for me to let someone in again. I have walls that are much more stringent than that,, but this rule I'll never break. And it's a shame, because that behaviour was beautiful in its own way.
