After finishing them I was starting to get a little worried.  In the last hour or so, I had munched down 3 doses of mushrooms, costing me 85 guilders.  If I didnÂ’t come up I had wasted a lot of money.  After a while I wandered into another mushroom shop.  I explained to the woman behind the counter my predicament, she suggested that I smoke a passionflower joint, something that she just happened to be selling!  It was meant to enhance the trip, but sounded like a whole load of bollocks.  As it was only a couple of guilders, I bought it anyway.
