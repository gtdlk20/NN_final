I ate exactly 6 dried grams at about 8:30 or 9 PM.  I ate a generous bite of banana nut bread, chewed it and put as many shrooms in my mouth as I could, until I tasted shrooms, just like the 5g dose 3 days earlier.  Knowing I had a while before they kicked in, I took my shower and prepared for bed as usual.  I filled 2x 1.5 liter aquafina bottles with water, remembering my splitting dehydration headache last time, and set them in bed with me.  I turned off my fan, stereo and even my computer, grabbed a notepad and climbed into bed.  I did not want even the slightest hum to interfere with my trip, taking Terence McKenna's advice again, which went extremely well last time, of engaging in a high-dose trip in the dark of your own room in your own house where you feel comfortable and will not be disturbed.  About 1 hour and 15 mins later my trip started in, same times as part 1 so far.
