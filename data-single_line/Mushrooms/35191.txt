We spent about half the time trying to communicate with bizarre creatures that were forming on the walls, and the rest of the time we were discussing things and discovering secrets locked in our brain which the shrooms had released, as always, none of which I can remember, I just remember it happened. We also noticed that if we looked out of one side of the tunnel, it appeared to be nice, summery weather, but when wel ooked out the other side, it appeared to be winter: the trees were dead, the plants looked browner and the light was completely different. This was very confusing but definitely seemed real.
