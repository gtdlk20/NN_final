Back in Hanks room, his brown shag carpet became a thousand tiny caterpillars crawling around on the floor. I then looked down at my legs and found a gold mine of visions hiding in my blue jeans. First, there were faces. Lots of them, swimming all over my pants and looking back at me, smiling. On my right thigh, one formed into the face of Jesus Christ. He also looked like he was having a good time. My friends of course were laughing and enjoying the show the whole night, but when I yelled out I can see Jesus in my blue jeans! they practically pissed their pants.
