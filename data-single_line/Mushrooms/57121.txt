I was standing outside smoking a cigarette and just staring up at the sky. It was nighttime and the sky was a bright purple color to me. It was dark but at the same time everything was so clear, I could see every little detail. My roommate and boyfriend came outside to check on me and they were telling me that they weren't tripping at all. This made me feel so sad, I just wanted to be by myself and drift off into my own world. I walked back inside to the computer to listen to some music. I don't remember actually making it to the computer but I do remember coming inside. My boyfriend told me that I spun around in the computer chair and then passed out, face first onto the floor. I was only out for a few seconds but it felt like hours.
