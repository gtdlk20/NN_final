The mushroom almost seemed like it was built or designed to dissolve the ego.  This dissolving of my ego was like the defeat of an evil demon that had dwelled inside me my whole life.  It made me feel like an animal, or organism more than I felt like the human me.  During this 'ego death' process that took place, the mushroom seemed to equalize my mentality to a certain level.  The mushroom seemed to pull out who I really am,  assured me that everything was fine and was really pushing me to overcome my fear of what others think of me (which is my biggest fear) and take on the religious belief of the mushroom.  It destroyed the mentality that made me feel like 'I was the shit.'  The human ego, the typical male ego that thinks he is the best looking, that he is the smartest was gone and so was the ignorance that comes with it.
