The next few hours are somewhat hazy in my mind, but I faintly recall a very gradual lessening of effects. I fancy I may have drifted off into the forgiving hands of sleep for an undeterminable period of time, but I will never be quite sure. Somewhere in between the peak and when I first noticed I was finally beginning to regain contact with my ego, I felt the most extreme, all-consuming euphoria possible. It was the sort of sheer, unadulterated bliss poets only dream experiencing. It was a happiness free of reason, free of origin, free of logic, free of limitations, free of time itself (the very same properties attributable to the anxiety I had been experiencing only a few minutes before). I was still very much unattached from the physical world, and felt as though I had stumbled upon some cosmic isle free of earthly properties. As I tossed and turned in bed, I couldn't stop smiling, and was completely overwhelmed by my euphoria. It was the strongest sense of fulfillment and perfection I had ever felt. It felt as though it would never end, as though I was stuck in an etenrity of sheer, inexplicable bliss that refused to subside.
