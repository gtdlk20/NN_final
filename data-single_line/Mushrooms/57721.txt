When I got home, I started to make my dinner immediately. I was making pasta with garlic bread and a fruit bowl for desert. I didnt eat too much of it. By this time it was 16h30. I started to feel normal again. This prompted me to take more shrooms. This time, I took 2 g. Similar to above, I started to watch a movie. Instead of it being My Neighbor Totoro, it was Howls Moving Castle. For some reason, near the end of the movie, I just started to cry. I could not stop the crying for three hours. I sat on my couch, alone, in the dark for three hours crying. The closed eye visuals continued to intensify to an overwhelming extent. I forced myself to sleep. When I woke up, I felt normal again.
