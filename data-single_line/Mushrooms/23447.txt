I couldnÂ’t seem to focus on anything else but the cars. I remember thinking that if I looked too long at them, my eyes would start bleeding because they looked so sharp and pointy. I noticed Trevor was heading back towards the house so I followed. While crossing the street, the cars kept on freaking me out. A car would be about four hundred yards or so down the street, but I could hear them as if they were about to hit me. This caused me to almost shit my pants, but turned in to something that was amazing. After crossing the street I turned around and waited. I then closed my eyes and listened for a car. After hearing one and determining that it had to be pretty close, I opened my eyes and saw the car far down the street. I then watched this arrow of light float towards me in awe. It took about a minute for it to reach me but the sound never changed, even when it was right by me. It was very confusing to see a car very far away but hear it as if it were so close. I felt like I had super hearing abilities.
