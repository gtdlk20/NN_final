My mushrooms come on strong. Within twenty minutes I decide that Stalin, Lenin and I are unstuck in time. The three of us are very giggly. I remember going into fits of laughter and writhing on Stalins bed. There is intense euphoria and I assume strange, contorted postures that are somehow comfortable. I remember lying on the bed with my limbs splayed out like a broken G-I Joe. Our pupils dilate within half an hour.
