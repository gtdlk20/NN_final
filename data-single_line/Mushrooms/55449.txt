Me and my friend munched our shrooms and layed a blanket down. I layed down and listened to Infected Mushroom and similar trippy techno while the shrooms started. Since I didnt wear a watch, I dont know when they hit me, but I started to feel spaced out, then the clouds tripped me out. They looked different, and beautiful at the same time. The clouds would morph, and it would be like a kalidescope. They were thin clouds, not thick. I saw a dragon and other things in them, it was cool. This is when I knew I was coming on. I had sunglasses on, but the sky was not blue anylonger, it would turn shades of light purple too! Only later did I tell my friend, and he told me he saw the same thing, and thats what jimmy hendrix was talking about: Purple Haze!!!
