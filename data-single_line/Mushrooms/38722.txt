Margo and James layed down and became parts of the room and the bed.  I lost track of where Nick had gone.  When I 'found' Nick again there was some talk between he and Martin about Martin going over to BenÂ’s house.  Nick was worrying about Martin having to deal with their dad, who already knew something was up.  I became incredibly confused as to where Phil and Martin both were.  Where they had gone, where they were going, whether they were in the house or not.  I let it go.  Margo was completely silent, moving her hands around in front of her occasionally.  We had been listening to pleasant Indian music the entire time.  Nick and James were discussing the piece we were listening to which lasted either forty-five or sixty-three minutes. I kept thinking that the direction of lighting in the room was shifting around.  It looked like there was a swinging spotlight moving all around the ceiling and walls.  What I was seeing, however was the illusion of a disco ball; tons of lights and sparkles everywhere.
