We set off, and in just a couple of minutes found the shop I was looking for.  I went in and purchased a bag of Liberty Cap.  I had now found out that you had to slowly chew the buggers, so as we continued wandering around, I slowly munched on them.  The taste was horrible; chewing too much at once just made you wanna spew your guts up.  Despite this, I soon managed to eat the bag.  We wondered around some more, and after 20 minutes or so I started to get impatient.  The damn things were having no obvious effect.  Even the gear was starting to wear off.  I decided that getting more mushrooms was the only way to go!  Dave suggested that if I buy yet more they still might not have an effect, and I would waste even more dosh.  I didnt care, I had already spent 50 guilders ($25, £16) on the two doses I had today.  The way I saw it, if I had more they were bound to work.
