Well I go downstairs, and as I'm looking out the windows before I get to the door, it looks like war of the worlds outside (it wasn't raining/lightning or anything), I was literally seeing light everywhere and it was only 2:00am something. I ended up not going outside, I don't know if it was because fear, but I just didn't go out.
