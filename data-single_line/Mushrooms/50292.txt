I will sum the next part up as quickly as possible, but don't let this distract you from the gravity of the situation.  My friend who was also shrooming and another friend who was only slowly sipping a beer watched for the next two or so hours as I writhed on the floor of the room, assuming the fetal position whenever possible, in sheer terror and agony.  Though I wouldn't say as much to my friends, thoughts that I was dying would not leave my head.  Even the fact that my fellow shroomer was experiencing none of these problems did little to calm me.  The nausea wouldn't go away, and the initial psychadelic peak was upon me.  The combination of mind-fuck and nausea was terrifying as I was almost unable to tell the two apart.  I kept thinking over and over how thankful I was that I had done psychadelics before and was able to partially able to tell apart the two effects, but this was no consolation.
