This adventure was in early fall which is hands down the most beautiful time of the year. I've smoked pot under ten times in my life and I had done shrooms lightly about a month earlier by myself, but my friend G and I were set for this to be much more exciting. I really like the mind expanding thoughtful aspect of it and I was excited to see more visual elements in a better trip.
