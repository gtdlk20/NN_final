I turned my head slowly and saw the beautiful lights of sunsets and sunrises. I found it difficult to leave. I am not sure how long I stood there, but it may as well have been for a thousand eternities. I peered outside the door of this room on occasion and saw my living room as a paradise filled with beautiful plants. It was indeed filled with plants, but it seemed more beautiful somehow. I reluctantly turned off the light, and left realizing that this experience must end. I proceeded back to my room, and turned the light on and off. The blanket on my bed began to die and be reborn as the light changed. The light was extremely pleasant. The blanket appeared to me as a beautiful snake, but I was still able to distinguish its true form. Somewhere in between I stopped in the hall and became entranced at some family pictures. I imagined myself as a little child in a desert where I once saw preserved dinosaur footprints deep in the ground. I remembered the jacket I wore and how the wind felt. The picture beside it of my grandparents and my family made me feel many emotions that of sadness, love, and happiness.
