The next day I was a little tired and fuzzy, similarly to how I feel with an alcohol hangover. It was only when I walked to the shop to fetch some basic supplies that I realised that I was rather unsteady on my feet. Overall, however, I was in an excellent, proactive mood, feeling like something in my mindset had changed for the better. The feeling of mild physical exhaustion remained for another day, after which it disappeared entirely.
