We consumed the mush at around 8:00 and we sat on the side of the hill until about nine. I could feel of a body high coming on and we decided being at a fight on mushrooms was a very stupid idea, so we walked to a friends house nearby. On the way the body high had increased and my mind was becoming a bit blurred a dog behind a fence sounded like a vicious beast and I began to feel a bit anxious. We got to my friend ray's house and chilled out in his room for a little bit but I began to feel the drugs taking hold. The Peircings in my face began to feel strange, however I shrugged these feelings off because anything made of metal always feel weird on mushrooms. It was about 10:00 when I began to feel really sick and I decided that I had to leave rays room. I could feel the spins coming on strong and as much as I tried to relax I just was not able to keep my mind settled down. We left ray's house and I began to feel a whole lot better but I looked at brad and he did not seem to be having the best time.
