Finally!  Is seemed like forever!  Anywhere around 11:15-11:45 (time was the last thing on my mind at this point) my trip started.  First it started as an auditory ringing in my head, much like ones ears ring, but this had a deeper 'sound' to it.  After a few minutes it evolved into some sort of energy flowing through my head.  I plugged my ears, no change.  Was I perceiving AM or FM radio waves?  No, this had a much slower vibration type energy to it than a radio wave would.  The wave continued to increase in intensity.  My curiosity soared!  What is this?!  It had a feeling to it, like I was floating through the hyperspace of our universe.  My head felt extremely large compared to how my body felt.  I felt like I was all mind.  My physical self seemed so small.  It was a pleasant feeling.
