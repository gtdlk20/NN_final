We put on music that I planned to put on then we changed our mind and ended up listening to the northstar singers Christmas carols 3 times. Then I stopped for a while and looked at a poster of a girl in a bikini on my wall, it was moving and bending bigger and smaller and was tripping me out. I closed my eyes and saw brilliant colorful changing visuals and thought, I feel like a druggie but this is fuckin awesome while my bro was freaking out about the raccoon that was gunna bite him.
