I've noticed that when I do the Hawaiians, the experience is different every time.  One day it might be a moderate experience, and as I found out recently, the next day might blow me away.  I ground up the dried mushrooms into a powder using a coffee grinder, and then placed them into 5 capsules for consumption (this has been the best way to do it by far, because I get all of the plant material).
