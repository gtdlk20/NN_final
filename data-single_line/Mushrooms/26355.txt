The next day we woke up around 11:45am feeling refreshed and only marginally tired.  The world seemed so bright and beautiful despite the fog outside.  I still could not get over the beauty of the trip.  It was the most amazing experience of my life.  I swore off alcohol and fell in love with the mushroom and what it can show me about my life.  I felt my ego die and I felt my love for the world grow.  All the petty things in life no longer bothered me and I realized how we are all part of one energy, one life force and cannot be separated from it.  I wanted this experience to never end.  I look forward to being at home with the mushroom again and I hope in my heart, that the entire world could experience this experience.  It was what I would call an enlightenment experience, the essence of perfection, pure love, bliss.
