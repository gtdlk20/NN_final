As the trip was mostly over a little after 9:00 PM, we left the bedroom and went downstairs and drank a little V8 juice, then walked around the house until we started feeling better.  We were silly as I led her by the hand and we laughed about playing chuga-chuga-cho-cho and looking like we had lost it (walking in a slouched over stance, I have no idea why). By about 10:00 PM we were sitting in the two living room recliners.  My wife had a dream of flowing blood and a skull that turned to dust and started crying.  We then started talking and my wife described that and a couple of lucid dreams or visions she had years ago, that were interesting but I couldnÂ’t figure out what I should take from them as meaning.  It was pleasant to talk openly and personally for a time.  A little after midnight we went to bed and slept.
