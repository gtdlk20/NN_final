Well I ate an 1/8th of mushrooms on Saturday (3 caps, 8 medium sized stems, all completely dried). Absolutely beautiful experience. The only thing I didnt like was being around other people, as strange as that sounds. Trying to make conversation really detracts from the high of it all, at least for me. Next time, hopefully this next Friday or Saturday Ill be tripping half an 1/8th with K, and we wont try and talk so much because hell be seeing the same shit that I will.
