Like I said, this was the best experience of my life.  I didn't do much of anything that day, but the mushrooms made it unreal.  I highly recommend the eating of magic mushrooms as long as you are sure of the species and are in a safe environment.  I've done hallucenogenic mushrooms four times with no adverse effects, and I think everyone should have the right to such experimentation if they so choose.
