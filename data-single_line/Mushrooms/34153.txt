Then something funny happened.  While I was in my bathing suit showering I was just looking away from John,  watching the water hit the ground, and he said something really loud so I looked at him fast as shit, I turned my head so fast and looked directly at him right in the eye.  I know he thought 'What the fuck'.  I know it doesnÂ’t sound that funny but it was, b/c right after I did it he walked away. A couple days later when I talked to him again he was completely unaware I was high that day.  I looked in the mirror in the bathroom and my pupils were taking up my entire eye and my face was doing the wavy distorting thing.  My face was changing in structure like you can mold play dough.  I remember laughing and just saying to my self holy shit.
