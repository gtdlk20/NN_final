I had a huge appetite that morning. We all cooked breakfast together and smoked plenty of pot to ease our somewhat sore muscles and increase appetite. The pot brought back mild flashbacks and insight to the trip. I had blacked out more than I thought, and my friends described me running into the forest and having conversations with sleepy and drunk campers before they could pull me back to our fire.
