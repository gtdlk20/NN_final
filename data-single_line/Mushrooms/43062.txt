I continued debating for a long while over what I wanted to do. I continued thinking with the mentality that to understand the full potential of this drug, one should trip by themselves, which, after all this time, couldnt seem like a more foolish idea. I also wished to conceal the amount I was taking from Peter, as I knew he only had two grams he would be taking, and I wanted us both to be on the same level, so to speak. Finally, I decided it would be best for both of us if I just waited. I knew he wanted to trip, and wouldnt want to alone, so I invited him over and sat around, anxiously awaiting for what seemed like an eternity.
