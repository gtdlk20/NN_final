After that, the experience becomes *extremely* fuzzy and I can't recall much of this time, but certain parts stick out. I can't recall much of this time, but certain parts stick out. I know that I started removing articles of clothing and eventually ended up being naked for a good hour or more of the trip, using my body as a canvas to draw and paint on. I finally decided to put clothes on, as I was set on leaving my house - I had been calling random people for an hour or so trying to get some one to pick me up, since I had become well aware that I was in my parents' house tripping on mushrooms. I even talked to a friend who wanted some, too, and when I told her who the dealer was, her and her friends knew who it was and she told me if she could get in contact with him, she would pick me since she'd be around my area. I was so excited by that, and genuinely amazed at the circumstances! The one thing was that I just could not decide what to wear out.... everything seemed too tame for my state, even the brightest clothes in my closet. I layered on 3 shirts and 2 skirts and various other articles of clothing, which only somewhat went together... but still, my outfit was just not unique enough! I then decided to mix it up with paint, colored powder, and markers,  and it didn't exactly hit me that I was wearing very nice clothes - fabric was fabric to me, I might as well have been wearing a plain white t-shirt - and I probably should have been, seeing as I ended up ruining most of those clothes. With my righteous paint-markers in hand, I also began decorating my room with 'very profound' (or so I thought) sayings I kept coming up with.
