Skip to t+2:00.  Mushrooms are in full effect.  Minor visuals, body feels great, thinking is bizarre to say the least.  So I'm in a comfortable room with A and these two other people, we have been watching Family Guy for the past 2 hours.  A conversation starts, I don't remember what about.  Sex, drugs, rock and roll, the usual, I suppose, but very early on I realize that I'm not completely sure what I'm supposed to be doing.  When do I get to speak?  Have I spoken out of turn?  Am I supposed to say what I want to say, or what I think other people want to hear?
