The flavor was absolutely delicious, with none of that pretty disgusting mushroom aftertaste. The only thing about mushies I don't like. I started at 11:23 PM, and finished the last piece of choco-mush at 11:53 PM. At about 6:00 AM I was basically back to normal, although with strong lassitude that lasted the entire day.
