This is probably my 60th or 70th time eating mushrooms, yet it is probably only about my 5th time eating more than a typical 8th-ounce dose.  I plan on reducing the dose next time to an eighth and possibly building the dose back up to 5 grams.  This trip was a little too intense and I feel that I need to enhance my shamanic skills before doing another heroic dose.
