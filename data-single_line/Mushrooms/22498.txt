It wasnt exactly closed-eye visuals it was more than my visual imagination had sharpened by a factor of ten. Anything I thought of appeared behind my eyelids, vivid and psychedelically colourful. The best part was the atmosphere - a busy, excited carnival show in the background of whatever image I was conjuring. 'The carnival of the strange,' I said aloud. I believe if I'd taken another gram or so, it would have been hard to tell whether my eyes were closed or open, so strong was my imaginative imagery. Indeed whenever I opened my eyes, the external world seemed mundane. I dropped onto the bed, hallucinating behind the eyelids, thoroughly overjoyed to be happy for the first time since, well, the only decent DXM trip I ever had. I couldn't wait to peak, because things could surely only get more incredible.
