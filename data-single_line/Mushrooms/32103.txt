T+58: peed. Checked pupils, not much different than normal. I can feel the poison in my veins, though  and I really do think thats how my body treats it  as a poison. I get so fucking cold, yet sweaty at the same time. Starting to think that synthetics are the way to go for me  much less nausea. Things outside look very pretty as they wave around.
