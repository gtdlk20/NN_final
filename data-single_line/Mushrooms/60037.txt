Returning to the now crackling campfire where the rest of my friends were, I listened to the mellow rhythms of the drums and smoked another bowl as I anticipated the excitement of the night to come.  As the sun began itÂ’s beautiful sunset in the distance, I felt the first real effects of the mushrooms.  I remarked to my friends that I was feeling a little bit surreal and someone replied that in half an hour I would be very high. I started to get scared that I had perhaps eaten to many shrooms, and that I might freak out and have a bad trip, but I grounded myself and remained calm.  Then, just as the sun slipped behind the horizon, a lightning storm in the distance erupted into a frenzy of glory.  Lightning came crashing down into the ocean over by Delta.  'This is so crazy!' I remarked as we began to walk towards a log that was pointing out into the ocean.  We all walked along the log to the end and we were surrounded by water on both sides, and when I stepped onto the water, expecting to 'pull a Jesus' and surprise everyone, I found myself knee deep in the ocean.
