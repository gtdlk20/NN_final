Muse went home after a while, and I lay in bed thinking about my different lives until I fell asleep. It was rather interesting, and for a while I actually believed that these lives may have been me reliving my past lives, but Im not so sure anymore. Some of the lives didnt sync up timewise, but of course, time may be different in our different lives.
