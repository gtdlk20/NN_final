Since I am a very private person I wouldnt think of asking for advice from someone, a pastor, a counsellor, or anyone else for that matter, who had never taken LSD, and certainly not anyone who had not done so in a thoughtful manner. So I decided that the only way to gain resolution was to take the magical mystery tour again and to go deep enough to jar my paradigm.
