Taking note of our condition and topic of conversation we decided it was time to make haste away from the park with twilight taking hold. As we walked back to the house L was in his own little world M and I had sobered a bit as walking tends to do but Junebug was zoomin. He tried to describe his trip for me, what I got out of it was that for him, the world was a series of grids and diagrams, similar to blueprints and akin to the code in the Matrix movies. He would drift in and out of the grid dimension but every time he would start to speak a grid would form and intersept his sentence, making it part of the code. Now at some point L split a pole, we begged him not to but he did, almost snikering about it. Directly there after he went to see A and M, Junebug and I went on walking to a park at the end of the block.
