3:00?? I come to with one of my friends shaking me. I say I'm tripping harder than I ever have and keep asking him if he's real. As I stare into his familiar face I feel dragged back into reality for a brief moment, before it starts melting and changing. I can't deal with this and start wandering around some more. I find a large area of couches and collapse, staring off into the swirling ground in utter disbelief and awe. I feel like I'm coming down a little bit.
