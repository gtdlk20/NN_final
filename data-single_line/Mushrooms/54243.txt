I was around some people, one big guy was blaming me for killing his friend by giving him shrooms.  The other guys were very angry too.  I kept trying to say sorry and explain that I didn't intend to kill him but it was his choice to go that way.  This didn't work... the big guy came to my car and slammed his hands on the window, threatening harm to me.  I wasn't scared, but I stood up and told him if he does that again, or threatens me, I will fight back, but I don't want to.  He backed off with his friends and walked away.
