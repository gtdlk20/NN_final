I have taken mushrooms seven or eight times and right from the first time I took them I experienced the same trip, it usually happens during the visually intense comedown and each time it is always a continuation of the last trip. The first 'episode' of this trip was on my first experience with mushrooms. It was in amsterdam with some friends. We got about 12grms of mexican mushrooms each and headed to a park. This was great fun and we just walked around in circles for hours laughing our asses off. I loved it. The sunshine made rainbows around everything I looked at and all the trees and flowers seemed to be laughing with us.
