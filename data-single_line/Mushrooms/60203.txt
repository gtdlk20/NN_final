At this point, things were getting so intense, I couldn't even get a hold of myself.  Every time I looked at anyone, or my own hands and arms, the normal skin seemed to be covered with a strange membrane (kind of like a baby mouse type skin).  I could barely keep my eyes open the entire time, for everything was completely out of whack, and I couldn't make the visuals cease.  They just kept getting stronger and stronger.  My friend's kitchen floor is made up of concentric octagonal tiles and as I walked through the kitchen, each tile would be of a different height as they shot up from the ground like pillars.  I laid down back in the TV room on the carpet, with the side of my face on the ground and watched the fingers of the carpet grow as they waved like the stalks in a wheat field.  Slowly, a white smoke, like that from dry ice, floated over the carpet enveloping everything, including me.  It was kind of hard to handle such an intense feeling of...I don't even know, maybe falling too far into a trip, so I went outside.
