So eventually, I started to freeze bad, so I walked until I came to this tent that had a light on inside and I walked up to it and said, 'Hello? Can I come in and get warm? IÂ’m lost and cold.' It was a lady in her mid 30s, she unzipped the door and came out, obviously wanting to know what kind of person I was before she trusted me. 'Probably not, I don't feel comfortable doing that.' she said. She came out, and organized some things in her booth and asked me a few questions, studying my aura and then finally said, 'Yea, come on in, I got the propane heater going in there and tons of blankets, you have a place here brother.' I ducked inside and felt like I had just met my first human.
