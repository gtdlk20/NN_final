I slept like a rock on heroin for the rest of the night. I lay in bed, remembering nothing but sweet thoughts of my encounter with the clay entity, who taught me a lot about my inner self. It is so amazing how the brilliant human mind can take such a complex, purplexing message and send it from the unsconscious mind to the conscious, manifesting such a great thing into such a small representation. Let me translate: I think it was amazing how my inner/higher-self showed me my true thoughts through such a simple little hallucination.
