So, in the end, the trip ended on a positive note, and I feel that I learned a lot from this bad trip. I now have more sympathy and empathy for people suffering from depression or other conditions, having experienced it myself, and I think I'm more sensitive to people in general. I feel that a major reason that my bad trip ended on a very positive note was my preparation (reading Siddhartha and meditating, for example) and sober integration of the experience.
