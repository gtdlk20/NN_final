A few months ago I had my first experience with a psychedelic, acid. My dealer talked up this stuff, and convinced me and my girl to only take half because it was 'strait hippy acid'. We did, and let me tell you, the experience left me wanting more. I did not trip out, and ever since then I have wanted to take acid again. But alas, acid became hard to find, and shroom season was upon us. So talking with my girl we agreed to take shrooms on a Sunday afternoon and walk to a local park. After extensive research, and reading a lot of trip reports, I felt ready to submit my mind to the awesome power of the magic fungi. From the moment I bought the shrooms, a feeling of anticipation came over me, I was finally going to experience what it's like to have my mind fully altered and watch as reality slowly slips away.
