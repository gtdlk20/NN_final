After everyone refused to come with me I got really nervous, but I figured I'd just be really careful and I'd be fine. I realized I was in over my head by the time I made it to the first intersection (no more than 2 minutes down the road). I kept forgetting which way I was coming from and which way I needed to turn. I tried reading the sign, but couldn't. The patterns and colors kept getting in the way. I finally made up my mind to go a certain direction. So I continued on my journey. After about a half hour I noticed myself talking to and answering myself quite a bit. I'd be like 'Man, you're messed up! Why am I messed up? 'Cause you ate those funny shroomies and now you can't see!' Stuff like that. Anyways, by now the road is liquid form and changing all kinds of amazing colors. I only exist from the waist up, but I can still feel myself walking. Every step I take makes a *wump wump* sound. Meanwhile there's this high-pitched shreaking sound going in the background. Cars were just hovering lights, and people were just misty shadows that floated around.
