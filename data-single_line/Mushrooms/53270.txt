We returned home, and I was still unsure as to the 'who, what, when, where, why, and how' of the situation. My wife asked me some questions, but I wasn't entirely sure what she was saying, and kind of just went 'uhhhhh... uh huh..' and nodded my head. It was then that I remembered that I had written some things in my notebook, so I grabbed it, hoping that it would help jog my memory. I found that I was unable to read, and was becoming more and more certain that I was clinically braindead. I did not remember taking the mushrooms, and thought that I felt the way I did because I had recently quit smoking tobacco.
