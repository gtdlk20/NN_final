I felt it coming on very quickly...about 10-20 mins. So I lay down on the sofa and turned out the lights...silent darkness...just like Mckenna suggested. As the feeling increases I see out of the darkness a spiral descend above me. It is composed of blocks of bright primary colours. These blocks morph into faces...female...serpent like...sexual and deadly. I have seen this image every time I took acid in the past...and always felt baffled as to what this was...I still don't know. It is a recurring theme that I cannot reference to any part of my life is all I know...and it manifests during trips. It is a recurring theme that I cannot reference to any part of my life is all I know...and it manifests during trips. It was the first image I saw on my first psychedelic (acid) trip...it remains a mystery.
