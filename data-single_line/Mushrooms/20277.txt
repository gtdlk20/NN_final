I began to feel the spiritualities of different cultures and continents, and associating them with certain ideas, feelings, and other relationships. The tabla drumming was simply beautiful, with such full, rich sounds coming each time the tabla was struck. After a while (probably 30-40 min), I began to head back to my room. I had a bit of trouble finding it, as I have problems with getting slightly lost on psychedelics (not to the point of being a major problem, though). I got back to my room, spoke to my hallmates for a few minutes (they knew I was tripping), and turned on some music once I was alone. I listened to some old Santana (such as Samba Pa Ti-an amazing song), Coltrane, and other stuff. However, after maybe 40 min I began to get stuck in negative thought loops that led to complete self-loathing (but I never considered physical suicide) and hatred of the world and all other people. This was strange because (sober) I'm confident (but not overconfident, I don't think), stable, have good self-esteem, and have never suffered from depression.
