This is my second experience with mushrooms, and I will always remember it. My friend M's mushrooms finished growing and he was left with about half an ounce (dried) for his first batch. M, my other friend T and I did not have a scale, so we just ate all of them, not quite sure on how much it was. I would consider myself fairly experienced with psychoactives, I am a pot smoker and drinker. I've experimented with opium, hydrocodone, codeine, DXM, Valium, Ativan and mushrooms once before this trip (only about a 16th of an ounce though.). T and M have very little experience and we didn't think about having a sober sitter around, which was a very big mistake since we all took quite a large dose.
