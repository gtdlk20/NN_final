The code in the bible is something so profound, so life saving that it had to be encoded into the Hebrew bible.  Something so important that human would not have access to this information until The time came.  Something somewhere knew of the evils that befall human civilization.  This was the only way that the information could be made secret as to not be suppressed throughout the thousands of years of human civilization rise and fall of empires wanting to control.  This was to be the ultimate prophecy, one that could not be unlocked without the use of modern computers.
