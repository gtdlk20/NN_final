Meanwhile, the members of our trip tribe at the foot of the hill were in less than blissful states. Manny, having succumbed to hunger and broken his fast was bringing up the chicken hed wolfed down with gusto just prior to drinking the smoothie. Albus stayed by his side like a protective, loyal sentry while Jimi more or less hovered in one place, experiencing stronger auditory hallucinations than visual ones. He seemed like an animal focused entirely on listening, his ears perked up and his head jerking around at every little sound. We would later learn that Jimis keen ears picked up on something before either Wes or I had begun to climb: the sound of a flag flapping against a pole. I swear, it sounded like it was coming from the top of that hill, Jimi recounted post-trip, But I thought I was nuts. Every time I looked up, there was nothing there. And yet, unbeknownst to Jimi at the time, something did in fact turn out to be up there.
