The chair I was sitting on seemed to become increasingly uncomfortable (perhaps I'd merely forgotten how to sit) and so I stood up and staggered onto the landing where the things I saw around me continued to haunt me. I pulled my glasses out of my pocket and mangled them, and wrestled with my mobile for a brief period. Then I collapsed on the stairs and after that I can't remember much at all for the next few hours. Scattered, distant memories of my friend's mother leafing frantically through a phone book. The phrase 'That particular strain of magic mushroom'. Being offered mugs of water and only instinctively being able to drink from them.
