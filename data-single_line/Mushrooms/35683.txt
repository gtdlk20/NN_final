This time I was really interested in experimenting with the screen and trying to figure out what it is and what I can do with it.  I started walking quickly swinging my arms and taking long strides and tried to focus the swirling screen on a fixed point in front of me. I don't really look at anything instead I just look everywhere at once. When I focused the swirling image this way and placed its epicentre where I was going, it felt like I was being pulled forwards.
