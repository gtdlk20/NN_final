Once we were in bed we were both aware of the sexual side to the drug, but not to the point of being able to ignore the noise of the tent next door. As we lay there cuddling I could see patterns shifting and forming on my eyelids. I found that I could control them and make them more intricate or more random, like a bunch of lines, but not connected, or shape a pattern. As the patterns got more detailed I would start to get this amazing feeling of warmth and love and well being in my chest, when it got really strong I would release my grip on the pattern and the joy would sink back down again. It really was an incredible feeling, I have never been able to control patterns to such an extent, let alone to have the patterns effect me directly physically.
