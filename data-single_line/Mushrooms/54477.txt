-	Rejoice, for you can keep building forever!  School is out for summer and summer is actually endless.  You can go into limit, into darkness, but equally into limitlessness and light.  Into the pool, out of the pool, into the office, out of the office.  What a privilege and joy to be able to do it all and to never grow tired or bored of it Â– and when you do, you simply create a new dimension to explore.
