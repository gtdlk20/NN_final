The most amazing sensation I experienced was the lack of physical sensation I had. I knew my nose was running when I cried, but could hardly feel it. When hunger occurred, I talked about the sensation as if it were happening to someone else. I repeated things such as 'my body must be hungry' or 'apparently my nose runs a lot when I cry'. When I walked barefoot on the hard ground, it felt soft and warm. I felt release from my physical body and came to a realization that I am not my body. It was really quite a spritual awakening.
