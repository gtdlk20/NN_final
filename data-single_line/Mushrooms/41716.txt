When my friend and her boyfriend got to my house, it aroused my dogs, and my step-dad, who came to the bottom of the stairs to see  if I was going out - as I had not confirmed my plans with either of my parents - and I simply said 'I'm just going to talk to someone, I'll be right back,' and rushed out the door past him. My friend and her boyfriend had gotten out of their car and came up to my house, which made me angry, and when they asked if I was okay, I got really upset and told them we had to leave, and ran to their car, which was really a 2-person truck. We all squeezed in, with me on my friend's lap, and I began telling her how fucked up everything was, even though it wasn't really, and told them we had to leave my house immediately. They were surprised - and I was surprised, and upset, that they didn't want to stay out and party with me. They told me they'd take me for a ride though, and we ended up just cruising through my town for 15 minutes... which was exhilarating, being in a car and with new surroundings, but I was beginning to come down from my trip and was very disappointed. When I got back to my house, I had been planning on staying up all night, and since I was going on a school trip to an out-of-state art museum the next day, I was planning on eating more in the morning. By this time though, my enthusiasm was dying and I realized I had very little of my bag left, so I just fell into bed and tried to get past the horrible headache I had acquired.
