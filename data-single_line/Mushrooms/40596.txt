After I was uncovered and I gathered myself again I noticed that I felt like every opening and crack in my body was literally pouring with water. I began to rub my fingers, brush my arms, wipe my eyes, dry my nose to try and rid myself of this massive excess of moisture all over me. For the rest of my trip I just admired the fact that everything with an edge seemed to have two semi-transparent lines of color hovering next to it. Audio was reverberating to the point of muttering and seemingly small things becoming absolutely significant and noticeable.
