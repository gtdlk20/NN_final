Now something goes wrong. The CD skips. In fact, it starts repeating the words you lit, you lit, you lit. [hush now you little boy] My auditory is already distorted as it is, (try speaking aloud and allowing your voice to carry away and not be able to speak!)  so this sounds just horrible. To make it worse, I did light, I lit up a cigarette, and now I am being accused viciously. God! This could go really bad, really fast. I leave the dead zone and close the door. The mood is worsening; I switch to the relaxing music and douse the cig Things are better. But now I know I must return to that place, the place where I lit. Because there are matches out there and my family would not be pleased. Now I open the door and it flows on its hinges. The inside part is bright and varnished, as it swings open its opposite side pealing and bland is exposed. That is the side of death. I have to return to the dead land. The music The Water by Fiest, seems to be describing my situation perfectly with her voice, its almost theatrical.
