Mushrooms have made me realize that I love my friends, family, girlfriend and the world in general. It's been a few weeks since the trip and I still think about all the things that I said to my friends. I plan on taking other psychedelics soon, I'll be taking mushrooms soon, maybe try acid and I believe M is ordering some 2c-t-7. I am very excited for the world of psychedelics.
