So after a short discussion they decided they wanted to separate us and speak to us individually.  I wasnt worried, because what we were both saying was the truth.  It wasnt like we had to come with some huge and elaborate scheme that corresponded correctly, because we both knew what was to become of the equipment, and we both knew we werent going to use it.  Even though this was the case, I know my 4th amendment rights, and I wasnt going to give these agents anymore than necessary (I cant speak for my girlfriend though, I  dont know how much information she ended up giving them.  She is more easily intimidated and less experienced with cops/authority figures).  At first I thought of not speaking at all, but when it seemed that they werent going to arrest us right off the bat, I figured maybe I could push them along on there marry way and give them just enough to not become overly pissed off, or get there egos involved, and then arrest us on some bullshit technicality that would easily turn over in court (but still it would be quite a hassle).  I fucking hate that intimidation factor these Nazi thugs hold over you.  Justice is anything but just, I SWEAR TO PAN THE FUCKING GOAT GOD!!!
