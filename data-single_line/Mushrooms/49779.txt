By this time N thought everything was kinda greenish. I look into our coca cola bottle that was standing on the floor and saw something very interesting. It looked like little stars/patterns that were pulsating inside the bottle. I find this very cool and I ask the others to look too. It all ends with me and N looking into the bottle laughing. We think we see a transparent metal (is there even any transparent metals?) in the bottle. Anyways, it was a hilarious sight - 2 people looking into a coca cola bottle and laughing like mad!
