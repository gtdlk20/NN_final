This perspective unlike the others was a sporadic experience most powerfully occurring during my comment of How much longerits sohard., and the love Mother had for me. The suffering I seemed to indicate to Mother was simultaneously Mother indicating Her  suffering to me. This is a perspective where I am not sure if it was Her or my Inner Self, despite that its technically both.
