I am a 28 year old female, I love mushrooms and have done them about 8-10 times over the past 5 years or so, and my boyfriend J really wanted to try them, since he had only used acid and never had tried 'shrooms.  Something told me to ask the guy (when conversations about drugs came up) if he could get them.  Right as I was about to ask, he said to me, 'do you like mushrooms'?  I said 'that is so weird, I was just about to ask you that!'  I went on to tell him I've tried on and off for years to get them, b/c besides my prescriptions, they are the only drug I will do anymore.
