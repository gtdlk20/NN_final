Quetzalcoatl then reappeared, he morphed my room and I was left to explore what was left of my heavily voided room. The walls had split, the windows had turned to mirrors that were flapping on the wall, and the door was missing a door knob. I came to the conclusion that I was a spirit, and was left to haunt my very own room. My vision changed from color prisms, into a dark noir type of view. Everything was black and white. This thought of a permanent haunting was very dramatic for me to take, but I did not fret too much. I basically acknowledged that I was dead and this is where a spirit goes.
