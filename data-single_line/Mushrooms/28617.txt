I go cursing into the bedroom because of how upset I am.  It feels like I'm in the middle of the fucking matrix and I'm about to find out what the real world really looks like, and from what I'm seeing so far, it doesn't look like anything even remotely earthlike.  I don't have any clear pictures, just brief images of space and maybe glowing colors.  I'm actually scared of something for one of the first times in ages as well.  My wife wakes up terrorized at this point, but luckily for me she's a pretty patient woman with me and my experiments with mind altering substances.  I go over to her telling her about how my life is over and how I have to move on.  She tells me No!  fiercely a few times and makes me slow down and explain what was going on.  At this point she just kind of melted my heart even more, and I told myself that I wasn't sure if I cared if this was an illusion.  What would the harm be if I just finished living out my illusionary life and then moving on if I really enjoyed it.  Not only that, if this world was an illusion, then it meant that I could be really and truly happy because I knew it was just for fun.  Entertainment.
