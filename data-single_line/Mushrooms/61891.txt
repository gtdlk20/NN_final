After this I had to work in the morning so I had to go. I went home and I tripped out on the computer and it was changing screens on me and I thought it was going to explode. I looked out the window and there was a black cat, but I saw this black cat get glowing red eyes and his ears turned into horns.I yelled o my god it is the devil cat. Good thing my parents were sleeping. I than went and played the ned 'Golden eye- agent under fire' and I felt like I was actually in the game I was lookin around and looking for enemies.
