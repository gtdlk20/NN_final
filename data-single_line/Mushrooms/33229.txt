I acknowledge that with a sunny day  some open spaces  a better stomach and some experienced buddy around things might have been a lot better. But good for what?  I dont know. I didnt get perfect set, setting and pre-journey diet to guarantee a good journey. But I did spend a whole stack of money growing them. I dont reckon that species (Panaelolus Ban Lamai) agreed with me. Frequent trips to the toilet show me that that species and that tea do not agree with my system. Happy to get out the other end with my every day consciousness. I accept my everyday consciousness as more enlightening and rewarding, than the mushroom state.
