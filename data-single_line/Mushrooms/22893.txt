At this point in the night it must have been ten degrees above freezing and I was wearing a dress shirt, a flimsy jacket, and a scarf. I was ill-prepared to spend the night out in the elements but I kept pushing myself to be out there and to walk further. Why? The pain reaffirmed my existence. Since childhood, and even more so since I gave up on my dreams, I've had a nagging belief in the back of my mind that my life is less valuable because of the privilege I enjoy. I've never had to trek across the globe to destroy a ring in the fires of a volcano. I've never gone to a deserted mountain cave to meditate for forty days and nights. My life was superficial and I was soft compared to the heroes of my youth. Pushing myself to my physical limits and subjecting myself to pain were my ways of proving that I matter. That I'm not just some pompous dandy. Even though it hurts, I feel so strong when I force myself to bear the agony of physicality. Perhaps this also ties in to why I constantly cause myself emotional pain by interpreting other's actions as rejection. Pain is my validation.
