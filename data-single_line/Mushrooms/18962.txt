The parties are natives of Oxford County, Maine, where the event occurred. Their real names are withheld, by request. The effects experienced are in some respects similar to those caused by hashish; others are like those experienced by some opium smokers, especially the multiplication of objects and their bright colors.

The loss of the power of estimating time and distance, as in some dreams, is interesting, as existing when other faculties were active.
