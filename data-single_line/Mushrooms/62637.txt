On my 17th birthday I went to my good friends house and he delivered on his promise and had some mushrooms for me as a gift(as well as for a friend of his, whos birthday was close to mine and he had the same deal). I was curious about them since pot was starting to be the same-old same-old and mushrooms were a distinctly new, natural psychedelic.
