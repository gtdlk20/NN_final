We set apart the ones we wanted to eat right away, and put the rest on a cookie sheet to oven-dry.  After attending to the oven, I poured a glass of red wine for D and filled one for myself, and we drank to a good trip.  We had about 5 shrooms each from the larger ones we had picked, and put Dead Can Dance on the stereo.  D is a musician himself and we discussed music for about 40 minutes until the effects began to catch up with us.
