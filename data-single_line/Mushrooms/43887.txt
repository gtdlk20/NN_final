When we inevitably arrived back at the car it was probably only like 6pm at that point. Meaning we were only like 2 hours into our trip, I was still very high when we got in the car but I had evened out a bit at this point. Like I knew I had already peaked so I was thinking 'I'm still disoriented but I can handle this.' We didn't have much to do so I entertained myself with the radio, filming myself on my phone and conversing with my friends. When  we were in the car my mood got lifted and I had frequent laughing fits over the dumbest things. I was enjoying myself more at this point but it was kind of claustrophobic in my little car but at least it was warm and not wet.
