We felt excited at the park entrance, feeling a rush of blood in the fingertips and lips and traces of visual distortion coming on as threshold indicators that we were soon to be immersed in a powerful encounter with the Sacred.  After driving around to park in an out of the way location, we began the hike.  I felt a touch drunk as we entered a wooded area and crossed over the train tracks that wrap around the base of the mountain, and which provide tourists a wild-west shoot-out show.  Within a very brief time we entered the hidden pathway up the back-side to our intended destination.
