I have few memories after that.  I remember we made our way back to the grocery store, and spent some time sitting at the edge of that parking lot.  I watched  a womans head turn into that of some sort of dog, and had to very forcibly, physically push it back into a human-shape with my ethereal hands.  My sister vanished for a while, leaving me alone with my skater shoes, which kept me close company for a while.  The voices of the universe were all speaking to me at once, flying in and out of my head in a great, black expanse of universe.  The parking lot spread out before me as great, calm, misty sea.  I was an old Chinese wise man who sat on the rocky shores of this sea, on an island that was half green, mossy cliff, and half smoke and steam.  People rowed their boats out to me for advice all the time.  As a matter of fact, someone was coming right then, I could see them, but what the hell was I going to tell them?  I couldnt make out the voices of the universe as they were all talking at once!  Id really done it, I must have taken some sort of drug, Id really destroyed my capacities as an oracle.
