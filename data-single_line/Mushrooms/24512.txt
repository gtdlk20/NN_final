I rush to the basement with a smirk on my face and I crash to the floor besides a couple of my friends. Probably some of the ones I enjoy doing shrooms with the most. We sit, listening to Pink Floyd. I lay down catch my breath and hall out a pack of matches, every now and again someone would light a match or flick a lighter for some affect. I lit acouple and just studied the flame to such a extent, from the scrapping off the flint on the side, to the chemicals reacting to cause a flame to the burnigng, the smoke, the demise of the flame, and nothing left but a chared skinny stick. It amazed me. Made me think of all the things mankind has created and discovered, as well as destroyed and totally ignored/shruged off.
