No fear in this drug, there's no time to fear.  While I was gone supposedly I said the word 'love'.  It was about time.  My throat felt a bit scratchy and for an hour I ran around outside flapping my arms in absolute happiness and fulfillment.  Got a wave of nausea and puked though.  Well worth it.
