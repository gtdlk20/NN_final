I took a piss and flushed the toilet, after which I decided to take a look in the mirror. My face was fluid, and it seemed to drip into the sink below. I touched it, and it felt like a viscous, oily substance that could get very messy. My long hair danced around my neck, slipping and sliding all over my head. Colors also seemed to dance around my body. These must have been the symbolization that I was on mushrooms and not any other object or person I was in contact with.
