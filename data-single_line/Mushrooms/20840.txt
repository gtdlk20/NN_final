I was lying in a bed in some hospital surrounded by friends and family. There was a doctor and a nurse or another doctor. I was hooked up to all sorts of stabilizing medical equipment. Everything was fuzzy and glowing. I could never make out faces or distinct details. Everyone greeted me with such joy and enthusiasm and proceeded to talk to me all at once. My mother was to my immediate right. There was a group in the middle of the crowd in front of my hospital bed. Those were my close friends. To my far left was what I perceived as father. They told me I was in a coma for a great many years. They had developed a drug which allowed me to come out of the coma for a brief period of time. The doctor said that this drug had been used before but I would not remember the last time I was able to speak to my friends and family. I was told that I would not remember after this time as well. I of course proceeded to enjoy and savor every minute. There were some details told to me about my sickness and the condition in which it left me. How I was living another life in my mind that wasnt real and I could only wake up for a short time in the real world. However, I half acknowledged this during the experience because I knew this was a simple representation that allowed my mind to understand but knowing that I wasnt really a patient and that all that was being shown and said was synonymous with my real experience. It was a quasi-real illusion.
