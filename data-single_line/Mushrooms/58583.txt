I realize I have to piss and go upstairs to use the bathroom. I turn on the light and I see star patterning everywhere every bathroom ficture changing colors vibrently, and the walls are just heavily breathing. I look at the mirror and basically feel as if I'm in another dimension. The bathroom is not a bathroom anymore, it's a box and I have control. I can almost feel like I have the power to turn the whole 'box' and it's just an amazing experience. My face when looking in the mirror is morphing into uncontrollably and rediculously odd images, stretching into positions I've never thought possible to see on really any drug. I observe myself more in the mirror and notice that my reflection is doing things that I am not doing, as if it were another person, I enjoy this very much and find it amusing as well.
