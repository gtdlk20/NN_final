I asked for a glass of water. Previously I had refused to go to the kitchen because the fridge did a wonderful humming noise. I said that if I ever get to the kitchen I honestly never may come out because I'll stay there forever to listen to the good vibrations. Then she brought me water. As I started to drink I couldn't.
