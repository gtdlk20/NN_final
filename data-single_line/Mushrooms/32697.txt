I talked to her for a bit longer, said my goodbyes, and she wished me luck, and went back to my room. I had bought some incense at the same place I bought my bong, and decided now would be a good time to light them, as I was tripping quite hard. Everything had the three base colors surronding them. Like the kind you can see if you look really really close into the tv. Everything reminded me of a mushroom, and I could see a mushroom in almost anything. It seriously felt like I was in some kind of alternate demension, and that the shrooms had brought me there. The walls had stopped breathing, but they were just sleeping. Don't ask me how I know that, I just knew.
