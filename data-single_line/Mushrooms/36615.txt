Behind the music, there is a story. A long story. To sum it up, ICP preaches that when you die, your soul will arrive at a carnival. The Dark Carnival. This Carnival wil judge your soul. If you were a good person, you will go to Shangri La, aka Heaven, but, if you were a bad person (usually depicted in thier songs as a bigot or an asshole), you get sent to Hell's Pit. This story has been told through 6 CDs, the 6 faces of this Dark Carnival, the Jokers Cards. It has taken ten years for the last of these CDs to come out. The last being 'The Wraith: Shangri La', and even though I was not a Juggalo, I was constantly surround by ICP because of my boyfriend, so I too was awaiting the release of this final CD. And finally, it came.
