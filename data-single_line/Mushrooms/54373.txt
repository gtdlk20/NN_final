I can see incredible potential for psychedelic use from micro dosing to mega dosing and the knowledge gained thereby to attack depression and redefine the human condition.  We can find new paradigms, new ways of being, as human beings, within society and through culture.  Integrated being, embracing logic and intuition, meaning and the Void all at once.  As psychonauts we venture into territories where solutions are offered and where confrontation with core truths is the name of the game.  If any community can offer true solutions and new ways of being in todayÂ’s depression-prone world, it is the psychedelic community.
