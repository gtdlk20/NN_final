N, J and L had no problem taking their doses, but C wasn't that keen and only had about half as much as the rest of us. I'm allergic to nuts and the psychological connotation of the nutty taste of the truffles was making me feel a bit ill, and I wound up vomiting some of them back up onto the carpet. Not to waste my money though, I continued and wolfed the remainder of my dose down on a piece of dry bread which improved the taste exponentially.
