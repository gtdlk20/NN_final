Three MASSIVE golden pyramids made of perfectly cut brick, the largest in the front the two others at either side and to the back in the distance.  They were twinkling so beautifully it really was breathtaking.  They were all twinkling upward to the sky and the point of view scaled the pyramids to a smoky sky that was red and pearl towards the edges from the centered sun. Then I heard the voice (of course there just haaad to be a f***ing voice talking to me DAMNIT!!)  The told me about heaven and hell which basically summed up the point that, with respect to our lives, you get what you get then you die and get to experience what nothing is.  Then the voice explained to me that I must save others by showing them the glory and the healing powers of art (art in general).  Then I made very fast other prophets connections in example moses.  I felt like moses maybe felt when he heard the voice of god.  Yea whatever I bet his was much better but whatever this was how I felt.
