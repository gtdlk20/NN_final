Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. A little nausea in the beginning, and a little at the end, but ultimately negligible. I think that I chose a perfect does for a first experience; it wasnt traumatic so as to turn me off to doing it again, but it showed me the kids of things I can expect from a mid-level trip, Id say. The next time I think Ill shoot for three grams or maybe just a whole eighth, and a warmer season. I also found myself laughing a lot, especially in the first two to three hours. I enjoyed that thoroughly; I simply dont get that from marijuana anymore
