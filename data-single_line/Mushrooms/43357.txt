For a while I had gotten quite scared of where I was. I kept thinking how I was going to get home and how everything was going to work. I kept telling myself to trust my past self, who was sober, because he had laid this whole plan out and knew it was going to work. I debated this inside my head for about an hour when I noticed only 5 minutes had passed on my watch.
