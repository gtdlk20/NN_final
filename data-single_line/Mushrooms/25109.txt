Lucky for me this was just a really powerful hallucination but I was completely unaware of that at the time. I screamed 'They are coming!' and it seemed that everyone in the room was muted and all I could hear was the most frightening sounds of my life. It was E puking in the restroom. I ran to the restroom since I thought he was dying and he was my closest friend there. When I saw him he said 'Dude I am fucking dying.' I freaked. This was too much the vomit in the toliet sent bad images running through my mind I was so scared I ran back to the window and blacked out.
