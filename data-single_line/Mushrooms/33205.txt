The drug itself gave a sense of another presence or of others observing me while I observed myself. I interpreted this as I would interpret the effect of someone else's moods and chemistry on my own. The drug itself from the moment it kicked in, was effectively a strong presence directly fucking with my head (which is of course what some people also do).
