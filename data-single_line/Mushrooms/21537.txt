I tried 2 experiences of low dose (between 1.5 and 2.2g of cubes) and they did let me get a bit more emotional with the classical music.  At one point, in the end of a trip- I felt this frustration and sadness build up (without the anxiety that seems to block us out of the root) and started crying that I couldn't take it anymore!  I was angry about these feelings weighing me down in life.  Then an amazing vision popped up!  I have been carrying this baggage, tools that I no longer needed for my journey (like a mountain climber) and it was time to cut these tools loose and respect that they have got me this far.  Wow, what an amazing feeling- the frustration and depressive sadness was replaced with that feeling you get- a grieving of losing a friend- those things that I have held close through my childhood and teens I suppose.
