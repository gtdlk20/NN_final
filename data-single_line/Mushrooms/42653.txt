After a few years of processing the envy experience I am ready to share it. Before any of this happened, I was a different person, I didnt really believe in God, and I felt that I was going nowhere I my life and I had no self-confidence, to me life had no point, it was only - birth, school, work, death. However, along my way in life I started experimenting with psychedelics, this is where it all started to change, from peyote to LSD then mushrooms and DMT the color was coming back into my life, life started to have meaning. I began growing mushrooms for 2 years taking up to 14 dried grams which was still not as intense as this strain of mushrooms, 5 grams felt like what could have been 25 grams of cubensis, this experience with penis envy changed my life forever. I am grateful for this experience happening and I am glad to be able to be alive and conscious. Now this isnt the full story because what happened on this day can really only be experienced, words only go so far to describe this experience, it was ineffable, and sublime. During the course of this night I lived an eternity in 8 hours.
