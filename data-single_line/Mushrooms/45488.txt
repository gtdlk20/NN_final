We meet up with the dealer and he tells us he needs a ride to his house to get the mushrooms. We give him a ride and he was very thankful so he gave us 15 grams for 40 dollars. The usual price for a half ounce around my area would be about 65-75 dollars. I assumed the mushrooms wouldn't be too great considering how much he gave us for so cheap. I was very wrong.
