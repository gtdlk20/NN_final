I sailed through the air on a cushion, hitting the water only feet away from the guy who went before me.  I stayed under for a second longer, going a little deeper and letting myself float in the muffled, chilling aqua.  I swam into the middle of the river, out of the shadows of the shore, and let myself sink down.  It got colder and darker, but a meter or so down everything became a wavey, deep cyan.  I felt like a womb, only so much colder.  I felt like I was protected completely and exclusively down here, only the sound of the rushing river around me.  I was perfectly isolated.  I could feel the heat of the sparkling sunlight, even though the water around me was only 65 degrees.
