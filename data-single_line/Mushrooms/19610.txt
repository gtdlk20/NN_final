Like a sudden revelation I see an @ of an internet café then I understand where I am. We go straight ahead looking for the 'zocalo', the main square. But we step into another square like in a De Chirico painting blue arches like a surreal world (it was no vision, it existed). I'm disorientated, then I start following her since she seems to be more aware of things. While in the centre of the 'zocalo' she cries: I'm not here! I laugh Sure! It's always been like this, but you didn't know it!!! It's my reply.
