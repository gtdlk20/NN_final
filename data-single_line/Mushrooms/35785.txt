The night came, Y & Z showed up on our doorstep semi-stoned and smiling.  My fears were immediately relaxed, Y looked happy and psyched, though maybe a little unserious.  As she walked in she told me they had already eaten a little and were feeling some minor effects.  I remember Y exclaiming a quiet 'Woah' as she walked into my sister's room.  As I was completely sober at the time, I could not imagine what the room looked like on shrooms.  As we sat down, Z cracked open a big plastic bag with a few rather large caps and many, many stems inside.  He took the caps for himself and my sister, which pissed me off.  Y and myself were left with the remainder, of which I got the lion's share, and in the end it was definately sufficient.
