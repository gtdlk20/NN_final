T+11:00: After the movie, we watch a little TV, and I start to not be so mad at S, (I had gotten frustrated with her lack of affection for me) and fell asleep on the couch. Actually sleep signalled to me that was definetly back to baseline. I slept roughly half and hour, and then drove home, dropping off S. I got home and slept for a few hours, got up, and wrote this.
