About halfway back along the trail, we realised we were in Vietnam and being hunted by US troops and Vietcong, as we were just a couple of tripping guys that had suddenly been transported to the middle of a warzone. We grasped our skateboards as weapons and carried on up the trail, careful to avoid punji stake pits and grenade trip wires. As we neared the end of our journey we received a phone call from some mates who were not tripping, but had a bunch of shrooms and wanted us to come round and give them the few we had.
