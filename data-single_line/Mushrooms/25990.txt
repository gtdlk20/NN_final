My trip turned bad whilst I was outside. It rapidly became apparent that I was going to be well fucked. I wasnt yet fully under the influence of the Stones, but the whole experience was becoming too intense, and I was loosing control of my mind, I was also loosing happiness fast. I think if I had taken action I might have been able to prevent this bad part of the trip, but by this time I was too overwhelmed to do much. I think the main thing that triggered the bad trip was becoming unhappy and scared. I now really appreciate that psychedelics must be used with great care if you are in any way not a happy, confident person.
