The hallucinations did not intensify in the same way that LSD does as you begin to peak, and the side effects were much less severe. I felt relaxed, comfortable, and mellow. I sensed that the mushroom was alive and with me, but I felt detached from the world and everything but my consciousness. Everything seemed unreal and unimportant. It was at about this point that our friend suggested we try some Nitrous.
