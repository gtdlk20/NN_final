I used to take magic mushrooms for fun with friends once or twice a year when I was younger. I had a few 'bad trips' in those days, I didn't know the history of psychedelics, or understand the sacredness of these substances. The last time I'd taken a small amount of mushrooms was 2 years ago, and I cried through the entire trip.
