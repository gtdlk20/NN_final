Then I noticed that everything in my room, and everything in the universe for that matter, was disproportionate to the space around it.  I looked at the door to my room, and though at first glance it seemed to be the same shape and size as it was originally, it began to change in shape and size relative to the wall it was on.  And what small space was between its hinges seemed to stretch off into eternity.  In fact, when I closed my eyes, everything I touched seemed to stretch off into eternity, my bed, my pillow, and myself.  Everything, every miniscule point in space had its own micro-landscape, its own domain, teeming with an energy and life-force all it's own.
