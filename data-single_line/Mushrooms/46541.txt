I think someone had put on The Sounds, and I was thinking that I really didn't want to listen to The Sounds but for some reason felt glued to the floor.  Although I was right next to everyone, I was looking away from them all and felt a little bit isolated so I finally stood up to change positions.  It was funny because as I stood there everyone was looking right at me, and I felt about 10 feet tall and all of their faces looked like little bunny-rabbit villager people (which is the only way I can think to explain it) and I was their leader.  I made a funny 'whoah!' sound, somehow changed the music to Enigma (it was rather difficult to operate my iPod, it had somehow turned a brilliant blue-green and all the artists were jumping away from me as I scrolled), then went and sat down next to my buddy Luke.
