Then, out of nowhere, my guide stood up, took off his clothes, screamed 'Nothing matters!!' and split the scene. I was alone on the golf course. At first I almost followed him, but something in me told me not to. I wandered around the course, whispering words of encouragement and thanks to my body that I could barely feel in my state of pure bliss. I suddenly realized that there was probably a hungry coyote stalking me like I was a deer, and that was ok because that was what he did, and walking around was what I did, and as long as we did our things no matter what happened it would be all fine.
