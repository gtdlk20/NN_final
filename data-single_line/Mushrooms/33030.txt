I remember looking in the house and seeing the kitchen, I saw some roast beef out that I was going to use earlier that day with a sandwich, I could actually taste the roast beef from the backyard, only the taste wasn't coming from my mouth but from my head. It made me hungry but when I got closer to the kitchen it seemed as though I was going somewhere else. Some wall or object would change every step I took, the doors to every room breathed like they were alive, at the time I was thinking maybe the doors were alive, the walls gave off lines that crossed eachother like scratch paper, and when I got really close to the walls I could actually see little bugs or something moving on them, they were extremely small, about half the size of an ant, but soon after I lost my fascination.
