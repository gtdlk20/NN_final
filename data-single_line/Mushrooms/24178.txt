But whod have thought Hell is an Amalgam of Gilliamesque lights, theatric almost, and symbolic Dantean tortures? The fire is everywhere, you live here now, a carnival of immolation, a festival of flames, those old hit the Negro games at fairs you know? Those last vestiges of real overt racism in the 30s? Well come on it was overt past then granted, but its like that, humiliating and wrong. Flashes of Christian frescoes, statues, psalms but you were so sure it was so illogical. The screaming!!! Screaming misery. Misery loves company does it? Misery loves nothing. Pure misery is misery alone.
