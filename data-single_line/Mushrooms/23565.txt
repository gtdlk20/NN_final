As I turned away from the warmth of the fire and headed back towards the campground, cutting through the festival grounds on the way, it began to rain.  It was as though, at the very moment the first drop hit me, I was transported utterly into a different world.  As the first drops of rain hit my face, the joy I had felt earlier surged to new heights, and I laughed in the most carefree way.  No-one was around, so why not enjoy the moment?  The rain felt SO good!  I sank to my knees in the soft earth, and lifted my head and palms to the sky.  It opened up and let a flood of rain down on me, and I soaked it up.  I felt utterly refreshed, cleansed, new, and filled with joy.  I shook out my hair, which was getting drenched, and stood back up.  Suddenly, what had seemed like a dreary, chilly, sad night seemed brimming with possibilities and beauty.
