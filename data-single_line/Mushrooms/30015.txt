At first I felt some minor dizzyness, probably as much from tiredness as from the mushrooms.  I was walking easily, enjoying the feeling of floating and numbness in my legs.  Every minute or so a car would cruise past on the highway a mile away and these sounds only added to my feeling of peace and seclusion.
