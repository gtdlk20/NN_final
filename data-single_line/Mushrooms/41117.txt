I feel my mothers dementia. Can I touch the words. I begin to understand dementia. I see it from the inside. Will I become trapped in the forever of now? I can feel the darkness lurking.  I speak the words  Julian Assange. For he is incarcerated by the malevolent forces in the real world. The message is the word. Truth does not always set your free. Truth can plunge you into darkness. Lisa tells me it's better not to think of him at the moment.
