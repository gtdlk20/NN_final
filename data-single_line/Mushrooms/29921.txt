We arrived at the desert compound on our chosen Saturday to find a quirky space - private and isolated behind no less than three gates, the rich green grounds peppered with tree houses, fountains, and Greco-Roman statuettes. The delightfully like-minded owner gave us a tour of the property, adding that she grows weed on it before bidding us, a blessed stay.  The next few hours were spent stocking the fridge, unpacking and exploring. At around 5pm, we threw bananas, strawberries, cinnamon, cayenne, avocado, apple, ginger, turmeric, mint, and almond milk into a blender. Oh, and of course, the shrooms! A lot of ingredients, yes, but we were starving; breakfast had consisted of a single bagel followed by juice for lunch, per Terence McKennas recommendation to fast. After drinking the elixir, we jumped into the van.
