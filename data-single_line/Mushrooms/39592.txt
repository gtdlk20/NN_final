NOTE:  In retrospect this probably wasn't the most intelegent thing to do, considering we were an hour from anything resembling a hospital and I didn't have a manual on me.  However, as noted above, I did my homework and BLG is easily identifable and has no deadly look a likes.  (at least in the eastern US)
