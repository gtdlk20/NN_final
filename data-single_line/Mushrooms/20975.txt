That landed me with a kind of responsibility that isn't healthy for a little kid. My way of reassuring myself on that level --- a level that I seldom talk about, and it feels extremely strange to be typing about it for strangers --- was to ask myself whether I wanted to be playing the universe game. I always did. (The "I" I'm talking about here was neither my human bodymind nor my ego, though my ego soon latched on to the idea that I was basically god and no one else was, and built itself around that.) On the deepest level that I had access to, I was a being who chose being over non-being, even in the darkest moments, and there were some very dark ones. It was both a choice and not a choice, because if I chose non-being, the whole universe could reasonably be expected to disappear. That looks absurd when I type it. Just try to suspend disbelief, okay? That was my reality for several years. As I start typing about the loneliness of having no other conscious being to describe my experience to, the possibility that some conscious being out there will get what I'm writing about makes the writing not make sense.
