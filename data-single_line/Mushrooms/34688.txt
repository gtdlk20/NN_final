We kept on this way for a while, until R said we should go upstairs. I was adamant; the vehement opposition I proclaimed was fascinating to B and C. I was saying things like 'The stairs are bad, and scary.' and C would say 'I'll help you up the stairs' and I tried to tell him that it was the concept of stairs that I was so opposed to, but he didn't get it. We did end up going up the stairs, which led to us going to the park. On the way, a car past and I hid behind a mailbox because I was afraid of the lights. The trees at the park were insane, they were like the Nightmare Before Christmas or something. There were pumpkins everywhere, and dragons, and I kept trying to chew things. I was like a little kid. The path we walked down was curved normally, but on mushrooms it twisted upside down and around and it went through itself. The regular street looked normal, but everything else was incredibly trippy.
