T+3.5hrs I have for the most part been enjoying the experience, and have become completly used to the green color, which remains through the trip until I leave the house. I have been talking and still chilling in the room, and the trip has been better than usual so far. I find that my skin feels very different, almost rubbery from time to time. My temperature fucks around for awhile at this point, and I begin to get the chills and shivers all over, while also feeling as tho I am sweating profusely, which as my friends tell me, I'm not.
