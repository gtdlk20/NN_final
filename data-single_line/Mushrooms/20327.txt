I played with my shadow for half an hour and then proceeded to swim through the darkness and roll around on the floor through fractals and spirals of color.  We put on some Pink Floyd and I sat in the corner and contemplated my existence.  I thought about how beautiful all of my friends were on the inside and how much I loved my family.  I felt the plants and trees outside connecting to me and I could feel the life force of the planet.  I balanced upside down in the 'tripod' position and laughed hysterically, bathing in mushroom ecstacy.  I made patterns in the darkness with my lighter and watched the afterglow patterns morph and sink into the ground.  We turned the lights on and it was like a pulsating star exploded within my vision, sending bright patterns of light everywhere.
