Then I hear my dad turn on the stupid TV in the living room.  Out of all things to turn it to he turns it to cartoons.  'Boingy, boingy, boingy,' I hear that cartoon bouncing noise.  At the same time I was hearing the boingy noises, it was doing something to me, like my subconscious was now conscious and I felt the full effect of the sound (there are lots of subliminal sounds on cartoons, its a marketing technique).  I saw cartoon looking entities bouncing all over the place!  There were like 8 of them.  The cartoon sounds were extremely obnoxious and interfering with my trip.  This went on for about 10 minutes, and then it stopped.  Finally!  He turned off the cartoons and went to bed!
