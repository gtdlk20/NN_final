I looked back into the common therapeutic dosages back in the early research years of the 1950s and early 60s.  I also looked into the modern research dosages, particularly those used in the Johns Hopkins cancer/anxiety research. In this latter research, in addition to the control groups given a placebo, there were two levels of therapeutic dosage - 20mg and 30mg pure psilocybin. I read that statistically significant benefits were reached at both dosages, however (perhaps obviously), more benefit was realized with the higher dose, but also slightly more negative side effects. I therefore aimed for this high medicinal dosage equivalent. (If I had never done mushrooms before I may have opted for a somewhat lesser dosage.)
