 After what seemed like an eternity of the most intense experience of my life, I finally calmed down enough to talk to S and see how he was doing. He calmed down at the same time as me (I dont think his peak was quite as bad) and we decided to get something to drink. Before we went we started laughing hysterically at what just happened to us, and we both felt great to know we were returning back to normal. We went downstairs where my grandma was, and into the kitchen. She came in and I tried to hide my face from her by looking busy with my hoodie, trying to zip it up. But I was struggling immensely. What are you doing? she asked me. Nothing just, er, fumbling with this, I said extremely nervous.
