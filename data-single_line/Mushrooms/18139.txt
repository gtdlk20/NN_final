The trip started out fine:  we were lucky to get a campsite at all, considering the high demand of any campsites in the Santa Barbara area during the annual Fiesta Week.  We had put ourselves on the waiting list the previous day and were incredibly excited to get one of the few remaining camp spots.  We set up our tent and had good music ready for our post-mush return. A single backpack full of essentials was all that was brought with us on our trip; it contained peanut butter, spoon, pipe case, metal joint-holding tin, a lighter, the mushrooms of course, and my friend MattÂ‘s 1969 steel Nikon camera.
