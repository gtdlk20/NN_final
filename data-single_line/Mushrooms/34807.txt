T+5:45 - S just dropped me off at my house and it's 9:50pm. The effects are now greatly depleted. Visuals are not noticable except a little bit of an aura still around the lights, might be just cause I'm very tired tonight. Auditory effects are completely gone for all I can tell. I think there still is some effect on my mood though, I am still quite emotional. I sat at my computer on the internet for awhile before going to bed.
