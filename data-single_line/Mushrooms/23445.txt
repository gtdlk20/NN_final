11:20 p.m. For some reason, Trevor and I just had to get out of the house. We decided to go on a bike ride. Pulling the bikes out of the garage, I ascended once more. Not only was my vision tripping me out, now I was losing my mind. I thought that if we went on this bike ride we would surely get lost. I was so scared, but it was the ride of my life. Flying down the street I could barely see anything. My vision was so distorted that everything was a circling blackish blob to me, until I saw a car. This was by far the most amazing part of my trip. When I watched a car go by, it was unlike anything I have ever dreamed before. They looked like razor sharp pieces of light just gliding down the street. It was actually very intimidating. I had to constantly promise myself that it was only a car.
