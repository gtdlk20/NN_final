Here's the doozy.  The 3.8 liter bubbling gravity bong we fondly dubbed as 'Grav' (how creative).  When fully loaded with a healthy, heaping mound of spores, Grav could easily fell an average Pro Wrestler.  We had to resort to 'halfsies.'  However painful the coughing fits, however grody the taste left in my mouth, this method is entirely worth it.  While the glass pipe and acrylic bong gave a mild, cerebral high, not unlike coming up onto a mushroom trip, Grav kicked me into something like the subsiding of a full-on trip.
