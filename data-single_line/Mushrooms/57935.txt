5:00 pm: Bundled up and took a walk. Put headphones in and put on Innerspeaker by Tame Impala. Was able to process the experience and look at it in a more positive light. Felt the incredible feeling of control returning. Roommate met with me for a time and was the first person I was able to verbalize that I was feeling okay and coming to terms with the experience to. It was good to say it out loud and get it out of my head. Helped me solidify my feeling on the experience a little bit.
