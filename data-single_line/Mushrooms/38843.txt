I thought it was very strange that when I closed my eyes it was perfectly still and concentrated. It wasn't visual but more like being there and here at the same time. Being part of the network, feeling like a mushroom and experiencing the room and the situation, communicating with the entity, wondering about things, seeing visual delight. Asking myself about situations in my life, no answer, nothing to be said, everything was ok, no worry at all. This was a very nice entity, entirely different from the cubensis entity I experienced. With cubensis I always had a ambigious feeling, very serious and somewhat hostile in a way. With the cyanescens there was only trust and warmth.
