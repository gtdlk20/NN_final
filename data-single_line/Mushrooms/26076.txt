The effects reminded me strongly of a very serious previous trip I had. In January I had experienced my first ego death. I ate 60 grams of fresh shrooms in my room by myself, turned the lights off and listened to Ravel's Bolero and... Well... I became the universe and similar ego death clich√©'s :). I remember it as an unpleasant experience, but a more serious side effect of this ego death experience was that every time I took shrooms after this ego death, I fell back into a similar experience. I heared scary auditory hallucinations like the ones during my ego death and started to feel like I was being thrown around other dimensions by something. This would only happen when I was alone though. When tripping in the company of others I didn't experience it.
