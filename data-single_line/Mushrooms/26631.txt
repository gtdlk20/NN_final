Lets break for a minute.  First off, anyone who has ever had any previous legal complications, who is put in this situation is thinking in there mind, no matter who they are, OH FUCK! FUCK!  FUCK!  FUCK!  You begin to sweat bullets and turn into a pile on the floor that is otherwise known as a nervous wreck.  Im an extremely white person naturally, but my girlfriend later told me that I was literally paper white.  I turned pale.  Damn near translucent.  So, somehow my girlfriend is holding things together pretty well.  I dont think she knows what its like to be arrested and have your freedom taken away, etc And she just responds with a fairly mellow Okay, whatever.  While Im about to panic and jump out the nearest window and run away.
