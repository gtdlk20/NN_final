Anyway, I bought an eighth of shrooms from a co-worker of mine and decided to trip that night.  I learned later was that these were extremely powerful mushrooms; much more so than any I had previously experienced, but I ate the whole eighth anyway.  Ok, so I chopped up the eighth and ate it with some bread and jelly. As I sat alone in a friend's apartment, I noticed that some of the stucco on the walls was beginning to move and drip. This was the first indication that these were not normal shrooms. These open-eye visuals began only 30 minutes after ingestion, which I took note of but it didn't really bother me. Normally I don't see things till about ninety minutes in.
