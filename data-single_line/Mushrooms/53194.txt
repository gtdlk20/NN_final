Music was not very good during the trip, for I was feeling quite low. The Eastern meditative music which is almost excellent sounded actually very boring. My physical body was feeling very lethargic and somewhat shaky. I was dreaming of the next upcoming rave and how I could have spent this trip time more usefully dancing rather than suffering in this condition. Although the trip was not very successful, the happiness and mood changes it brought about as post-trip effects were highly rewarding.
