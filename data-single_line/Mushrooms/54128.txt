At the time of this experience I was at college studying art and through a series of synchronizations I began exploring shamanism. I listened to all the Terence Mckenna rap. Read M Eliade etc. Then decided I should experience the 'heroic dose' thing. It was mushroom season so I began hunting. To begin with I gained small amounts..about a mouthful. These resulted in lovely closed eye visuals...conscious serpent down one half of my body and wood texture down the other...at the time I was carving a certain type of wood. These were nice experience but I wanted it to be stronger...I just could not find enough mushrooms.
