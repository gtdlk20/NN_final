It was two hours after ingestion and I was beginning to feel sick. I was out of breath and thirsty but water couldn't help, it just made me nauseous. I saw 2 mountain bikers on a trail nearby, they couldn't see me but I decided I was too exposed. The last thing I wanted was being found by a human being in the state of confusion I was now in. So I moved the best I could in a bush near a pond and there I spent the worst 1 Â½ hour of my life.
