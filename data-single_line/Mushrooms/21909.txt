At about an hour after initial ingestion, I noticed a prominent intensification of colors, and slight movement, especially in the halo of warm gold surrounding the basking lamp over my large aquarium. I found this very beautiful, yet it was somehow difficult for me to wrap my mind around color in any form. This struck me as deeply amusing.
