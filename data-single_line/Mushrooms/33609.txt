I made a very random decision to do shrooms last night.  They had been sitting in my freezer waiting for a time when me and my friend could do them together.  Well this whole week I had been a little depressed and tangled in so many negative thoughts I felt I really needed something to help me break through it.  I had this urge all week and was trying to figure out what I could do, forgetting that I had the mushrooms in my freezer.  Then last night I really felt the urge to find something, I looked to see if I had any herbs that could serve my purpose but I didnÂ’t have any and remembered about the shrooms.  I decided to just go ahead and do them myself.
