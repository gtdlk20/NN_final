The next day was spent dwelling on the same things that i was while i was tripping. I simply couldnt accept the way i saw reality, as a totally meaningless game with no real reason to try to succeed because it doesnt mean anything anyway. I didnt know how to know that, and still play the game... As time has started to go on, ive begun to accept it and just realize that its possible to live like i have, and still know how much bs everything is. Sometimes i seem like i get very depressed, like this day, but the more ive learned about myself, the more i realize that i am always making myself depressed because i only focus on the negative aspects of my personality and dont accept anything positive as real..
