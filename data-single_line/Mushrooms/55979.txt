'I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be writing at the moment. Everything around me has been redefined. Every little challenge and problem is magnified into a full blown dilemma. We sit and overanalyze every decision, every idea, and every action. The lines between our world and the world around us are blurred. Lines which are so permanent in day to day life are broken down and become unclear. Lines which are so permanent in day to day life are broken down and become unclear. What is reality? Because what I am feeling right now is certainly real. But, I know tommorow is a different kind of real. I think I like that one too.'
