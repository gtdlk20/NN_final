We stupidly decided without any inhibition to walk deeper into the hospital complex, where we stumbled upon a massive structure.  The hospital was under complete construction and an extremely large part of it was just stories of buildings with no walls, just a freestanding structure about 5 stories high.  I remember at this point, that everything I was seeing around me was the first time Id ever seen it before.  I was just pushed through the womb of another dimension.  I  remember constantly gasping out of my mouth and saying ooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh in the most astonishment of what I was witnessing imaginable.  We decided to go deeper.  We hopped a security fence guarding the unfinished wing of the hospital and made our way up the stairs to the wide open air of the 5th floor overlooking the city with the wind hitting us.  I remember an overwhelming warmth and separation from reality.  We sang the song Ive got the whole world in my hands out loud together, bellowing it.  I remember shedding tears out of my eyes because the euphoria surrounding the event was too good for this earth, too good.
