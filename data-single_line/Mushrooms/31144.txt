T+3:30: At this point, my nausea returned in full force. For about one minute, I was in intense agony. I felt myself spiraling into a maelstrom of discomfort, panic, and coldness. No matter what I did to try and quell the feelings, they grew exponentially worse. I knew that I would have to vomit very soon, but I was not quite ready for the purge. I closed my eyes, and my visuals grew unfathomably more intense. Coupled with my current feelings, however, this made matters much worse. As if matters could grow worse, I perceived my entire body and existence shrinking. Although Ive never experienced a true ego death, I was certain that this was the path that would lead to that state. I couldnt handle that, and presently puked forcefully with my mouth closed. My friend pulled over the car, and I purged all over the side of the highway. The strain on my body and mind all but disappeared. Once I was finished vomiting, I sat back in the passenger side, and laughed mightily: I was feeling like a million bucks again. We took off, and my friends made a few snide comments. They certainly didnt affect me, as I had just evaded the worst trip I could imagine.
