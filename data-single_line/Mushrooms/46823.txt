James and I panicked and, as if by instinct, I began to build a sand barrier in front of the tent. The sand through my fingers felt like watery jello and the activity of piling and sculpting it became pleasurable and cathartic. I forgot about the 'danger' ahead of me and enjoyed myself. James and I chatted and laughed and had a great time of ourselves while building with the sand - it was like being kids at the beach again. Eventually we stopped building and I, feeling brave, decided to venture out closer to the tide. I let the light from the lighthouse illumiate my path, so my steps were very gradual, rhythmic. Suddenly I spotted something in the sand. I screamed.
