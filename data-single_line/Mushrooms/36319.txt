Then another friend came along, I told her my plight, and she bravely led me through the gate and past the 'guard' to the cool and shady other campground.  I came upon the circle of tents I knew to belong to the group I was seeking.  There was a tarp partly supported by a bamboo fence which created a sort of living-room area between the circle of tents. The man I had been looking for sat there on the ground talking to a friend.  When he saw me, he rose and we embraced.  We began talking about various things, and the topic turned to mushrooms, which, it turned out, we both possessed at the time.  We decided to take them together and proceeded to do so, munching them down wrapped in a slice of wheat bread.
