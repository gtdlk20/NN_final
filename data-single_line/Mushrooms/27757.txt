Beware: This takes a while to get there...One friday evening, I made plans with a friend to go to a Ben Harper concert.  We planned to smoke a great deal of herb, but were looking forward to the likely consumption of mushrooms as well.  As can so easily happen in the uncertain world of illegal chemicals, we were unable to obtain the fungus.  The concert was very fun, but overlaid with the feeling that we SHOULD have had shrooms there, to complement the expectatory rush that looking forward to hallucinogenic experience usually engenders.
