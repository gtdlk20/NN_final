As the effects slowly started to kick in for me, D expressed that he was not comfortable where we were.  He wanted to go back to the house.  I was happy so far by the stream, but he seemed strong in his desire to move, so I went along with him, let him lead the way and followed.  I mentioned to D that he had said a few times that he was especially afraid of encountering people while he was tripping, and I pointed out that we were more likely to be approached by someone if we were at the house.  He responded that we did not need to answer the door.  I asked if he would unplug the phone when we got there and he agreed.
