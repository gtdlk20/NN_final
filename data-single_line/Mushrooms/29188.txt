The experience was beautiful and melancholic at the same time, like hearing a hauntingly beautiful sonata and feeling it deep within me.  I took a breather and stepped outside the room for water and more familiar company.  I felt my eyes moist but not teary like as if I had been crying.  What a profound and very emotional state of mind.  I felt honoured and privileged to experience everything so far.
