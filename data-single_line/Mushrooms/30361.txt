It was getting hard to concentrate on the videos.  We started to watch some Durhamrockerz Youtube Poop (perfect for tripping for some reason) and I started to roll another blunt. I realized that I gave the lighter I borrowed earlier from his roommates back to them. They were kinda mad (I think?) about us not sharing shroom, so I didnt wanna go ask for a light. We decided to walk to the gas station. We were still coming up but the world around me was morphing and I couldnt stop laughing as we walked up the road. He started talking about some emotional things with me (I recently had a death in my life thats changed a lot of shit) and it kinda made me feel overwhelmed. I felt like Id lose my mind if I thought about the bad parts of life too hard. I started to stumble around a little bit but I didnt tell him about it so I could just make the feeling go away. I didnt want to feel too overwhelmed again. I dropped the weed on the grass and we decided wed go back for it on the way back from the gas station, so we didnt look like we dropped drugs on the ground and were looking for them. We made our descent down this grassy hill and onto the manmade cement weird structure that was the gas station, with all its buzzing. Oh lawd, here we go I said.
