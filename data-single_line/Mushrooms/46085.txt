It was New Years Eve, and I ended up having a house to myself for a few days because my family went away. I didn't really feel like having a party because I knew a lot of people would show up and I prefer having a smaller get together. Originally, me and two of my friends were going to trip, but then three more of our friends heard about it and wanted in, which was great news. I spent the day contacting my dealer to see if he would come through, since we needed 3/4oz (3.5g each). Around 6pm, everyone started to come in and we smoked some pot in my basement and played some video games as we were waiting for the dealer to stop by. Finally, at around 9:00pm, we hear a knock at the door, and it's him. He comes in with a handful of baggies with our mushrooms, and we pay him, he wishes us a good trip and heads out to get really fucking high. A few of my friends wanted to stop by a nearby party for the sake of showing up, and would return. During this time, I created the lemon-tek in individual cups for us. 3.5g ground in a coffee grinder, into a cup with some lemon juice, and the rest of the cup with orange juice. I've had experience with the lemon-tek before, and it provided me a mind blowing trip (and that was with 1.5  2.0g). I had all 6 cups ready sitting on my counter, and when everyone was back we immediately had a toast and drank the concoction we called swamp water. It actually didn't taste too bad, just like regular orange juice, but the smell was a bit discomforting.
