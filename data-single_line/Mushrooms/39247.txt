The duck then proceeded to swim over to us...about 3 feet from where I was sitting and clean himself and fed. He showed no fear of us and stayed there for about a half an hour taking care of his own business while we talked. He almost seemed like he was listening and being a part of our conversations. Then all of a sudden he let out a loud quack, turned slowly around and flew away. It was as if he was politely saying goodbye to us. Everyone in the group shared this idea. It was one of the most amazing things I had ever seen. After this we made our way back to camp and spent the rest of the time coming down eating and talking and laughing. Luckily everyone who was sick had felt better and enjoyed the second half of their trip.
