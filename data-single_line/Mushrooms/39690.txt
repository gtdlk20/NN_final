We had spent the evening on various different strains of mushrooms, powdered and mixed into honey.  The 4 of us were feeling wonderful and close hugging each other and feeling like family.  We went into B's bedroom to hang out for a bit when B brought up something I had found myself dreaming about for almost a year since I heard a poem about it at burning man last year.  At that time I didn't really know the difference between 5-MeO-DMT and DMT but it didn't really matter.  I was SCARED!  My heart was pounding and it was only made worse to see how rather than being weighed out the powder was being 'eyed' out (I realize how dangerous it is to 'eye' out any dosage and I don't advise this method to anyone!! )  I thought I was going to have a heart attack just watching the others take their 7 minutes of other worldliness.. but.. I wanted it so badly.  I needed to know.  And then reality unraveled and existence rewound and ... and I inhaled that harsh chemically tasting, heart pounding inhalation.  B was holding my hand and took the pipe. ..the vibration..
