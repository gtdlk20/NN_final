I had the great idea of chopping them finely and drinking them in orange juice. OJ sucks coming back up! It was way harder than just chewing them up as I did last week. I must say that the dose was about half the last. Last Thursday I ate three caps and four stems. It was an incredible experience; almost too intense. We cut the dose in half this time. T and C ate even less.
