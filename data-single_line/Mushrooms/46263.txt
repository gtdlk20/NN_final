As we were coming up we started looking at the creatures inside the smaller display tanks. The first thing which creeped us out was in the Swan River tank. It was full of various fish but the one thing that stood out was this one completely evil eel. At least 2/3s of its body was buried in the sand. The remaining 1/3 was stuck completely vertical up in the water. The snout was pointed with 2 beady eyes and a mouthful of tiny needle like teeth. Esther, Dylan and I began a conversation about the utter evilness of this particular eel. The ideas ranged from the eel darting up to eat the other fish, to it crawling through the air vents in order to steal babies and finally that the eel was in fact the creator of the Nazi party. Naturally our imaginations went a little wild about the lifestyle of this eel.
