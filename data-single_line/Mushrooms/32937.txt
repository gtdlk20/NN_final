I have begun to call this last shroom trip, The Trip. Being the fifth time Ive ever tripped, over the course of 6 months, it was as if I was doing the drug for the first time. It was like a different drug, as if all the other trips didnt count. This was definitely due to all of three major factors: The extreme potency of this particular batch of mushrooms (I am in the belief they are from a strain aficionados call Reality Benders), the fact that the trips setting, the campus of Florida Gulf Coast University on an empty Friday, was so unfamiliar to me, and the fact that this was the first time I tripped without a sitter, and with only one person, my beloved girlfriend, Camille.
