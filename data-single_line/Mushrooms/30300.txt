10:20  I make it to the house and remember that I have more shrooms and I joint that is a foot and a half long that I rolled before the trip. Life is good, Im forgetting the negative vibes. I sit to smoke the joint with my friend, whose face is blinking in every color imaginable. In the yard behind the back porch, the plants have turned into chainsaws that are bright green with intensely red blades, and are whipping back and forth. Runic symbols in what I took to be a language humans arent meant to understand sprout from everything, rends in the fabric of life itself appear and sprout kaleidoscopic patterns of stunning intricacy. Holy shit, these are good shrooms. I am having the deepest conversation I have ever had with a person Ive never met. I eat the rest of the shrooms.
