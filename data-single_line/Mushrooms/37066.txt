I started getting a bit anxious because of my previous hard times on acid, and my legs were beginning to jellify. 2 minutes later we were walking to the park, and I stopped to vomit. This made my friends laugh so much that it forced the experience to break through simultaneously, even for poor me! I felt immediately, and this was wierd, that I was vomiting all the fear and doubt out of my body - this shocked me so early in the trip, and I felt bulletproof after it. Once in the park, we naturally went out on our own, and something amazing happened.
