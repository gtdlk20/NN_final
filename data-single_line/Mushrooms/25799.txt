My McKenna 'archetype' consistently revealed itself throughout the trip, as it always has since reading Food of the Gods.  So many parallels to his ideas manifest in my mind throughout the trip, particularly relating to language.  I recalled him somewhere talking about how he, after having regularly ingested mushrooms for decades, became a spokesman for the Logos and how he could mesmerize small groups of people through his speech for up to twenty hours at a time.  The Mushroom truly plays some important role in the human psycho-spiritual relation to the cosmos.  It activates the more dynamic powers of the human that would otherwise require years of time-consuming meditation.
