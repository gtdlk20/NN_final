Suddenly I saw a glove appear at the base of the log.  This immediately compelled me to take off the bandages of my injured arm, which suddenly started hurting intensely.  I saw the scab underneath, and my hand turned pale white until I could see the threadlike arteries and bigger veins underneath.  My entire hand then, within a couple seconds, decayed completely; it looked like I was watching a movie because the blood and gore was so realistic.
