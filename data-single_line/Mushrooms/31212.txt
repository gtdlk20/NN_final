Stage 5. So anyways, Cody went to bed, and Jess and I began to walk to my house which was only 6 blocks away. I was completely over the whole power trip and the raging wars against mother nature, haha. We concluded that that night was an AMAZING night. Everything turned out perfectly. The weather was amazing, the sky was astonishing, and the trip was an adventure. We had arrived at my house and fixed up some snacks, and I felt so good to be alive. I was so appreciative of everything. I felt proud that I was popular and spoiled, and for once in my life, I told myself that I  really am amazing, and that's why so many people like me, and that I'm not a piece of crap. I told myself that I  really am amazing, and that's why so many people like me, and that I'm not a piece of crap. But depression made me think that for the longest time. And I have to admit, even 3 weeks after that night, I still feel amazing. I had a psychedelic revolution, and it was amazing.
