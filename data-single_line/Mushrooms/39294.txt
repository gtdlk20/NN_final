Still not feeling anything, I decided to lie down and turn the lights off.  The first thing I noticed was that my night vision was amazingly clear (dilated pupils). I was standing near the light switch when I became slightly dizzy (much like the head rush of a shot of liquor) and decided to lie down.  Within two minutes of lying down, I realized that the shrooms were taking effect and I felt like a force I have never felt before would soon overwhelm me.  I was getting head rush after head rush (like I was about to pass out) as I tried to stay focused on the glow-in-the-dark stars stuck to the ceiling of my room.
