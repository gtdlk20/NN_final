We have been discussing this camping trip for a few months now, and have been working on getting clearance from our wives to do it (we both also have toddlers).  My friend cultivated the mushrooms from spores, and the ground them up and put them into capsules.  Each capsule was a little over .6 grams(?) each, and we had 10 capsules for a total of about 3 grams per person.
