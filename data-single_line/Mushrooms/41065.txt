I am all that was before me. I am at the edge of time. I am at the edge of infinitude. I am blue-green algae in the infinite lake of knowingness. I am the fascination of lipstick and the fonthead of creation. I am the whiteness of GodÂ’s beard in the sky. In the darklight of the day/night sky. All is one in the waves of light.
