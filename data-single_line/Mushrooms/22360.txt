I continue to meditate on a regular basis and I experience revelations or moments of peace and interconnectedness in everyday life albeit not as intensely. Occasionally I experience them during meditation, but more often these explicit revelations are triggered by extremely small things. Sometimes it is a particularly puffy cloud on a sunny day or the sight of a vine climbing its way up a treeÂ’s trunk. Other times it is when a smile is met by a stranger with a recognition and acknowledgment that is normally absent in our routine interactions. I understand that I have the ability to control my reality by being choosy about what I choose to take in and what attitude I choose to take concerning every day events. I can pay attention to what is beautiful, what is painful, and what task is at hand. When I find myself lost in a critical anxious loop in which I am making no progress, I consciously bring myself back to the present and practice being mindful of breath and thought. I have much greater control over my emotionality and experience in the world. I feel more guided and more purposeful. I must admit that the feelings of being a piece of the cosmic consciousness, being one with the universe, feeling grounded, and having the ability to draw strength from positive communities has not left me and allow me to live my life in a deeper way.
