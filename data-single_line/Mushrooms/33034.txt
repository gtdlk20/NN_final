I was curious if I could ever come out of this train of thoughts, that I wasn't lost in my mind but just not understanding. And at that moment. The moment I realized that I don't understand is the moment I stopped caring. I didn't care anymore to understand anything. I didn't understand because I didn't know what was real anymore and what was false. Images created through my thoughts I call it. so I went to my room, where I felt safe. Where I lived for over 15 years of my life. And in that room I started feeling like laying down, I felt like I was dreaming in real life, but I decided maybe I should try and dream for real until the trip was over.
