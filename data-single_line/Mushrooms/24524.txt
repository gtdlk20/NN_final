A thought that was passing by me, and that stuck with me for a moment, I felt as if I was a ball of energy, as well as all my friends. I felt this so strongly it felt like it was real, like we went this whole lifetime as nothing but balls of energy and colors. I can't exactly explain what I seen, but it was like each ball of energy that was my friend, had their face on it, and that ball of energy was destroyed each and everytime they blinked. I felt life was going quick. Everytime I open my eyes I was reborn to a new source of energy, just rolling through this whole feild of energy. and I blink, and it felt as if it was over.
