It was New Years Eve, and I had no plans or preparation for the night. I went over to my friend's house and he mentioned that he had a baggie of shrooms. It wasn't a fair trade, but since I had never taken mushrooms before he agreed to exchange my bag of weed with his 3.5 grams. I ate it with peanut butter and it was dry and crunchy. Within minutes I felt so nauseous I tried to induce vomit in the bathroom. I couldn't do it so I gave up and went for a car ride with my friend. 45 minutes had passed as we began down the road, my tripping really started. The tree's were coming at me so fast, I felt compelled to greet every one of them. He put on loud gabber music and I danced and saw closed eye visuals of patterns and dragons.
