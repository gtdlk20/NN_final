Without realizing it for a moment, my body began to sit up and move to the corner of the bathroom.  Uncontrolled by me, my legs were brought up to my chest and my arms wrapped around them.  I felt like a 4-year-old.  A 4 year old who is lost in some unknown place and just sits tight till someone finds them.  I was able to tell that my mind was lost somewhere outside my conscious, outside my normal reality, and it was trying to make sense of what was going on.  I pictured my parents, trying to ground myself in that: perhaps to find the path back out of this dark forest and back into my mind.  The more I thought of them, however, the more they slipped out of my grasp.  I could picture their faces, but the essence of who they were made no sense to me: I couldn't envision how they could be my parents, or how I could even have parents, or for that matter have anyone or anything in my life. I was truly alone.  It was just me in my world, no one else existed, except, perhaps, on a 'cartoon' or 'painting' level: simply not real, but mere abstracts of some sort of outside reality; the first time I had ever felt truly solipsistic.  That 4-year-old self, plus my actual self, were all I could feel.  I pictured myself as Gollum from Lord of the Rings: the two personalities in one body, and as I felt that analogy take affect I wondered if I would ever become one person again.
