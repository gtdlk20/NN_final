One typical day, I was at a friends room, just smoking pot and relaxing with a few of my friends. Another friend came in and said he had shrooms, I imediately knew I was going to try it once and for all. I consumed maybe 1/16th of an ounce, and just sat there talking and waiting for the fungus to take effect. I didn't really feel it for like a half hour, but then it hit me. It went suddenly from relaxing to very intense in the room.
