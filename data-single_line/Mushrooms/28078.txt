Im drinking tea and listening to music on my bed watching some closed eye visuals I decide to go back out into the living room to just get a change of scenery. I was out during the day beforehand and I drove my boyfriend's car to get some tires and stuff installed for him, and it was in a parking lot across the street so I peeked out the window to check on it and this lady was standing right next to it, for like no reason at all. Empty parking lot and this lady is just standing by my boyfriend's car. It kinda concerned me, I also took note of my TERRIBLE parking job hahaha ! Jesus Christ! lol So that kinda sketched me out I closed the blinds and reminded myself I was just tripping out and I was reading into it too much. Which I was. I had some ridiculous thoughts pop up for the next little while of what if my boyfriend's car got stolen when I'm supposed to take care of it? How the hell would I call the police high on mushrooms? What would I actually do about it? LOL NOT ALOT maybe have a panic attack?!! I went back to bed and listened to some music. I kept on having thoughts pop in about my boyfriend's car which was lame but I just sort of meditated and focused on my breathing and the music I was listening to. Lots of dripping colourful patterns, fractals and designs happening behind my eyes. I wish I could take a real mental picture of how beautiful it was. So much colour, depth and movement, absolutely life changing gorgeous I cant believe our brains reactions to mushrooms or acid (psychedelics in general) can create such an effect. I felt like I became a part of what I was listening to like I was moving through a story in my mind and I could feel everything about it.
