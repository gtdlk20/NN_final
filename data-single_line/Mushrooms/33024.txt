Where I first started noticing differences was when I went to the bathroom, I felt like my eyes were moving closer together, it was weird, I had never had that happen before.. and I was afraid that my eyes were about to pop out of my head or something. It was the first step in a bad direction and started trying very heard to steer clear of that negative pathway. After I used the restroom, I started washing my hands and looked into the mirror.. as I glanced at myself, I felt like my mind was staying in me but was shooting through the reflection and giving me thoughts through my other self, this self being me, only in the mirror. I saw myself moving but I did not feel like I was moving. My face morphed into quite interesting objects which stood out, something like a jigsaw puzzle only not actual shapes but different peices of my unconcious spread out into different areas of my face. Every time I touched my face it seemed that the cracks in this 'puzzle' gave a different sensation, some good, some bad. I realized that the only true peice I could trust was my mouth.. it made me feel.. like I was a deity on a far off planet, here to spectate what we feel as humans only advanced in sense of time, space, energy, feeling, taste, and sight.
