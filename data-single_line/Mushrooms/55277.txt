I think that after taking shrooms I can see the world in another perspective I think that after taking shrooms I can see the world in another perspective than what I always had, I can now see alot more clearly through things and especially through people, yet I sometimes get mild flashbacks, especially when I'm talking to people, I can see their faces make some strange expressions. Now I look at life in a more detailed way, is that a good thing or not? I always used to go with the flow with things and took life in a really lazy manner, now I feel that I have to be serious with things. Could that be a response from experiencing death (according to my first time, when I got into the bad trip I thought I could almost jump out of the window in order to stop the pain I was going through and just kill myself instead, I felt I was physically being tortured with my second time)?
