Everything I just said was a realization, half of it through introspection, and the other half through infinite conversations I had with every object I encountered on my journey back to my dorm.  I felt, I knew, that it was all true, and that there was a continuous train of thought that linked all of these ideas together in a convincing religion of sorts, but now I cannot remember the true scope of the vision I was given at the time.  I also could not figure out if this truth made me happy or sad. If this is  the truth of our existence then I will never exist again after I die. Instead, a rock will exist because of me; water will exist because of me, fruit will exist, and then when some guy eats the fruit, a human being will exist because of part of me.
